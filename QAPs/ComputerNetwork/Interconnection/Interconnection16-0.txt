★How are the fields of physics interconnected?Is there a chart or diagram that depicts how the fields of physics are related, from the standpoint of "What specific areas of physics research could I potentially be involved with given my choice to pursue a Ph.D in X physics?"
I'm currently working through my PhD in Physics - so I don't have the significant experience that others might have, but here's my 2 cents: Statistical Mechanics links with Thermodynamics (trivially) and with applications in Quantum Mechanics / Particle Physics (Bose Statistics, Fermi Statistics) Quantum Field Theory is very generalized but experimental results are amazing and staggeringly accurate to high degrees - in Quantum Theory of Gravity, Beta Decay, LHC experiments, Ultracold atoms (particularly with BEC), along with QED, QCD, and so on This is from a more theoretical standpoint (book-learning). From the kind of research I'm starting in (Solid State, Condensed Matter, Ultracold Atoms, Quantum Computation/Quantum Information and Processors) are all somewhat linked and overlap.    Embed Quote
