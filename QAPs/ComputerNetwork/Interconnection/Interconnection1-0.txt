★Are SHERLOCK_BBC_tv series interconnected?
They are 'interconnected' in the same way as movies and their sequels are. The main protagonists remain the same with different stories in each episode. Means if you want to watch one of the episodes without watching the previous ones, you won't miss much and will be able to understand the episode's ongoing story comfortably.    Embed Quote
