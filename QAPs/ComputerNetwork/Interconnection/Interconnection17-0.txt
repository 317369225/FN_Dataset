★Are the names "West Indies" and "India" interconnected?
West Indies is common term used to refer to the Caribbean islands.  'Indies' in the name West Indies indeed come from India. Christopher Columbus set out to find a faster sea route for India in late 15th century. He sailed in west direction hoping that he would reach India without going round the cape of good hope. He though landed in Caribbeans instead of his destination in Asia, but he thought that he had reached India and therefore called the place 'Indies', a term which was used to refer to the south and south-east Asia at that time. Later on when they realized that the place they had landed was not India, the started referring it as 'West Indies' (Indies to the west of Europe) to differentiate it from the the east Indies (Indies that lay to the east of Europe/actual Indies).    Embed Quote
