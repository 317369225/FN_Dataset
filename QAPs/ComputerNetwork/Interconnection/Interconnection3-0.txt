★Is Politics and Life interconnected?
Both are the two face of the same coin, you cannot separate or disintegrate them. Growing human population gave birth to politics. It is the same structure found in our joint family organization, it is now turning in different direction being more biased to some, however. Your each and every move is controlled by your politician. You, born in a hospital, start school, doing job in a company or self-employed, get married, managing family, get old-age pension and many more are governed by political system. Just try to experience it in your daily life. Sometime it happens unknowingly to us. In short, you can stop breathing but not politics in your life.    Embed Quote
