★What is the best way to present interconnected data consisting of people, companies and relationships?
If you're asking how to present interconnected data in general terms, then there is software out there that is dedicated to network charts, such as i2, which is used by many British police forces to understand criminal networks. In terms of making things cleaner, many data viz experts use Adobe Illustrator (David McCandless certainly does), and so you can present it exactly how you like. David himself sketches things out on paper first before going to the computer. To make network charts easier to read, it pays to use coloured lines to distinguish between different types of things, so the lines in your chart could be coloured in this way, e.g. one colour for director, one for board member etc. The other thing is to think about why you are presenting your data in this way. Do readers need to know WHO these people are in terms of the names, or just what their connections are? If its the latter, consider stripping out names and just using logos (as you have done) to denote the nodes. If you do need to keep personal identity, consider using photographs instead of the head silhouettes that you currently have. This does rely though on the user recognising their images. Otherwise, I actually think it looks pretty good!    Embed Quote
