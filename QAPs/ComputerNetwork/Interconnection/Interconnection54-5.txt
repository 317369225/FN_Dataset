★How is a person's desire to be wholly good and wholly devoid of bad/evil to be reconciled with the universal law of yin yang, which says that the universe is a constant harmonious interaction of the two opposing forces (i.e. positive/negative, good/bad), which are interconnected and interdependent?
The more one is concerned with being wholly good, the more one will focus on evil. It's inevitable. It can become a very tiring act of judgement, and it will never be achieved. Be content with being, following your heart, and willing into existence that which raises up the world around you. When faced with evil, borne of self or borne of others, regard it with passing equanimity. Stand by your conscience, yet give evil nothing to resist. When faced with good, borne of self or of others, regard it with passing equanimity. Stand by your consciousness, yet give good nothing to resist. Be unattached wither way, focus on raising up the world around you.    Embed Quote
