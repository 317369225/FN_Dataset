★Why is it so hard to fathom that we are interconnected?
Def. agreeing with what Nan said. But me being me, I have a rather selfish need to ponder such interesting questions ;) Like Nan said, we are separated by our pain, because we feel it individually. We are, at the basic level, driven by physical needs- and these needs, unlike emotional ones, can be felt only on an individual level. I can only feel my own hunger, the pain of stubbing my own toe, etc. not you. These series of experiences that we feel solely on our own may make us feel on our own. We can empathize with one another, but I cannot experience your stubbing your toe the way you did. This can make it very easy for us to see ourselves as separate from one another. Emotional experiences are the same- I can never feel exactly the way you did regardless of my sense of empathy. I feel separate from you, in that sense. It is difficult when we focus on individual experiences to see an interconnection between one another. I would also like to address your own insightful comment on your question that this is being asked from an American's perspective - this is very important when we think about our views on interconnectedness. Americans are, in my opinion, very focused on the individual and therefore have a more difficult time seeing the wide ripples, so to speak, that we each make without even realizing it. Certain religions, cultures are more focused on humanity as being one interconnected being, one organism that works in unison, and less focused on individual experience. I would like to see more answers to this question discussing views on interconnectedness from the point of view of people from other cultures and religions- Hint Hint!!!    Embed Quote
