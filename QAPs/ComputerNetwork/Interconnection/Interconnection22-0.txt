★What interconnection network topologies are used currently?I think most of clusters use fat tree. Is there any cluster or HPC use super cube or other topology?
This answer is not going to date very well, 'currently' makes it tricky. At least per the June2012 top500 list, Pleiades is the highest ranking (enhanced) hypercube, at #11. A quick look around the top 10 divides it into 6 mesh/torus topologies (Sequoia, K Computer, Mira, Jaguar, Fermi and Nebulae), and 4 fat trees (SuperMUC, Tianhe 1A, JuQueen and Curie), with the present top 3 all being mesh/torus variants. My superficial research method here (highly advanced web browsing :) ) ensures that this coarse division mis-represents at least one million fascinating details about each design, but in the name of brief answers, I'm going to stop at saying "in addition to fat tree, mesh and hypercube derivatives are also in use currently". That may just be general enough to remain true come November.    Embed Quote
