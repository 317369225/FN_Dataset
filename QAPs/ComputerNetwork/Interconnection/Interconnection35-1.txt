★Do all the characters in a book have to be interconnected?
It's unusual to have a book with two or more separate groups of characters who have hardly any contact, but it has been done. Greg Bear's Queen of Angels has four plotlines, three of which are loosely linked through their relationship to one character; the fourth is a completely separate story about an AI in space. But if I were you, I'd have at least some way the groups of characters influence each other even if they never meet up in person; otherwise, why would they be in the same book?    Embed Quote
