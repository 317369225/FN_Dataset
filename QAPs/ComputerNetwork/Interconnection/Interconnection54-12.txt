★How is a person's desire to be wholly good and wholly devoid of bad/evil to be reconciled with the universal law of yin yang, which says that the universe is a constant harmonious interaction of the two opposing forces (i.e. positive/negative, good/bad), which are interconnected and interdependent?
By recognizing that yin-yang are natural laws of the universe, and by recognizing that one has to align themselves with the natural laws of the universe so as to find both balance in their own lives through the words, actions and thoughts that is directed towards maintaining harmony in the world. As they begin to find personal harmony within, by coming to a point of balance, by recognizing the yin and yang aspects of life within, and expressing that purely without, the interconnectedness and interdependency is purely understood and experienced by that person.    Embed Quote
