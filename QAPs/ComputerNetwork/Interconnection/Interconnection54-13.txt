★How is a person's desire to be wholly good and wholly devoid of bad/evil to be reconciled with the universal law of yin yang, which says that the universe is a constant harmonious interaction of the two opposing forces (i.e. positive/negative, good/bad), which are interconnected and interdependent?
What you call the "universal law of yin yang" is not a law but rather a description of how some people think things ought to be. Thus, there is nothing that forces good and evil to be "interconnected and interdependent" and therefore nothing that needs to be reconciled.    Embed Quote
