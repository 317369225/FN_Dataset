★Do conspiracy theorists actually fill rooms with interconnected webs of string?Also, when did this first start to appear in movies?
I don't.  I mitigate my paranoia with a policy of applying effort only to things likely to produce results with little fallout.  If I did that, it would take a lot of effort and it would intimidate anyone who saw my apartment.  Instead, I might eavesdrop on nearby people trying to gossip about me in a way that might evidence someone has given them false information about me.    Embed Quote
