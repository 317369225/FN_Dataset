★How is a person's desire to be wholly good and wholly devoid of bad/evil to be reconciled with the universal law of yin yang, which says that the universe is a constant harmonious interaction of the two opposing forces (i.e. positive/negative, good/bad), which are interconnected and interdependent?
The desire to be wholly good or devoid of bad/evil cannot exist without a believe in a perception in which one is not, but supposed to be (wholy good or devoid of bad/evil). So in a way, the desire itself is part of constant harmonious interaction of the two opposing forces. No thing to reconcile. :)    Embed Quote
