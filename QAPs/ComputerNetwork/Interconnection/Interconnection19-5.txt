★What are the supposed advantages of Toslink vs. copper for audio interconnects?
Toslink is much less susceptible to EMI, RFI, and other sources of noise. However, my rule is to reduce conversions as much as possible: Toslink requires that the audio signal be converted from optical (cd read), to electrical (within the cd player), to optical (for toslink), to electrical (at the D/A), staying electrical for the rest of the season By contrast, SPDIF is optical to electrical, staying electrical. Digital vs analog  is similar. If the source is digital, then (generally) it's better to keep the signal digital for as long as possible to minimize analog signal degradation.    Embed Quote
