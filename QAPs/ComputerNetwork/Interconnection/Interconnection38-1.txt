★What's the interconnection between Java Servlets, Java Server Pages(JSP),  and Java Server Faces(JSF)?
Servlets are the foundation of virtually every Java web framework whether part of the Java EE spec (JSP, JSF) or third party. JSPs are converted to servlets and therefore require a JDK (not just a JRE) at runtime. JSF 2.0 when used with Facelets (recommended) is implemented as a servlet called FacesServlet. Unlike JSP, it doesn't convert anything to servlets and therefore can run with just a JRE. Having said that, it should be noted that JSF 1.x versions predate facelets and were built upon JSP. Although you can develop JSF 2.0 pages in this manner, it is certainly not recommended. Another key difference between JSP and JSF 2 is that JSP is template based whereas JSF 2 is component based. In JSF 2 you simply add components to a page, although you can also mix them with html. JSF 2 comes with a basic set of components and you can easily add third-party components such as those found in PrimeFaces. Facelets provides templating capability to JSF 2.    Embed Quote
