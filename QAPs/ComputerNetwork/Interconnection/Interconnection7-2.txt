★Is there any evidence of interconnected evolution?Is it possible that cows evolved to their present form so they can be eaten by humans? In some species anti-predatory traits have been favored by evolution, so why some species haven't evolved so, for example, their meat is poisonous to predators?
For hundreds of years humans have selectively bred cattle for maximum meat quality and maximum quantity of milk. Now the human race is evolving to be able to digest milk beyond babyhood.    Embed Quote
