★Is Thunderbolt (light peak) a suitable cluster computing interconnect?How does it compare to Myrinet, Infiniband, etc.?
Light peak is a peripheral device connectivity bus. Generally such technologies have limitations in the physical distance. At a high level, its like USB or PCI. Other aspects to consider are the ability to do switching, routing, ability to address / identify, latency, bandwidth and scalability. Like USB or PCI cannot replace Ethernet, light peak cannot replace cluster interconnects. The two technologies are fundamentally different in their purposes.    Embed Quote
