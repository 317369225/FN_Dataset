★What would have been the disadvantages and the costs of a world network based on ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) technology instead of the IP interconnection?I have in mind to create a scenario in which there are only ATM networks, so I would find some percentual of the more costs compared to IP.
Can you explain me the 10% of more costs? Is it related to the 5byte of overhead on a only 48 byte packet? For a comparison with IP have I compare this overhead to the ethernet overhead so level2 or I have to consider also the level 3 IP? Do you thing that the costs of the ATM equipment are bigger for the reason that they also have to manage the qos and other complex service of the atm protocol? And also the design focused on the fiber use is a reason for the low diffusion? Last thing, do you know where to find a 10 or more years ago list with the price of ATM equipment and IP equipment?    Embed Quote
