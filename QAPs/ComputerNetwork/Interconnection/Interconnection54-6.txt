★How is a person's desire to be wholly good and wholly devoid of bad/evil to be reconciled with the universal law of yin yang, which says that the universe is a constant harmonious interaction of the two opposing forces (i.e. positive/negative, good/bad), which are interconnected and interdependent?
The fact that Western philosophy arranges concepts into polar pairs does not imply they are theorized by Taoist ideas of Yin and Yang.  Western thinking tends to seek simple invariant laws that can label things in a permanent way.  Compared to that, Taoist thinking involves fluid conditions and contingencies.  The same thing might be "good" relative to one situation but "evil" relative to another, or something in-between, or a combination.  Yin and Yang are not a binary (either / or) pair, but the extremes of a continually and smoothly changing process.  I think it would be characteristic of Lao Tzu's thinking that the desire to be "good" can lead to ill events, that could be called "evil", but would really just be a state of disharmony with conditions.  These labels are evidence of human preferences and fixations, not a kind of universal law.  The reason is that things are not themselves good and evil, but only relative to ever-changing circumstances. The Tao Te Ching is full of examples where the intention to be "good" creates unintended consequences.  The ambition (to be good, or powerful, or whatever) is critiqued in Chapter 29 with words like the following (there are many translations): Those who wish to change the world According with their desire Cannot succeed. The world is shaped by the Way; It cannot be shaped by the self. Trying to change it, you damage it; Trying to possess it, you lose it.This theme is echoed in the Christian Bible in the book Ecclesiastes 3 There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens    Embed Quote
