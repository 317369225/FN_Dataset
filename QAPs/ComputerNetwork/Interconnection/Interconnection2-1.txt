★Are evolution and an increase in intelligence interconnected?I mean, is it necessary that human-like species (who are intelligent) will always eventually evolve from the most basic living forms? If not then why are we searching for extraterrestrial intelligence?
There are no rules of evolution, there is nothing that says that intelligent life must evolve. The only thing you can say is that life will probably get more and more complicated as time goes on but that complication does not have to include intelligence. Fortunately in our case it did.    Embed Quote
