★Are evolution and an increase in intelligence interconnected?I mean, is it necessary that human-like species (who are intelligent) will always eventually evolve from the most basic living forms? If not then why are we searching for extraterrestrial intelligence?
Due to evolutionary changes being generated in a random way, it is very difficult to make specific predictions about that will or won't come to be. However, remember that things that evolve are restrained by their environment. They are also in competition with each other, so one might expect certain parameters of competition to become important. For instance, the surface of the earth is irradiated by the sun during the day, and by the moon at night. The radiation has certain frequencies that are useful for resolving images of the environment. If you look at nature, you find that this fact has been "used" several times by various lineages. Insects have eyes, people have eyes, certain unicellular organisms have light-sensitive patches. It's simply a quality of evolution that it sometimes ends up using the same environmental facts in more than one way. Regarding the question of intelligence, it's not that far out to think that "information processing" is a parameter of competition, which some lineages will by chance invest in and develop. Humans have taken it to a high level, but many other creatures do it too.    Embed Quote
