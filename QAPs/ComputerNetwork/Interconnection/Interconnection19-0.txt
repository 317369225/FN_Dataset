★What are the supposed advantages of Toslink vs. copper for audio interconnects?
Jack Dahlgren is right on - only your ears can tell you if it "matters". As to advantages, TOSlink cable is very thin, very flexible and pretty cheap. Since it's all digital, and fiber, it's highly reliable. The issue is the AD/DA conversion, how well and how often it's done. If you're peeling digital audio off digital media and sending it digital to an audio device that's converting to analog and pumping it through speakers, there's less opportunity for distortion than if you're taking an analog source, digitizing it, shooting it over TOSlink, etc. But in the main, you probably won't hear the difference. And you don't need a ton of bandwidth - "CD grade audio" is 1.4Mbps (two channels  × 44,100 samples per second per channel × 16 bits per sample) Take that up to 5.1, even 7.1, you're still in the sweet spot for TOSlink.    Embed Quote
