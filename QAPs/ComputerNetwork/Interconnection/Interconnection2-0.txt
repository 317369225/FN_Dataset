★Are evolution and an increase in intelligence interconnected?I mean, is it necessary that human-like species (who are intelligent) will always eventually evolve from the most basic living forms? If not then why are we searching for extraterrestrial intelligence?
Wow - this is a good question. It's possible that unstable climate is a prerequisite for intelligent life. The earth is unusual in that it got hit by something enormous early in its life, knocking its axis off-center and causing that axis to slowly wobble.    This has created periodic ice ages. Intelligent life has a special advantage during periods of climate change.   Rather than doing what it's always done, it can figure out new ways to live : Wrapping itself in furs of other creatures, discovering fire, inventing hunting weapons, etc. It's survival of the smartest when the glaciers come.    Embed Quote
