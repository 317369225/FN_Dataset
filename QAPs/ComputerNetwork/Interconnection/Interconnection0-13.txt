★What are some books with interconnected short stories?Something along the same lines as Cloud Atlas. It could be any genre. The connection between the stories should be fascinating.
'The Tesseract' by Alex Garland. Several parallel stories which all eventually collide. Good book, although not as good as 'The Beach'.    Embed Quote
