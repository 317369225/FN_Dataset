â˜…Is there any evidence of interconnected evolution?Is it possible that cows evolved to their present form so they can be eaten by humans? In some species anti-predatory traits have been favored by evolution, so why some species haven't evolved so, for example, their meat is poisonous to predators?
Yes, there are many such examples. One of the better-known ones is the co-evolution of garter snakes and poisonous newts. In regions where the snakes prey on the newts, the snakes are more resistant to the toxin, and the newts are more poisonous. These traits can be tracked and shown to be new adaptations, the product of ongoing arms races between predator and prey. There are lots of other examples.
