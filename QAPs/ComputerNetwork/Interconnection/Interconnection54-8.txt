★How is a person's desire to be wholly good and wholly devoid of bad/evil to be reconciled with the universal law of yin yang, which says that the universe is a constant harmonious interaction of the two opposing forces (i.e. positive/negative, good/bad), which are interconnected and interdependent?
I've wondered about this too. My take is that yin-yang/duality applies to physical properties, like hot-cold and light-dark. With these each half of the pair is defined by its opposite and cannot exist without it. This duality extends to our subjective experience of them as good or bad in the sense of physically pleasant or unpleasant. You can't appreciate a full belly unless you've been hungry. By constrast, I think the essence of consciousness and its manifestations as love/compassion etc is non-dual - it exists independently of its opposites such as anger, fear etc (which could be thought of as the lack of, rather than opposite of love). I think it comes down to two different systems - physical reality (and our experience of it), which is dual in nature, and non-physical reality ie awareness, which is non-dual. I think the problem stems from the different meanings of good and bad. Goodness in the sense of what is moral can be objectively defined and isn't just relative to what's better or worse.    Embed Quote
