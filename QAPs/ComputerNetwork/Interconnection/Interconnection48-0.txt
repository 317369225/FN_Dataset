★Why can't the US implement an interconnected river system?It's a huge undertaking but it might solve the problem of droughts in one region and floods in the other. Thoughts?
There are 250,000 rivers and streams in the U.S., which collectively cross 3.5 million miles. Connecting them in such a way that their water supply can be efficiently redirected during a crisis without also damaging the areas which depend on them under normal conditions would be one of the greatest feats of engineering in human history. You're right that it's probably not impossible, but the cost and time to complete the project would vastly outweigh the benefits and dwarf the current costs of drought mitigation.    Embed Quote
