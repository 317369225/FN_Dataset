★What are some books with interconnected short stories?Something along the same lines as Cloud Atlas. It could be any genre. The connection between the stories should be fascinating.
More Pricks Than Kicks by Sameul Beckett all follow the inimitable character Belacqua Shuah. This collection is absolutely hilarious and far more accessible than some of Beckett's longer works. Anything J.D. Salinger ever published other than Catcher in the Rye. Follow around the Glass family, build an understanding of them based on the windows the stories give into their world, love them dearly and deeply. Sherlock Holmes! Who doesn't love to read a good Sherlock story? Barnes and Noble has a 'Complete Sherlock Holmes' for fairly cheap I believe. It will keep you occupied for awhilel. This Way For the Gas, Ladies and Gentleman by Tadeusz Borowski. These are not necessarily 'interconnected' in the sense that they follow around one set 'group' of characters, however they are all written from the perspective of a person in a Concentration Camp. They give a very honest and extraordinarily interesting look into the life of a Concentration Camp inmate during WWII. The stories all feel like one larger unit, and give you a real sense of what was happening and how it was effecting those that lived through it. The Possessed by Elif Batuman. This is actually a book of essays that the author gives a fairly heavy autobiographical tint. They are all about Russian Literature and 'the people who love it'. All of the essays are very entertaining, well written, and informative. If you are a fan of Russian lit. this is a must. This last one isn't a book of short stories at all, but Plutarch's Lives should absolutely be read (albeit very slowly and probably over the course of a fairly long period of time). The historical comparisons he gives are juxtaposed brilliantly, and the readings intermingle fact with 'fact' nicely.    Embed Quote
