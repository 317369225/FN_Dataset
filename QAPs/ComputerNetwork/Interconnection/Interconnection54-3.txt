★How is a person's desire to be wholly good and wholly devoid of bad/evil to be reconciled with the universal law of yin yang, which says that the universe is a constant harmonious interaction of the two opposing forces (i.e. positive/negative, good/bad), which are interconnected and interdependent?
You integrate positive/negative within yourself. Then, you'll be able to act from a point of Unity. A standpoint of Unity doesn't mean you'll act wither positively or negatively in an alternate, bipolar manner. Rather, it means you've aligned with your essential Truth (which is benevolent in nature) but with the wisdom and balance that resulted from you integrating your own negative polarity within you.    Embed Quote
