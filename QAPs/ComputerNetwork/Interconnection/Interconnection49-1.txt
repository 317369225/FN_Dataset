★Is everything interconnected? Are we all made of the same thing?
Depends on what level you're speaking from. From a quantum perspective, matter and energy are interwined. A particle can occupy two different points in space simutaneously. However, from our worldly, physical perspective, there are some clear differences in matter. As human beings, though, we have remarkably similar structure. Only when malnourished do distinctions happen.    Embed Quote
