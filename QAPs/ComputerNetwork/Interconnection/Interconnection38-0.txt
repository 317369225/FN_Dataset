★What's the interconnection between Java Servlets, Java Server Pages(JSP),  and Java Server Faces(JSF)?
JSP and Java Servlets are used to handle HTTP requests and generate responses. Java Servlets are java classes(you write) that implement the Servlet interface to handle Http(or other) requests. They follow a lifecycle and are called by the servlet container(such as Tomcat) when a new request arrives. JSP is a templating language for generating html. JSPs are converted to Servlets by the servlet container. So all JSPs are eventually converted to Servlets. JSF is a a web framework that builds on top of servlets and jsp. You can compare to the other frameworks/architectures such as Model View Controller.    Embed Quote
