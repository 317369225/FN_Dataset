★What are the supposed advantages of Toslink vs. copper for audio interconnects?
You get isolation and freedom from hum with the optical link. But you also can get it with careful electronic design. Maybe you get some bragging rights. Other than that there's no real advantage as both easily handle the required bandwidth. My system has both in use... I can remember which is which. It really doesn't matter.    Embed Quote
