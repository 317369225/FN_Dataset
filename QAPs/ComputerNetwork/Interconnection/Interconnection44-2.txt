★Why aren't the networks comprising the internet interconnected through bridges at the data link layer, instead of being  interconnected at the network layer through routers?
Bridges can not connect two different networks, you need routers for that as they function at Network layer and thus can understand IP addresses and subdomains. Routers have network layer built-in. Bridges make routing decisions based on MAC or physical addresses while Routers make decisions based on Logical or IP addresses. And all devices connected to internet use same Network model, if they are different, it won't be possible for them to talk (unless you take explicitly tell them how to handle particular packet type). So, all devices connected to any kind of network use same model, be it laptop, mobile, routers etc etc! Hope it helps.    Embed Quote
