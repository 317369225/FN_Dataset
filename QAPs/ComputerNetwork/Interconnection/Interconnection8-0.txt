★Simplify interconnected cloud marketing - can you?
'Interconnected cloud marketing' means using special marketing tools which are accessed through the internet, that connect with one another. Let's break it into manageable portions. 'Cloud computing' means that your computer doesn't have to do the hard work. It simply connects to the internet, connects to a huge 'cloud' (or group) of computers, tells the cloud what to do, the cloud does all the work, and sends back the information needed, direct to your computer. 'Interconnected cloud' means that one cloud of computers connects to another cloud of computers. This isn't as easy as you'd think, because each 'cloud' works on its own set of rules. So you have to work out a way for the clouds to connect to one another. 'Cloud marketing' means using marketing tools which exist in a particular cloud. Examples might be the ExactTarget Marketing Cloud, which is a group of tools available in the ExactTarget cloud. This might be social media management, or email management, or text message (sms) management. However, you might also be using Salesforce.com,  which helps you to manage your interactions with customers (tracking sales, contact with them etc). In order to use both, you would need to connect the clouds together, so that the data that you have in one cloud can be accessed and transferred to the other. And there you have an interconnected cloud marketing solution.    Embed Quote
