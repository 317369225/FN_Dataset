★How are the fields of physics interconnected?Is there a chart or diagram that depicts how the fields of physics are related, from the standpoint of "What specific areas of physics research could I potentially be involved with given my choice to pursue a Ph.D in X physics?"
Quite an interesting question. I am also looking forward for the responses from experts. I don't have any idea about chart but let me show you the paths that I have passed though.  May be one of us can consolidate all the responses here and create a chart. (As a computational physicist, following paths might be merely related to theoretical/simulation physics).  Non-Linear Dynamics which is diversified from Classical Mechanics Quantum Computing from Quantum Field Theory and basic Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Dot comes as experimental field and also merges with electronics(?). Quantum Computing leads to/ accompanies with  Quantum Information. If you take statistical mechanics, this field diverges at Stochastic Processes and Monte-Carlo Techniques. Liquid Crystals an experimental and simulation field from Condensed Matter Physics. From Condense Matter Physics/Physical Chemistry, there emerges a field called Density Functional Theory(DFT). With the help of theoretical knowledge in these fields, one can also start a career in simulation computing which completely takes into software industry. Material Science as an experimental field from Condensed Matter Physics. ...    Embed Quote
