★How is a person's desire to be wholly good and wholly devoid of bad/evil to be reconciled with the universal law of yin yang, which says that the universe is a constant harmonious interaction of the two opposing forces (i.e. positive/negative, good/bad), which are interconnected and interdependent?
a) If there was no bad, everything would be good, but since everything was good there would be no need for the idea of goodness, as it would simply be existence. Without bad there can be no good, and vice versa. b) A person's desire to be good does not eliminate evil, it merely expresses a desire not to give into it. There will always be temptation, and thus the desire to be good will always be interacting with the temptation to do do wrong.    Embed Quote
