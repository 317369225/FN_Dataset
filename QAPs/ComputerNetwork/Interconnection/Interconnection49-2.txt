★Is everything interconnected? Are we all made of the same thing?
If we reduce everything to the atom. The answer is yes. That though may be too narrow because diversity and complexity is a very real consideration. We are unique and that should mean more than the similarity of our substance. The fact that all matter is composed of the very same substance says a lot about the source of life--the power that holds it all together,  if you will. There is a powerful passage in the Bible that comes to mind whenever I think about this subject. Acts 17:23-29 KJV For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.  God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;  Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;  And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;  That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:  For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.  Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device. The scripture also says that by the Word of God all things "hold together". Scientists wonder about the force behind sub atomic particles and the instructions in DNA. It makes since that everything that has life must derive that ability from the same ultimate source.    Embed Quote
