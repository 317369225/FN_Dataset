★Are the uploading speed and downloading speed interconnected?While downloading from Torrent many a times both the Uploading and Downloading speed get equal. Is there any way to reduce the upload speed and increase the other one?
No. Both upload and download speed are given fixed independent bandwidth by your Internet Service Provider.    Embed Quote
