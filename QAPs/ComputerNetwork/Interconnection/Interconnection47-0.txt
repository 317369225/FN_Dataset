★Is there a UK mobile network that offers SIP/SS7 interconnect for voice transit?Looking for either MNO or MVNO who can hand voice calls to a switch for our own termination / origination. An advantage would be being able to retain the ability to use SMS and data services. Ideally I wish to be able to deploy SIM cards to end users and contact them as a SIP uri for voice - paying a flat monthly transit charge or low per minute fee.
a2a That sounds like you want to be an MVNO. There are various different "flavours" of MVNO - having your own switch, SIM cards & pricing plan is more sophisticated than some MVNOs (who are just brands) but a very standard business .odel. You just need to contact the MNOs in your country and ask about the MVNO products they offer NA dthen negotiate.    Embed Quote
