★It possible for South East Asia country have interconnected power grid?
Depend on your expectation. The land-base SE-Asia, I think there are already some (or at least planned). To include ALL the archipelago in SE-Asia: Not cheaply. So, no. At USD 3 MILLION DOLLAR per km [1] (say it like Dr evil Austin Power), distributed grid will be far cheaper. Hello microgrids! Hello distributed renewables! (Ok, that's different topic). PS: I'm not sure how accurate this map is, but looks OK-ish [2]: Double check that map with Indonesian grid map. Yeah, OK, we get the point, it's virtually non existent (except the 'Jamali grid') [3]: [1] Paul Stockley's answer to Electrical Grids: What is the cost of laying high voltage underwater, sea or fresh, copper cable, dollar per meter or $/km?
