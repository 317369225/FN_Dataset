★Are evolution and an increase in intelligence interconnected?I mean, is it necessary that human-like species (who are intelligent) will always eventually evolve from the most basic living forms? If not then why are we searching for extraterrestrial intelligence?
Insects existed before humanity and they reproduce much faster.  They've had more cycles of evolution than we have.  Single-celled organisms are even more extreme.  Whenever a creature reproduces, they are participating in evolution.    In practice this means that evolution will find as many different ways to ensure the transmission of the host's genes.  Intelligence is just one expression of this.  It's a good one, but it's far from the only advantage.    Embed Quote
