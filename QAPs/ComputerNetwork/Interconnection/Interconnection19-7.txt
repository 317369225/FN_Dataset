★What are the supposed advantages of Toslink vs. copper for audio interconnects?
The only immediate advantage I can see is its pretty immune to external interference, like radio waves and ground loops, that sort of thing. But to achieve that, the original electric signal has to be converted to light, travel to the other end of the cable and be converted again to electric. Even with these conversions, lab measurements are good, but... they tend to have higher jitter. And you have probably heard that high jitter is enemy of a natural pleasant realistic sound. Subjectively, there are a lot of blind tests concluding that copper interface (SPDIF with coaxial cable and RCA interconnect) sounds better to the ear in some sense. And this fact seems to correlate closely to jitter. The lower the jitter the better! Another good thing you mention is bandwidth. And in fact, by today's standard input/outputs available in electronics, coaxial SPDIF does support higher data transfer rates than toslink. So, I would say that a good well built shielded coaxial cable will beat toslink any day.    Embed Quote
