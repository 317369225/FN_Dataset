★How is a person's desire to be wholly good and wholly devoid of bad/evil to be reconciled with the universal law of yin yang, which says that the universe is a constant harmonious interaction of the two opposing forces (i.e. positive/negative, good/bad), which are interconnected and interdependent?
The concept of there being a balance between good and evil is one that is misconstrued, evil is the lack of balance. I`ll make a statement and give an analogy for it`s ontology: ``Good can exist apart from evil, but there can be no evil without there being a good for it to be against``.   Analogy: A man is working in his yard putting up a fence on a saturday morning. He is enjoying his work and has asked for no help. His son, however, desiring to help out of the goodness of his heart, offers his assistance freely for two hours. When the two hours are up, the father in his gratitude, buys his son a meal from his favorite restaurant.   There needed be no evil present when the son gave his help - an act of kindness - to his father, nor did there need be an evil present when the father showed his gratitude. I challenge you to name me one evil in a situation where there is no good that is both present and under attack. The ideal and balanced state of existence is good, evil being a virus that looks to it`s deterioration and destruction. Given that good exists of it`s own independance and evil like a parasite needing a host, there can be no balance between the two. To seek to be wholly good is to seek the true balance that is the lack of evil and where justice prevails.    Embed Quote
