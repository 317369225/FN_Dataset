★What are some books with interconnected short stories?Something along the same lines as Cloud Atlas. It could be any genre. The connection between the stories should be fascinating.
Jhumpa Lahiri's "Unaccustomed Earth" is a beautiful, interconnected collection. Riffs on the themes of 2nd generation Indian immigrants finding their identity in America... but apart from various details, the stories are very universal. She's been my favorite author for years.    Embed Quote
