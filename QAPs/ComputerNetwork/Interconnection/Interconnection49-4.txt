★Is everything interconnected? Are we all made of the same thing?
As per quantum mechanics we can simultaneously exists in various possibilities. The implications to this are profound. Quantum entangalment further suggest if two electrons of a single atom are separated in vast distances lets say at different ends of a Galaxy, if you intervene with one the spin of the other electron gets affected in the opposite direction. Albert Einstein called this spooky action at a distance which suggests that information can travel faster than light. That would mean there is a single interconnected force.    Embed Quote
