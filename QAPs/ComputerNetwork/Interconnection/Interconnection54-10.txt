★How is a person's desire to be wholly good and wholly devoid of bad/evil to be reconciled with the universal law of yin yang, which says that the universe is a constant harmonious interaction of the two opposing forces (i.e. positive/negative, good/bad), which are interconnected and interdependent?
Humans must balance the Good Inclination with the Evil Inclination to produce a harmony of operation.  If we did not have the Evil Inclination we would want nothing for ourselves which means we could not exist very long.  In order to do any Good we must maintain our material bodily strength which requires some selfishness,  a manifestation of the Evil inclination.    Embed Quote
