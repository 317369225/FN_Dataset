★Is there any evidence of interconnected evolution?Is it possible that cows evolved to their present form so they can be eaten by humans? In some species anti-predatory traits have been favored by evolution, so why some species haven't evolved so, for example, their meat is poisonous to predators?
Insects, specifically bees, and flowers.  Some plants have specifically evolved to take advantage of bees, like placing pollen packets directly on a bees back.  The plant only does this to bees.  The bees in turn have evolved to take advantage of the plant's nectar.  The same mechanism is also at work with certain flowers and hummingbirds.    Embed Quote
