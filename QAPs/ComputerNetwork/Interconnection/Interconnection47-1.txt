★Is there a UK mobile network that offers SIP/SS7 interconnect for voice transit?Looking for either MNO or MVNO who can hand voice calls to a switch for our own termination / origination. An advantage would be being able to retain the ability to use SMS and data services. Ideally I wish to be able to deploy SIM cards to end users and contact them as a SIP uri for voice - paying a flat monthly transit charge or low per minute fee.
AAISP offers a mobile SIP interconnected MVNO for customers who can whitelabel their own mobile service. You should probably speak to them about your needs. O2 in the UK seems to be the most prolific MVNO lease provider for direct interconnection.    Embed Quote
