★What are some books with interconnected short stories?Something along the same lines as Cloud Atlas. It could be any genre. The connection between the stories should be fascinating.
If you liked Cloud Atlas, you would probably enjoy Specimen Days by Michael Cunningham. It has a similar structure. The stories are inter-connected by theme and character, they take place at different historical times, and Cunningham uses the structure to explore very different genres in the same book. You might also enjoy The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien. He uses the inter-connected short stories to convey the experience of the Vietnam War. It's not one of my favorite reads, and I wouldn't recommend it as highly as the previous two books, but another example is Kissing in Manhattan by David Schickler. All  these books I would consider "short-story novels" (I just coined that term; I don't know if a real equivalent exists). In other words, they are composed of short stories, but the effect as a whole is like a reading a novel. The sum is greater than the parts.    Embed Quote
