★What are some cities with interconnected metro systems?For example, it is (was?) planned to link the Shanghai Metro with the Suzhou subway system by having two lines meet in the middle.
Let's see..... Oakland and San Francisco are separate cities that share BART (with several other cities too). Liverpool (of Beatles fame) is connected to Birkenhead (don't ever suggest they are the same city) by Merseyrail. Japan has a number of metro systems which connect to private railways that continue to other cities.   Tokyo and Kyoto spring to mind but I'm sure there are others. Greater London is served by the Underground and contains the City of London and the City of Westminster. However, I have to admit I can't think of two cities that built separate metros and then linked them.    Embed Quote
