★Who are the best global VoIP wholesalers both for interconnections and direct routes?
SIPRoutes.com is a good starting provider for both domestic and international termination. You can either let them pick most cost effective route for each outbound call based from your list of preferred carries, or you can create profiles that let you pick and choose which carriers you wish to use - and you can do so dynamically for each call. This is helpful also as you get started with debugging and troubleshooting specific destinations/countries. You can essentially create your own LCR engine on top of SIPRoutes that also factors in quality, customer-specific preferences, and destination-specific recent performance of ASR, etc. Internationally they currently support 6 carriers and for domestic termination you have 25+ carriers including RBOCs such as AT&T, CLECs like Level3, Pacwest, aggregators such as ANI and Excel, and also providers such as Inteliquent and Hypercube. On top of all this they have a great SIP debugger. Once you get big enough you always have the option to go and contract these carriers directly if you have large enough volume to justify saving SIPRoutes' relatively small margins.    Embed Quote
