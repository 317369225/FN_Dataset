★How long will it be before a new system such as Netflix or Apple TV makes traditional cable, broadcast networks and Blu-ray distribution obsolete?
I'm may work in the camp of the industry producers, but I think the computer industry is correct.  Major disruption is coming.  Just providing online distribution isn't enough though, there has to be a new business model as well - but we're not talking about new business model in terms of monetization - we already have perfectly good models that have worked for a long time; which is, you either get content for free with advertising subsidies - which can be a very profitable model; or you pay-per-view.  Or you do something else, and there's some new models that are interesting, but are tougher to scale. So when I talk about new business model, I mean what's the new model for producers to create not just a distribution channel, but also what's the funding model (it has to be paid for ahead of time), and what's the marketing model (how will people find out about your content)?  Once innovative combinations of platforms + real world financial and deliverables support come together that subvert the networks, change will happen; quickly. There are a lot of professional producers who can't wait for that to happen - me included.
