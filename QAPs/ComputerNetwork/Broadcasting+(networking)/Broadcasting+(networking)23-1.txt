★If Amazon, Hulu, Netflix and other streaming video services can provide an enjoyable viewing experience online, why can't (or won't) CBS and the other broadcasting networks do the same?
The networks are getting closer to this as we speak and cable/satellite companies are nervous. HBO-Go  and other premium channels offer streaming services to subscribers who pay for the channels through cable/satellite. HBO customers get free access to HBO-Go already but the company is looking into making this streaming service available for non-cable/satellite customers on a monthly subscriptions service soon. Other premium networks channels are looking into the internet streaming subscription, but they are holding back to see what happens with HBO. The sticking point is that when HBO-Go becomes a streaming subscription service then HBO will be competing directly with the very satellite/cable companies they sell programming to, creating a conflict. TV providers will almost certainly want to drop HBO and its affiliate channels in retaliation so HBO needs to be sure they can go it alone.
