★How can I tell if I'm on a broadcast network or if I'm on a switched network?
If you are physically plugged into a hub you are part of a broadcast network, if you are plugged into a switch you are on a switched network.  If you cannot tell which device you are connected to (ie in a network closet etc) Wireshark can be used to determine if you are on a switched network.  If you only see traffic destined to and from your own IP address then you are on a switched network, if you see traffic that is not sourced from or destined to your local host then you are part of a broadcast network.  Broadcast networking equipment has not been used by the majority of organizations in several years.
