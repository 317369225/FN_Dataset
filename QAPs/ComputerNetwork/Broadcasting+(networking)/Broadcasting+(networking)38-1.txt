★Is it time to revive a show like Media Network broadcast 1980-2000 on Radio Netherlands?I feel not enough is being done to document media developments outside the USA and (parts of Europe).
Absolutely.  NOTHING (well, except maybe Happy Station) was a better ambassador for the Netherlands as a country worth respecting and appreciating than the time and attention RNW gave to everything it did. Media Network was an outstanding example of how to cover media and technology developments that impacted what was originally the shortwave medium. I had an MCI Mail account and remember telexing (not a cheap proposition) Radio Moscow during the coup attempt, and was the Region 13 Coordinator for Fidonet, covering the mid-Atlantic states of the USA, so I've been around the online world for many years now.  But being online didn't have to mean obliterating the radio listening hobby -- it just helped transform it. Technology like the Internet broadened the reach of stations that formerly couldn't afford a big broadcasting presence (you can enjoy pristine quality from the Voice of Mongolia today online), but without a tour guide to the monstrous-sized Internet, and the technology we can use today to access international voices at home and on the go, it all gets lost except among those who already know where to find it. It was an enormous mistake to cancel Media Network in the first place -- one that could still be rectified by bringing it all back.
