★Is a television broadcast network affiliate such as KVOA (NBC) allowed to charge a cable/satellite company for programming?
The local affiliate legally has exclusive rights to the programming in that area. I admit I think some issues regarding this have changed, but basically: An affiliate can request MUST CARRY status for a cable company OR they can charge for it to be carried Those are true for cable, and I think also apply for satellite.  Remember, for a long time, satellite did NOT have network stations at all EXCEPT for very limited areas that were not within affiliate boundaries... (And tons of people who were lying to get network stations.)  Then satellite did the "local into local" transmission of your own affiliates, not a major city in each time zone.
