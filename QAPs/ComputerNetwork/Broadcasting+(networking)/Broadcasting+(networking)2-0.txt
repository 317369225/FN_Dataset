â˜…How long will it be before a new system such as Netflix or Apple TV makes traditional cable, broadcast networks and Blu-ray distribution obsolete?
I've been in three separate panel discussions about this exact subject in three different, high-end industry conferences in the past 12 months. In every case, the answers broke down into the same two strikingly stark camps: Participants who are currently in the film/video/TV production and distribution industry (show producers, MSOs, network executives, studios, etc.) were unanimous in their belief that the mass, inertia, basic economics and long-term contracts of the current system will ensure that no dramatic change will be possible for at least five to ten years. Every other participant (computer execs, Internet entrepreneurs, pundits, bloggers, investors, etc.) were unanimous in their conviction that it will be a matter of one to three years before everything is turned on its head...and that there is a good chance that Apple could do it almost single-handedly by deploying some of its enormous cash horde to jump start something based on iCloud. These have been some of the most fascinating conversations I've been in all year...and it's clear that one side or the other is going to be very, very wrong.
