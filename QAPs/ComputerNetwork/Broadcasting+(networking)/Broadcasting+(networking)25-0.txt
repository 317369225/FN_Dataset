★I am looking for TV Ratings for the 18-34 age range in the US. I have been able to find the weekly top 10 rated shows for this age range this for cable networks, but not for broadcast networks or integrated across all networks. Any suggestions? Thank you
Are you looking to find it for free online?  If yes, not sure how to help you.  If not for free, Nielsen or most media buying agencies can give you that data if you ask them for it.  Page on TV also MIGHT have that data cut available.
