★Are the miracles performed by great evangelists like Benny Hinn, pastor Chris, and others on TBN gospel broadcast network proof that God exists? Are these true biblical miracles?
Miracles do happen ! Like it or not.   I agree with the idea that it is better to pray for 100 persons and see 5 healed than to pray for none and none got healed.   The truth is that miracles are promised by Jesus for all believers (Gospel of Mark chapter 16 verses 17 and 18). Why ? Because, christians are meant to be exactly as Jesus, the ultimate model and do even more than what He did ! Even Jesus didn't heal all the sick people of Israel at the time. Only those who believe and act by coming to Him got healed. Nobody left Jesus with his sickness according to the Bible.   Just to be more experimental: Last week, saturday, january 24th 2015, I've prayed in the Name of Jesus for a paralyzed man who can't walk without a cane. A minute later he needed his cane no more and was shocked. He got healed, it is true. I can post his photo ! Not everyone I prayed for get healed but the truth is that some are healed and others do not ! I have no explanation for the unique reason that, I am not the healer ! Jesus Is !   Instead of arguing here, ask a christian who practice the Bible to pray for sickness and see the results or if you are courageous, read Bible passages related to healing, have faith and ask Jesus to heal you ! Try Him ! It's a matter of personal experience not theories !   Have a good day ! Much Love !
