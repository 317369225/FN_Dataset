â˜…What's the exact difference between broadcast networks and cable networks? In terms of business model?
The big difference is in the type of channel. We have the following categories: - Premium channels (like HBO), these are a la carte carte channels meaning that the users chooses wherever they want to pay for this or not. If the customer will pay then the revenue is split between the channel (HBO) and the carrier (Comcast). So these channels have revenues from distribution and rarely from advertising as they don't sell ad space. - Paid channels meaning the channels that the carrier has to pay for (Discovery, ESPN, etc) in order to distribute to the user. Therefore the carrier will include this channels in paid packages and will pay the channels according to how many customers subscribe to the specific package. So these channels make money from distribution and also they sell ad space. - Free channels, this are the channels that the carrier dosen't have to pay to include them in packages that they sell to the users. So these channels make money only by selling advertising. There is down to personal choice for each channel, the free ones go free in order to get more distribution therefore more audience so they can make more money from advertising. As channel have better content they can ask money for distribution also therefore developing a new revenue stream.
