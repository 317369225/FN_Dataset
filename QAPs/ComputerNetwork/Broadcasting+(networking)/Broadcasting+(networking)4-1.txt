★Entertainment Industry: How would you value the worth of a broadcast network like ABC?Just for argument's sake, could anyone assign 'values' to the 'Big 4' networks and rank them first through fourth, in terms of market value?
There is only one broadcasting network which is competing with the ABC and that is 'CBS'..ABC is only about 5% of Disney’s stock and Fox is about 8% of News Corp’s stock but the 'CBS' has the 34% of the company’s stock. so CBS is the leading from all other broadcasters..
