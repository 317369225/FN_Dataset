â˜…How long will it be before a new system such as Netflix or Apple TV makes traditional cable, broadcast networks and Blu-ray distribution obsolete?
I've cut the cord myself, but I think large-scale disruption could take a while, if only because of the sorry state of broadband in the U.S. If most households were reliably able to get 30-40 Mbps during peak hours for $40/month or less (as should have happened a while ago, given technological advances and declining infrastructure costs), then it would be a lot easier for a company like Apple, Google, or Netflix to upend the industry through an IP-based platform for distributing both cable/broadcast streams and on-demand content. But instead, it's estimated that the average connection speed is only around 5 Mbps (http://ipcarrier.blogspot.com/20...). Which is a major problem when 1080i content generally requires a minimum of about 10 Mbps (usually higher). Even if compression advances allow for comparable image quality around 5 Mbps, it'll still be a major challenge for many homes that need access to 3-5 TV streams at once (between multiple TV sets, PIP, and DVR recording). Especially since you need a bit of headroom with your connection speed to guarantee QoS and have some bandwidth left over for Internet access. That said, I'd still love to see Apple or someone else try to disrupt cable, satellite, and telco TV providers by offering an a la carte, IP-based platform for TV channel subscriptions, with VOD content and mobile streaming rights attached to each subscribed channel. If Apple is willing to pay the same per-subscriber rates for ESPN, CNN, USA, etc. that traditional pay-TV providers offer, they might be able to pull it off (though I'm sure the networks' pay-TV customers won't be happy). But any such service will have to come with a strong disclaimer that many homes won't be able to get HD streams sent to all of their TV sets at once.
