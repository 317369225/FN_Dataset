â˜…What's the best way to describe the USA TV system? Cable Channels, Broadcasters, Networks, what do they all mean?
Well, the answer used to be simple. Local stations affliated with the Big Four networks (ABC, CBS, NBC & later Fox) were called Broadcast and you could view the local stations with an antenna. (PBS also was "broadcast" but because they ran no ads, they were not really "counted.") There were also indie stations (not affliated) who were also "broadcast" but again, since they were local with lower ratings, they werre not really "counted." Cable first came about re-transmitting the local/network affliates so the signal was better. Then of course, people realized they could create a channel and skip having to sign up affliates all over the country. These became "cable channels." Then things got a little broad as local (non-network) stations around the country became "superstations" WTBS - later TBS and WGN have survived to this day - others dropped trying to be a "superstation.") Scroll forward to today and it's totally complicated as Broadcast also includes the CW, Univision, Telemundo and a few other Spanish channels. But it's complicated as QVC, HSN & other the home shopping channels also own local affliates so they are technically a broadcast network. There are overseas broadcast metworks that are only cable channels in the US (BBC and CCTV just t name 2). AND with the digital must carry rule, some local stations have "channels" that can be accessed with a HD antenna but when 99% of eople access these via cable, what is what? And now, you have "internet-only" channels - including Netflix plus others only "broadcast" via AppleTV or Roku ... Or YouTube "channels" that reach and viewed by millions more than something like OVATION - so, what is what?
