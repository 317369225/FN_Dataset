★How long will it be before a new system such as Netflix or Apple TV makes traditional cable, broadcast networks and Blu-ray distribution obsolete?
David, Evan and Brian's answers are spot on.  Due to rising content costs (spurred by the 360 availability consumers are demanding of video providers), the cable model may have been in trouble.  Then, miracle of miracles, came broadband with amazing 70-80% margins.  Now pay TV is just a sunk cost of smashing it out of the park on broadband, home phone and sometimes wireless too.  Look at Time Warner Cable -- they lost vid subscribers for literally 20 quarters straight, but they added broadband users and their stock actually went up during their bleeding video customers years. And a note on Apple...Can the Steve Jobs worshipers please stop beating the drum for Apple to revolutionize the TV biz?!? As Evan and Brian commented, the TV/Film biz is most certainly not the music biz.  What possible incentive would a TV net (or for that matter a television show creator) have for ditching the current upfront+annual license fees+ad revenue+syndie revenue model?  Apple/Google/every other tech company doesn't have the stomach for that kind of initial and ongoing financial commitment.  Nevermind that content isn't in their DNA. All that said, viewers will pick the winners and losers.  And according to Nielsen, more than 90% of viewers don't know what they want to watch when they turn on the TV.  Hence packaged pay TV and OTT.
