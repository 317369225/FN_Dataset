â˜…What is collision domain and broadcast domain in networking?
If there are multiple devices connected to the same medium through Hub or some kind of Repeater, then there is only one collision domain for all of the devices connected to it. If multiple of them try to send a message at a time, the message will get garbled due to the collision. For successful operation in this collision domain, you need media access protocols on the NIC cards of the hosts like CSMA CD/CA. Switch is used to break up the collision domains. Where as in a network if some one is broadcasting, even though they are connected through switch ( No common collision domain ) , the other hosts receive the message because they are in same broadcast domain. You can split the broadcast domain by using VLAN'S or Routers Routers will not allow the broadcast traffic of one sub network to the other if those sub networks are connected though router.
