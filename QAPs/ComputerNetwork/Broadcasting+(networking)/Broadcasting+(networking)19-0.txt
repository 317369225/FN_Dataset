â˜…Television Business: What is the marketing strategy / programming brand of each of the major four broadcasting networks right now -- ABC, NBC, Fox, CBS?For example, targeting old/young/men/women/etc.
All personal opinion and perception. not looking up data right now (answering from phone) CBS - market leader. most popular shows but really don't think they're all that creative. ABC - focus on high quality content that's more family-oriented. NBC - good with young people but not well in terms of ratings. Peacock still looking to recover from the glory days. had a decent run with 30/Office for a while but community/P&R has loyal following rather than large audience Fox - takes more risk / more willing to experiment. Has a good grip on young adult male.
