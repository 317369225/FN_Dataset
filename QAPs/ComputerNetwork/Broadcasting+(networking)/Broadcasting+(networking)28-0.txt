â˜…Why doesn't Cartoon Network broadcast Naruto anymore?
The descision of airin or not airing an animated show would be taken keeping in mind the age groups of the viewers. Channels like Cartoon Network have more viewers aged 7-15. Considering these veiwers, the channel managers wouldn't like complaints regarding violence and misbehaviour from the parents as the channel ratings would go down. Whereas in Channels like Animax, which broadcast anime specifically ,that wouldn't be the case.(My answer might be boring, I just started writing them recently)
