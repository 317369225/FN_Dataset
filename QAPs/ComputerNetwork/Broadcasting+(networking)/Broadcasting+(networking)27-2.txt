★When did networks broadcast in color?
I have no reference for this answer, only the recollection of an article I read somewhere on the same topic.  The story stated that, in the beginning of TV, no one ever considered broadcasting anything other than color, simply because that is what the eye reproduced and what everyone saw.  The idea was to create a color broadcast right from the beginning.  But, in order to simplify the process and make it commercially viable, the engineers decided that they had to find a way to take the color out of the picture.  So, black and white TV (or TV with no recognizable color ... early TV was pretty much green and gray if I remember right ...) was really the second choice and it stuck.  When the technology finally caught up with the market, color TV broadcasts made a come back.  Can anyone find a reference for this old, old memory?
