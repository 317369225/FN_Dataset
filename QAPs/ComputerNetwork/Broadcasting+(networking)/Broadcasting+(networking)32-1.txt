â˜…When will the US broadcast television networks no longer be viable businesses, and go the way of Kodak?
This is unlikely to ever happen. If quality content could be supported by advertising in the past, then it seems reasonable that quality content will be supported by advertising in the future. Certain media companies will fail to adapt themselves to the new medium. Others will survive, and even thrive. I watch all of my preferred television online, I have for the past 7 years. In the past 7 years, I have not had a cable television subscription, and I have been thrilled to discover that much of my selected programming can be viewed legally and supported by advertisements (and specifically targeted advertisements at that). Those guys are going to be doing just fine.
