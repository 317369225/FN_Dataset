â˜…What is the difference between a broadcast network and a switched network?
Broadcast in computer networking (I've just finished a college class about it) is a packet sent to all devices on a network. This kind of implementation was common back in the days when hubs were used, because they do nothing but retransmit what they receive. The set of all devices that receive this packet is called broadcast domain. This wasn't a very efficient solution, because all devices transmitted data at the same time, creating congestion and requiring time-consuming solutions to avoid collisions (think of a meeting where everybody starts talking at the same time or of a huge traffic jam on a highway). Collision happens when two devices try to communicate on the same physical segments at the same time. The set of devices involved in this situation is called a collision domain. Hubs created a huge collision domain, very hard to handle. That's why nowadays we use switches. They break up a network in smaller segments (network segmentation), that are much easier to handle and use physical (or hardware) addresses (MAC addresses). Switches learn MAC addresses and have a table where they store the source MAC address of the frame (filter table). If they know the address of the destination device they forward the frame to it, otherwise they broadcast it to the whole segment but to the device that transmitted it. Most important of all, switches break up collision domains by dividing a network in several smaller physical parts (segments). Though this partly solves the problem, you'll need routers to solve the problem of broadcast domains, because switches can't break them up, only routers do. Hope this responds thoroughly to your question.
