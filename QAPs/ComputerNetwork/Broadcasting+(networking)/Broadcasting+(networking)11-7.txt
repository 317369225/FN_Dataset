â˜…Are the miracles performed by great evangelists like Benny Hinn, pastor Chris, and others on TBN gospel broadcast network proof that God exists? Are these true biblical miracles?
God is as real as you are. He works in different ways. Sometimes in a quiet whisper (Elijah) and sometimes the mountains trembles and quakes with His presence (Mt. Sinai). The point is, God has made it absolutely clear in the bible that the age, gender or status of any man isn't a qualification for him or her to be used through Him. Yes these miracles are true. It all depends on the faith and belief you have in Jesus. Give Him a chance to change your life. I did and I cannot explain the joy and peace I have. It's like nothing else. Open your life completely to Him. You have nothing to loose, but have everything to gain..
