â˜…Is it time to revive a show like Media Network broadcast 1980-2000 on Radio Netherlands?I feel not enough is being done to document media developments outside the USA and (parts of Europe).
I ran the programme for 20 years and recently started putting some of the programmes back on line, mainly because I think its an example of crowd sourced radio programming well before we knew what the Internet was all about. There are now some great podcasts and vodcasts for those interested in technology (www.twit.tv) being a great example. More insight into Leo's work in this video I made last year. http://www.vimeo.com/9934226 . If you want to relive what we were up to when MCI mail and Fidonet was the only way of sending electronic correspondence, have a look here. http://www.jonathanmarks.libsyn....
