★What are the main drivers of CPM rates charged by broadcast and cable networks?
CPM (Cost Per Thousand Impressions) is determined by day part placement (morning, day, afternoon, prime, etc.) as well as how far in advance of the airing an advertiser buys the spot.  Typically, it is economically favorable to purchase ad time in the Upfront market in May as the subsequent Scatter market commands a CPM premium.  Think of it as a discount for buying early - it saves the advertisers money and it enables broadcasters to firm up their ad sales revenue in the first half of the year.  A network will typically sell 60-80% of it's full year ad revenue during the Upfront season.  Other than these considerations, CPM is also determined by the macroeconomic conditions as it spurs consumer demand and thus advertising need (for instance, 2009 CPM was horrible but 2010 rebounded considerably across the board), as well as factors that drive network desirability to advertisers (demographic, size of Nielsen universe and ratings.) Fun fact: CPM is abbreviated as CPM and not CPT (thousand) because M is the Roman numeral for 1,000.
