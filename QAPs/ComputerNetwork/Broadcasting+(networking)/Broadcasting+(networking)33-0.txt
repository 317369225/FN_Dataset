★Does broadcasting different networks cost a cable company different amounts of money?For example, does it cost a cable provider more money to broadcast ESPN vs. NBC because of the amount they have to pay to the network?
Yes, ESPN is currently the most expensive channel line up for most/all US cable companies.  Other channels like the various shopping channels actually pay the MSOs to carry their channel.  The exact cost varies by cable company.  The costs for content is the main reason that NCTC (http://www.nctconline.org/) exists so that smaller operators don't have to negotiate individually and can take advantage of a larger scale of subscribers when they buy from the networks.  Re-transmission of over the air broadcast channels is a whole other issue that has gotten more complex in recent years.
