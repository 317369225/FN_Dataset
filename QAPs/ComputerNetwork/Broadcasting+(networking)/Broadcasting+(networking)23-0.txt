â˜…If Amazon, Hulu, Netflix and other streaming video services can provide an enjoyable viewing experience online, why can't (or won't) CBS and the other broadcasting networks do the same?
Because it's actually really, really hard to do. The problem with great (not just good) technology in general is making it look effortless and easy. But making it look like that kind of magic takes a lot of resources, and a very talented team. The additional problem for traditional broadcasters (especially in the US) is attracting that kind of talent; because why would these people want to work for an "old media" company, when they could also be working on the cutting edge in an internet company, with likeminded peers and management that understands what they're doing? That's an edge that Amazon/Hulu/Netflix have over media companies (and they're very well aware of it, and put in a lot of effort to make sure their companies stay that way).
