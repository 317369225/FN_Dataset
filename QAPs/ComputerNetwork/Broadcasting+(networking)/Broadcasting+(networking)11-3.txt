â˜…Are the miracles performed by great evangelists like Benny Hinn, pastor Chris, and others on TBN gospel broadcast network proof that God exists? Are these true biblical miracles?
Miracles are coincidence. God does not exist in the form that the bible suggests. Often, "miracles" one sees are staged and crafted by the one who wants others to believe that they are working with "God" to make these miracles happen. Why would"God" not simply heal anyone who was sick, or injured, or in need of a miracle? It makes no sense that "God" would pick and choose if "he" was an all loving God as everyone believes. It's all nonsense.
