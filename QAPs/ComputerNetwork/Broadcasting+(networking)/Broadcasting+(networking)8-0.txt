★Television Business: In a cable and Internet dominated world, what happens to local affiliates of broadcast networks?Especially the ones that aren't O&O.
NBC Universal affiliates launched websites that are based more on the local market needs about three years ago. They are increasing their relevance by attempting to create sites that are local market experts online rather then solely focus their website on the network and its programming. Since they already have a local sales force and strong local market info, it makes sense for them to do this.  They recognize they must differentiate and have a strong online component in order to maintain relevance in the market.  They even changed the branding - so instead of looking for www.wxyz.com you go to nbcatlanta.com Now that broadcast networks have negotiated a fee from the cable operators, they may split some of that with their local affiliates as well.  You are right to note that it has become an exceptionally challenging marketplace though.
