★Would there be any changes in The Last Ship if the show were on a broadcast network instead of cable?
That’s hard to say because I think the broadcast networks are trying to move closer and closer to the cable model:  taking more risks, doing shows with bigger scope.  And our show is not a gory violent show (compared to The Following at least) or one filled with nudity so I can’t say that we’d have to change the content.  What I can say is that the shorter order (of 10 or 13) is comforting because you can really sculpt your season and see the whole thing before you get started and not have to worry about stretching a season into 22 episodes which inevitably diminishes the quality.  The other thing that’s been great about working at TNT is that they don’t have nearly as many shows to launch as the networks so they can focus their attention on you – in terms of marketing dollars – and you also have a sense that they won’t give up on you in the third week if you’re not hitting a home run out of the gate.  Fortunately for us, our numbers were pretty great right off the bat so that hasn’t come into play.  But it’s a good feeling before you launch to feel like people aren’t coming from a place of fear.
