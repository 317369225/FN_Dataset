★Do non-public broadcasting networks have religious roots?
The current broadcast television networks do not have a religious background.  NBCand CBS were founded in the late 1920s, ABC was created from part of NBC (NBC's 'Blue' Network)  NBC. Fox is an amalgamation of a number of smaller systems such as Metromedia, none of whom seem to have  had a religious base.   CBN, the Christian Broadcasting Network, was originally a broadcast network that also syndicated programs but it seems to entirely out of the broadcast business today Christian Broadcasting Network.   [There are a number of entities that syndicate religious programming on radio but I cannot speak to that issue. ]
