★What are the main drivers of CPM rates charged by broadcast and cable networks?
Main drivers are the audience watching the show and the cost of the ad.  CPM is actually a formula.  If you take the cost of the ad multiple it by 1000 and divide by the total audience you get your CPM or cost per thousand.  Take the Super Bowl.  Let's say for example a :30 spot is $2.5 million dollars.That's expensive so it seems, but the audience watching is huge - close to 95 million.  So your actual CPM is around $26.00, which is actually pretty reasonable.  It just seems high since your audience is so large.   Of course it is really a circular argument in a way.  You purchase a program based on the audience, but you don't really know what the audience will be.  So you base it on historic info or comps in the case of new shows.  Then it will either over or underdeliver.  If the audience is larger then historic and comps indicated, then you got a deal, but the price will adjust upward to a higher price based on this larger audience.  If the audience was smaller then historic or comps, then it underdelivered in which case the network will owe you a "makegood"  to make good on all audience/impressions it was supposed to deliver.
