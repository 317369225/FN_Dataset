★When did networks broadcast in color?
Mid 1950s. But it was quite a few years before color TV technology became good enough and mass produced to reach the multitudes. Now, the song lyric in Money for Nothing about 'moving those color TVs' has become archaic. Kids these days have never seen anything but TVs with color screens. Someday kids will be accustomed to holographic TVs and will laugh at ancient people who only had two dimensional sets. Anyway, at the start of TV, CRTs were the only practical way to display images and early CRT phosphors were limited to green. After awhile, white phosphors were available. This enabled gray-scale (black and white).  But for decades there was no practical technology for displaying colors in a screen. So, TV by necessity started with black and white. There never was any attempt to  start with color and back off from that.
