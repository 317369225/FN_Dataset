â˜…Are the miracles performed by great evangelists like Benny Hinn, pastor Chris, and others on TBN gospel broadcast network proof that God exists? Are these true biblical miracles?
Miracles do occur, and I've been witness to one as it unfolded. I've seen a woman who was diagnosed with a mass on her brain, as seen in a CT scan, be prayed over by her pastor and congregation, and then the mass was gone in a subsequent CT scan. Which is why the Benny Hinn crap infuriates me. It is staged baloney. God is not a performing monkey who acts on a public stage at the whim of a charlatan like Hinn, but acts in quiet moments of faith that are usually only witnessed by a few.
