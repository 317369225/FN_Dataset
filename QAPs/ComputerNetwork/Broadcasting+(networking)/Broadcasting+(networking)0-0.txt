★What is the difference between a broadcast network and a switched network?
Ohad Kravchick covered it. I will offer an analogy in an office full of cubicles: Stand up and shout = broadcast Dial someone's extension = switched If everyone shouts - it is very noisy and some messages get garbled.  To make communications more effective, you have to either: Limit the amount of shouting at any one time and put in signals to let people know if they were heard (i.e. Ethernet broadcasts do this) Allow for directed point-to-point connections between endpoints (i.e. Ethernet switching does this).
