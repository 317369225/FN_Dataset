★Why aren't Canadian TV series broadcast on US networks?
They tried Trailer Park Boys on BBC America a few years ago but wound up censoring a fair bit of the dialogue.  Given that "Fuck" is punctuation in that series, BBC America made it incomprehensible.  Which made no sense since it was a cable station.  It had to be experienced properly on Showtime (in primetime, uncensored in Canada, take that FCC!) or on DVD.  Still hilarious years later and I own all of it.  More or less unknown in the USA.  Trivia: One of the first on-screen appearances for Ellen Page.
