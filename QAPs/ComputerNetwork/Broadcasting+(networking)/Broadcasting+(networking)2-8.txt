★How long will it be before a new system such as Netflix or Apple TV makes traditional cable, broadcast networks and Blu-ray distribution obsolete?
The conceit of this question is that companies like Netflix or Apple TV are somehow natural competitors to cable or broadcast. Once you understand how media companies use distribution windows to monetize their content, you'd see the question makes about as much sense as asking when PCs will obsolete TV.    Most of the video entrepreneurs I've met at conferences over the years do not understand how TV and movie companies make money, and if they don't learn to listen quickly, they prove they love their own hype more than success and ultimately fade out. Others, like Steve Jobs, Reed Hastings and Jason Kilar have come to understand the media business, which is why their successes are designed in a way to carve out their own distribution windows. Steve Jobs' original approach to TV was flawed, but he learned to listen. (I still have an Apple TV remote from his failed 1995 effort.) The online medium will only obsolete current distribution windows if and only if (1) it is first able to create an upfront-type marketplace that creates significant, incremental and sustainable licensing revenues for both new releases and  library content, and (2) this marketplace demonstrates the ability to fund a typical studio's pipeline of projects in a way that reduces development risk. About ten years ago I would have given this a 40% chance of happening. Now, after seeing YouTube's lack of progress and Hulu's shrinking influence, I give this about a 20% chance of happening within the next 10 years. EDIT: Here is J.
