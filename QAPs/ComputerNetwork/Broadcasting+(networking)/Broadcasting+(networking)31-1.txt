★How often should I send a network broadcast packet?Writing a network chat program. How often should I send network broadcast packets (Short UDP string) to check if other users are on the network? I'm thinking every 30 seconds but need advice.
The normal approach is to have each client phone home to a central server periodically and have the central server keep track of who is online.  This scales better since each client can ask to connect to a specific user if they are online. The client heartbeat to the server can be on client launch and exit.  If the client wants to either connect to a particular person it can ask the central server for the details of that person. A central server also helps to get around NAT issues if both endpoints are on the internet and not a LAN.
