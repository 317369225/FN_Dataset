â˜…How long will it be before a new system such as Netflix or Apple TV makes traditional cable, broadcast networks and Blu-ray distribution obsolete?
It's coming sooner than we may think. The solution isn't going to come from Apple though, their traditional closed approach would just mean trading one all-or-nothing provider for another. The old "push" model of cable television--giving us all a huge number of channels we'll never watch--just isn't consumer friendly. A more workable alternative would be an Android-based set-top box, tied to a cloud-based back end that allows for more of an interactive platform and delivery of a wider variety of content. A great advantage here is that because such a system (and there is one in beta now, see TROVA: Open Source Media, Gaming, & Services Platform) would lend itself to more action on the provider side, giving indie producers small game developers, etc. a seat at the table.
