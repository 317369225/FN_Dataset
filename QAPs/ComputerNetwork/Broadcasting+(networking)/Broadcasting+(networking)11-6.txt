★Are the miracles performed by great evangelists like Benny Hinn, pastor Chris, and others on TBN gospel broadcast network proof that God exists? Are these true biblical miracles?
I don't think many people believe that what Benny Hinn or any televangelist does are miracles.  Crack scientists (chemists, biologists, and physicists) doesn't disprove science Crack preachers, pastors, and priest don't disprove Christianity
