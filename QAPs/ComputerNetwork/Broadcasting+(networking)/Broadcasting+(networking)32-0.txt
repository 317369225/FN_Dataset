â˜…When will the US broadcast television networks no longer be viable businesses, and go the way of Kodak?
Not for a long time. Just like radio was never replaced by TV, television will not be completely replaced by video streaming for a while, instead, it will find a niche and change its business model to stay profitable there. Other reasons why the Internet is not a direct threat to TV yet are: Advertisers have not figured out how to justify or measure Internet investments. In part because, The Internet is still not a mature medium. There are no clear standards (lots of codecs and proprietary protocols). There is no clear legislation governing it (Internet neutrality anyone?). The current average user does NOT want the Internet in their living room. We are still away from a good interface that can make interactive TV a good proposition. Just like Steve Jobs said that the iPhone would have been dead on arrival if it had a stylus, interactive TV will not succeed until we don't need a keyboard, or even a remote to interact with the TV as a group, the way we watch television today. Perhaps more importantly than the items above, the people making decisions about advertising budgets are not active internet users. They also have the perception (whether valid or not) that those in charge of making expense decisions at home are not internet users. There is a generational divide that will keep some companies from migrating to the internet. As more marketing execs retire and get replaced by younger people, online delivery will become more acceptable for companies that so far are struggling to figure out new media strategies. The internet is evolving quickly and trying to find its way, but it needs to solve quite a few problems before it can rival TV in a convincing form for advertisers.
