★Someone claimed that CBN (Christian Broadcasting Network) is a white supremacist hate group. Is there any evidence that backs this up, or do some people simply disagree politically with CBN and insult CBN due to political disagreements?www.cbn.com
"White supremacist hate group" is a bit unjustified, unless you happen to belong to a group that they hate. Most people would be more comfortable with "wacko religious  extremists", or just "American Taliban" for short.
