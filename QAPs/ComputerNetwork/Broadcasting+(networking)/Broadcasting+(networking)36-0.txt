â˜…When films dialogue or content is edited for network broadcast, who makes the changes?Is the new version produced by the original studio or the distributing network; for example do all the 'edited' versions of The Big Lebowski feature the 'find a stranger in the Alps' line?
Each studio has an in house team who are dedicated to the revisions of its' releases. Often these are older editors who have been through many standards and practices issues in their careers, and are masters of making the sort of changes required for network, and airline showings. Sometimes when you see "edited for television" this is just referencing changing the aspect ratio. It may also refer to adjustments made to have the film's running time fit the broadcast schedule. In some cases this is done by creatives associated with the production, but mostly is executed by the network, either through employees or contracted service companies working from directions. As to the Lebowski question, someone would have to track down however many versions exist, and compare. Most lines that are changed for broadcast are specific words, or phrases that are considered inappropriate for the audience in the time slot the film is scheduled. The noted line does not have such value.
