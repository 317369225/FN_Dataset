★What are the main drivers of CPM rates charged by broadcast and cable networks?
Supply and Demand is first and Foremost.  The ratings and subscribers can be there, but if no one is buying it then it's essentially worth nothing.  Second is the rating of the program or time period. "How many people in the total DMA that are watching tv are watching during that time" (Which coincides with demand) and the last would be how large the DMA is.  How many tv households and for cable, what is the cable penetration in the market.
