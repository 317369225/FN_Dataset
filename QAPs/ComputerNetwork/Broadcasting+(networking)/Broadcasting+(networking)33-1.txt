★Does broadcasting different networks cost a cable company different amounts of money?For example, does it cost a cable provider more money to broadcast ESPN vs. NBC because of the amount they have to pay to the network?
In short, yes. ABC/Disney, NBC Universal, Viacom, Time Warner and NewsCorp  control most of the channels you generally think of on cable television. They also have different requirements on what "tier" they can be carried (or where they are carried in relation to other complimentary or competing channels). This is a link to a chart that's now 4 years old and out of date (specifically for the Comcast purchase of NBCUniversal). http://www.neatorama.com/2008/07... As far as NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox networks are concerned, they are carried by local broadcast stations and it's much more complicated. These signals are broadcast over the airwaves for free by the local stations. In general, these local stations are owned by companies like Raycom, Scripps, etc though some local stations are owned by the networks. In most cases, these local stations require the cable companies to pay to carry their signal over the cable network to the home. Remember, they broadcast these signals for free. Cable companies and local stations "negotiate" these fees and sometimes the stations are dropped from the system. This process is called "retransmission consent". These costs are generally passed along to the cable customer increasing their bill. The most recent high visibility example of a channel being dropped from a cable lineup is Time Warner/MSG in New York http://www.multichannel.com/arti...
