★Are the miracles performed by great evangelists like Benny Hinn, pastor Chris, and others on TBN gospel broadcast network proof that God exists? Are these true biblical miracles?
The bad news is that miracles like they perform are found in ALL religions throughout history.  Hindus have more "faith healers" than Christianity. Of course, the Christians say that it is Satan that gives their rivals power. e,g, Sathya Sai Baba If your faith is based upon miracles or predicting the future... it is a very weak foundation.
