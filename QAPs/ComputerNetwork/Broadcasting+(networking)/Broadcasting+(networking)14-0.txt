★Will the broadcast networks eventually be watched by too few people to be profitable?Of course, the American broadcast networks have been losing viewers to cable each and every year.  What I wonder is if they will eventually fail because not enough people are watching them
This year most awarded shows are on cable, not the broadcast networks. At the same time, the networks all own cable stations, so the may only be losing to themselves.
