â˜…What's the exact difference between broadcast networks and cable networks? In terms of business model?
Sorry, but this one is going to be quick n' dirty. Everybody on cable makes the vast majority of their money from subscriber fees. Let's say you pay Comcast $100 a month for cable. They probably keep about $20-$30 of that, and pass the rest on to the channels. ESPN is oft derides, as they get about $5-$6 of the remaining $70. Other channels get anywhere from $2-$0.05 per subscriber per month. I've been told that for CNN, the revenue break down is approx: 70% sub fees, 20% content licensing, 10% ads. Network news only gets revenue from ads, and for the most part, the evening news has never made money. It's always been a loss leader. Morning shows like the Today show are very profitable tho.
