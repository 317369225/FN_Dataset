★How long will it be before a new system such as Netflix or Apple TV makes traditional cable, broadcast networks and Blu-ray distribution obsolete?
Absent their own problems with customer service and that byzintine bureaucracy....I think cable is in some ways rather lean given the lack of need for real estate and a monthly reoccurring revenue stream. But more to the point: 1) As I see it they have at least 3 revenue models (not to mention new packaging with phone, home security, etc...).  So its not like they are calcified on only one way to make money. 2) Sports and sports packages may keep them alive.  I think it will take at least 5 years to break that monopoly.   Also, the price of cable is about the same as the price of internet--and the packaging that occurs.  I think this structure is decently advantageous and the overall way internet service providers work.  * I don't know their numbers.  And the production of new programming isn't exactly cheap--to the extent that they do that.
