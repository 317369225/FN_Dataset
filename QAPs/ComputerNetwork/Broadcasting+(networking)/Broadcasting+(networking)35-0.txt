â˜…How much do U.S. broadcast television networks spend annually in advertising their own shows, and through which platform (TV, Internet, billboard, etc.) do they spend the most? How does this compare to cable network expenditure?
It's impossible to measure in one aspect as they often use their sister companies and while they get a discount, it's really just going from one pocket to another - Comcast owns NBC, USA network, Universal, universal studios, as well as obviously cable systems covering about 22% of the US. CBS used to own the outdoor billboard company, etc , etc ..
