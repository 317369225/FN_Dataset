★How long will it be before a new system such as Netflix or Apple TV makes traditional cable, broadcast networks and Blu-ray distribution obsolete?
Sorry, but this is naive.  I love movies.  I probably go to the theatre and watch more movies on my Apple TV than the average person.  But seriously?  People are going to abandon their half-hour comedies that they fit into their busy schedules between changing diapers and making dinner and the shows they watch with their kids and just watch two hour movies all the time suddenly because Apple tells them to?  No, no they're not. If Apple can't figure out how to integrate traditional TV content into their eco-system without it being incredibly complicated, it won't happen.
