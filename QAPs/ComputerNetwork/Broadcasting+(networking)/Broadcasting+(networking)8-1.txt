â˜…Television Business: In a cable and Internet dominated world, what happens to local affiliates of broadcast networks?Especially the ones that aren't O&O.
Ownership of broadcast TV stations in the US has become increasingly expensive, due to extreme regulation by the FCC, and the switch the HDTV and digital transmission. Unless the FCC significantly lowers fees (not happening), the only way broadcast stations can generally be profitable is if they are part of a large station group, preferentially affiliated with a network. Another option, besides finding ways for the station (or business that owns the station) to make money outside of TV itself, is for stations to go cable only or shut down, and let the FCC auction those stations spectrum for use by mobile phone providers.
