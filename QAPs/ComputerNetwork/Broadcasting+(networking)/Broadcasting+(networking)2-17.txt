â˜…How long will it be before a new system such as Netflix or Apple TV makes traditional cable, broadcast networks and Blu-ray distribution obsolete?
It all depends on what is most cost effective. People prefer "Apple TV" and other services because they're cheaper and offer more variety, but if movie theaters found a way to make their prices more appealing, people would still go- and obviously they do go when the product is worth their while, as box office records are broken nearly every month. However, that can also be attributed to rising ticket costs, not necessarily larger numbers of film goers. People have to look to cheapening the theatrical film experience. That's one thing premium services have in common with theaters. You can choose what you watch, when you watch it and you don't have to pay by the viewing or you pay a rate that is ultimately cheap if you're a heavy user. I think you should look at the theatrical film industry before looking at cable, because you're talking about ad-based revenue (cable/broadcast) vs. subscription based revenue (Apple TV, Netflix, etc.) vs. individual sales revenue (movie theaters). I happen to think that companies like www.dealflicks.com are the real future, because we're never going to stop seeing movies in theaters, but so long as ticket prices inflate, the frequency is going to continue on a downward trend, adding more relevancy to the topic question. That is, unless people find a way to save money on going to the movies, the way people save money on television by subscribing to Netflix or Apple TV (in terms of the volume of content watched for a fixed fee). www.dealflicks.com is the theatrical answer to the questions that Netflix or Apple TV have begun to answer. By saving money on movie tickets, it will increase the volume of customers and keep theatrical releases relevant far into the future, postponing the necessity of definitively answering your question.
