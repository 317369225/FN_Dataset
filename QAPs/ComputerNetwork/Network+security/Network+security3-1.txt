★What's a good online source for learning network security?
Network security is a fairly broad topic. Nowadays, when people talk about "network security", the issues they're most often really concerned with are web-based security vulnerabilities. A great online source of information and resources regarding web-based security vulnerabilities is the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) site.  OWASP an international, non-profit organization whose goal is to improve software security across the globe. A colleague of mine also recently published a blog article on the 10 Most Common Web Security Vulnerabilities (based on OWASP's "top 10" list) that is also well worth reading.    Embed Quote
