Don't forget to check out LinkedIn! You can search for people by company, or by position. Follow companies that employ people whose jobs you'd like, and immerse yourself in the community. You may even be able to reach out to someone who has your ultimate job and do an informational interview with them, or shadow them for a day. Smaller companies, like RJS Smart Security (http://www.rjssmartsecurity.com/) could be a good place to start in terms of getting guidance from professionals. Those at large companies may be harder to reach.    Embed Quote
