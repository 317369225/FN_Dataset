★Research topics: What are the hot research topics in network security?I am currently doing my masters in computer networks and wanted to know what research topics I can work on in network security? Also what are the trends?
You could do research, why security-awareness gets more and more uninteresting and why the personal convenience and self-presentation leads to massive dataleakage and the loss of the last (small) privacy that has been left by now. You could search for an answer, why so many reported security breaks of modern devices (like smartphones and tablets) apparently are without impact to the awareness and behavior of these people.   It's almost like using drugs. Any of them knows about the risks of getting ill and die sooner than they need to, but they do it and wonder occasionally, that they are getting ill and dying sooner. The people using modern communication platforms and telling anyone anything about themself without restriction (and the technology tells the rest e.g. gps-signal, pictures on the device or possibility to take pictures unnoticed, cookies, biometric profiles, search requests,...) wonder occasionally, that they are getting spam mails, the advertising in websites is personalized, burglars know when they are away from home or who their childrens are and where they are, ... in short, that unknown people know everything about you and even your character.    Embed Quote
