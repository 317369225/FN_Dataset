★What's the difference between network security and content security?Furthermore, how do different components of enterprise security fit in? I'm confused about branches such as application security, endpoint security, cloud security, mobile security, and wireless security. Any help would be greatly appreciated, and I am not an expert by any means (so please answer as if you're talking to a 5 year old). Thanks!
Network security is typically handled by a network administrator or system administrator who implements the security policy, network software and hardware needed to protect a network and the resources accessed through the network from unauthorized access and also ensure that employees have adequate access to the network and resources to work. Content Security means different things to different organizations. For enterprises, it's often about confidentiality and legal concerns. For the media and publishers, it's about making sure content - or intellectual property - isn't stolen or illegally reproduced.When digital files or text can be transferred with the click of a button, or posted on a new site with a simple copy and paste, age old concerns about copyright go into overdrive. Content security has come a long way since the first days of Napster, when college kids started trading music files like baseball cards. For more information please visit cyberoam.com    Embed Quote
