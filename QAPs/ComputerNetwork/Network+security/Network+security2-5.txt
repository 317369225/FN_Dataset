★What is the best way to learn network security concepts?
Order a book on Flipkart.. There's a book named 'Network security and cryptography'.. I purchased this book and was able to learn several networking concepts.. This book also comes with knowledge of cryptography so isn't it like a 2in1 package?? :)    Embed Quote
