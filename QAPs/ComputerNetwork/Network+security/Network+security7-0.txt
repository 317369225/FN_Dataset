★Network Security: How can i crack a wifi?
There are 3 types of Wi-Fi security methods that you would find deployed commonly: 1. WEP 2. WPA2-Personal 3. WPA2-Enterprise (You aren't probably interested in this!) WEP Wi-fi security has been long broken and tools like  @Aircrack-ng can break a WEP password within minutes. WPA2-Personal (that is most commonly used in home devices nowadays) is more secure, and I am aware of only a @Dictionary attack  on it, again using aircrack. Of course, if you have a lot of computing power to throw at WPA2-Personal, you can probably still crack it assuming your dictionary "has" the password that is being used.    Embed Quote
