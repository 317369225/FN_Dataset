★What is the definition of "Network Security"?
Lots of ways to define it, here are some of the core principles (but not all of which apply to all kinds of security implementations at all time depending on what level of security is needed) 1) Confidentiality: What you and your peer communicate must remain confidential 2) Integrity: The communication must remain unaltered (or be verifiable) 3) Authenticity: Peer identity should be verifiable by all or some peers (more often its just one way). Of course there are may ways to implement such security, some involve explicit cooperation/trust of the path (like the hardware involved) some rely on encryption by assuming that the intermediate path is untrusted. There are others which are more advanced or a combination of the above. Some even involve third parties to verify trust on their behalf. These get more technical and require more explanation.    Embed Quote
