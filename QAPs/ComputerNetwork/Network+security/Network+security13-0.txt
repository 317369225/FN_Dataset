★What are the hottest research topics in network security?
Thanks for the A2A. In my opinion, best way to get 'latest/hottest research topics' in this field is to look up at the programs of top 2 - 3 conferences. Courtesy the competitive nature, they usually have the latest and the greatest of industry/academia research. In general, some of the trending topics are : - Pervasive security / Security of internet enabled host devices. With Nest thermostats, Tesla cars and Microsoft's Hololens - Internet of Things (IoT) seems to be geared up for a good run. IPv6 protocols add another dimension to the problem space. - Privacy compliance in big data / distributed / cloud systems. With more and more enterprises uploading sensitive data across data centers, ensuring privacy and integrity (traditionally resource intensive) for huge amount of data is a bottleneck. - Anonymous traffic networks . Recent NSA stings have brought the focus back on possibilities of  packets being tampered with. Networks like ToR are being prototyped to prevent tampering. - Software Defined Networking ( SDN ) vulnerabilities. SDN world has to deal with control plane attacks which try to DoS the central control systems and data plane attacks which are similar to traditional network protocol attacks. For a more wholesome picture of the research scenario, I have listed below some of the top notch conference programs of 2014. 1. IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2014 2. ACM CCS 2014 3. USENIX 2014 Technical Sessions 4. IEEE NCA Page on ieee-nca.org Hope this gives you a starting point and an overview of the research directions !    Embed Quote
