★As someone without a computer science degree...how do I become a network security specialist?What route/ jobs/ qualifications are needed to start a career in network security and eventually progress to a security specialist role?
My opinion is that the level of output increases your position in the security industry. Obviously a degree helps to increase your worth but without one I would imagine having to start at the bottom and work you way up however in security you have a direct impact that is quite visible. Since technology and security is always changing I would focus on the frontier so that you are one step ahead of anyone with a computer science degree who may not keep up to date with current security. After all if you are able to prevent data breaches and fraudulent activity through a means that is not traditional you will show plenty of worth to any business.    Embed Quote
