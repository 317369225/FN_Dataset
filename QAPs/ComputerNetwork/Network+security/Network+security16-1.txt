★What's the difference between network security and content security?Furthermore, how do different components of enterprise security fit in? I'm confused about branches such as application security, endpoint security, cloud security, mobile security, and wireless security. Any help would be greatly appreciated, and I am not an expert by any means (so please answer as if you're talking to a 5 year old). Thanks!
network security is concerned with making sure there isn't any unauthorized traffic flowing through the network and that there isn't anyone abusing or gaining illegitimate access to network resources. content security is concerned with making sure that content (such as the stuff in a database or website content {which in turn often comes out of a database}) is not accessed illegitimately or modified maliciously (such as inserting malicious data that exploits users of the content). application security is concerned with eliminating software vulnerabilities at the design and implementation stage. this requires the programmers who make the software to be aware of problems that can lead to security vulnerabilities and know how to avoid them. endpoint security is concerned with keeping malicious software/users off of your computer(s). this is where things like anti-virus software, white-listing software, etc. come into play. cloud security is concerned with keeping cloud-based services secure, so that they remain available and any data within them doesn't get leaked or corrupted. mobile security can overlap quite a bit with endpoint security (since mobile devices are a kind of endpoint) but also involves concepts such as remotely locking or wiping lost mobile devices. wireless security is concerned with keeping wireless communications (frequently wifi) secure, so that attackers can't read or modify the traffic being broadcast over the airways, and can't access the resources that respond to that wireless traffic.    Embed Quote
