★What makes the Bitcoin network secure?
The real reason that makes Bitcoin secure is that participants in the mining process have to spend real world resources in order to secure the network. The resources they spend is electricity and the electricity that is spent cannot be recovered. It is only exchanged for "tokens on the Bitcoin network". Miners have to do some sort of arbitrage : either they mine Bitcoin through its proof of work system (and spend, and lose the value of, some electricity), or they mine another altcoin and expect that this coin somehow gets to supplant Bitcoin in value. All of those who tried have failed. The security of the Bitcoin network is measured by its hashrate (number of calculations per second), which is directly related to the energy spent to secure it. If you look at this page you will notice that the hashrate that has been added to the network since the beginning of the year is more than twice the total hashrate that was available only one year ago. And that the total hashrate that is available today is more than 30 times the one that was available one year ago. The proof of work system is what makes Bitcoin so secure : not only someone who would like to attack Bitcoin would have to buy expensive dedicated (ASIC) systems, but he would also have to spend so much electricity that he would better surrender and just buy Bitcoins instead. It is difficult to understand why Bitcoin is so powerful and the alternative are so weak, but basically it can be summarized by "There can only be one Blockchain, and so far this Blockchain is Bitcoin".    Embed Quote
