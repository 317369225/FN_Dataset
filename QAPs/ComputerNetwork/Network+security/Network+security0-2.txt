★Network Security: What is PGP?please explain me in simple terms that what the PGP is? and how it works? Thanks!
PGP stands for "Pretty Good Privacy". PGP can be used to send messages confidentially. For this, PGP combines symmetric-key encryption and public-key encryption. The  message is encrypted using a symmetric encryption algorithm, which  requires a symmetric key.    Embed Quote
