★What is the best way to learn network security concepts?
Learning by doing is the only way to go. I'm not completely sure I understand exactly what you mean by "learn network security concepts", but if you really do mean concepts then implementing them in practice is the only way to go. Take a security practice like "Security in depth". The only war to really get to grips with all the elements, problems and dilemmas is to successfully implementing it in a large corporate network and working with it thereafter. I really don't like the word concepts used in connection with security because of the theoretical character of the term. Lots of people are big on concepts. I am bit on real security. Real security is not implementation of concepts. Real security is not getting compromised    Embed Quote
