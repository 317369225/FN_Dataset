★What's the difference between network security and content security?Furthermore, how do different components of enterprise security fit in? I'm confused about branches such as application security, endpoint security, cloud security, mobile security, and wireless security. Any help would be greatly appreciated, and I am not an expert by any means (so please answer as if you're talking to a 5 year old). Thanks!
Network Security controls access to content. Content Security controls what you do with that content.    Embed Quote
