★What's the difference between network security and content security?Furthermore, how do different components of enterprise security fit in? I'm confused about branches such as application security, endpoint security, cloud security, mobile security, and wireless security. Any help would be greatly appreciated, and I am not an expert by any means (so please answer as if you're talking to a 5 year old). Thanks!
Content security refers to protecting your content. If an unsecured content leaves your secured network, that document is now unprotected. With a content security tool such as Protectedpdf http://www.vitrium.com, you can be sure that the content remains safe even if it leaves your secured network.    Embed Quote
