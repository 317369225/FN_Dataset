How do two computers with the same IP from different networks communicate with each other? How does the routing work?To get into more details, let¡¯s first discuss private and public networks.

IP addresses from private networks are not routable from Internet while Public IP addresses are.

Some ranges of IP addresses are reserved for private networks and rest of the IP address ranges are allocated to ISPs, Corporations etc.. as public IP addresses. (Excluding a few more reserved IP address spaces)
