When a MAC address itself is unique, why do we still need an IP address to uniquely identify a system on a network?MAC is L2, IP is L3.  You must have a unique address for both in the domain for both.  MAC doesn't need to be globally unique, just un-repeated for a single collision domain.  There have been manufacturers who were too cheap to buy enough MACs, and did MAC re-use.  The expected that the chance two cards would end up on the same network would be so small such that they'd get away with it.
