When a MAC address itself is unique, why do we still need an IP address to uniquely identify a system on a network?In large networks there is a need to keep things organized.  MAC addresses are impractical.

The IP infrastructure is organized in same way that the telephone network is organized. In telephone networks your "number" is divided into a country code, areas code, local exchange and, finally, your number. IP networks are organized in a similar fashion [Formally, the address is divided into "subnets" (sub-networks) where each subnet can be further divided, at any location, into other subnets ... like a tree branching]
