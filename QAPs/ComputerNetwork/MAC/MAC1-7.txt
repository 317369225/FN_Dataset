When a MAC address itself is unique, why do we still need an IP address to uniquely identify a system on a network?It is not possible to route a MAC address since it works on a layer above Ethernet. To understand why IP addressing is used in a computer network or over the internet you need to understand how IP routing works.

Basic IP Routing: When your computer (PC1) wants to send a packet to some IP address like x.x.x.x, then the first check is if the destination address is in the same IP network as the PC1 itself. If x.x.x.x is in the same network, then the destination IP can be reached directly, otherwise the packet needs to be sent to the route configured on PC1 and if a route for the destination network / host is not configured explicitly, the packet is routed to the default gateway configured on PC1. Well that was about how IP routing works at a very high-level. Routers also use dynamic routing protocols and algorithms to find the best possible path.

MAC addresses: Once the packet has reached the local network of the destination computer, the communication happens over the Ethernet which is the data link layer. This is where MAC addresses are used to communicate. The sender (which in this case could be a router or the source computer PC1 if it was in the same network) needs to get the MAC address of the destination computer. There is a special protocol ARP (address resolution protocol) that is used for that. Once the sender has retrieved the MAC address of the next hop, he sends the data. Before sending the data packet over the Ethernet, is is divided into shorter pieces called frames.
