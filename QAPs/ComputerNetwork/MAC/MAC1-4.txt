When a MAC address itself is unique, why do we still need an IP address to uniquely identify a system on a network?MAC addresses come pre defined with the equipment you buy, be it computers, access points, routers, etc. They end up randomly distributed at various points in the network. They need to be discovered and learnt. Much like you learn about the roads, intersections, and landmarks when you move to a new city.
