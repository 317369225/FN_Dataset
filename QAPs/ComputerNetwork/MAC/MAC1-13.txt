When a MAC address itself is unique, why do we still need an IP address to uniquely identify a system on a network?An alternate analogy would be as follows:  A MAC Address is like a car's VIN (Vehicle Identification Number).  It does uniquely point to a vehicle on the road, pretty much around the world.  However, each state has their own License Plate Issuing policy.  The State License Plate is like IP Addressing schemes.  If all cars are sold only in one state, there is no need for two different schemes, VIN vs. License Plate.  But, because, the vehicle moves across states, and could carry multiple license plates (i.e., authorized by two different states), it is better to leave out the VIN Number out of the game.
