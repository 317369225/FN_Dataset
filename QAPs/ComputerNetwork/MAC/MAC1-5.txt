When a MAC address itself is unique, why do we still need an IP address to uniquely identify a system on a network?MAC address is the basis on which communication occurs. However we need IP  address to be able to create a routing table ,that enables faster  commnication. Lots of communication algorithms take use of IP address ( Network address +SubNet masks) to be able to route packages faster.
