When a MAC address itself is unique, why do we still need an IP address to uniquely identify a system on a network?Simply, MAC address are not routeable.  The beauty of IP networks is that you can attach any device regardless of its manufacture and type to a network and control the size of the network.  Talking to other networks utilizes gateways and routing protocols that allow IP addressed based networks to transmit packets of information to routers that contain specific information about the networks they are attached to.  For MAC addresses to do the kind of things IP networks do they would have to broadcast the packets for every attached device in the "world" in hopes that it will make it, meantime other MAC addressed devices would have to be listening for its named to be called. You can quickly imagine how horrible that would become, so it is basically impractical.  IP networks can quickly figure out if the a device is on its network and if not send the packet to other devices (routers or switches) that can forward it on to still other devices to get to the network the packet is looking for.  Run the trace route utility from your attached computer and find out how many hops it takes to get to your computer, for example, to one in a far off land's computer.  You will find it will take only a few hops, no doubt less than the 30 hops it takes to time out, to go from your computer to it.  Fortunately for us God (Vint Cerf?) created higher level protocols (see the OSI model) that allow for more intelligent ways of communicating between connected devices.
