When a MAC address itself is unique, why do we still need an IP address to uniquely identify a system on a network?MAC address works in Layer 2 (not considering VLAN/Layer 3 switching).

IP address works in Layer 3. IP is required to connect to the network. It tells the server in which network the client is.
