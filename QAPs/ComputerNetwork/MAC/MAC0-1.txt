How do I conect other computer in local network by Mac address?Layer 2 switches send traffic in the local network based on Mac address. Typically if local hosts are communicating, the Mac addresses for the source and destination are those of the network interface cards in the hosts. When a packet is received on a port and the destination Mac address is in the switch¡¯s Mac address table the packet is sent on the associated port. If the destination Mac address is not in the local table, the packet is flooded to all ports except for the receiving port. There is a lot more to it, including consultation of arp table and handling of switch default gateway, but your question implies both source and destination Mac address are in the local network, so no need to discuss those things.
