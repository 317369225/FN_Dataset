â˜…How much bandwidth does youtube use?
From Youtube's own statistics page: - Over 6 billion hours of video are watched each month on YouTube - 100 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute (about 4.3 million hours per month) a 1080p H.264 youtube coded video is about 2.5GB per hour. 6 billion * 2.5GB = 15 billion GB = 15000 PetaBytes of upload per month (also about 347000 GB per minute) 4.3 million * 2.5 GB = 10.75 million GB = 10.75 PetaBytes of download per month (also about 250 GB per minute) I'm not even taking into account that this data has to travel the world sometimes and servers need to connect with each other and transfer data to each other. It would increase the numbers significantly. Hope this has been helpful.
