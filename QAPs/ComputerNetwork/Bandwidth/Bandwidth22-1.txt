â˜…Which ISP offers the highest bandwidth and lowest latency in Palo Alto?Are there any options besides Comcast and ATT?
According to Ookla's Net Index, Sonic.net ranks the fastest in Palo Alto, with Comcast a close 2nd. A mild caution however, that the testing methodology is somewhat questionable. Source: Net Index For historical reasons I use Comcast and am a generally a happy camper, however they do throttle the connection. You can determine this by using ShaperProbe a tool that is part of the Measurement Lab.
