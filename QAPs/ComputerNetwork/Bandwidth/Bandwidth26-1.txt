★What is the total input and output bandwidth of the human brain?
Most of the information is compressed however. It's highly redundant. The human brain decomposes sensory inputs over an over-complete basis set. The basis set is learned and is based upon sensory inputs. Sound tends to be processed using a wavelet-like basis set and visual inputs are decomposed over "Gabor functions", which are the product of a sin wave (a "trigonometric polynomial") and a Gaussian function. You can actually rewire the nervous system in frogs so that their audio system ... [insert something here] From the weighting coefficients on the over-complete basis set decomposition of a sensory inputs you can reconstruct the sensory input with a very small mean squared error.  The reconstruction accuracy was "98%", based upon some metric based upon mean-squared error between the sensory input and the reconstructed input from the basis set. Therefore any estimate of sensory input bandwidth is probably an over estimate by a factor of 50 to several hundred times. The human brain is processing the compressed, decomposed and processed sensory inputs rather than the raw inputs.
