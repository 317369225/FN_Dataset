â˜…Why is YouTube's bandwidth bill zero?http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2...
This is not something new, as Wired article linked in the question seems to imply. Big providers and CDNs have specific terms and conditions for interconnection that involve little or no cost for direct settlement of traffic. It's a matter of network optimization which lies at the core of the Internet and allowed its costs to be substantially lower than any other network in the world. A little bit of logic helps to explain. Small ISPs pay to bigger ISPs to have their traffic routed all around the world. This is called "transit" and is the most popular arrangement for interconnection between ISPs. Small (local) ISPs pay transit to bigger regional ones, which in turn pay transit to national backbones, and so on. However, as you go up, who would the bigger ISPs connect to for transit? The answer is simple: instead of paying for someone even bigger, they interconnect between themselves, using what is known as a "peering" agreement. Let's assume that you are one of the biggest ISPs in the world. You would like to sell transit to YouTube, but a competitor already did. Now your competitor has much more traffic than you have, and he wants to start to charge you for this traffic. It's easier and more efficient for you to connect to YouTube for free than paying someone else to do it for you. At this point YouTube has so much traffic, and Google as so much fiber, that they are able to negotiate such deals and interconnect with any ISP in the world. In fact, most of them are dying to connect freely to YouTube, because it means saving a lot of money. That's good for everyone involved: ISPs, Google/YouTube, and the user, who gets better performance for a lower price.
