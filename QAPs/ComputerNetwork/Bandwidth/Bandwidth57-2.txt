★Mobile Broadband: How long will it be until cellular bandwidth/speed will be suitable substitute for cable Internet?
As people have said: 'it depends on what you mean' There are many places where people are using wireless broadband instead of fixed internet. Perhaps because there is very little fixed internet, or it is very expensive, perhaps because they just like the convenience and wireless is 'good enough'.  I believe in Austria about 50% of broadband is wireless broadband, nad the %age will be higher in developing counties. However, wired networks are inherently faster than wireless ones ('copper is a better conductor than air') and fibre networks are even faster. Yes, wireless is getting faster - but so is wired technology. There is 'Edhom's Law' (one of those join the dots technology laws) which trends data rates wireless / copper / fibre. The three lines are roughly parallel (ie wireless gets faster but never catches up).
