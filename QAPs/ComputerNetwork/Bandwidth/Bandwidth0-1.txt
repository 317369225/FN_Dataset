★What is bandwidth?I don't understand the way signal is transmitted on a wire or a transmission line. How is it related to the frequency of the signal?  What limits the bandwidth? I am real confused. What kind of physic lectures do I miss？
There are several ways in which the word "bandwidth" may be used. From Wikipedia: Bandwidth has several related meanings: Bandwidth (signal processing) or analog bandwidth, frequency bandwidth or radio bandwidth: a measure of the width of a range of frequencies, measured in hertz Bandwidth (computing), the rate of data transfer, bit rate or throughput, measured in bits per second (bit/s) Spectral linewidth: the width of an atomic or molecular spectral line, measured in hertz Bandwidth can also refer to: Bandwidth (linear algebra), the width of the non-zero terms around the diagonal of a matrix In statistics kernel density estimation, "bandwidth" describes the width of the convolution kernel used A normative expected range of linguistic behavior in language expectancy theory In business jargon, the resources needed to complete a task or project Bandwidth (radio program): A Canadian radio program Graph bandwidth, in graph theory
