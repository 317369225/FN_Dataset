â˜…Mobile Broadband: How long will it be until cellular bandwidth/speed will be suitable substitute for cable Internet?
In terms of speeds offered, potentially (a big if) yes. In terms of pricing, never. For reasons that have already been well covered. Spectrum is a scarce resource and there is very little to change that. My guess is 'true' mobile plans will be data and/or bandwidth capped, while there is going to be a conscious push towards nomadic access.
