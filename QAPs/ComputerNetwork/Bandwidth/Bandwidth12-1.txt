â˜…What is a good bandwidth monitor for routers?I am looking for a free utility to monitor bandwidth with Shaw internet. My cap is at 100gb per month and do not want to go over the limit.
DD-WRT is quite popular. You need a compatible router and install this firmware to monitor your bandwidth. http://www.dd-wrt.com/
