★Does YouTube pay for upload bandwidth?What are YouTube's upload bandwidth costs?
As we know, Google attempts to hide their information. But according to a 2009 Article on Slate.com about "The High Costs of Running Youtube": To serve up all these streams, the company has to pay for a broadband connection capable of hurtling data at the equivalent of 30 million megabits-per-second—about 6 million times as fast as your home Internet connection. All this bandwidth costs Google $360 million a year, the analysts estimate.(This is in reference to a Credit Suisse estimate that 375 million people around the world will play about 75 billion YouTube videos in 2009.)
