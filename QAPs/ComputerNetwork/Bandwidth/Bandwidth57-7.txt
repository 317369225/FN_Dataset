â˜…Mobile Broadband: How long will it be until cellular bandwidth/speed will be suitable substitute for cable Internet?
Telcos and their customers are facing growing concerns about the health impact of radio waves, which leads them to reduce the Wifi power of their home gateways, even switch it off at night, to be very careful when installing new mobile antennas in high density areas, and to use a micro kit with their phone instead of sticking it to their ear for hours. This fear already pushes waveless technology like powerline anywhere it is possible. In the coming years cellular technology will become faster than today's cable broadband, however several reasons will prevent it to become a substitute for fixed-line (rather than cable which will be replaced by FTTH): Fear of radio waves will make customers prefer fixed-line connectivity whenever it is available Fixed-line technology, especially with optical fiber, will be far less prone to interferences than mobile Speed on fixed-line access will become much higher than today (latest GPON norms allow 9Gbps downstream and 2Gbps upstream), leading to usage that will not be possible on a single 100Mbps cellular link shared with your neighbours Ten years ago you thought 56k Internet was the 'information highway', now your GPRS mobile with the same speed makes you upset. In ten years from now you will pest on your 100Mbps 6G mobile and only use it when mobility is required.
