â˜…Mobile Broadband: How long will it be until cellular bandwidth/speed will be suitable substitute for cable Internet?
Never. The speeds & more importantly capacities are generally diverging, especially in markets with fibre or very fast cable/DSL variants. There are hard physical limits. Unless you use femtocells, the aggregate real-world throughput from all realistic frequency bands used for mobile, using a realistic grid of cell-sites, works out at roughly 1-5GB/s TOTAL per sq km in an urban area, in aggregate, across all users. In other words, the MAXIMUM that all macro-cellular operators can offer equates to about one fibre per sq km. With clever use of beam-steering that might be increased. And even if you densify the network with femtos or other smaller cells, you still need fixed connections to backhaul them. And if you put in one fibre to a cell-site for everyone's shared mobile usage.... what do you think the other 99 in the duct will be used for?
