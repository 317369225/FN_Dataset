â˜…Does YouTube pay for upload bandwidth?What are YouTube's upload bandwidth costs?
Yes, it probably does. The cost can be ridiculously low compared to other companies' bandwidth bill. Google datacenters are connected to the biggest internet exchanges(1)(2) in the world such as AMS-IX, LINX, and MSK-IX. Internet exchanges are the cheapest options in order to connect to the internet. Connecting to an internet exchange is much more cheaper than buying IP transit(3). For instance, if you want to buy IP transit from a company, the best price you can get for 100 Gbps is approximately $40.000 a month but you can get the same connection for $6000-8000 from an internet exchange, but as far as you can see, you can't connect to an internet exchange if you aren't big enough to "exchange".
