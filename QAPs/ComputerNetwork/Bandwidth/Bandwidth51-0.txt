★What's the approximate bandwidth of face-to-face interaction?To put it another way, what's the bandwidth equivalent of a single person's consumption of stimuli?
Some data points (as far as I am aware):  * Upper-level consciousness runs at approximately 128 bits per second, some people with an accelerated psychomotor might get to 200 bits per second equivalent.   * The human eye takes in about 500-700 megapixels of data/resolution, however it captures more things than just the pixels.  * This information decays VERY rapidly, like 99% gone after 3 seconds, obviously it gets "simplified".  * Other senses operate in very different ways but seem to have lower bandwidth. I would personally estimate all of it to be at about "1000 megapixels per second" equivalent with extremely fast decay and simplification.
