â˜…Mobile Broadband: How long will it be until cellular bandwidth/speed will be suitable substitute for cable Internet?
Cable Internet provides a low loss, low interference link between the consumer and the provider. This cable has a bandwidth capability of around 1GHz. Much of that frequency spectrum is used by broadcast but it is possible for more than half to be available for internet access. DOCSIS 3.1 allows for up to 10Gbit/sec downstream and 1Gbit/sec upstream (in theory). In comparison a mobile base station probably only has a few MHz that it can share between thousands or tens of thousands of subscribers. LTE Advance provides up to 1Gbit/sec of bandwidth (in theory) but that is still subject to the fact that it must be shared and is subject to interference. So 4G provides high speed broadband equivalent to DSL or basic cable internet already, but the contention between subscribers for bandwidth is much more of an issue in maintaining quality of service. In terms of an arms race cable TV will always win when it comes to raw bandwidth because it has far more bandwidth available to it than mobile broadband could ever have. It can also provide that bandwidth with less contention, less interference and more dense spectrum usage. People always want wireless to win because of the convenience, and wireless will become more convenient, but our desire to match performance between landlines and mobile is physically impossible. So the expectations of users to have the same facilities available on both networks will never be met.
