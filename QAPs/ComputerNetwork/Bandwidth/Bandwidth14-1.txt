â˜…What are the best ways to monetize excess bandwidth capacity?When a company owns much (upstream and downstream) capacity are there ways to resell excess capacity to companies that need either. Any brokers or wholesale platforms?
The best way to monetize excess bandwidth is not to buy excess bandwidth. If you are stuck with a long-term contract with your ISP and can't work with them to change it, you may consider launching your own IaaS cloud. Since your excess bandwidth is tied to your location(s) and is non-transferrable, you won't be able to easily resell your bandwidth without your own IaaS cloud, which is essentially a way for other people's workloads to get into your infrastructure to be able to consume your excess bandwidth.
