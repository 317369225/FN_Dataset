â˜…What is the bandwidth of a biological neural system?For example, what is the maximum information flow rate along the spinal cord, or from one part of the brain to another (say across the corpus callosum). It would be interesting to hear both the theoretical maximum and whats more likely in practice (e.g. assuming some redundancies, unused pathways, etc).
One way to look at this recognizes that nerve transmission is by pulse train using pulse frequency modulation (PFM). Here is an example chart record. McKay & McCulloch (1952) pg 130 top (Page on weizmann.ac.il) reported short bursts up to 500 pps and sustained transmission up to 250 pps. the authors go on to discuss the implied channel capacity in their following pages. Multiply this by the number of nerve fibers in the spinal cord (insert your search here) and you will get an upper bound. However it seems unlikely to be a useful number. If all fibers in your spinal cord were firing at maximum rate (imagine a burn victim with a large skin area affected) your brain would be overloaded by it. And in spite of the temptation presented by the pulse train mode of the nerves, they are communicating a magnitude by the PFM, not digital information in the sense applied to digital computers or communication links. There is more recent work on this but the 1952 reference helps put it in historical perspective. Dean Wooldridge (the W in TRW) of CalTech was a pioneer in this area.
