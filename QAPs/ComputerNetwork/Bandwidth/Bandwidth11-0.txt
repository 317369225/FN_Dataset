★What is the usual bandwidth for a video conference?
please see: http://vsee.com/skype and http://vsee.com/vidyo which system you use has a huge difference, modern systems such as VSee, Vidyo, Zoom, Skype, etc, all are a lot more efficient than systems from the previous generations such as Cisco, Jabber, IBM Sametime, etc.  Cisco has very high quality, but assume the network is engineered, and can handle the high bandwidth, thus they optimize for the best video quality, thus require a lot more. VSee, Vidyo, etc assume the network is a black box, thus we have to do the best we can.  A typical vsee call over 3G requires 100-200 Kbps.
