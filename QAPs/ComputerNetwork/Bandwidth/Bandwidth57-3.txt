★Mobile Broadband: How long will it be until cellular bandwidth/speed will be suitable substitute for cable Internet?
It really depends on what "suitable substitute" means to you.  Wireless always seems to be a 1-3 years away from offering speeds comparable to what wireline (cable or DSL) can provide today.  Thus, if you consider 6Mbs to be suitable today, then expect speeds like that from wireless in a couple years.  However, by then, 6Mbs may not seem suitable for you any longer.  I believe that Wireless will always be behind the curve of what home users expect.  However, I see a second market forming for mobile wireless connectivity that you use on portable devices when not at home.  Wireline and Wireless broadband are going to become, in my opinion, apples and oranges.
