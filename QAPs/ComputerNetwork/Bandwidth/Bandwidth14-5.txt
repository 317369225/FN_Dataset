★What are the best ways to monetize excess bandwidth capacity?When a company owns much (upstream and downstream) capacity are there ways to resell excess capacity to companies that need either. Any brokers or wholesale platforms?
Yes, there are brokers. You can find one such company in Boston called NEF that deals with bandwidth in high cap situations. They have an Asset Marketplace where excess capacity and/or whole networks can be monetized or sold outright.  See http://www.NEFiber.com/services-....
