â˜…What is the bandwidth policy in china?If someone wants to access any server outside of China it's really slow. This is because the Chinese govt. has a strange bandwidth policy. They allocate lesser bandwidth if someone wants to access anything outside China. I am curious about the figures. The amount of bandwidth they allocate to servers located within and outside China.
Your description is not true. The said bandwidth policy is in fact not a policy but a feature of the technology, ADSL, or Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line, which is widely used in China. The bandwidth is greater toward the downstream than the upstream, with the ratio is perhaps 4 to 1. It means if you can download at a speed of 200 kilobytes per second, a speed of only 50 kilobytes per second is allowed for uploading. In fact there is no limit of bandwidth for visiting servers within or outside China. The reasons why you feel it's very slow when visit servers outside are versatile. It might be network traffic jam, DNS lookup failure, or simply that your connection is continuously interrupted by the Great Firewall of China. When Youtube was still reachable in China, I could watch Youtube videos without much buffering. And even now Gmail service is fast in China, though not that reliable because of unexpected interruptions.
