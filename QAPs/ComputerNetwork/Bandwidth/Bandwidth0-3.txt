★What is bandwidth?I don't understand the way signal is transmitted on a wire or a transmission line. How is it related to the frequency of the signal?  What limits the bandwidth? I am real confused. What kind of physic lectures do I miss？
An arbitrary signal can be described as a combination of sine waves, for which the concept of frequency is well-defined. One such representation is given by the Fourier transform. The bandwidth for a signal is generally defined as the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies that occur in a signal with non-zero amplitude, or that are of interest. The bandwidth of a transmission line is the largest bandwidth of a signal that can be transmitted on it. It is limited by physical characteristics, beyond which there is significant distortion such as loss of amplitude at high frequencies. When talking about communication channels generally, such as radio waves propagating through the same medium, one has to consider signals are often modulated. This is done to send multiple signals at once without interference or to take advantages of better propagation characteristics at higher frequencies. Modulation involves shifting a signal's components before transmitting it. If you have multiple such signals, you separate them into bands of finite width. That's another possible source of bandwidth limits, because exceeding the bandwidth results in interference of signals.
