★What is bandwidth?I don't understand the way signal is transmitted on a wire or a transmission line. How is it related to the frequency of the signal?  What limits the bandwidth? I am real confused. What kind of physic lectures do I miss？
Band Width is the "Range of frequencies" over which the strength of the signal is almost constant. The signal may suffer/ not suffer attenuation depending on the Bandwidth of the channel. The band-with depends on the type of the cable, its construction, mechanism of its physical structure, capacitive /inductive effects and so on.
