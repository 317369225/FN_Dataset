★Why is there a shortage of Internet bandwidth in India?
Being an Indian, i would say - 1) Lack of reliable, robust infrastructure outside few major cities.(Like Electricity, fiber optic networks etc). Even in some tier 1 cities the telecom operators provide the backbone network only and rely on the local cable operators for the last mile connectivity. The unprofessional local operators with their unreliable network leads to unsatisfactory service to the end user. 2) Government with their flip-flop policies. At least 3 policies have been formulated in last 10-12 years, with no coherence among them. A universal fund was created by mandatorily collecting a percentage of revenues from Telco's to fund the rural  telecom/broadband infrastructure. But the fund is still lying largely unused with a shoddy execution record. 3) Lack of e-literacy in major parts of the country. Where there is no demand - there is no service. Many Indians were introduced to the mobile first and then latter into a diluted internet experience through EDGE/GPRS. 3G is yet to catch up and 4G network is almost nonexistent even after 2 and half years of the auction of airwaves. 256 kbps and above is defined a broadband by the government! Even in major cities like Bangalore, you can get a 2Mbps connection depending on where you stay. Smallest towns in United States get a descent 23Mbps plans. 4) Lack of competition: Prices have not reduced much in last 10 years or so, which prevents adoption. In a country where average revenue per user for 2G connection per month is around Rs 80 (Roughly $1.5), a decent broadband plan costs about Rs 500 plus taxes (Around $10).. The least priced unlimited broadband plan from the state owned MTNL costs Rs 725 every month. A least priced unlimited plan would cost $25 to $40 in United States with speeds ranging 15Mbps to 23Mbps speeds.
