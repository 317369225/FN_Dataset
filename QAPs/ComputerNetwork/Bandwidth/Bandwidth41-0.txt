â˜…How are download managers that consume the entire bandwidth, like IDM, created?which will not leaving anything else to other programs I would like to know algorithm or anything behind it which will help me create such apps. I have created download manager but my download manager doesn't consume all bandwidth.
Hi, I haven't tried out below suggestions but these are my assumptions that might work. Try to connect to the download URL using multiple connections Before downloading check for the possibility of download mirrors to the same file. If there are any choose the one with best minimum download latency.
