â˜…Which hosting providers offer affordable unmetered bandwidth for dedicated servers?Rackspace does not provide unmetered bandwidth for dedicated servers.

Take a look at Amanah: Dedicated Servers & Hosting Toronto, Canada, 151 Front Street. I think they might work for you - they were the first host in Canada to offer 100 TB dedicated servers.
