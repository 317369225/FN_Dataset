★How is bandwidth calculated for a web application?
Your bandwidth is how much data is going in and out of the server each month. Most hosting providers only make you pay for outgoing bandwidth. Amazon does make you pay for incoming bandwidth, but Rackspace does not.   To calculate your bandwidth, you'll need to know how big the average response to a request is. So, if you respond to each request on average with a 100KB page, your bandwidth will be 10GB, given your 100000 monthly hits. Caching and otherwise lessening the size of the pages you are responding with will decrease your bandwidth further.   As for cost, simply use one of the cost calculators that Heruku, Rackspace, Amazon and/or Google provides and use the figure of 10GB per month. You shouldn't be expecting anything more than US$100 a month.
