â˜…What is the maximum potential Internet connection bandwidth?Is fiber optic the best technology to get there?
That upper limit is constantly being challenged and changed, but yes, fiber is the best technology to get there. Currently, 100G is already widely deployed via optical fibers, just not very commonly for the Last mile, especially for residential customers. Why not? It's the most expensive part of the network to upgrade to fiber (think of all the connections to each house and each port within each house). Google Fiber is looking to change that slowly. You can refer to Fiber to the x (FTTX) for different network architectures. Companies like Infinera already deploy technology utilizing photonics integrated circuits (PIC) to achieve several hundred gigabit speeds and are pursuing scalable "Super Channels" with Terabit speeds.
