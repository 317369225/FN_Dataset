★Mobile Broadband: How long will it be until cellular bandwidth/speed will be suitable substitute for cable Internet?
It already is in most of Japan. For example, Softbank, eMobile, and DoCoMo offer reasonablly priced, flat fee, all you can eat,  high speed services... I am pretty sure that they all offer 7.2Mbs download speeds. Prices are typically around 50 dollars a month.  Just as many people are now giving up their land line for a mobile telephone, many are starting to give up their wired Internet connections for these data services.
