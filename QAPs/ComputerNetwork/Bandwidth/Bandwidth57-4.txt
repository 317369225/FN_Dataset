â˜…Mobile Broadband: How long will it be until cellular bandwidth/speed will be suitable substitute for cable Internet?
It is a suitable substitute in many parts of the world already. In US, I would guess 1-2 years. However, "suitable" depends on what you expect from and require of a cable line. For example, latency is around 100 ms higher on MBB than on cable (of course, widely depending on conditions!). MBB can be used anywhere, so that is of course a great advantage to cable. On the other hand, cable is not as much of a shared resource as MBB, meaning less affected by on- and off-peak capacity.
