★How much bandwidth does youtube use?
If you asking how much Youtube uses on your bandwidth when you watch videos, then it depends on the video quality you are watching in. For example, a 480p video will use 5.50 mb/min. I done test in for all the Video Qualities (240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p).  You can see the results at How much data Youtube video use? - Cliff Tam . If you are asking this to find out how much data you need to have, then use the results from the link above and figure out how much Video (in minutes) you will be watching on a monthly basis. For safe bet, always watch them in 480p (this is the default video quality).  720p and 1080p (high definition) will eat up your bandwidth like no tomorrow.
