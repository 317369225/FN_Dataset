â˜…What home routers have built-in bandwidth monitoring?Plans are getting to have set limits, but I can monitor every Internet connected device individually.
Depending you the definition of bandwidth monitoring. Your best bet would probably be to get one of the models that is supported by DD-WRT firmware. It can report interface level bandwidth utilization real-time and can export more detailed info via cflow. Cflow will give you more detailed data about which IP connected to which other IP over what protocol, when and how much data was exchanged. OpenWRT is also worth checking out.
