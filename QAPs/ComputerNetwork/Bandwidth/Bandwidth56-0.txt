★Is Nielsen's Law of Internet Bandwidth verified and valid?Does it apply as a nationwide phenomenon? Do the numbers since 1998 follow his linear pattern? Were his predictions on target, or has the rollout of bandwidth upgrades deviated? Either way, why is it this way, and how does it hold outside of the US? Link: http://www.useit.com/alertbox/98...
It's merely "a law" in the same sense as Moore' Law - it has nothing to do directly with physics or the real world but rather is a mixture of economics, math and happenstance. With all "laws" of this type, you have to dig into the underlying causal forces that enable the law to appear.   In many cases indirectly a result of Moore's Law cost deflation.   Moore's Law is NOT forever - it's already ratcheted down in many ways, so you should expect "laws" like Nielsen's Law to follow suit in the not too distant future. There are also other factors that alter such things.  For example, the US and even Silicon Valley, now has some of the worst internet quality and speeds on the planet because of government and industry choices.  Go to Asia and you can get 100Mbps for the fraction of price you for 1 Mbps DSL in Silicon Valley!  So the US is already at odds with this "law".
