â˜…How much bandwidth does each human sense consume relatively speaking?Bandwidth here means, for example, "how much information is received per second". See related: What is the sensitivity and frequency range of each human sense?
Just to extrapolate from Robert's excellent answer and provide a simple order of magnitude on total brain bandwidth: 100Mb/s or about 10MB/s while awake.
