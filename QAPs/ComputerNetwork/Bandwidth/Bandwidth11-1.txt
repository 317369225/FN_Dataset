★What is the usual bandwidth for a video conference?
It depends on how many people is talking over one conference ! For simple video calling, 300 kbps  (kilobits per second) is largely sufficient. For HD video, you need at  least 1 Mbps (Mega bits per second), and are sure to have good quality  with 1.5 Mbps. That’s for one-to-one conversations. How about when there  are more participants? Add another 1 Mbps per added participant for  comfortable video conferencing. It also depends on bandwidth at server/cloud end bus as you may use traditional VoIP provider it is none of your concern !
