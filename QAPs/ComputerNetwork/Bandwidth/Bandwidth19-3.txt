★What determines the bandwidth of optical fiber versus copper wire?
Optical fibers run at much higher frequencies, in the infrared, around 1 micrometer.   Coax cable runs at wavelengths from very long down to about 10 centimeters, that's 100,000 times lower frequency.   So the fiber signals are wiggling 100,000 times faster, and everything else held constant, the fiber can carry up 100,000 times more information, loosely speaking, just based on its frequency.  You see information inevitably adds "sidebands" to the center carrier frequency, and the information content is proportional to the width of the sidebands.   On a copper cable you can't have a carrier much higher than 1 gigahertz, so your sidebands are limited to that.  On a fiber the carrier is 100,000 times higher, so the information sidebands can be that much higher.  There are some complications though.  The signal can get attenuated and phase-shifted by different amounts at different frequencies.   This can somewhat be compensated with clever tone controls, but there is a limit to that compensation.   Fibers can also have different internal bounce-patterns, which means the signals can arrive a little bit blurred in time.
