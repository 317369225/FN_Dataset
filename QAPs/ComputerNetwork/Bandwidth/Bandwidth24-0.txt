★What is the bandwidth of a coaxial cable?I don't understand how the coaxial cable coming through my wall simultaneously carries the hundreds of channels received as part of a typical cable TV service.
It's vaguely similar to how your radio can receive many channels via a single antenna.  Traditional radio only uses a little more than 20Mhz of bandwidth.  Cable systems use far, far more than this.  There are still a few old mom & pop cable systems around using the old 330Mhz spectrum, but generally, cable plants start at 750Mhz go up from there.  A single analog channel uses about 6Mhz of bandwidth.  Modern digital cable systems can now apply various methods of compression and push many more channels through the same 6Mhz.  IIRC an HD channel only needs 1.5Mhz of bandwidth when compressed.  Advances in DOCSIS cable modem technology have also seen the addition of channel bonding, so instead of a single 6Mhz channel, the bandwidth for cable modems can span multiple channels (I believe the current spec is a max of four upstream channels bonded and four downstream channels bonded.) So, the practical answer to your question is that it depends on many factors.  I'm not sure what the theoretical maximum of a coaxial cable is, not that it matters.  None of the infrastructure is capable of achieving that theoretical maximum because it's subject to so many outside influences.  As to how many channels it is possible to deliver to a cable customer, that depends entirely on your cable provider's plant capabilities.  Not only are they capable of greater bandwidth overall, they're also capable of doing more with less bandwidth.
