★What is the maximum potential Internet connection bandwidth?Is fiber optic the best technology to get there?
This is basically limited only by how much money you want to spend.  The highest optical connection speed I'm aware of is approximately 40 Gb/s, but with DWDM it's possible to pack as many as 40 (possibly more by now, they're pushing this constantly) such channels onto a single fiber, achieving a raw bandwidth of 1.6 Tb/s on a single fiber.  The fastest electrical (copper) networking connection I'm aware of is 100 Gb/s Ethernet. Obviously, you can deploy as many of these as you like to create as much bandwidth as you like, although at some point you'll exceed the aggregated capacity of the rest of the world to talk to you.
