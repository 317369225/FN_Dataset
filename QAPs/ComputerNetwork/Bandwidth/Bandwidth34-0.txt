â˜…Is symmetric bandwidth internet neccessary anymore?With Cable and Wireless Internet connections getting so fast, (Comcast offers 50m/sb down and 20mb/s up and Verizon Wireless 4G I've seen run 16mb/s down and 4mb/s up), is there a need anymore to specify symmetric (same bandwidth in both directions) internet connections?
Yes, symmetric internet is still necessary. End users typically consume a disproportionate amount of download to upload, but that isn't the case in most business environments (Which symmetric is marketed towards). The ability to push data is just as important as the ability to pull data. The bigger these U/D numbers get, the more we will figure out how to use that capacity on a day to day basis.
