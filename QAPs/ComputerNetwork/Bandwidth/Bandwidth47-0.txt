★What are the best free unlimited bandwidth VPNs?
I'm not sure that there really is such a thing. Think about it: why would someone provide a free VPN service?  It costs them money to run it, so why would they spend money to give you something for free?  The adage goes "If you're not paying for it, you're the product".  What thing of value are you giving the operator of the free VPN service in exchange for them letting you use their servers and bandwidth? After you've thought about this for a while, you'll probably never want to use a "free" VPN service ever again. I use lots of free services, but I make sure I understand why the service is free before I commit to making any significant use of it. There are times I don't mind being the product. But I'm fairly certain that the "free VPN" scenario isn't going to be one of those times.
