★If I use a VPN (a virtual private network), will it protect my computer against malware?
A VPN encrypts the connection between your computer or mobile device and the VPN server, basically creating a tunnel. This prevents snoopers at your local coffee shop, the NSA and ISPs from stealing logins and passwords or looking at what you are doing. Because the VPN sits between you and the Internet it can also prevent creeps from pinging ports and other types of traffic reaching your computer, but... Malware is simply software running on your device, software you unintentionally downloaded which cleverly installed itself (computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, spyware, dishonest adware). Malware enters your computer just like any html-file your browser requested or a file you download via ftp. VPNs, such as hidemyass (http://www.adeepbite.com/hidemya...), were not designed to protect you from this type of attack; however, a few VPN providers have added malware protection to their VPN by comparing your http-requests against a database of known malware sites and alerting you if there is a problem.    Embed Quote
