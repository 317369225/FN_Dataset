★What exactly makes a VPN (virtual private network) so secure and what are its other major advantages?
Traffic between your end points are encrypted (can't be access by other  parties). The VPN is authenticated before hand (points at both ends are  who they say they are) and all packets are subject to integrity check  (all packets are received as they were transmitted). Non-repudiation  (data sender cannot deny sending the data) is also ensured on a per  session level.  That is four major security guarantees if used properly:  Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication and Non-Repudiation. These are also the advantages of using a VPN.    Embed Quote
