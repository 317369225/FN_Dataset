â˜…What exactly makes a VPN (virtual private network) so secure and what are its other major advantages?
Without a VPN: You -> internet You <- intert With a VPN: You -encrypted-> VPN server -> internet You <-encrypted- VPN server <- internet Basically all data is encapsulated using standard crypto, then sent to a VPN server. The server then decrypts and fetches whatever data from the internet. It then encrypts it and then sends it back to you. Anyone watching will see data from the VPN to the internet, and from the internet to the VPN, but will not (by default) be able to discern where or who originally asked for this data. Â Â  Embed Quote
