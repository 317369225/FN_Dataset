★How would you explain Proxy server and VPN (Virtual Private Network)?
VPN-A virtual private network (VPN) is a computer network that uses a public telecommunication infrastructure such as the Internet to provide remote offices or individual users with secure access to their organization's network. It connects them in such a way that both feels the other is in their network. In general a VPN can only support a connection between one computer or network and the remote network. To handle multiple users you need to set up multiple VPNs. (There are special-case exceptions to this but most of the time this is the case) PROXY-In computer networks, a proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A single proxy server can service hundreds or thousands of users. Proxy servers are cheaper and often easier to set up for mass users, but they require specific software support at the user's end to make the requests to the proxy server.
