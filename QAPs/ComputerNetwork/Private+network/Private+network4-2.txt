★How large is the annual world market for Virtual Private Network (VPN) services?By VPN I mean personal VPN services such as e.g. www.witopia.net.
Think there's a big distinction that needs to be made in this thread: consumer vs. enterprise. Most of us here probably use VPN via our employer provided VPN service (at Symantec we're required to use VPN to access company resources while off the corp. network and I suspect this is the same a many corporations). It follows that the majority of VPN users are enterprise, not consumer. In the consumer space, it's still a nascent market and not mature. And those consumers that use VPN services do so since they are familiar with what VPN does for them via their employer-mandated VPN.    Embed Quote
