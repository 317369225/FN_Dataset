★How do I set up my own Virtual Private Network?based on linux server.
That would depend on what you're trying to accomplish with your VPN and what resources are available.  If it's just a home network and your not heavily versed in routing, switching, firewalls, security, etc., I would recommend LogMeIn Hamachi.  All you have to do is install the client on the computers you wish to join to the VPN, and assign them to a network, most easily, from the Hamachi website.  If this is what you're looking for, and I'm assuming a lot, then the network type you're likely going to want to use is mesh.    Embed Quote
