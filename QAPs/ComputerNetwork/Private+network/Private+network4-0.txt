★How large is the annual world market for Virtual Private Network (VPN) services?By VPN I mean personal VPN services such as e.g. www.witopia.net.
If your referring to personal VPN services, I think the annual world market is massive and only growing. As privacy and online anonymity become major concerns, VPN providers offer a reliable solution. Furthermore, in areas with increasing censorship (i.e. Iran, China, and other similar) VPNs allow users to connect the real world wide web and participate on social networks. I'd say the current personal VPN Market is between $250 million and $500 million world wide but stands to grow to well over $1 Billion World Wide within the next 5 years. The internet is still "the wild west" and we haven't even seen the beginning of the privacy debate yet. Also, this new "Six Strikes" policy is a bit controversial as well.
