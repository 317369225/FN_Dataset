★How do people from China feel about the ban on using Google or Gmail without virtual private network software being switched on?
GFW creates three groups of Chinese in mainland. The people who don't use gmail or Google at all, will feel irrelevant; the people who want to use gmail or Google based on some sort of needs, will feel annoying, and eventually either give up or buy VPN; the people who already buy VPN, will feel being used of it. Many multinational corporations in China build their own VPNs, I think Chinese government will allow these VPNs to keep those companies. But for the personal internet user, it is harder and harder to break through GFW.    Embed Quote
