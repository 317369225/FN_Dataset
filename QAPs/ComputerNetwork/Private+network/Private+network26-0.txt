★What are some recommendations on ACH payment processes for my private network members?More specifically, I am looking to accept payment on behalf of my other private network members for things such as dues or professional fees that can get up in the hundreds of dollars on a daily basis. We do not need any credit card acceptance, ONLY ACH.
To throw my current company into your consideration set, you can do ACH-only processing through PaySimple (Simplify how you bill and collect). It's a flat 55 cents for most transactions (there is a higher fee for very high ticket). You don't need to sign up for credit card acceptance and you can do recurring billing through the software as well (and get reporting on your customer/member payments, etc.).    Embed Quote
