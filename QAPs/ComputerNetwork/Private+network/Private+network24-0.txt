★Is using VPN (virtual private network) or proxies legal in India?Considering you won't use it for illegal stuff just for normal browsing.
There is no particular  law which prohibits the use of proxies and VPNs. Even in countries like China, where VPN and proxy websites are blocked, people use it frequently . Using VPN or proxy won't let your ISP track what you are browsing , but the ISP on the other side (the one which provides  the proxy service ) would keep track of details of your browsing .  Suppose if you connect to a US server and download an episode  of an English TV serial, you are in more trouble  than what you would be if  you were using the Indian ISP, ie you must know about the local laws of that country. Bottom line: Using a VPN is perfectly OK unless you are living in Iran.    Embed Quote
