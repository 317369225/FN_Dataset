★How can an internet service provider identify which of its clients use a virtual private network?
Actually service provider shall set up the net work and the end-points of connectivity based on the client request only and hence shall have a mechanism / header /tag to identify each client and their traffic on their network either it is Layer 2 PIPE or Layer 3 VPN.  Based on these mechanisms / headers / tags, service provider shall measure the traffic of each client and send indicaters to the billing systems so that each client can be billied based on their weekly / monthly / billing cycles.    Embed Quote
