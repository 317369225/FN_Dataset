★What is a VPN (virtual private network)?
A Virtual Private Network is a logical network rather than a physical network.  To the hosts on a VPN, they appear as though they are sitting on a private network range and can communicate with each other at the network layer (e.g. IP) even though they might actually be in completely different locations on completely different physical networks. Since there are millions of overlapping private network ranges in the world, this traffic would not be routable over the Internet (because the source and destination would be ambiguous). The trick is that traffic between hosts on a VPN is not routed via the physical network as would normally be the case. Instead the traffic is sent, usually encrypted, inside of another transport (e.g. UDP/TCP) which can be routed via the physical network.  For example if you have two hosts on the same VPN and one pings the other, the ICMP packet generated by the first host addressed to the second host's private network address will be encrypted sent possibly inside of a TCP connection addressed to a public Internet address.  The second host will receive the encrypted TCP connection data routed over the Internet, extract the internal ICMP packet and then route it locally. There are many reasons for doing this:  - Network traffic is encrypted and authenticated.  - Hosts can be assigned to a private network range even though they might be in completely different locations.  - Routing your network traffic via another location might give you increased access to the Internet because it can bypass local firewalls and restrictions.    Embed Quote
