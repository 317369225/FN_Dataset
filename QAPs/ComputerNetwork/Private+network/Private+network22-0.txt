★Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): Astraweb + IPVanish or Giganews Diamond Plan with VyperVPN?
Choose VPN depending on your location. There are no good or bad VPNs, it depends on network condistions between you and server you connect. Honestly saying $35.00 per month is a total ripoff. I would suggest to try Seed4.Me, they have whole 1 week for free as trial and $3.33 per month if you want to continue. Think about that.    Embed Quote
