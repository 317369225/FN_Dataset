★Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): Openvpn works fine on Linux machines while fail to connect on Windows. What could be the problem?I'm using the same certificates for both. (vpnbook). It used to work fine on my windows 7 laptop until recently when it abruptly stopped working. (and various other windows users in my college network.) Any help would be great as the restrictions posed on internet connectivity by our college is unbearable.
I wouldn't recommend using a free VPN because of security reasons and sometimes Free VPNs tend to stop working after a few days of session. You can try PureVPN (http://www.bestvpnservice.com/vi...) or if you want to use free I would suggest that you get Zenmate Chorme extension. Its free and aWsome!    Embed Quote
