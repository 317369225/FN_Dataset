★How do I set up my own Virtual Private Network?based on linux server.
here are my 2 cents that will give you a basic idea in running your own VPN: I suggest launching an openVPN server.OpenVPN is an open source software application that implements VPN techniques for creating secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities. These are the things you will need in order to successfully create a VPN. 1) An Ubuntu Linux Server. If you do not have a Linux Server. 2)Port forwarding skills. 3)A domain name attached to your server. Hamachi is an alternative to OpenVPN for being the most hands-off, zero-configuration VPN tool to configure. The others aren’t terribly difficult, but Hamachi really is easy to install An easy alternative to OpenVPN. It runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, so grab the installer for your OS of choice. It comes in two flavours: a free (for non-commercial use) version that gives us everything we want (the ability to leverage to our home network from anywhere over a secure, encrypted connection), and a paid, managed version that does more than you’d likely ever need. Hope it could help.    Embed Quote
