★When I connect to a virtual private network, will my IP address change?
It depends on where you are looking for your IP Address. If you are looking it from the perspective of the VPN Server - your IP address will not change as the VPN server will have to communicate with your own "original IP" to exchange traffic. If you are looking it from the perspective of the servers outside the VPN server (assuming the traffic was actually routed via VPN), they will see the IP address of the servers within the VPN network (not necessarily the IP address of the VPN server), instead of your "original IP address." So just to be clear let's say: Your PC --> VPN Server --> Web Proxy --> Web Site From the perspective of the "web site," it will see the IP address of the proxy server.  The proxy server, on the other hand will see your PC's newly assigned IP address (by the VPN server).    Embed Quote
