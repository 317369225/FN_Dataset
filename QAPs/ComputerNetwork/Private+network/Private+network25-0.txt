★How can an internet service provider identify which of its clients use a virtual private network?
There are different kinds of VPN, from something as simple as an IPSEC tunnel between 2 sites, to GET VPN which is a tunnel-less VPN technology that, to MPLS VPNs that can segregate entire L3 or L2 networks off using labels to give the end client a private network that used to be only possible with dedicated circuits such as ATM or Frame Relay. Your service provider can see your packet headers (if the payload is encrypted), or the entire packet (if there is no encryption being used). They can tell if your packets are encrypted or not. They can also take into consideration usage of default ports for services such as ISAKMP (used in IPSEC site-to-site tunnels).    Embed Quote
