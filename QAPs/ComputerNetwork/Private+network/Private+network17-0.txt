★How can I transfer files from one private network to another through command line?
Some instructions. 1. This question has been tagged into Linux but you can ask for Mac/Windows in comments. 2. The answer has been divided into two part. 3. Since question detail deviates from the general idea of question, so the readers who are interested in the Question heading can read first Part I & the one sent me A2A can skip to Part II. Part I: Actual Question—How can I transfer files from one private network to another via Terminal? There're several ways to achieve it but first you have to set up connections between the two different networks and configure it. There're many GUIs & CLIs protocols by which you can do it but since this question relates only to copy via terminal command line, I will list out some network protocols & commands by which you can achieve it. (Assuming both the private networks are connected via Internet or any other TCP physical/wireless connection) Suppose your IP is: 172.16.32.X And You want to copy files to a system whose IP is: 192.168.X.X 1. FTP (Connect it with VPN+SSL or HIMACHI) - Risk Factor High If you don't know how to configure FTP, read about it on WikiHow CLI - Syntax $ scp <file Name/multiple files/ -r directory> <user name>@<Server Address>:/home/<User Name> CLI - Implement To Copy File: $ scp catmeow.txt imuser@192.168.X.X:/home/imuser To Copy Folder/Directory: $ scp -r /cats imuser@192.168.X.X:/home/imuser 2. NFS - Risk Factor Low Since this works as Client/server protocol, you have to configure it first. To configue check this page on TechMint. Note: Command to copy to-fro from NFS is same as mentioned above. Part II: The A2A—How can I transfer files from one private network of guest VM to Another private network of Host VM via Terminal? If sharing the file is the primary motive of both Eth0 and wan0 port, I think you've unnecessarily complicated it. As your guest OS isn't using the wan0 port of host OS, You can easily share files between both your OS without using network. You can do so by creating an exchange partition with a common file system such as FAT or NTFS (as per your requirement). But Since we've a question: 1. Connect the Host VM to Guest OS and set them in same network. (If you want them to stay in different network, read part I) 2. In case of VM, if you're using VMware or VirtualBox, You need to switch and check different adapter types (Trial and error). 3. Set up the network with target host and source host IP/Names 4. Copy files via SSH and also know where the target and host are based. 5. Follow the same command mentioned in Part I. (Repeated) CLI - Syntax $ scp <file Name/multiple files/ -r directory> <user name>@<Server Address>:/home/<User Name> CLI - Implement To Copy File: $ scp catmeow.txt imuser@192.168.X.X:/home/imuser To Copy Folder/Directory: $ scp -r /cats imuser@192.168.X.X:/home/imuser Postscript: You can also use sftp: & fish: along with the above in CLI.    Embed Quote
