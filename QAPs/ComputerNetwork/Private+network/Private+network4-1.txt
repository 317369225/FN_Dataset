★How large is the annual world market for Virtual Private Network (VPN) services?By VPN I mean personal VPN services such as e.g. www.witopia.net.
That would depends on how you classify a VPN ? Are you talking about a Cisco / Juniper / F5 etc. as a provider of VPN Service (VPN Client)  or are you looking at a VPN Managed Service(Qwest, UUNET or similar) or are you look at VPN Services as in a VPN Service provided by say something like http://www.btguard.com) ? I would guess the answer to the question is that it depends on the market. I have not seen specific number for each of these markets, however guys like Infonetics and others do publish figures for companies like Cisco etc.    Embed Quote
