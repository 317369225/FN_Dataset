★How does private networking function as opposed to having an account on Facebook or Instagram where your network is displayed publicly?
Open social network services, like facebook and instragram, have grown by suggesting you to connect with your friends' friends. Because the network node is open to all other people as a default, so the speed and volume of connection get faster as they make friends. However, in the private networking, you have to invite your friends for yourself without a suggestion from the system because you cannot know if they exist in the service. The way of making connection matters when we tell the open social from the private social.    Embed Quote
