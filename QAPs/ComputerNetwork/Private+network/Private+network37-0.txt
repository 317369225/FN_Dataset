★How can I set up a web server in my computer to create a private network?I'm learning how to build web apps and I need to test my server side code. I want to do it without using external web hosting. Also,should I use Node.js, Apache...any suggestions? I appreciate the help!
You don't give your OS, but anyway this is easy. On a PC, just install Easyphp or Xampp (Node.js have a windows installer). On a mac, you can use Mamp (or use mac native environment, but it's cumbersome). If you want to put yourself in a real world situation, you can also install Linux (I recommend Debian, but you can choose any flavor you like) on a virtual machine (Oracle VM VirtualBox is free and easy to setup). This would be the best option I think.    Embed Quote
