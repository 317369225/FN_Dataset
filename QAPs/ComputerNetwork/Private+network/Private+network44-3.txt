★How do people from China feel about the ban on using Google or Gmail without virtual private network software being switched on?
Most people do not feel anything since these are not so important in question. However, there is definitely the need to be more in the access for the mail to be sent and received without or without the private network. Though the privacy may or may not be guaranteed but the email needs to be received such that you can also reply to it and send it back in time and that will be helpful for the small business to get the material when it needs instead of relying on the other mail which may be not so fast as the business requires.    Embed Quote
