★What are the best virtual private networks (VPNs) for use in China?Am looking for something that's easier to set up and has more stable access that works well on PC, Mac and Smartphones.
How to Access Facebook in China is a good solution. You don't have to set anything up since it's a Proxy service. You sign up to the service and access your social media and other blocked websites through the proxy. Good luck.    Embed Quote
