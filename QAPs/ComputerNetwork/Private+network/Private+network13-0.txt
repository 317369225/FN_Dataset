★If I use a VPN (a virtual private network), will it protect my computer against malware?
No. It will prevent others from looking like your colleagues in the other parts of the VPN. But as soon as you interact with the rest of the Internet - visit a website, read non-internal emails - you are as vulnerable as ever.    Embed Quote
