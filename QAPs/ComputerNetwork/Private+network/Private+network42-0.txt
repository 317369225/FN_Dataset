★Does a virtual private network mask where you are coming from, like your ISP location?
Yes, when someone connects through VPN. All of the data then transmits through a secure tunnel which encrypts the packets from the local server to the dedicated subscribed server (Remote Server). And it will mask your identity mon the internet. By going with VPN not only enable you with the utmost security features but also make you anonymous on internet and no one figure out that who exactly you are as your IP changed by VPN. You actually don't go through your ISP  but your VPN connection, hence no one can figure out your actual ISP and actual location. Source: http://www.bestvpnservice.com    Embed Quote
