★When I connect to a virtual private network, will my IP address change?
In general, yes--the IP address that other sites and servers see you as coming from will be that of the VPN provider you're connecting to rather than your direct address. For clarity, note that your IP address doesn't actually change when you use a VPN. You connect to a VPN server, and then your computer basically becomes like just another workstation on the VPN provider's private network (that's why it's called a "virtual private network")--and just like you were sitting in the VPN provider's office, all of your Internet traffic passes through the VPN provider's Internet connection and thus appears to come from their network. If you were to actually look at your network settings, you'd actually see that your computer is assigned two IP addresses--one "real" one from your own network and one "virtual" one from the VPN provider's network. The VPN provider uses your "real" IP address to communicate with you, but all of your other traffic is associated with the "virtual" address and is thus tunneled through your VPN provider's network, and that's how other external servers will see you when you access them. That said, if your VPN provider has enabled what's called "split tunneling," then only traffic specifically directed to the VPN network (e.g., if you're connecting to a corporate VPN, this would be accessing internal resources on your corporate intranet) would go through the VPN tunnel. In this case, all other traffic, including general Internet browsing, would appear to come directly from your actual IP address. This arrangement would only be the case with a corporate VPN, though--certainly not with a paid VPN service you might use to secure your browsing over public wifi hotspots or to access U.S. streaming media resources from outside the country.    Embed Quote
