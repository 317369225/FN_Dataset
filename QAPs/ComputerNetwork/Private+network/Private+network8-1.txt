★What exactly makes a VPN (virtual private network) so secure and what are its other major advantages?
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a private computer network  constructed within a public network (such as the global Internet).  Imagine a VPN as a tunnel connecting you to the Internet through your  VPN service – on one side is your computer, and on the other side is  your VPN provider’s server. If someone looks at the tunnel from the  outside they see only the tunnel, and the traffic inside remains hidden.  When you use a VPN, websites you visit see only your VPN provider’s IP  (Internet Protocol) address, so your real IP address and your activity  remain hidden from the rest of the world. Anyone sniffing your traffic  (your ISP, law enforcement, or malicious hackers, for example) will see  only encrypted data. However, your VPN provider, by design, has access  to your Internet activity and can log information such as the IP address  you are connecting from, connection start and end times, or any other  information they are interested in. Apart from Security, people use VPN for many other purposes like, bypassing local censorship , watching Geo-restricted streaming contents, etc.  You may read more about it here : http://www.purevpn.com/benefits.php Hope it could help.    Embed Quote
