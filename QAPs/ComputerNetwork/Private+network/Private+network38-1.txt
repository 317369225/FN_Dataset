★Are there companies who offer online networking centres for groups to exchange messages and virtually & privately network?I'm looking at software companies that offer this service that enables a closed group (with an admin) to send each other messages (without sharing their email) Are there any startups that are currently doing this?
Okay I can only assume what you need after you have not provided me with feedback. Maybe I2P Anonymous Network [http://www.i2p2.de/] is what you are looking for and here especially the I2P-Messenger: I2P-Messenger is an end-to-end encrypted serverless communication application. For communication between two users, they need to give each other their destination keys, to allow the other to connect. It supports file transfer and has a search for other users, based on Seedless.    Embed Quote
