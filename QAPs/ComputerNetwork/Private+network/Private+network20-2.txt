★What are the best virtual private networks (VPNs) for use in China?Am looking for something that's easier to set up and has more stable access that works well on PC, Mac and Smartphones.
I've been using Nomad Tunnel for a while and everything works fine, even Hulu. I've heard good things about Astrill too.    Embed Quote
