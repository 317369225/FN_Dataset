★What would happen if there were two identical IP addresses on the same private network?
ARP should work wrongly , i.e., be stuck in a race condition. Lets say there is a packet for ip address 192.168.4.6 and there are two MAC addresses that bind to this ip address on the same subnet. Then if the terminal switch/router to that subnet does not have either MAC address, it will poll for it, and whoever replies first may get that packet and this will usually change as requests for change in IP-MAC translations are sent periodically and there is no saying which of the MAC addresses will be stored on the switch/router on ethernet. If the ip addresses are in separate subnets, then the routing protocol should have a problem and a race condition should be created as to who to forward the packet to.    Embed Quote
