★Is battery use higher on a public, high-traffic, wi-fi network, vs. a private network at home?
WiFi client power consumption is dominated by the transmit power amplifier which amplifies the RF signal prior to transmission from the antenna.   As such, WiFi client power consumption is largely proportional to the amount of time that the power amplifier is active for transmission.  So lets consider what can cause different transmission times in different environments. WiFi uses both adaptive modulation and MAC-layer retransmission to deal with the extremely wide range of radio link conditions encountered in the unlicensed 2.4GHz and 5GHz spectrum. Both of these techniques will result in variable transmission time for a given amount of data transfer.  The transmission time (and hence the power consumption) will be highly dependent on the radio link conditions which depend on a number of factors such as the local RF noise level, distance from the AP and the quality of the AP.  Poor link conditions result in longer transmission times and hence higher power consumption. Radio link conditions in busy public places are typically much worse than in private residences due to the larger number of WiFi client devices and elevated RF noise levels from both wifi and non-wifi sources. This can result in higher power consumption due to the use of slower physical layer data rate modulations and increased retransmissions.  These factors can be mitigated by high density wireless design strategies which improve the link conditions by reducing the average distance between clients and APs.    Embed Quote
