★Does ARP spoofing only work for private networks?
ARP spoofing is a type of attack in which a malefactor sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local area network. This results in the linking of an attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. Once the attacker’s MAC address is connected to an authentic IP address, the attacker will begin receiving any data that is intended for that IP address. ARP spoofing attacks can be performed at any networks to which you will be able connect to (home, office, public networks in restaurants) if these networks are not protected good enough.    Embed Quote
