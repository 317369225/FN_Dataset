★What is VPN (virtual private network) and what are its advantages and disadvantages?how to use it on android?
VPN or virtual private network is a network that extends a private network over a public network. It means that a P2P network is created over a vast network like Internet Now a P2P is the networking tech which is used by clients like Vuze, BitTorrent to transfer data directly from other connected machines to your machine. Now coming to the next part of your question, an Android app using VPN can be very useful. You could transfer data directly from another app user located far far away physically, like in a file sharing network. But using a VPN you can't broadcast a message like in a messaging app. You would have to access each node in order to send some data to it. Instead, you could use Google Cloud Messenger (GCM) to send feeds to each and every node. But you would have to configure it. Look it up. Ciao    Embed Quote
