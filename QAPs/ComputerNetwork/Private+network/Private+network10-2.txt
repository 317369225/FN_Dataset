★What is VPN (virtual private network) and what are its advantages and disadvantages?how to use it on android?
Also be vary when you use any free VPN solutions - your traffic is secured when traversing the internet as it is encapsulated and secured with IPSec,  but the servers and network that you're connected to (ie the provider of free VPN solution) can see all your traffic (if they itend to - you're basicallly on the same network) - you better find the trustworthy provider of VPN if you want to have privacy of data that you transfer over the internet. another downside of VPN is that your bandwidth  is limited by the bandwidth of the network that you connect to, therfore it is possible that you will get much less speed compared to regular connection. however when you're in country which has strict filtering for websites ('the great firewall of China' - for example) the best solution for you is to connect to VPN located somewhere else where these restrictions does not apply.    Embed Quote
