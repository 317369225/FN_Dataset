★If I set up a web server in my computer how do I create a private network?I'm learning how to develop web apps and in order to test them I need to check my server side coding as well. I'm looking for a way to have a private network.
To setup your own server you do not need private network. There are multiple web server softwares depending on the need. To test php skills setup Apache server. To Test Java skills setup Tomcat or Jetty Server. After setting up server just deploy your code and test it using Page on Localhost url. You can also test it from other computers on same LAN by http://<server's IP Address>/ url.    Embed Quote
