★How do people from China feel about the ban on using Google or Gmail without virtual private network software being switched on?
I am less sure when was this question asked but I just want to assume it happened recently, when Gmail SMTP and POP are completely shut down in China. I cannot stand for majority of Chinese people since it is a extremely diverse country and if I don't lie to myself I will say the majority are not affectedtoo badly. The first arguement will be that the market share of Gmail is not so significant in China compared to QQ, 163 and Sina. So those people do feel, feel it is wrong or unreasonable, or evil. Some of those who notice this "incident" happens and still keep the habbit of thinking, will feel at least weak, facing the formidable machine. But I doubt how strongly since they can hardly relate. And some however advocate the goverment behaviour, although I am not sure how many of them are paid to do so. There is one mainstream paper, which could be regard as the voice of the governing, just published an article saying, not literally but as how I understand, "So what Gmail is lost connection, which could be caused by couple reasons, why everyone is so sure the we did this? And even if we did this, we did it for the good of you all. So if we did it, you better shut your mouth and suck it up." How do Chinese feel about it? Well I guess I should belong to the minority if I was in China. I myself feel shocked. I mean, what? Seriously? Did someone just say that shamelessly? Most of us have hardly prepared for this. Of cause people who are directly affected adversely are angry, cursing and sometimes feel disgusted for those who accept it like the sheep follows the Shepherd dog. Forgive my less logical organization of answer. I think if there is one common and relatively pervasive feeling, I guess is powerless.    Embed Quote
