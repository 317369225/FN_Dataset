★Personal VPNs: What are Virtual Private Networks and do I need it on mobile devices?Is there a benefit to having a VPN account/app on ur smartphone or tablet?
Wiki VPN .. You will have much information Is it useful ??? ... Well , yes in some cases .. Just think about it , if you are using your mobile to browse internet or using chat application or email with no SSL via a public wi-fi .. And someone using specific application can sniffer the data going on that wi-fi , the result will be your data is not secured But .. If you used VPN , your data will be encrypted xD NOTE : more secure VPN more slow internet IPSec is secure also fast Pptp is 128-bit and fast OpenVPN is the best Also VPN can be helpful in some cases , such as if you are in middle east and you want to listen to AOL radio , you have to use VPN with U.S ip Also in your computer you can watch netflix if you had U.S ip    Embed Quote
