★Do Visa and MasterCard own their private network for processing payments? If so, is it very bad idea not to use the Internet instead?
The schemes have their own global authorization networks that all banks and some large payment processors connect into for authorizing credit card transactions. I am not sure what the question is aiming at when asking about the Internet. Ecommerce transactions obviously pass through the Internet for their authorization, but once they reach the acquirer of the merchant, they once again get passed into the proprietary authorization network of the schemes. The key reason for proprietary networks of the schemes is security and access control, which is tightly controlled and monitored.    Embed Quote
