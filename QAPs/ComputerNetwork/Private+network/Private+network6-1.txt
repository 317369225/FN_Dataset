★What commercial uses do virtual private networks have?
In today's market, larger companies often have offices around the world. Before the development of virtual private networks (VPN), companies with distant offices were forced to buy or lease lines, in order to enjoy services such as access to data, video conferencing and additional network services. These lines were extremely costly, and therefore accessing these private networks from other destinations for the purpose of telecommuting was not realistic. The creation of VPNs offered companies the chance to allow access to these private networks from long distances at a fraction of the price.    Embed Quote
