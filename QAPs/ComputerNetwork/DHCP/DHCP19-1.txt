★Why does DHCP sometimes give the wrong IP in the internal network?e.g. the DHCP normally give IP 172.27.8.xxx to some PCs, but suddenly the DHCP will give IP 169.xxx.xx.xxx to one PC. and DNS will change from 255.255.255.0 to 255.255.0.0.
Your 169.254.x.x address wasn't assigned by your DHCP server.  Addresses in this range are "link local" addresses.  Your PC assigns it automatically by itself. 169.254.0.0/16 - This is the "link local" block. As described in [RFC3927], it is allocated for communication between hosts on a single link. Hosts obtain these addresses by auto-configuration, such as when a DHCP server cannot be found. You can read more about it is RFC3927. The idea is that systems connecting to a LAN with no DHCP/BOOTP may be able to use the self-assigned addresses to communicate. If you aren't expecting such an address then the issue is that your DHCP server was down, or didn't have any more addresses to give out, or that your LAN was broken in a way that stopped your PC communicating with the DHCP server.
