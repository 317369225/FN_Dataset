â˜…Why use DHCP?Why should I use DHCP when i can use a static IP-number?
Consider I am connecting to a wireless network, I need to get a static IP for which there should be a system which checks for no collisions(same ip to two people), which adds resolver and gateway stuffs to my system, which retrieves the IP from my system if lease period is over if I dont have a DHCP Server. Why should I not automate this tedious process. My dhcp client talks with server and gets ip for a lease period, they talk again before the lease period expires. Its all abt automation and reducing human efforts on small jobs
