★Is it a problem to have both my cable modem and my router configured to use DHCP?Or should the cable modem be configured to be a bridge?  What's the impact of either setting?
In this users typical configuration, there are not two DHCP services on the same subnet. The modem DHCP is to the router, and the router DHCP is to the machines on the home LAN. As Anon indicates above. No problem to have both serving DHCP. Just make sure your router is handing out addresses starting at like 192.168.100.x ... because most likely  your modem DHCP and router DHCP would both hand out addresses in the 192.168.1.x range which could confuse things. However, set the modem in bridge mode if you can and data should traverse a bit faster since no routing is going on within the cable modem. In this however, you'd need to figure out whether your router WAN address is via DHCP to the cable broadband service provider, or whether the WAN address should be a static IP from the service provider. Most likely it will be DHCP unless you have like Comcast Business.
