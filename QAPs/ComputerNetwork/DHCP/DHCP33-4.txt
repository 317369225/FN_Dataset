â˜…How can I change my public IP from static to dynamic (DHCP)?My ISP give my a static IP and I want to change it to a dynamic IP, how can I do that? I tried with the CMD commands but it's not possible. There are other options?
Usually people pay to have a static IP from their ISP. If you don't want a static IP, that leads me to think you are trying to hide/hop around IPs in an attempt to hide; this won't work, there are logs. You probably have a dynamic IP from your ISP, you are most likely just still within the DHCP lease time and as such the DHCP server has not served you a new IP (or you haven't been offline long enough for your current IP lease to expire and be given to someone else).
