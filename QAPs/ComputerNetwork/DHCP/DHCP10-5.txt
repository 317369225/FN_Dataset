★Is it a problem to have both my cable modem and my router configured to use DHCP?Or should the cable modem be configured to be a bridge?  What's the impact of either setting?
A typical home set up has a Router with two LANs. One for all your devices. This usually appears as an integrated switch in your router and may have multiple ports. One marked Internet for your upstream/ISP connection.  This may seem like an additional port on your first LAN but it is not. This (the Internet port) is the port that connects to your cable modem's ethernet port.  The DHCP server on the router serves your devices on the first LAN. The DHCP server on your cable modem provides an IP address for the Internet port of your router.These two do not conflict.  Your devices will get IP addresses from your router, and your router will get an IP address from your modem. It is also possible to configure your "router" as a bridge.  In this case you should shutoff the DHCP server on your router. If you connect your router to your cable modem via USB, then also you do not have a problem with both enabled.
