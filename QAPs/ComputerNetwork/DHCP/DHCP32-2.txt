★Why would DHCP be considered a layer 7 (application layer) protocol when the sole purpose of the DHCP is to manage IP addresses?Shouldn't this protocol be part of Layer 3 (network layer) where packets are assigned source and destination IPs?
You are getting confused by  the fact that DHCP uses UDP to communicate. DHCP likee BGP,OSPF etc are control plane protocols who basically help IP to do its task in better way. However to get info they need to communicate and for communication they need TCP/UDP that does not make them Layer7 as end uses cant use it manually . Layer 7 are application which are available for common man who is end internet user to give input and get output he wants. Not every protocol that uses UDP for communication is application layer protocol
