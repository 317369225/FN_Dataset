â˜…What is DHCP and what is the purpose or role of the Active Directory?
DHCP allows us to Dynamically control various hosts in a network or subnetwork. Like how long a host can get connected to a network by means of ip lease time and allocating a unique ip of that network, etc. other features. This is particularly useful in a scenario where a host is acting as a bot in an attack, and admin is left with no other option except to isolate it, He can config the DHCP provider, not to extend the lease time, so that after lease time the host ultimately gets isolated from network. There are many more cases where you can use this. basically DHCP allows us to control which Hosts can be in the network or sub network that to dynamically. Active Directory is Directory service can be found in Microsoft server OSs for Allowed Hosts and Users in the network. This allows users to login into network from any of the allowed list of hosts in the network. Though purpose is same, you will have better control in Active Directory services like blocking, monitoring, quickly adding a new user, etc. These are just basics. you will find much if you open any server's dhcp daemon config files or similar files. If any thing is to be corrected, pls correct.
