â˜…What are good layer 3 switches that handle DHCP server functions?
It all depends on your needs and the size of your network. for up to 50 Users, every DHCP could do the work. If you have more users/devices then I'd rather use a Windows/Linux as a DHCP server and a Cisco Layer 3 switch to act as a DHCP relay. Of course you can support more users using a simple de vice who supports DHCP but you will have lack of control, ,mostly performance issues and not to mention that it can be very hard to manage
