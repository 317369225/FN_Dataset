★How can I change my public IP from static to dynamic (DHCP)?My ISP give my a static IP and I want to change it to a dynamic IP, how can I do that? I tried with the CMD commands but it's not possible. There are other options?
You have no control over the IP address assigned to you by your ISP.  You have to arrange a dynamic address with the service provider.  Even if you have a dynamic address, it may remain static for long periods of time. Although I have a dynamic address with my ISP, my address rarely changes. On the other hand, if you use IPv6, you can use privacy addressing and your address will change frequently.  However, the prefix assigned to you by the ISP will likely remain unchanged.
