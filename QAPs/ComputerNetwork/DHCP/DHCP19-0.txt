★Why does DHCP sometimes give the wrong IP in the internal network?e.g. the DHCP normally give IP 172.27.8.xxx to some PCs, but suddenly the DHCP will give IP 169.xxx.xx.xxx to one PC. and DNS will change from 255.255.255.0 to 255.255.0.0.
A 169.254.x.x address occurs when a client doesn't get a DHCP result, and thus defaults to using a link-local address.  These addresses are generated by the computer itself rather than being assigned by a DHCP server.  If you are getting addresses like these, and you're not deliberately using something like Bonjour for ad hoc address management (and almost nobody does), then the most likely problems are that the connection between the client(s) and the DHCP server is unreliable, or the DHCP server itself is unreliable.  Without knowing more about your environment, I can't provide more specific advice, but first steps would be to check the physical (layer 1) and logical (layer 2) connections between the clients that are autoconfiguring and the DHCP server, and check the DHCP server itself to ensure that it's operating properly.  If the DHCP server is on a different subnet than the affected clients, make sure that DHCP relay is configured correctly on all applicable routers.  Also check to ensure that the DHCP server is not out of addresses for that subnet/scope, and has not been configured to refuse to offer addresses to the clients in question.
