★Can DHCP be combined with some fixed ip's in a SOHO router?
Yes.  All you need to do is limit the DHCP range in the router setup and assign static addresses that are outside the DHCP range.  For example, you could have the DHCP server set for 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.254 and make all of your static addresses outside that range, .i.e., between 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.99.  I do this because it is convenient to have static IP addresses for devices that are always connected but to have a DHCP server for transient wireless devices.
