â˜…What IP address does a client use as source IP address while making a DHCP request and where does the DHCP server send the reply to?
In this reply I talk about Linux. However, the same principles apply to any other operating system using TCP/IP. During a typical boot sequence, after the necessary hardware drivers have been loaded, the dhcpcd program is launched (dhcpcd or similar). This program sends out a request via the UDP protocol, to the broadcast address, which is 255.255.255.255 The network card itself has set it ip address as 0.0.0.0. This packet is basically your computer shouting across the room saying 'Hello! this is network card f1:8f:4f:55:33:9a, what details do I need to use to join "the" network?' If there is a router that is willing to allow this device, it will reply with a 'Hi f1:8f:4f:55:33:9a., I am 192.168.0.1/24, Here are the details I would like you to use: ip address 192.168.0.5, netmask: 255.255.255.0, router: 192.168.0.1, DNS server 8.8.8.8' If your device likes what it is hearing, then it will say 'Hi 192.168.0.5, me again, f1:8f:4f:55:33:9a, can I please get the details you offered? ip address 192.168.0.5, netmask: 255.255.255.0, router: 192.168.0.1, DNS server 8.8.8.8' If the router is still willing to give out these details, then it will say 'Ok f1:8f:4f:55:33:9a, I have now assigned you the IP address 192.168.0.5 netmask 255.255.255.0. Use router 192.168.0.1 and DNS server 8.8.8.8' And that is pretty much it, in a nutshell. For a more detailed description, see the Wikipedia article: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
