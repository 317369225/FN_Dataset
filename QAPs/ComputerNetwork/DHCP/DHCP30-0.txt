â˜…When building a network, if you have a manually set DHCP pool and open one everytime you need it, would that prevent hacking and eliminate third party access?Let's say you have 5 devices and keep exactly 5 local ip addresses to give out, no other devices will be able to join the network. Would that potentially give hackers the disadvantage to not having a connection?
Would it stop a hacker? No. First, the hacker does not have to use an IP address you hand out, they can just pick one. Say your network is 10.0.0.0 -> 10.0.0.255. You hand out 10.0.0.10 through 10.0.0.14. The hacker picks 10.0.0.200 and it works. There are better ways to stop hackers. For instance, you can filter on MAC address. This will not stop a determined, experienced hacker, but just like a lock on your front door will not stop a determined, experienced thief, it can help with all the less experienced thieves.
