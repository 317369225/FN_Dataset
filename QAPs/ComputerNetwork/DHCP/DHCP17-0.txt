★How do you you find a rogue DHCP server on a large network?
I'd like to add some hints since you said "large network".  The way most people find any sort of machine on a large network is by its MAC address.  The rogue DHCP server will send a DHCP response.  The response should have the MAC address and IP of the server.  You then need to cross check your switches and routers to track this host down to a physical port.  DHCP is a LAN function (it uses broadcast), so you will need to have test probes on every subnet you want to look for rogue DHCP servers. Most commercial routers are not going to make it easy to send arbitrary DISCOVER packets. Good luck.
