â˜…Why does DHCP sometimes give the wrong IP in the internal network?e.g. the DHCP normally give IP 172.27.8.xxx to some PCs, but suddenly the DHCP will give IP 169.xxx.xx.xxx to one PC. and DNS will change from 255.255.255.0 to 255.255.0.0.
That means the Client system not able to connect the DHCP Server.... That Causes the client system is getting the APIPA address....
