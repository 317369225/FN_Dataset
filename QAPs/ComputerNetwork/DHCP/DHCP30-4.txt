â˜…When building a network, if you have a manually set DHCP pool and open one everytime you need it, would that prevent hacking and eliminate third party access?Let's say you have 5 devices and keep exactly 5 local ip addresses to give out, no other devices will be able to join the network. Would that potentially give hackers the disadvantage to not having a connection?
I think it would be better to make you public access point limited. The reason why I say this is because most routers had a delay in the type of access you want to change. A few ways to enhance your network security is this, make your network password a long string of letters, numbers caps and lower case and special characters. Second, is update your security programs. Lastly, admit all hardware and software is acceptable to hacking, so don't poke at the hackers. Don't give them a reason to hack or spam your system.
