★How can I change my public IP from static to dynamic (DHCP)?My ISP give my a static IP and I want to change it to a dynamic IP, how can I do that? I tried with the CMD commands but it's not possible. There are other options?
First you have to find out if your ISP is actually letting people use dynamic IPs.  In order for them to do this they need a DHCP server to assign, manage and revoke IPs.  This is fairly trivial and most ISPs will do this.  But if you are metering your customers or there is some other reason to want to track customers, then setting static IPs makes this a lot easier. If your ISP has dynamic IPs then you just need to change the settings in your network connection (if you are connecting directly) or in your modem (if you maintain a modem and share the connection with multiple systems.) I am assuming that you are talking about the IP for your modem and not for your router, correct?
