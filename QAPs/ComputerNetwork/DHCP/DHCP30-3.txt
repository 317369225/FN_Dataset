★When building a network, if you have a manually set DHCP pool and open one everytime you need it, would that prevent hacking and eliminate third party access?Let's say you have 5 devices and keep exactly 5 local ip addresses to give out, no other devices will be able to join the network. Would that potentially give hackers the disadvantage to not having a connection?
Let's  say you have 5 devices and keep exactly 5 local ip addresses to give  out, no other devices will be able to join the network. Would that  potentially give hackers the disadvantage to not having a connection? Not to the best of my understanding. Unless you're explicitly blocking all packets from other IP addresses from accessing the network via means of relevant rules in your switch/router, simply not having the DHCP server not hand out IP addresses will do nothing. Any device on the network can assign itself it's own IP address. As long as that IP address doesn't conflict with any of the existing IP addresses on the network, it should be no problem.
