â˜…Why does DHCP sometimes give the wrong IP in the internal network?e.g. the DHCP normally give IP 172.27.8.xxx to some PCs, but suddenly the DHCP will give IP 169.xxx.xx.xxx to one PC. and DNS will change from 255.255.255.0 to 255.255.0.0.
Kelly Martin gave a descriptive answer about the APIPA (169.54.*.*) you are getting. I would like to answer something about the DNS in your question description. First of all, the IP addresses(255.255.255.0 and 255.255.0.0) you've written here for DNS is incorrect. Those IP addresses in general cases belongs to the subnet mask. A subnet mask is used to break a network into sub-networks while the DNS resolve the domain name into the corresponding IP address. That's okay, then why the subnet mask changed from 255.255.255.0 to 255.255.0.0? APIPA(169.254.*.*) belongs to the class B of the IP addresses whose default subnet mask is of 16bits or 255.255.0.0. This is the reason your default subnet mask changed from 255.255.255.0 to 255.255.0.0. A simple question arises if you know about the classes of IP addresses and its range- 172.27.8.* is also a class B IP address then why its subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 in this case? Because of Classless Inter-Domain Routing.
