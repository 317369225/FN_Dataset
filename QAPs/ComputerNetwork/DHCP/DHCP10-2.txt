★Is it a problem to have both my cable modem and my router configured to use DHCP?Or should the cable modem be configured to be a bridge?  What's the impact of either setting?
Technically - no, probably - yes.  The problem arises when there are colliding address pools on the respective dhcp servers, and they aren't configured to let the other server know to invalidate an address.  You can certainly do something like configure static-only leases from one dhcp server which are outside the "free pool" of addresses the other dhcp server is handing out.  Obviously, if all dhcp servers are configured with static-only _unique_ addresses, the problem is mitigated.
