â˜…Why does DHCP sometimes give the wrong IP in the internal network?e.g. the DHCP normally give IP 172.27.8.xxx to some PCs, but suddenly the DHCP will give IP 169.xxx.xx.xxx to one PC. and DNS will change from 255.255.255.0 to 255.255.0.0.
if you find the PC with 169.254.x.x ip address when it is trying to get an ip from DHCP server, it is not because dhcp server assigned it to PC. PC aquires the 169.254.x.x (APIPA) since it needs an ip address and if it doesn't get it statically or automatically, it assigns that ip until it gets a proper ip address either manually or from dhcp server.
