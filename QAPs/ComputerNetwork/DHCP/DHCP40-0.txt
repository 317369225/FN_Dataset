â˜…In Windows 2008 DHCP sever, how do I stop users going into the first scope?I have a guest wireless network and a corporate LAN, the wireless users should get an address of 10.X.X.X. which is my first scope, but the LAN users should get an IP from the next scope down - how do I get them to ignore the 10 range? Windows just seems to take the first scope it finds.
How is the DHCP server receiving the requests from the two subnets? You should probably use the "ip helper-address" (or your router/switch vendor's equivalent,) command. Then just setup two different scopes and you should be alright.
