★When building a network, if you have a manually set DHCP pool and open one everytime you need it, would that prevent hacking and eliminate third party access?Let's say you have 5 devices and keep exactly 5 local ip addresses to give out, no other devices will be able to join the network. Would that potentially give hackers the disadvantage to not having a connection?
To add up to Patrick W. Gilmore's answer : TCP/IP was not designed with security in mind so all the security measures were added afterwards. In the case of DHCP the MAC feature was intended to be used as a man to create "permanent - dynamic" addressed,  i.e a way for a given host to receive always the same IP. If you have nothing but such addresses then IPs do not get assigned. Wi-Fi design had some security considerations in mind. After some hoops we now have a secure enough solution (namely WPA2) and if you use it you are fine,  nothing else is needed. Similar solutions were added to wired networks, they are not simple to implement and maintain (look up Network Access Control)
