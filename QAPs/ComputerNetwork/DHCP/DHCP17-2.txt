★How do you you find a rogue DHCP server on a large network?
Normally in an enterprise network you will only have one or two DHCP servers. If you lots of networks (VLANs) then usually the default router on the network will perform a DHCP relay function. It will convert the broadcast DHCP DISCOVERs from your clients to a unicast directed to the  DHCP servers on your configured router. So a rogue server has to be on the subnet your clients are on, and has to reply first to be of any use. As Joel has said, you should be able to track down the MAC address of the rogue DHCP server through your switches. Note that your routers aren't normally going to do DHCP DISCOVERs - unless you are willing to turn off their static address and let it try to get its IP dynamically. This would break it's normal routing function. Also if you are really concerned about rogue DHCP servers you probably need to look at the DHCP protection that is built into most enterprise grade switches these days. Basically if you turn this function on it prevents DHCP OFFERs coming from any port other than those you have configured. This will be then just the switch uplink ports (assuming you have a normal two or three tier switch structure) and the actual ports in your data centre where your DHCP servers live.
