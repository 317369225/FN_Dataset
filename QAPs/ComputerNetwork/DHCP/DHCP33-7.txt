â˜…How can I change my public IP from static to dynamic (DHCP)?My ISP give my a static IP and I want to change it to a dynamic IP, how can I do that? I tried with the CMD commands but it's not possible. There are other options?
The ISP assigns you IP address so you can't change via cmd and continue with normal . Just request them for dhcp connection and they'll do it for you !!
