★Is it a problem to have both my cable modem and my router configured to use DHCP?Or should the cable modem be configured to be a bridge?  What's the impact of either setting?
So long as the configurations of multiple DHCP servers on a single Local Area Network are either: coordinated (they're serving up the exact same data, so it doesn't matter which one answers), or disjoint (they each only answer for an exclusive set of computers, e.g. by MAC Addresses)there is no problem. If the DHCP servers conflict (e.g. they both believe they have exclusive right to assign a given IP address to any computer that asks), then you'll have connectivity problems.
