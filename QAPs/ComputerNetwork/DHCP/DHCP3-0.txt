â˜…How can I configure static DHCP on a Netgear WNDR3400v3?
I believe the OP is referring to a reserved DHCP address whereby the router hands out the same IP address to the same device each time it connects. Without seeing the exact management screen it's hard to say but in my Netgear router you select the option with a tick box and enter the MAC of the device and the IP you would like to allocate to it. Each time that device then connects to the router the DHCP process gives it the reserved IP and not the next available in the DHCP range. Update: Look under Advanced/Setup/LAN Setup and see the Address Reservation section.
