★Is it a problem to have both my cable modem and my router configured to use DHCP?Or should the cable modem be configured to be a bridge?  What's the impact of either setting?
Probably not. If your wiring runs broadband to cable modem. Cable modem to broadband router. Router to your wired and wireless network, then no. It's not a problem. The only issue you might run into are protocols that are complex and need special handling like VoIP (NOT Skype) and some gaming protocols.
