★Why would DHCP be considered a layer 7 (application layer) protocol when the sole purpose of the DHCP is to manage IP addresses?Shouldn't this protocol be part of Layer 3 (network layer) where packets are assigned source and destination IPs?
DHCP belongs in layer 7 because it's an application in and of itself.  It uses lower layers for various functions, ie discovery happens at layer 2 or 3 (relaying) but DHCP does much more than discovery.  For example, it talks to DNS servers via DDNS updates as part of the standard.  The entire "managing of IP addresses" is an application level function.
