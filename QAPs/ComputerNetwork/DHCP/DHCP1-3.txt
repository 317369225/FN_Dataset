â˜…What is the best free DHCP server software for Windows?I want to network multiple devices to a Windows computer. I would prefer to connect everything to a cheap low-power switch/hub, rather than using a hardware router. The other devices will be expecting to get IP addresses via DHCP. What's the best free software to run on the Windows machine to make these assignments? Is this built into Windows XP/Vista/7 somewhere?
You can use the windows built-in "Internet Connection Sharing" http://windows.microsoft.com/en-...
