★How can I change my public IP from static to dynamic (DHCP)?My ISP give my a static IP and I want to change it to a dynamic IP, how can I do that? I tried with the CMD commands but it's not possible. There are other options?
Looking at the other responses... I think the more direct and most simple answer is you need to call your ISP to inquire.  (There are a few variables that need to be known to answer the question, and they will know all of them.  First, your ISP needs to have a DHCP server.) Who is your ISP / what type of connection do you have? I can only assume, but the way you word your question ... you either have a business class service or you have a small type ISP.  (Residential cable seems unlikely.) My curiosity: why do you want to switch from static to dynamic? Having a static IP is not a realistic security or privacy consideration.  Sure, it makes it a little easier for some people and uses to associate a person to a computer, but overall the static IP has very little affect on your privacy or security.  What I'm trying to say -- changing your IP address is of little to no security/privacy value, except for some very specific and limited cases.
