â˜…How do you write a program (C++\Python\Java) to install a DHCP server on a remote machine?
I think your question boils down to installing software on a remote machine. That software just happens to be a DHCP server. The solution would depend on your environment: is the remote system running Windows/Linux? Also, do you really want to write a program to do this? For Windows Server 2012 - on both the remote system and the one on which you are working - the 'Add roles/features' dialog allows you to connect to a remote server and add the DHCP role to it. For a flavor of Linux, say Ubuntu - on the remote system - you can simply open an SSH connection and execute the following command: sudo apt-get install dhcp3-server Presumably, you would also want to then configure it - which can be done by creating a configuration file locally and then pushing it to: /etc/default/dhcp3-server Now let's say you do actually want to write a program to do this: PythonUse Paramiko to open an SSH connection and fire the command PowerShellUse the Servermanager module. See Page on microsoft.com for some help. C++/JavaThis isn't really a low-level computing problem - it's more of a sysadmin and infrastructure management problem. I wouldn't recommend using a language like C++/Java to do this - use a scripting language instead. Also, speaking of sysadmin, take a look at SaltStack | Systems, Configuration and Cloud Management
