★What is the best free DHCP server software for Windows?I want to network multiple devices to a Windows computer. I would prefer to connect everything to a cheap low-power switch/hub, rather than using a hardware router. The other devices will be expecting to get IP addresses via DHCP. What's the best free software to run on the Windows machine to make these assignments? Is this built into Windows XP/Vista/7 somewhere?
The Windows "Server" implemetations have a built in DHCP server that is easy to configure.  The "Workstation" implementations do not.  TFTP32 (an opensource IPv6 ready TFTP server/service for windows : TFTP server) has a built in DHCP server and can also serve as a syslog and TFTP server if you need those functions. However, hardware routers are stupidly cheap these days and significantly more power efficient than leaving a PC running around the clock and most add built in hun and 802.11 wireless as well.  A low power embedded appliance is probably a better choice in the long run.
