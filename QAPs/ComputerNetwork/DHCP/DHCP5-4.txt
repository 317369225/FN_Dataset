★Should I setup my home router to use DHCP or static IP?
You also need to clarify if you are talking about the inside network adapter or the external network adapter.  Either can be static or use DHCP - most broadband providers supply you with a Public IP address via DHCP and then the inside adapter on the router is static and a private IP address - most commonly 192.168.1.1 and then the inside network adapter is also a DHCP server with a DHCP scope which allows you to easily add new devices and if those new devices are using DHCP they will pick up an IP address from the Inside of the Router via wired or wireless connections. With DHCP you lose some admission control to your network - you can limit the DHCP scope so that only five IP addresses are allowed to be given out and then if a sixth device tries to connect, it will fail to get an IP address but this would not prevent someone from guessing at your IP scheme and using a static IP to access your router. With statics - you get a much more consistent IP addressing scheme, your Laptop if assigned a .10 will always be a .10 but when you go to your local coffee shop, you will have to flip over to DHCP to pick up an address there and then put back in your .10 back at your home. I would recommend DHCP.
