★What IP address does a client use as source IP address while making a DHCP request and where does the DHCP server send the reply to?
Tony Li is correct for the initial phase of DHCP, but I'll answer for a DHCP renewal in which case the client will already have an IP address.  In that case, and assuming the client is behaving correctly, it will use the IP address that was leased to it by the DHCP server and the server will reply to that address.  Its important to understand that this process happens halfway through the assigned lease time.  If the client goes through its entire lease time and is unable to renew its lease it will fall back to layer 2 communication using its MAC address as the source as it no longer has a valid IP lease.
