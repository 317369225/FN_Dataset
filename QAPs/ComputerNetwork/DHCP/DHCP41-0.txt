â˜…How can I ssh between two Linux machines that use DHCP for address resolution?I am using a wimax internet modem.
You can set this up using DNS. Your DHCP server is most likely capable of functioning as a DNS server as well, in which case it can simply save entries for any IP address it leases. Whenever a new address is leased, it will update the DNS database. This allows you to access any other host within your domain via the hostname, which the DHCP/DNS server will kindly resolve for you. Alternatively, you can configure your DHCP to prefer certain IP addresses for requests coming from specific MAC addresses, allowing you to make sure the IP address stays the same after multiple leases.
