â˜…How do I switch from a STATIC IP to a DHCP IP?I am running a Virtual Machine currently having a STATIC IP.. I need to switch it temporarily to DHCP to access my office server... How do I do this without removing my current STATIC settings. I am running CentOS 6.6 on my VM. Any suggestions.. I'm very new at this.. Thanks
I don't think you can use a DHCP at the same time while you still have a STATIC IP in place. Better idea would be to make a note of the Static IPs on some Notepad and then delete it to set the IP to Auto-Select, so that your VM would start looking for a DHCP server to obtain an IP from its' DHCP pool.
