â˜…What are good layer 3 switches that handle DHCP server functions?
For Cisco, see page 1 of http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solut... With that said, and even though no Cisco Layer 3 switches come with "LAN Lite," I want to say for posterity that I would avoid it. I'm also not 100% sure it includes the IOS DHCP Server feature. Everything else on that page has basic DHCP Server functionality. Be careful with Dell PowerConnect. Some models like the 6224 and 6248 support DHCP Relay and some other DHCP related features, but I'm not aware of any fixed switches from Dell that run a DHCP Server. Same goes for HP Procurve.
