★Should I setup my home router to use DHCP or static IP?
Both!  I recommend using DHCP, but setting it to use static IP addressing (so it always assigns the same IP address to each computer that connects). This will come in handy later when you start sharing files between computers, because you'll always know which computer is which address.  For example, I recently setup a box near my TV to stream movies from my home PC, and for that I need to know my PC's IP address.  Even though my PC connects with DHCP to my router, it will always work, because the IP address never changes. And anytime you connect a new device (like when someone comes over with their laptop), the router will automatically give them a new address.
