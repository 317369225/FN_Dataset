★What is a proxy server and how  does it work?
A proxy server is a service that takes a request and performs it on behalf of the user or another service. In some cases, this proxy server may cache the results in order to speed up the same requests from either the same and/or other users/services. The idea of proxies in computing have been around for awhile, but really seemed to have hit their peak with the advent of the World Wide Web. Here, most proxies did act as Caching servers in order to speed up requests for larger organizations. Additionally,  Content Filtering capabilities prevented access to illegal and/or illicit content as well as providing network-wide Ad Blocking. In the case of HTTP, proxies basically work by rewriting the request header to show that the proxy is actually doing the request. You can think of it as an authorized version of the classic Man in the Middle (communications attack) security attack.    Embed Quote
