★How do proxy servers work? And, why most college campuses provide internet through proxy servers?Please explain the technical aspects of the Networking that goes in operation of proxy servers.
I have only worked with Squid.http://www.squid-cache.org/ But this is what is going on. You type in www.quora.com into your web browser. That request is intercepted by the proxy server which goes to the site retrieves the page and then uses its web server to show you the page. You never go to the site, the site comes to the proxy and the proxy servers the site to you. Not sure about why colleges use them but I assume its for the same reason a lot of entities use them Security. The Sysadmin can control just exactly what flows through the proxy. Anonymity. Quora's web server only sees the ip address of the proxy. Control who you can visit. I can tell the proxy not to serve you Quora and you would get a message saying something like "site unavailable" Caching. I can save bandwidth if I cache a web site, especially a static one as the proxy's web server will already have the page, and will not have to retrieve it again. Malware. I can intercept crap at the proxy, so you don't become a victim. Avoiding the "Great Firewall of China" Ok, colleges aren't going to do this but a proxy can be used to get around limits on what you can do on the Internet. Also, can be used quite effectively to circumvent most Internet laws being passed by Congress. Kitty porn for example. You go to a site that is porn free and get all the porn you need anonymously. I digress here. Load balancing. Avoidance of NAT. Rather than using Network Address Translation the proxy keeps you on your private network. NAT can get messy on a large network.    Embed Quote
