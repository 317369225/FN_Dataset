★Is there any sort of proxy server service that gives you a USA IP address?iPredator.se always assigns its clients a swedish IP Address which will break sites like Hulu.com. Is there a similar service that gives you a US IP Address?
I always Prefer "Hotsopt Shield" free vpn proxy, as an encrypted tunnel between your computer/Mac/Android/iPhone and our Hotspot Shield server in the U.S secures your web data transfers. Your downloads, instant messages, bank information, passwords and other online activities are carried out behind Hotspot Shield's safety cover and away from inquisitive eyes on the internet.
