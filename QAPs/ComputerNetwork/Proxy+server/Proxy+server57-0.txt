★Why do people use Kamailio as the SIP proxy server?
On an application perspective I m suggesting one of the purposes. Kamailio is deployed by VoIP providers to handle huge volume of concurrent calls, by peering to other VoIP providers. A routing  table is created  on the interconnection and hence  least cost routing is formed on preferences and weights. In the below scenario Kamailio server interconnects calls from asterisk with prefix 33 to Peer A. In case if we have multiple providers for prefix 33.. on kamailio  then the calls are either load balanced or  routed based on the preferences done on LCR. Peer A (call to 33 prefix) ---> Kamailio server<---- Asterisk UA (dials 33..) The VoIP providers could be  registrars and SIP gateways. IP based authentication and sip accounts could be created on the Kamailio. The Sip agents like Asterisk, soft-phone connect to the Kamailio server, authenticate and place calls. Many features are available other than the one stated above. Kamailio (OpenSER) SIP Server    Embed Quote
