★What are the disadvantages of using a proxy server?
It can depend on the context it is being used in. Proxys server two totally different roles in a business/enterprise environment and in home/personal networks. In a business network, there are very few disadvantages--proxy's in this setting serve to cache content on the internet that was previously accessed by another client, provide isolation for internal hosts from the internet and thus improving security, and restrict access to the internet--or certain content on the internet--from the corporate LAN. If anything, the disadvantage in this setting is added complexity in getting certain services to work through the proxy (if this is something you are forced to do; typically a network is designed to only force certain traffic through the proxy) For personal use, many would utilize a proxy to provide, to an extent, some form of anonymity on the internet. Very few advantages here, as there will increased latency in most cases, and certain content may be filtered out (can be a good or bad thing). Also, trust is a major issue: the proxy server has the ability to log, capture, and track your activities, and if it is hosted by less-than-honest entities, the information you send over it could be used to cause damage.    Embed Quote
