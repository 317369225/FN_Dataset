★How do proxy servers work? And, why most college campuses provide internet through proxy servers?Please explain the technical aspects of the Networking that goes in operation of proxy servers.
The truth of the matter is that proxies are used everywhere and you are almost gauranteed to go through one if you are online.  Every major ISP uses proxies and most government also implement proxies - these are for tracking purposes. Other proxies are used to hide your identity or change your location but those are not mainstreamed and are only now really growing in popularity as people attempt to overcome censorship online (censorship by the way that is enabled using proxies). Finally, large corporations (i.e. IE InPrivate Browsing) provide the ability to block cookies and certain types of malware by passing your traffic through what are called public proxies.    Embed Quote
