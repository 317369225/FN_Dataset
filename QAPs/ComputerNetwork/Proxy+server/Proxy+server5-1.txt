★What motivates someone to host a free proxy server?There are proxy servers that folks use to access Hulu from outside the US. These proxy servers will have some major bandwidth and electricity usage....what motivates someone to host such a free proxy server.
In addition to the other answers, in my experience often  it's pretty much accidental. If you set up an internal proxy incorrectly it can easily become accessible to the outside world.  Internal network changes, updating a server, installing some software which enables a proxy or even installs one. A single line on a firewall can enable an 'accidental proxy server'.  Some versions of windows install and configure IIS automatically.  Often you'll find PCs operating as proxies inadvertantly too. Often it's only when they start getting overloaded with traffic that network administrators notice.    Embed Quote
