★Why do proxy servers exist?Free Proxy Lists This website has a whole list. Why do these servers even exist? How does this website find those servers? Does this website crawl the entire web?
Wikipedia has the best answer to your question - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro... A proxy server has a variety of potential purposes, including: To keep machines behind it anonymous, mainly for security. To speed up access to resources (using caching). Web proxies are commonly used to cache web pages from a web server. To prevent downloading the same content multiple times (and save bandwidth). To log / audit usage, e.g. to provide company employee Internet usage reporting. To scan transmitted content for malware before delivery. To scan outbound content, e.g., for data loss prevention. To bypass website restrictions at work. Access enhancement/restriction To apply access policy to network services or content, e.g. to block undesired sites. To access sites prohibited or filtered by your ISP or institution. To bypass security / parental controls. To circumvent Internet filtering to access content otherwise blocked by governments. To allow a web site to make web requests to externally hosted resources (e.g. images, music files, etc.) when cross-domain restrictions prohibit the web site from linking directly to the outside domains. To allow the browser to make web requests to externally hosted content on behalf of a website when cross-domain restrictions (in place to protect websites from the likes of data theft) prohibit the browser from directly accessing the outside domains. the website you mentioned earlier can use two methods to gather the proxy lists: 1. use a web scraper PHP script and then publish the results 2. use a software that do the scraping, and then publish manually the proxy lists.    Embed Quote
