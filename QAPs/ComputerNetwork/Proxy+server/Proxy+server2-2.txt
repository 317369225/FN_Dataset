★How do proxy servers work? And, why most college campuses provide internet through proxy servers?Please explain the technical aspects of the Networking that goes in operation of proxy servers.
My school (SIUE)  does not provide general proxy server access, but this is not to say that they do not use them. The school is large and remote enough where all the campus internet goes through a campus ISP.  However, the school has proxy servers set up for two reasons: Metering Access: The school provides a proxy server for off-campus students to log into so they can get into locked access sites, such as databases.  These sites check point of origin as the authentication, so routing the traffic through the school makes it work out. User authentication:  All wireless routers have a local proxy server that will deny general internet access until the student logs in with correct credentials.However, being an ISP means that we have certain controls as well, for example, we handle DMCA complaints.  What it comes down to is access control.    Embed Quote
