★What are ways to post/share on facebook through a proxy server which blocks facebook.com?I want to share articles/links on facebook through corporate net where facebook is blocked. I am looking for some third party app/website or social network aggregator that will allow me to do this.
you have to set a private proxy in your browser. this way you can bypass the blocked websites. i use for this ninjasproxy.com/private-proxy.    Embed Quote
