★What motivates someone to host a free proxy server?There are proxy servers that folks use to access Hulu from outside the US. These proxy servers will have some major bandwidth and electricity usage....what motivates someone to host such a free proxy server.
there are 2 main reasons to host a web free proxy server: 1. advertising revenues (adsense, adf.ly and others) from website traffic; 2. personal data theft (email, usernames/passwords, credit card information andmore) from the clients. that's why, i always use a paid private proxy to surf websites like hulu, netflix or pandora. you should try proxyninjas.com.    Embed Quote
