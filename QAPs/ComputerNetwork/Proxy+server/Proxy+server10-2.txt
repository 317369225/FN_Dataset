★Why are most proxy servers so slow?And is there a way or technique to develop a proxy that is close to "real" speed. I am talking about serving millions of users daily here, and not about optimizing a proxy for a few people.
it depends on the provider. I use private proxies from http://instantproxies.com and never have problem with the speed.    Embed Quote
