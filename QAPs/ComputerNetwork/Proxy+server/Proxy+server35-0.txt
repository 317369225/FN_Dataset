★Is it legal to host a proxy server even if it strips advertisements away?
It is not actually illegal to host proxy servers at all.  In fact your ISP (Verizon, Comcast, etc...) all use proxy servers for all of their traffic.  The government thoroughly uses proxy servers and you can fairly easily connect to public proxy servers (i.e. ones that block some forms of cookies but still promote your identity out the the world) through IE directly. There is nothing inherent is most proxy software that entails ad generation - people often place CPM-based banner ads on their sites to illicitely obtain revenues.  This is still not actually illegal - but the banner ad agencies will shut you down and lock you out of their network once they figure out what you are doing.   Proxy servers are akin to guns - they are not illegal at all and depending on how you use them, you are not doing anything wrong.  That said, so many people have misused proxies in the past that network providers are very wary of allowing people to walk around with a loaded weapon.    Embed Quote
