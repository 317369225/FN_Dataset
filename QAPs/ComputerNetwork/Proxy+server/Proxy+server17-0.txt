★How does a proxy server work?
In a computer network, a proxy server is any computer system offering a service that acts as an intermediary between the two communicating parties, the client and the server. In the presence of a proxy server, there is no direct communication between the client and the server. Instead, the client connects to the proxy server and sends requests for resources such as a document, web page or a file that resides on a remote server. The proxy server handles this request by fetching the required resources from the remote server and forwarding the same to the client. If you are not convinced, lets we go down to have another way of explanation. The proxy (technically a proxy) server is a PC that may pass as a good intermediary between computer and also the web. Any visitors routed via a proxy servers will appear in the future from the Internet protocol address, not really your own computer’s. Also, proxy machines do not need to commit resources in order to encrypting all visitors that passes via all of them, and for that reason can acknowledge simultaneous connections from the large number of more customers (typically many thousands)    Embed Quote
