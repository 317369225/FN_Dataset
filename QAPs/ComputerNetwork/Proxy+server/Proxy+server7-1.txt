★School internet goes through a proxy server, how do I get out?
The first question to ask is not what is possible, but what is allowed.  Is your school open to students circumventing the proxy?  Is it for convenience or is there a legal reason that they are enforcing the proxy?  Many schools have a "terms of use" around their networks and while you *could* technically circumvent their proxy, it may also be the thing to get you disciplined or expelled. I recommend doing a little more research first about what the rules are, and understand the ramifications before trying any of these tips. I know that is not the answer that you wanted, but part of what you are paying for in the school should be education for life - welcome to it.  When you get into the work world, you'll have the same situation.    Embed Quote
