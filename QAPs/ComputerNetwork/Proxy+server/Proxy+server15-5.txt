★Where can I find a reliable proxy server to use at work?My office has been questioning the use of Facebook, Twitter and yes, even Quora amongst employees. I will not abuse it; but I would like a good workaround, that works well within the U.S. preferably.
Proxy servers are not made to be used for these purposes. They are made to keep your identity safe and let you to access those information that you are banned from. It is easy to recognize these days and see if some one is using a proxy server to access your web site or not, For example there are some websites , that when you try to access them using a proxy server they will show you a notice that you can't try this site using a proxy and you need to connect directly to the site's web server. But about hacking business you need to know that most of the hacks are done directly the only thing that makes investigation a hard reaction is that the hacker removes all the traces by an encrypted, unique method. and it really doesn't matter for hacker if he is using a proxy server or not. www.proxy-hub.com/ is one of the best source for reliable proxies. There is another point about Proxies that you need to know that most of the current proxies keep a record of their users for years and in some critical cases they will give away information. you can use private networks or VPNs sometimes. they are more secure for these purposes.    Embed Quote
