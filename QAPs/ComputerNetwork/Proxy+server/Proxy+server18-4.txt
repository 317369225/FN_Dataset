★How do I set up my Windows Server 2008 R2 server to be a proxy server?
Theres really nothing special about a http [reverse] proxy server.  All it really is is a piece of software which issues a http request on someones behalf and then forwards them the response obtained from the origin server. The client may or may not be aware that the server it is talking to is proxying requests on its behalf. Common proxy servers (or servers supporting reverse proxying): squid apache (via mod_proxy) nginx iis (via the application request routing module) (many others) One approach would be to install IIS, ARR, and then configure a rewrite rule. Setting up a Reverse Proxy using IIS, URL Rewrite and ARR IIS happens to be microsofts supported webserver.  You could, of course, use another server if you wish.    Embed Quote
