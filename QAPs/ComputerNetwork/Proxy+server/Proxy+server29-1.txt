★Are there any good logging proxy servers for web analytics?
Proxy server is not necessary. Just write some javascript to watch for the omniture pixel firing and then construct a second request to your own server containing all the same query string params. make sure that the web server has logging turned on. Every request will be a 404 but all the query string details will be captured in the logs. You may however need to configure your web server to add the user agent, and IP address into the log as those request attributes are usually recorded server side instead of being passed via the GET request. As for other headers, Omniture sets first party cookies they do not see the cookie headers and the referrer is passed as part of their GET request I believe. Or you could give Open Web Analytics (http://www.openwebanalytics.com) a try... ;)    Embed Quote
