★Where can I find a reliable proxy server to use at work?My office has been questioning the use of Facebook, Twitter and yes, even Quora amongst employees. I will not abuse it; but I would like a good workaround, that works well within the U.S. preferably.
The real question is when it comes down to it, would you rather use a web proxy (such as web based proxy) or a HTTP proxy where you tunnel regular browsing through. Both run the risk of the site owner "capturing the data", but if I had to choose I'd just buy a VPN and call it a day. Regardless of what you choose, I'd check out http://hidemyass.com - they have Proxies & VPN's as well. If you had to use a web one, just Google "myspace proxy" because you know they'll support web forms & cookies and you should be fine ongoing from there. It's just all about how much you value your FB/Twitter/etc login vrs how much you'd use them. Hope it helps. :)    Embed Quote
