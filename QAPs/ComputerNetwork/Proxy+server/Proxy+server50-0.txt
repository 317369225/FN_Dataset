★What are some good ways to bypass the url filtering in a squid proxy server?There is a squid proxy server using url filtering in our university. It is so stupid that it blocks any url if some words like 'game', 'sex', etc is in the url.  It also blocks facebook, youtube as well. Also, it only allows http/https traffic to ports 80/443. Pls suggest ways to bypass this filtering
use Anonymity Online TOR routing system. VPN is another option.    Embed Quote
