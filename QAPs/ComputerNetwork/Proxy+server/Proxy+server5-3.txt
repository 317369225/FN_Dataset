★What motivates someone to host a free proxy server?There are proxy servers that folks use to access Hulu from outside the US. These proxy servers will have some major bandwidth and electricity usage....what motivates someone to host such a free proxy server.
Many of the "free" proxies are run by those who just want to gather personal information for identity theft or credit card fraud.  I wouldn't trust them at all.  I use a great proxy service that is very reliable, has multiple servers to choose from in the US, Canada and the Netherlands, and the subscription price is very reasonable.  They even offer a 7 day free trial so you can check it out for yourself.  See link below: Privacy Partners    Embed Quote
