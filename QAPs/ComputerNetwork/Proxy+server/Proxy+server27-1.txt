★Does proxy servers like kproxy and savemyass completely hide your IP address?How do they work?
Thanks for the A2A. Sachin Kamath has given a good explanation as to what a proxy server is and how it works. Do these services completely hide your IP? NO. What a proxy server is doing is acting as a gateway between you and the website you intend to use. It acts like a middleman masking your IP from the websites. But there are other ways. Proxy server (Transparent Proxy) can transmit your IP using X-Forwarded-For HTTP header.  It is a standard for identifying the originating IP address of a client communicating with a web server through HTTP proxy. While I am not sure of HideMyAss or KProxy specifically, the gist is that not all proxy servers can hide your IP address. Even cookies like Evercookie can be used. This depends on the websites you visit using the proxy server. Evercookie has even been used to track TOR(widely considered one of the best tool for anonymity) users. And then there are browser extensions. They leave a fingerprint. (Ever wondered why a browser disables them by default in Private/Incognito mode?) Again, not specific to HideMyAss or KProxy, but HTTP proxy does give away a lot of information.    Embed Quote
