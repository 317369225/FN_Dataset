★What is a good proxy server to use?what is proxy server?
"In computer networks, a proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource available from a different server and the proxy server evaluates the request as a way to simplify and control its complexity. Proxies were invented to add structure and encapsulation to distributed systems." - Wikipedia Proxy server You should definitively try our private proxy service - http://www.ninjasproxy.com to use with any SEO tools.    Embed Quote
