★How can I set up a HTTPS proxy server on Ubuntu?Please specify all the minimal instructions to set up a basic HTTPS proxy server on Ubuntu, not just pointing to a program.
Install squid ( http://www.squid-cache.org/ ), that is ready to be installed through software center/apt-get. It was the default http/https proxy in linux for decades, pretty mature and stable. That should be enough to get that proxy for your local PC. To enable it for your local, internal network, you should need to edit the file /etc/squid3/squid.conf, and uncomment the lines that describe your local network in the acl section i.e. acl localnet src 10.0.0.0/8 enable that local network to use the proxy http_access allow localnet and reload the configuration sudo service squid3 reload With that should be able to set it in the browsers of your network as proxy at the port 3128 for all the protocols, including https. There is a lot more tuning that can be done with it, the configuration file is well commented on available options, and there are a lot of nice addons included in the ubuntu repositories, like dansguardian for filtering access or sarg for log analysis.    Embed Quote
