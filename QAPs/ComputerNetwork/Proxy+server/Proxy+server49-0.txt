★Will HTTPS secure data transferred via a proxy server?In other words, will the proxy server be able to view my data or will it be encrypted for them as well?
That depends on the proxy. The way https normally works, the web browser does not care that the site has the correct  certificate, as long as it has a valid one. So when you connect to a proxy, the proxy might pass the request encrypted to the destination. Or it might terminate the connection itself, replying with a certificate for the destination website that it just generated itself, and then start a second encrypted connection to the destination. In which case it would be able to view or modify your data. Some intrusion detection firewalls work like this - companies may install them to filter viruses and malware from "secure" web connections, or to detect someone uploading trade secrets or sensitive information to the internet. If you want to protect yourself against this possibility, you need to verify the certificate path with certificate pinning, or manually check the certificate fingerprint when you connect. See for instance Certificate and Public Key Pinning    Embed Quote
