★How do I play Counter-Strike 1.6 online behind college proxy server?Spotflux, Vidalia, Proxifier and Ultrasurf.These 4 are not working for me.:(
I'm not sure but you can give it a try. I used to do this to use International DC++ servers which were also not allowed through proxy as the port was banned. You can use TOR(precisely Vidalia). When you start Tor/vidalia it creates a local SOCKS proxy and all the traffic is masked. I used to connect to that socks proxy to use DC++ and yes I was also able to play CRYSIS 2 multiplayer demo using this. If that also does not works than you can use proxifier on top of that as it will take care of the username password thing that you have to enter to access your proxy server. I,m not sure about both methods for CS 1.6 but they worked fine for me even in case of steam games.    Embed Quote
