★Is there any sort of proxy server service that gives you a USA IP address?iPredator.se always assigns its clients a swedish IP Address which will break sites like Hulu.com. Is there a similar service that gives you a US IP Address?
I use the proxy servers at Private Proxy | Anonymous Proxy | Secure Proxy Servers.  Depending on the plan you choose, you have a choice of many static and rotating IP addresses in the US.  You also can choose IP addresses in Canada and the Netherlands.  All information sent out over their servers is encrypted.  I'm very satisfied with the service.  At the site, there is also a blog that has some very useful information and there is also an offer for a free Privacy Guide.
