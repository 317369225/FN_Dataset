★How can I create a simple proxy server in Java?can it be created without socket programming
You probably will need socket programming.  Don't worry though... socket programming is really easy in Java. What you need to do is create a server that binds to a particular port and listens for connections.  When it gets a connection, it should read requests.  When it gets a request, it should parse it to determine which server/port the request is for.  It should then connect to that server, forward the request, wait for a response, and send the response back to the client.    Embed Quote
