★What are some good ways to bypass the url filtering in a squid proxy server?There is a squid proxy server using url filtering in our university. It is so stupid that it blocks any url if some words like 'game', 'sex', etc is in the url.  It also blocks facebook, youtube as well. Also, it only allows http/https traffic to ports 80/443. Pls suggest ways to bypass this filtering
I use tor to get over the restrictions. But since tor is extremely slow, I use polipo (a caching proxy) between my browser and tor. It also provides an HTTP proxy over the SOCKS proxy of tor. Add to /etc/polipo/config socksParentProxy = "localhost:9050" socksProxyType = socks5 Add to /etc/tor/torrc HTTPProxy proxy_address:port HTTPSProxy proxy_address:port HTTPProxyAuthenticator username:password HTTPSProxyAuthenticator username:password Point browser to localhost:8123 (polipo)    Embed Quote
