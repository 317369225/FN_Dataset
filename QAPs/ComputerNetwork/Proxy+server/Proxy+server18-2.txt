★How do I set up my Windows Server 2008 R2 server to be a proxy server?
Since Windows Server 2008 R2 does not have an ISA (Internet Security & Acceleration) server built in you would need to setup one. Here is a resource on ISA: http://www.isaserver.org/ Microsoft has a resource on ISA at: http://www.microsoft.com/forefro... Another solution is using Squid. Here is the main Windows source for Squid: http://squid.acmeconsulting.it/ The site is in Italian, but you can use translate if you need. A source to read would be: http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
