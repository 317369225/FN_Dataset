★School internet goes through a proxy server, how do I get out?
There is usually a reason to set up a proxy. Nobody does this for the pleasure of making people's life difficult, or because he or she is a communist fan -- at least in UK and many other countries. You will often find a legal case behind such service (the institution may have a requirement for a best-effort filtering of pornography involving minors for instance) A proxy can be bypassed, it is easier or more difficult depending on the setup. Before jumping into the various provided solutions I would first go to the IT person and report the issues, they may not be aware of them.    Embed Quote
