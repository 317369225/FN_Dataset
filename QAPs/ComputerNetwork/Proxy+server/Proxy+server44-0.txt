★How will you Explain the Proxy servers in a Layman terms?
Imagine you're a kid at school, and you want to ask someone out on a date, but you don't want to do it yourself. So, you ask someone else to ask for you. The person you asked to ask for you was a Proxy. Now imagine you're using your Web browser, but you don't want anyone else to know what you're looking at. So, you configure your computer/browser to send a request to a Proxy Server (your friend), which will then send the request to the web server (the person you want to ask on a date). Then the web server sends the website back to the proxy, which sends it back to you. There are different kinds of proxies, varying from simple HTTP proxies, which only proxy web traffic, to SOCKS proxies, which will proxy other types of traffic (IRC, HTTPS, SSH, Telnet, RDP, etc.) in addition to HTTP. You can even go all the way up to a VPN, in which all traffic between you and the VPN is encrypted.    Embed Quote
