★Why is my computer unable to connect to the proxy server?I am using a VPN network not a LAN and I have these extensions which I delete but whenever I restart chrome they all come back again please help
Firstly, because you tell me in the comments on your question that you are on Windows, you can check the proxy settings: Go to Control Panel > Internet Options > Connections. Under the section "Dial-up and Virtual Private Network settings", you should see an entry for each of your configured VPN connections. Select the applicable one and click "Settings". Here you can configure proxy settings for the specific VPN connection. Secondly, I believe the Chrome plugins you mention in your comment have nothing to do with your connectivity issues. They sound like malware or junkware. If, for example, I search for "takesave extension chrome" on Google, I find the following page: How to remove "Ads by Save On" virus (Removal Guide). Similarly, I suggest searching for something related to "unisales". Add "malware" to the search query, e.g. "unisales malware" to find a solution for removing these plugins. E.g. searching for "unisales malware" gives me the following page as one of the search results: Remove UniSales - Junkware Removal.    Embed Quote
