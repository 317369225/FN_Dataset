★School internet goes through a proxy server, how do I get out?
From my understanding, the ability to access the internet while bypassing the proxy would be impossible unless you had a physical connection in-front of the proxy. As for the download speeds, sounds like this would be slow during peak times, because you are sharing the link with hundreds of other users and as for the faster downloads, the proxy may very well have cached them locally, so you are not even leaving the Campus LAN to download. That is very common for these types of networks. One trick i can suggest is to use the IP address of the site instead of the Domain Name, depending on the configuration you may be able to bypass blocked sites this way. Just run a simple ping of the website and the command line should display the IP with the return echo. Goodluck.    Embed Quote
