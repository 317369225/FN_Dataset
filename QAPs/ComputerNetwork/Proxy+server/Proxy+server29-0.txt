★Are there any good logging proxy servers for web analytics?
Peter raises some great options, absolutely. But before you start down this path, I would have a frank discussion with Omniture themselves; they're already collecting this data using your existing configuration, so why should you have to do anything more to get a copy of your own raw data? They may charge some fee against this kind of a data feed, which I would weigh against the costs of added development and testing for implementing another solution. Overall, when I'm in a relationship with a vendor where I'm paying them quite a bit of money, I always see answering these kinds of challenges as a natural part of the value they should be offering. Best of luck!    Embed Quote
