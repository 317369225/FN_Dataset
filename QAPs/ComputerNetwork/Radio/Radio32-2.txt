★Why don't radio stations play better songs?I can find such great songs through the internet but not on the radio.
The most creative, interesting music usually takes a number of hearings before it can be fully appreciated, or even liked. Radio stations don't want their listeners to change stations, so they will not play challenging music. The most common exceptions (in the U.S.) are the better college stations.    Embed Quote
