★Why hasn't satellite radio displaced terrestrial radio?
There is little added value for the consumer, same formats, same content, same sound quality but paying $13 a month for the privilege to receive it in an expensive player with -3 cool factor. The creators of Satellite radio tried to build a competitive advantage with distribution and not with content but realized too late that the main draw is content.   The result is a Meh service with crazy costs and talent choking the company to the point of extinction. Howard Stern contract is such a managerial absurdity that he might have collected over a billion when everything is said and done. http://www.hollywoodreporter.com... But they have little choice, they can't tell the difference between good and bad talent and how to recruit, groom and mature the people that will create future value for the company.   Nether they know the proceess to create value in the business. If you peek under the hood you realize that Satellite radio is very close to extinction, if Howard Stern is unable to perform or if one of the satelites is damaged ( something that happened before ) Sirius might have to declare bankrupcy.    Embed Quote
