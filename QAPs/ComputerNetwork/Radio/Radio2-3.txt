★Which radio stations around the world are closest to BBC Radio 4?
BBC Radio 4 is indeed in a class of its own when it comes to intelligent speech and its way of sharing ideas in a thoughtful way. I also value the comedy, especially in these dark days of recession....the News Quiz in particular. I use a wifi radio to listen to other stations around the world. I would argue that Czech Radio and ORF OE1 are their own jewels but you need language skills to appreciate what they're up to. I have been following some of the local ABC stations in Australia to hear how they are covering the terrible flooding. They are doing an excellent job. My biggest disappointment is to see the way speech radio has gone in South-East and South Asia. Its like being transported back 30 years.    Embed Quote
