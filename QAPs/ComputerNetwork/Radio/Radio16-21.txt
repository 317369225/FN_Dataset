★Why is Conservative talk radio so much more successful than its Liberal counterpart?Based on Arbitron data, eight of the top ten commercial programs are Conservative talk radio.  No Liberal talk radio programs are in the top ten.  Air America was the last Liberal attempt to gain a stronger market share and it was a dismal failure.  Why?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis...
Not enough liberal callers to make shows interesting I distinguish talk radio from other news and opinion programs by the air time given to callers expressing their opinions.  Talk radio depends on strong host personalities, like Rush Limbaugh, but also on callers saying things the audience finds funny or motivating or at least reinforcing.  Fox News is conservative and biased and broadcasts a lot of opinion but is not talk TV.  Morning Edition and All Things Considered have a liberal ethos but not much opinion and no call-ins. There's no liberal talk radio because there are many fewer Americans as far to the left as Limbaugh's callers are to the right.  This wasn't always true.  Back in the 60s and 70s (I'm OLD.  I remember those days.) there were lots of SDSers and Trotskyites.  But they all seem to be gone.  Public radio has some call-in shows - Talk Of the Nation, the Diane Rehm Show, and local lunch time programs - but the callers are never blasting the military or CIA conspiracies or union busting big businessmen or demanding radical income redistribution.  (I'm not for any of these things, but I remember when they were part of the public discourse.)    Embed Quote
