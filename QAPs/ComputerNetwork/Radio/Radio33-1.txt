★What are the top radio stations in Austin, TX?Respondents are kindly requested to provide some justification for their choice.
NPR content aside, my go-to for music is KUT 90.5FM, especially for Jay Trachtenberg (unlike most of Austin, I am not so much of a John Aielli fan). Here is their weekly schedule: http://kut.org/about/schedule. KVRX 91.7FM (student-run radio at UT) can be good too and classical on KMFA 89.5FM is good for a change of pace while in traffic.    Embed Quote
