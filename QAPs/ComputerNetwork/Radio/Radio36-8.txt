★What radio shows or podcasts are similar to This American Life?
I am not sure what aspects of This American Life you love. I shall assume it's the production values and the stories (as opposed to the American content) that being the case I can reccomend from BBC Radio4: - You and Yours - for investigations into consumer issues - Saturday Live - for the real life stories    Embed Quote
