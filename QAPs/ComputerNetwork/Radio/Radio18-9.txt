★Which hip hop songs can go into a radio friendly playlist for my kids?I'm putting together a hip hop playlist that I can play with my 2 young children in the background, without having to worry about them picking up foul language. I've been going through my hip hop collection but am struggling to find quality tracks without explicit language in them. Any suggestions (artists, tracks, albums) would therefore be very much appreciated!
My kids are quite young, so even "PG-rated" lyrics are not appropriate for them.  My solution is to play instrumental versions from YouTube.  Most major tracks have an instrumental version that give listeners the beats, melodies, and harmonies without any lyrics.  Kids learn to listen to the music instead of the (frequently age-inappropriate) message.  Dad likes the instrumental versions, too (boasting, sex, and materialism all have their place, but a little goes a long way).    Embed Quote
