★What is a better alternative to Pandora internet radio?
To find alternatives, you can segment the internet radio world by the programming function. Pandora, Last.fm and Slacker are examples of programming by algorithm.  The algorithm looks at your initial query, your likes & dislikes and adds some secret sauce to determine what to serve you next.  Over time they can learn your preferences fairly well.  However due to limitations of music library size and the algorithm, they're not as good as you move away from the mainstream.  I agree with Chris that you are likely to hear repeated songs sooner than you hoped. Accuradio provides curated stations.  Music programmers (usually former radio pros) program genre-specific stations.  I believe Slacker has added some curated stations as well.  Compared to the algorithmic stations, they will be truer to the genre, but won't learn your preferences.  Live365 (and the Shoutcast directory) provide independently-programmed stations.  A wide range of independent webcasters, ranging from hobbyists to prosumers to professionals offer enthusiastically programmed stations in a very wide range of genres.  This is the UGC part of the dial.  Sound and programming quality will vary on a station by station basis.  Some of the very best stations can be found here, but you have to hunt around. Jelli allows for real-time crowdsourcing of the programming function.  There are a number of stations available on their site/app which you can begin to help program right away.  Some of these stations are internet only, and some are simulcast on terrestrial stations.    Embed Quote
