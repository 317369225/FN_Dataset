★What is the future of radio?Should it move toward noncommercial community content? Should it race to the lowest common denominator (as much of it has)? Will the great content that is left move somewhere else?
I think in a near future, radio like many other things will shift to online, thus enabling people to contribute with their own radio shows, music and their own stations. It will be more of content contributed by users than users listening to the limited content available and the stream of advertisement.    Embed Quote
