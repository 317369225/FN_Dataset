★What radio shows or podcasts are similar to This American Life?
In my opinion, aside from Radiolab, the only podcasts produced as well as  This American LIfe are '99% Invisible'  with Roman Mars and 'The Memory Palace' with Nate Dimio (who I think MIGHT be the same person...Their voices sound so similar to me...but I have no other evidence to support me and some good evidence that contradicts me). To be sure, there are many other good podcasts which I love, but in terms of all around quality that anyone can enjoy regardless of their interest in the particular subject, only those two make the cut. (at least for my ears)    Embed Quote
