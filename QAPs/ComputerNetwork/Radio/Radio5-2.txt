★Is Internet radio really radio?
I think that one could say that streaming radio content is "radio" in the same way that cable television is television. In the past, before wired infrastructure was built out, both radio and television were delivered over-the-air. The defining quality of these media is that they are broadcast in real time (even if the content or playback are recorded). Podcasts and on-demand cable TV content blur the line a bit; they are not transmitted in real time. Pandora, in my opinion, is not radio because it is a customized (that is, non-broadcast) music service.    Embed Quote
