★Why is Conservative talk radio so much more successful than its Liberal counterpart?Based on Arbitron data, eight of the top ten commercial programs are Conservative talk radio.  No Liberal talk radio programs are in the top ten.  Air America was the last Liberal attempt to gain a stronger market share and it was a dismal failure.  Why?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis...
The truth is quite simple. Conservatives like to talk about the news, religion, and politics.  Most liberals--most not all--do not.  All my right-wing friends watch Fox News, read Drudge, etc.  Most of my liberal friends do not care for politics and rather focus on their personal lives.  If you go to a Tea Party gathering, those folks will give you 10 bullet points on why they are there.  Of course they could all be bullshit, but they at least have something.  Go to an Occupy Wall St. event and most of those people will have no clue why they are even there. I am generalizing, but this has been my experience over my 35 years of living.    Embed Quote
