★Why don't radio stations play better songs?I can find such great songs through the internet but not on the radio.
This could just mean that your tastes are not mainstream enough to support a viable commercial radio format. You may passionately feel that certain songs and artists are "better," but your preferences are not universal. Instead of focusing on the tastes of one person or a small group of people, broadcasters use audience research to find out what people (as large groups) prefer to hear on the radio. It may be possible, particularly if your tastes lean toward the more obscure or experimental, that your music is economically viable for a personalized service like Pandora but not for broadcast radio.    Embed Quote
