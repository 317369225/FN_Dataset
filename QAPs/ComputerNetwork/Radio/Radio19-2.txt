★How relevant is radio in your life?Music radio, talk radio, news / traffic radio? Please include a brief listening profile.  I'm curious to compare to my own.  If radio is not relevant at all, please explain why.  I am equally curious about that.
I listen to various talk programs almost daily, many "on air", and the rest on podcast, downloaded or cached on some device I can use in the car.  Political talk, and subject based talk, NPR stories, etc...  Easily 2 hours a day, usually while driving or fixing / building something. My music radio profile has changed.  Used to be daily, but now it's only mood based, once a week, maybe twice for a few hours. I do not make use of news / traffic radio at this time. AM radio is about 60 percent, with the balance being FM / Satellite.    Embed Quote
