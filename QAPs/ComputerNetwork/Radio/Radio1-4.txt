★What is the future of radio?Should it move toward noncommercial community content? Should it race to the lowest common denominator (as much of it has)? Will the great content that is left move somewhere else?
Given This American Life's recent move to become independent, it seems like that is the model most shows will adopt. The revenue model will be similar to Hulu Plus, supported by advertisements and premium access to previous content. For people who stay current on their show's, it's free, for others it's not. There will also be premium extras akin the the Live at BAM show that TAM recently did this summer.    Embed Quote
