★Why is Conservative talk radio so much more successful than its Liberal counterpart?Based on Arbitron data, eight of the top ten commercial programs are Conservative talk radio.  No Liberal talk radio programs are in the top ten.  Air America was the last Liberal attempt to gain a stronger market share and it was a dismal failure.  Why?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis...
One reason is that the demand for left-wing opinion is being filled by blogs. Looking at the Technorati rankings, we see The Huffington Post and Think Progress in the top 10 and the highest rated political blogs by far (surpassing all of the purportedly non-biased political blogs). Conservative blogs start at the #13 spot. http://technorati.com/blogs/top100/    Embed Quote
