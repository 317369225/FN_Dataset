★Which hip hop songs can go into a radio friendly playlist for my kids?I'm putting together a hip hop playlist that I can play with my 2 young children in the background, without having to worry about them picking up foul language. I've been going through my hip hop collection but am struggling to find quality tracks without explicit language in them. Any suggestions (artists, tracks, albums) would therefore be very much appreciated!
Good bets in general: De La Soul Biz Markie Eric B and Rakim DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince Everything before 1985 (Sugarhill Gang, Spoonie G, Treacherous 3, Grandmaster Flash, Fab Five Freddy) Current pop radio hits aimed at pre-teens are usually fine for little kids too, ie Willow Smith, Black Eyed Peas etc, though these may get on your nerves Instrumentals -- I especially recommend J Dilla and 9th Wonder Here are all the hip-hop tracks in my collection that I can certify to be kid-friendly, profanity-free, and most importantly, good music! I made the executive decision that kids can handle some minimal exposure to "hell" and "damn."
