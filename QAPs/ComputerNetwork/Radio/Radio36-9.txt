★What radio shows or podcasts are similar to This American Life?
There's a lot of great radio out there, but I don't think you'll find a single program that is able to do everything that This American Life does.  If you're looking for great radio documentaries, try the Fishko Files on WNYC.  I recommend the Jazz Loft Project.  You want something fun?  Try On the Media. Awesome investigative journalism?  Try Bill Moyer's Journal.  Planet Money, The Moth, Snap Judgement, and Radiolab are all awesome as well. But I think  This American Life is the only program that has all that wrapped up so perfectly into one neat package.  In Canada, we have a similar program on the CBC called "Definitely Not The Opera," or DNTO, and it offers a lot of personal stories like This American Life, but for whatever reason it just doesn't seem as good.  So, instead of looking for the one radio program that will satisfy you, I'd recommend picking a few and switching between them depending on your mood.  I'll admit, it's an awful lot like pouring chocolate syrup and milk in your mouth and mixing it together with your tongue to make chocolate milk, but if you search for that one podcast that does what TAL does, you'll be looking for a long time and will overlook some pretty good stuff.    Embed Quote
