★What is so fun about ham radio?
Having a ham radio license opens the bottle and the genie comes out with more than three wishes to give you. There is no need to "only" grab a mic and talk, actually a lot of hams don't even have a radio, but they are involved in courses, building equipment, teaching ham classes, learning Morse, and the possibilities are endless. Talk about families bonding together with radio. Equipment can be expensive, yes, but activities and reading involving ham radio are free and plentyful.    Embed Quote
