★Who is the best FM radio jockey in India?
I can't believe no one mentioned Sarthak on this!! Really like his stuff. Hit mornings and Jazz nights are amazing.. Gets upcoming artists on the radio too.. And the cow named Adam is also quite ironic and funny :D If he reads this he'd be like- Saturday afternoon chane ke jhaad pe maza aa ra hai!!    Embed Quote
