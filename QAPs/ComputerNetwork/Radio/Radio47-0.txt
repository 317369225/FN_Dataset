★What are some of the greatest radio documentaries?Radio channels such as ABC, the BBC, and CBC have long-running documentary series, as I'm sure, do others.
If you're looking for great radio documentaries and live storytelling podcasts (which could be considered a form of radio documentary too), these are my favorite points of departure: THIS AMERICAN LIFE www.thislife.org RADIOLAB www.radiolab.org THE MOTH www.themoth.org RISK http://risk-show.com/ MORTIFIED www.getmortified.com NPR www.npr.org You can also browse a huge collection of links to international radio docs here: http://www.netvibes.com/ifc If you're Dutch, check out the newly launched 'Dutch version of This American Life' (http://weblogs.vpro.nl/plots) or the podcasts from Moth-inspired live storytelling event Echt Gebeurd (http://echtgebeurdintoomler.nl) Finally, here's a nice transmedia / radio documentary you can watch, created in 2008 by Dutch documentary maker Bert Kommerij http://www.doclab.org/2008/flick... In 2007, I started IDFA DocLab (www.doclab.org) at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (www.idfa.nl). IDFA DocLab is a program to showcase new forms of documentary storytelling and technology. An important part of the program is devoted to new forms of radio documentary and live storytelling.
