★What is so fun about ham radio?
Though we take it for granted, radio is magic.  It's hard to imagine a world without it.  No wifi, no satellite communication, no cell phones, etc.  Amateur radio is about experimentation, challenge, and fun.  You can build as much or as little of the equipment as you like.  You meet lots of interesting people on and off the air.  You explore the corners of the world.  You help your community in an emergency.  There are virtually no limits to what you can learn and do.    Embed Quote
