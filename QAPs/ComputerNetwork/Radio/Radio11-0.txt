★What is so fun about ham radio?
Many of the things we take for granted were invented by hams. Example:The voting system in a cell tower that controls which tower handles a cell call. Talking to someone outside your area without the web with just your and their skill in guiding the connection is great. Every radio band has its tricks and charistics.  10 meter is different than 6m, 2m or 70cm. 2 meter has tropospheric ducting. 70cm has ice scatter. And 6 meter is just the magic band. Sometimes it behaves like VHF and sometimes HF. The camaraderie with other hams is amazing both in your country and internationally. Hams experiment with satellites and digital modes as well. I'm about to set up my Ham mesh network. Did anyone mentioned network 44? http://www.ampr.org/    Embed Quote
