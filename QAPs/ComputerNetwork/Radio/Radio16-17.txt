★Why is Conservative talk radio so much more successful than its Liberal counterpart?Based on Arbitron data, eight of the top ten commercial programs are Conservative talk radio.  No Liberal talk radio programs are in the top ten.  Air America was the last Liberal attempt to gain a stronger market share and it was a dismal failure.  Why?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis...
Because there are more conservatives than liberals: Liberal Self-Identification Edges Up to New High in 2013  Even though it did edge up in 2013 the total numbers are that 38% of Americans claim to be conservative to 23% that claim to be Liberal.  The potential audience is almost twice as large.  Add to the mix that many Conservatives believe that mainstream news tilts left and you have a recipe for rightwing radio success and leftwing failure!    Embed Quote
