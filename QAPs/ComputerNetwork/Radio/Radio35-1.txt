★Why is there no phase modulation radio?we have AM radio and FM radio, but Why is there no PM radio?
There is, but it's called FM.   Phase modulation is effectively the same as FM, but measured in the phase domain, instead of the frequency domain.    Then end result is identical except for rising FM with rising audio frequency, and that can be compensated out with a couple RC rolloff stages.    Most old "FM" radios like police, fire, and taxi radios, they almost all of them used a stable crystal as the frequency reference, then they used a phase modulator to generate the "FM".   The radio would be spec'ed as having "30KC FM deviation", but it was actually implemented as PM with high-frequency rolloff.    Embed Quote
