★How does radio work?I want to know the science behind the whole wireless technology. I'm not really from science background but have genuine interest in the subject so I would like to request an explanation that's simple yet elaborate.
ill just explain how a basic radio works. When you say radio I assume you mean that thing we use to listen to music. Nut that is actually a receiver and radios can also be transmitters(THe radio station uses transmitters). The transmitter sends a radio wave and the receiver receives it. There are two types of radio waves FM(frequency modulation) and AM(amplitude modulation). okay so lets say you are listening to 94.3. All around you there are radio waves of different channels but you hear only 94.3. How does that happen? Well you tune in to one frequency and block out the rest. Your radio does this by achieving resonance to the wave you want by using the only things a radio needs a capacitor and a inductor (also a register is needed).  Once you reach resonance the radio wave is sent to a speaker and you hear ads(Lets face it radio has more ads than music). This is so over simplified if you would want a bit detailed version ... How does a radio work?    Embed Quote
