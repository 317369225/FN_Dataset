★What's the best internet radio app for Mac?I'd have liked  a Tunein Radio desktop app but it doesn't look like there is one.
I'd recommend Radium 3, although it's Mountain Lion only and recently changed their icon from a lovely radio into a faintly ridiculous chocolate heart which makes not much sense but hey ho. In the absence of a TuneIn radio app, this is the best actual app that does radio streaming on a Mac I reckon. Apart from the icon! Wrote a wee review of it at http://myglasseye.net/news/mac-r... if you're not convinced yet ;)    Embed Quote
