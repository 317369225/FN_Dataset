★What is so fun about ham radio?
Ham radio is about possibilities.  You can experiment and design new systems.  My Ham club in Jacksonville, Fla discussed a remote receiver system for our repeater years before the cell phone system became real.We discussed UHF control signals(outside the call) to choose the strongest incoming signal from a receiver to drive the repeater's transmitter.  The cell system is exactly built this way.  There are many radio devices standard now that are based on hobby radio!    Embed Quote
