★Who is the best FM radio jockey in India?
I would go for RJ Naved. He had me in splits after listening his titanic spoof "phatto" series. Really I laughed till my eyes watered. I think it was quite intelligent, random and witty. Especially the way he mimicks the accent of delhi jat its flawless.He works with radio mirchi.And few of his murga series were also nice.  Recently he's hit because of video of his conversation to Pakistani politician on Bilawal Bhutto's stupid comment on Kashmir. He immaculately leads that politician to believe he is Pakistani and is genuinely talking about serious matter. He is spontaneous, knowing how far he can go without breaching limits of another person, still makes a brilliant point with humor attached. P.S.  :Listening Phatto series is must and it sounds even better with a group of like minded individuals of course.    Embed Quote
