★Why is Conservative talk radio so much more successful than its Liberal counterpart?Based on Arbitron data, eight of the top ten commercial programs are Conservative talk radio.  No Liberal talk radio programs are in the top ten.  Air America was the last Liberal attempt to gain a stronger market share and it was a dismal failure.  Why?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis...
Sometimes the simplest explanation is the best one, and as far as I can tell, the simplest explanation is for unique success of conservative talk radio involves the different economies of scale in rural areas as compared with urban areas. The politics of a county are predictable largely on the basis of the population density there. Talk radio has a comparative advantage in rural areas which happen to lean conservative, sometimes quite strongly so, where, coincidentally, there are too few people to support the expense of a TV news program. TV news has a comparative advantage in the concentrated media market of large urban areas, which in comparison, happen to lean in the other direction, relatively speaking. Left-wing talk radio doesn't work so well because the areas where talk radio works best are more Right-leaning. Even NPR, with its reputation as a liberal institution, isn't particular Left-leaning, just sort of gentrified and polite. It's only liberal by the standards of talk radio.    Embed Quote
