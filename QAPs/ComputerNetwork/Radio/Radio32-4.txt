★Why don't radio stations play better songs?I can find such great songs through the internet but not on the radio.
Like most things in life, when the prime motive is economic and its corollary, mass popularity, merit and virtue suffer.  So they're trying to sell (push) stuff, and traditionally on FM there are relatively few people making the programming decisions, so as they're compromised, we all suffer.  There are diamonds in there, but they're largely coincidental. Now, and this will be dated soon, I joke with my friends about Adele's Rumor Has It.  It's depressing. It's like the phenomenon of fast food. Where I live, there are five general classes of music: Top 40 celluloid, like Beyonce Country Rap Mariachi Music Everything Else 'Everything Else' is huge in scope, but not popularity.  And though it's not without even more bad material, generally, therein lies the hope. And in contrast to Joey, Katy Perry's I Kissed A Girl is one of the best successful pop songs in many years, right next to Call Me Maybe.    Embed Quote
