★Which hip hop songs can go into a radio friendly playlist for my kids?I'm putting together a hip hop playlist that I can play with my 2 young children in the background, without having to worry about them picking up foul language. I've been going through my hip hop collection but am struggling to find quality tracks without explicit language in them. Any suggestions (artists, tracks, albums) would therefore be very much appreciated!
Jurassic 5 - What's Golden (they have a bunch of songs that are pretty clean like this one) A Tribe Called Quest - I Left My Wallet in El Segundo Blackalicious - Blazing Arrow (they also have more pretty clean stuff like this) Skee lo - I Wish    Embed Quote
