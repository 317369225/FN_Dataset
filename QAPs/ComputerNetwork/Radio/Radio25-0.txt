★What is TuneIn Radio and how does it work?
TuneIn Radio is a radio aggregator, and lists lots of radio stations from across the world. It's a website and a set of apps for devices like iPhone and Android (and others). TuneIn used to be called RadioTime. It's run by a man called Bill, who is very nice and bought me a very large sandwich once. TuneIn also provide radio listings for a number of electronics manufacturers, though I'm unsure whether Bill bought them sandwiches too. I suspect he might have done.    Embed Quote
