★What is so fun about ham radio?
For me, it's about meeting new people and having conversations with them, wherever I am, in my car, while going for a walk, in my home.  It's like a more social version of Twitter.  In addition to that, you learn so much from other Hams, and improve your technical and electrical skills at the same time.  Plus when my cell phone runs out of battery, I still have a way of contacting someone or getting help if my hoopty of a car dies.    Embed Quote
