★What is the best internet radio platform?
Despite Last.fm you can also try using http://listen.grooveshark.com/. Their music database is enormous. The interface is sleek and it's free! Not like Last.fm radio. Of course there are subscriptions available too (6$ and 9$ per month) which mainly give Last.fm scrobbling.    Embed Quote
