★Who is the best FM radio jockey in India?
RJ Shekar Basha 92.7 Big fm Hyderabad I don't hear much of fm but i used to.....only for that guy. I love the way he does the job, i felt he is the one who is born to do the job and some special things on FM. Like 927 hours rj marathon and lot more. If anyone hears him for a short time and understand what he does to you, you will definitely accept that he is number 1 RJ.    Embed Quote
