★Which hip hop songs can go into a radio friendly playlist for my kids?I'm putting together a hip hop playlist that I can play with my 2 young children in the background, without having to worry about them picking up foul language. I've been going through my hip hop collection but am struggling to find quality tracks without explicit language in them. Any suggestions (artists, tracks, albums) would therefore be very much appreciated!
Thank you all for your great suggestions! I know it took a while to create this list but I spent a bit of time going through all your suggestions (and in some cases looking for clean versions) after which I created the following playlist for my two children: Outkast - He Ya Run DMC - Run's House Run DMC - My Adidas Fabolous - My Time Beyonce ft. Jay-Z - Crazy in Love Linkin Park and Jay-Z - Numb/Encore Big Daddy Kane vs. Jay-Z (mixtape) - My Name Is Hov DJ Khaled - I'm On One XV - The Last Hero Jadakiss - Crazy Jay-Z & Alicia Keys - Empire State of Mind Melanie Fiona - Gone And Never Coming Back Lupe Fiasco - Daydream The Roots - Love Of My Life Opgezwolle - Verre Oosten De La Soul - Ego Trippin' Eric B & Rakim - I Know You Got Soul Das EFX - They Want EFX MC Serch - Back To The Grill Pete Rock & CL Smooth - T.R.O.Y.    Embed Quote
