★What is so fun about ham radio?
For me, the most fun and satisfaction comes from volunteering for events where they need ham operators (Marathons, trail runs, triathlons, bike rides, Red Cross emergency shelters, etc), which also serve as practice/preparation for emergency communications.    Embed Quote
