★What is so fun about ham radio?
AB1ST. For me, the fun of amateur radio is the sheer variety of technologies available - from being able to send and receive email from literally ANYWHERE on Earth - to using satellites, bouncing signals off the Moon, or talking to someone on the other side of the planet with less energy than a light-bulb uses. It is a never-ending parade of possibilities. And let's not forget the public service aspect - from being part of your community's disaster plan, providing communications during emergencies, or helping out during parades and races.    Embed Quote
