★Which radio stations around the world are closest to BBC Radio 4?
I love Radio four and have been listening to 4 Extra all day on a tedious car journey.  I have got into one programme on 4 Extra to a point that I am going to have to take my lunch at 1PM tomorrow to listen to part 3.  They way the BBC is funded is why I could never leave the UK.  I can't stand advertising and the BBC doesn't have it.  I would gladly pay more licence fee to keep the BBC advertising free.  I am aware that this in no way answers your question, but I love the BBC so much I just thought I'd chuck this in there.  P.S I don't work for the BBC, these views are still my own! P.P.S  Get the iRadio Player (then you don't need to worry about what else is out there!)    Embed Quote
