★Will there ever be an iPod Touch with a 3G radio?
The iPod Touch is essentially an iPhone without the 3G. It has two cameras (which can take videos and pictures), a mic, a Retina display, etc. The advantage of the iPod touch is that it is a lot less expensive than the iPhone because there is no monthly contract. Steve Jobs said "Well, one's a phone, and one's not. The iPod touch is training wheels for the iPhone." So no, the iPod touch will never get 3G.    Embed Quote
