★Why is Conservative talk radio so much more successful than its Liberal counterpart?Based on Arbitron data, eight of the top ten commercial programs are Conservative talk radio.  No Liberal talk radio programs are in the top ten.  Air America was the last Liberal attempt to gain a stronger market share and it was a dismal failure.  Why?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis...
Here's a fun fact- Almost all American Idol winners have been from the South- except one or two. Nobody from New York has ever won, I believe, despite often being wonderfully talented, and perhaps more deserving. Why? Because liberal folk aren't as crazy when it comes to showing support. Turnouts are smaller, fans are less fanatic. Conservative folk are a tightly-knit bunch. They support the community. They're far more likely to discuss what was on the radio. Liberals try to be different, and are harder to rally together under a single flag.    Embed Quote
