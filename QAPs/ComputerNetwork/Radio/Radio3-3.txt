★Why hasn't satellite radio displaced terrestrial radio?
I think there's a lot of skepticism in the marketplace, for many reasons. In the early days of Cable, the promise was, 'Pay us, but get no commercials.' Anybody remember that? Right. Then, when you couple that with the very innovative 'streaming' venues out there all of a sudden [Slacker, Pandora, Stitcher...let alone Spotify, or even RealPlayer], it makes paying for XM/Sirius a much tougher proposition, despite how good some of their channels are.    Embed Quote
