★Which hip hop songs can go into a radio friendly playlist for my kids?I'm putting together a hip hop playlist that I can play with my 2 young children in the background, without having to worry about them picking up foul language. I've been going through my hip hop collection but am struggling to find quality tracks without explicit language in them. Any suggestions (artists, tracks, albums) would therefore be very much appreciated!
Great question. I thought about this for a while and ran through about 20 ideas, ultimately winnowing down the list to just a handful of tracks that seem pretty kid-friendly: Jump, by Kris Kross Motownphilly, by Boyz II Men Hey Ya by Outkast (hip-hop group) Run's House by Run–D.M.C. My Adidas by Run–D.M.C. My Time by Fabolous Air Force Ones (radio edit) by Nelly Crazy in Love by Beyoncé feat. Jay Z Numb/Encore by Linkin Park (band) and Jay Z I took a pretty close at the lyrics for each song, although not the videos. I'm open to suggestions that some of these songs don't work -> I don't have a super-confident perspective on any of them.    Embed Quote
