★Which hip hop songs can go into a radio friendly playlist for my kids?I'm putting together a hip hop playlist that I can play with my 2 young children in the background, without having to worry about them picking up foul language. I've been going through my hip hop collection but am struggling to find quality tracks without explicit language in them. Any suggestions (artists, tracks, albums) would therefore be very much appreciated!
As you can see there are a lot of ways to go with this. One thing that hasn't been mentioned, but many, and I mean, MANY, of the popular songs that were once on radio have a clean version, which you can find simply by adding "clean" in your query. All radios have to comply with FCC regulations and therefore there should be plenty of options for "popular" hip hop. More "underground" hip hop acts, which never received radio play, might not have clean versions. Here's an example of search which provided many "clean hip hop" (YouTube results: http://www.youtube.com/results?s..."clean+version"&aq=f&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=tweepz&utm_campaign=Quora) Mike Rayzman made some good suggestions with Jurassic 5, A Tribe Called Quest, and De La Soul. Anyone from Native Tongues Collective (wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat...) are great important, quality, and enjoyable artists that focus on positive message hip hop. To build on Mike's list: Jungle Brothers, Queen Latifah, Black Sheep, and more. Debo Olaosebikan makes a great point citing Will Smith, who proudly made his career around not using obscenities.
