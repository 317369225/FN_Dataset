★What are some of the greatest radio documentaries?Radio channels such as ABC, the BBC, and CBC have long-running documentary series, as I'm sure, do others.
Piers Plowright, formerly of the BBC, later an independent radio feature/documentary producer, is widely regarded as one of the most creative and brilliant radio producers in radio - though it seems there's very little of his work available online. There is an interview with him in this series: http://www.ubu.com/sound/radio_r... and his work was featured in this BBC Radio documentary (short extract online): http://www.fallingtree.co.uk/bro... (Both links also mention many other innovative radio producers.) The Third Coast Festival has featured a wide range of high-quality global radio documentary work over the past 10 years, and you can listen to nearly 1,000 radio pieces in their audio library, as well as searching by producer: http://thirdcoastfestival.org/li... In addition to the services mentioned by Caspar, there is a small but growing list of pieces curated and user-submitted at http://audiodocumentary.org/. Finally, this example from London - The Hackney Podcast - has deservedly received a lot of praise for its creativity: http://hackneypodcast.co.uk/    Embed Quote
