★Why hasn't satellite radio displaced terrestrial radio?
Putting satellites into orbit is expensive. That fact, along with the wide adoption and proliferation of smart phones around the world and the expanding 4G/LTE cell networks will kill the entire Satellite radio idea if they fail to differentiate substantially. I won't be investing in SIRI anytime soon.    Embed Quote
