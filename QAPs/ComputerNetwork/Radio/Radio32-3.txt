★Why don't radio stations play better songs?I can find such great songs through the internet but not on the radio.
They never have, except by accident. Radio stations play popular songs. They always have, and always will. Of course, there are (and were) exceptions. Try any non-commercial radio station, such as college radio. Some NPR stations play great music at certain times. But yeah, it's few and far between.    Embed Quote
