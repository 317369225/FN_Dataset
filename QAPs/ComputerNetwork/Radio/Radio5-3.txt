★Is Internet radio really radio?
What defines radio? The strictly audio stream? The continuous broadcast? Its reach? Its availability on the FM band? Its localization? Its registered status? The organization(s) which backs it up? The money it can throw at talent and its productions? The mass appeal of its celebrities? [...] Radio is just a label for something which used to be familiar. Radio changed when TV came along. It is changing now. And I don't think it is a singular noun anymore. Call it whatever you will. Just be aware if its context.    Embed Quote
