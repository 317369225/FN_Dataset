★Is Internet radio really radio?
I don't understand the question or maybe the answers to the questions given. To me, Internet Radio, is a service provided where you buy an internet radio receiver (Amazon has the best selection in the USA) and use the service which requires an internet connection and provides thousands of FM stations worldwide to listen to. You don't need a radio, a pc will do, but a nice small table radio is more compact to get any genre on  stations with podcasts worldwide. Not popular in the US but it sure is in Europe and Australia, maybe other continents. Receivers in the US are expensive,  starting at about $100 but cheaper in Europe, for example $66  for an excellent model. I am thinking about importing them to the US    Embed Quote
