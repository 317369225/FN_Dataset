★How relevant is radio in your life?Music radio, talk radio, news / traffic radio? Please include a brief listening profile.  I'm curious to compare to my own.  If radio is not relevant at all, please explain why.  I am equally curious about that.
Currently, I don't listen to radio at all. But until a few years ago, I used to be active listener of an Indian radio channel (I'm Indian) called Hit 95.0 FM. It was a music channel and had a decent playlist and entertaining radio jockeys. A major reason I used to be an avid radio listener was because the internet was very slow at my place so it was not possible to listen to music over the internet because of the excessive buffering time. But when I started college, things changed because my college dorm had good internet speed, and YouTube replaced radio in no time. I never used to listen to radio for news/traffic/weather so i completely stopped listening to radio.    Embed Quote
