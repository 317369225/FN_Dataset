★Which hip hop songs can go into a radio friendly playlist for my kids?I'm putting together a hip hop playlist that I can play with my 2 young children in the background, without having to worry about them picking up foul language. I've been going through my hip hop collection but am struggling to find quality tracks without explicit language in them. Any suggestions (artists, tracks, albums) would therefore be very much appreciated!
I'll add more later, but this is awesome: Very Poorly Concealed Secret Track - Optimus Rhyme + MC Front-a-lot It's about Ping Pong :) EDIT: Here's a few more. GZA from the Wu Tang clan has some VERY cleverly themed songs which are kid-friendly. GZA - 0% Finance (lyrics made using car models and vehicle metaphors) GZA - Alphabets (chorus uses all letters of the alphabet) GZA - Animal Planet (hood life using purely animal metaphors) GZA - Fame (a personal favorite; weaves a story using celeb names example: Richard's Gere ripped while climbing Bill's Gates) GZA - Queen's Gambit (story told with NFL team names and football terms) Here's some other curse-free songs from the Wu. The themes often lean to the more mature, but the language is obscure enough to go over kid's heads. Just some really good beats, flows and rhymes. GZA - Breaker Breaker GZA - Colombian Ties Inspectah Deck - Longevity Inspectah Deck - Lovin' You Inspectah Deck - Show N Prove    Embed Quote
