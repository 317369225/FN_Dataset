★What is so fun about ham radio?
There are many ways to experience this hobby, so I guess everyone can find their own. For me it is the magic of being able to talk to people far away using relatively simple equipment and antennas - and very little energy. I've once made a contact with a scientific station in Antractica using just 20W with a dipole extended from my house's roof to a tree in the yard. 20W is less than an average lightbulb and yet I was able to communicate with someone on the other end of the world. Nothing beats that, not even Internet.    Embed Quote
