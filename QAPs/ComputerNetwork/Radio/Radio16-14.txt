★Why is Conservative talk radio so much more successful than its Liberal counterpart?Based on Arbitron data, eight of the top ten commercial programs are Conservative talk radio.  No Liberal talk radio programs are in the top ten.  Air America was the last Liberal attempt to gain a stronger market share and it was a dismal failure.  Why?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis...
There are various reasons for this, but most can be summarized as follows: 1. The population who listens to conservative talk is largely male and middle aged and older, often the so called "Road Warriors". This means time on the road and often a seething anger at the world, which talk radio steps into. Call this the "Death of a Salesman" theory. Also, Talk started out on AM radio, which was able to be heard much longer distances on the road, especially at night. Rural locales often have few FM stations they can receive, even at home. 2. Large media corporations are largely controlled by conservative and right wing forces. Clear Channel and Citadel are among the biggest - well known to lean right. 3. The "car wreck" and "porn" theories - we all know sayings such as "if it bleeds, it leads". No one slows down on the turnpike to notice the beautiful color of the sky. Thousands slow down to watch a car wreck. Much the same factors are in play with Conservative Talk. If they were not completely outrageous, they would have far fewer listeners. I would suggest #3 provides the largest reason - I know a number of people, myself occasionally included, that will tune in for a few minutes just to see how outrageous and entertaining they can be! It's the same phenomenon which catapulted Howard Stern to the top. In summary, Conservative Talk Radio is like the ultimate scripted reality show....based in actual events, but then lampooned to a degree which makes a normal person cringe.    Embed Quote
