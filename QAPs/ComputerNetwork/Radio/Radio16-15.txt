★Why is Conservative talk radio so much more successful than its Liberal counterpart?Based on Arbitron data, eight of the top ten commercial programs are Conservative talk radio.  No Liberal talk radio programs are in the top ten.  Air America was the last Liberal attempt to gain a stronger market share and it was a dismal failure.  Why?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis...
There is successful liberal talk radio. It's called NPR. It has a huge audience, and both audience and the programs are reliably liberal.  (That does't mean 100% liberal, so the NPR apologists who wish to point out that there was a 5 minute conservative segment as recently as May 22 can save their energy ;-) ) A few very important questions -  Did NPR help "crowd out" Air America? maybe - maybe AAR died of too many CEOs, which can kill anything (see Adam Mordecai 's great answer) Should the US taxpayer be subsidizing (even third hand, indirectly) political broadcasts to US audiences? I obviously don't, and I believe the NPR damages the left by displacing their voices and viewpoints, and helps keep liberals in an ideological corral and away from dangerous new ideas. Ultimately, NPR's political slant damages the United States. It's not a monolithic evil conspiracy bent on world domination (that's Microsoft and Google), however - their automotive show, Click and Clack is okay. Background info... NPR demographics http://www.wuot.org/h/underwriti... 124% more likely to have a very liberal political outlook. 125% more likely to own a Volvo.  (who says stereotypes aren't true?) NPR popularity - Rush is #1, NPR holds #2 and #3  In 2005, ATC aired on over 560 radio stations and reached an audience of approximately 12 million listeners each weekday, making it the third most listened to radio program in the United States after The Rush Limbaugh Show and Morning Edition(also NPR, at 13 million listeners) Wikipedia All Things Considered.    Embed Quote
