★Who is the best FM radio jockey in India?
Following three RJs were trend setters of South India Radio industry. 1) RJ Suchithra (aka Suchi) - She started her RJ career in Mirchi FM, Chennai. People go crazy for her voice. She use to do "Good morning Chennai" in Mirchi FM. She later joined Radio One and now she is a playback singer. Her voice is peculiar and metallic. Yes, and I was crazy over her, for her voice. Her voice makes me energetic when I start my day. Most of Chennaites felt the same and many expressed the same on shows through phone. Following Suchi several female RJs tried to do same kind of shows. But no one could replace her voice. Chennai people still miss her morning shows. Beauty with brain and superb voice.

He use to do comedy by keeping his voice, emotion and slang very serious(the other extreme) and make you laugh out loud (which is another extreme). Since he turned out as an actor and most of his movies go unnoticed. But he is talented. Few epics of Shiva.
