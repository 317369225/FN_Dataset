★Why is Conservative talk radio so much more successful than its Liberal counterpart?Based on Arbitron data, eight of the top ten commercial programs are Conservative talk radio.  No Liberal talk radio programs are in the top ten.  Air America was the last Liberal attempt to gain a stronger market share and it was a dismal failure.  Why?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis...
I think the other answers are quite good, but there is one aspect of this topic that hasn't been explored: the characteristics that define the listening audience. Conservative shock radio does not seek or (for the most part) attract a well-heeled, highly educated crowd.  The listening audience available for these programs is more likely to include: people who drive all or part of the day as part of their working duties people who are allowed or able to listen to radio during the workday (or work night) because of the nature of their work people who do not consume mainstream news or other media anyway, either for lack of access (no cable, no Internet, no tablet, no ebooks) or lack of interest Very few highly literate, educated, professional people fall into any of these groups, and Americans who do fall into these categories tend to be conservatives, at least on the face of it. The product matches the listening audience that is there.  If college professors nationwide spent their days typing out a draft of their latest paper while listening to the radio, you can be sure what's on the airwaves would be a bit different.    Embed Quote
