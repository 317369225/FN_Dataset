★Was CB radio the first social media?
I don't know about first, but sometimes when I tweet a question hoping for an immediate response from someone in my network, I'm reminded of those scenes in The Dukes of Hazzard when one of the Duke boys would turn on the CB radio and say, "This is Lost Sheep, anyone got their ears on?"    Embed Quote
