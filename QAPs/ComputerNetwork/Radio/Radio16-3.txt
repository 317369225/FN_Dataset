★Why is Conservative talk radio so much more successful than its Liberal counterpart?Based on Arbitron data, eight of the top ten commercial programs are Conservative talk radio.  No Liberal talk radio programs are in the top ten.  Air America was the last Liberal attempt to gain a stronger market share and it was a dismal failure.  Why?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis...
Here is the dirty secret: Liberals prefer to listen to Conservative Talk Radio over Liberal Talk Radio. Conservatives listen to pundits to have their beliefs reenforced, Liberals listen to them to get riled up and self righteous. This is part of the magic of Fox News too. If you are a lefty, watching O'Reilly is much much more entertaining then watching Maddow. This is in many ways the appeal of Jon Stewart's approach to making fun of the stuff that FOX and CNN do. It's much more fun to watch Jon skewer Geraldo then it would be to watch him high-five Maddow. Left leaning shows don't work because Conservatives don't want to hear it, and Liberals think it's boring to listen to people they already agree with. Conservative Talk Radio is more like sports call in shows then it is news programming like NPR, so I don't really see NPR as in the same category as AirAmerica, even if they were under the impression they had the same audience.    Embed Quote
