★What is so fun about ham radio?
There are so many different aspects to ham radio to explore, learn, and contribute. You can help your community with emergency communications if that is your desire. You can explore technical niches that are beyond description (think super-niche Long tail). You can learn and send low power Morse code around the world as a challenge, talk through amateur radio satellites, or just fire up a radio and easily talk around the world. Two of my most recent links that fascinate me (I just blew 3 hours last night!) are FreeDV which uses digital voice over HF for clear HF communications and websdr.org which has a list of software based receivers that you can use yourself.  Go ahead, bring up ewi.utwente.nl:8901 and tune to 15000kHz with AM demodulation -- that's WWV from both Hawaii and Colorado giving you the real time (try 10000kHz and 20000kHz too -- propagation varies during the day).    Embed Quote
