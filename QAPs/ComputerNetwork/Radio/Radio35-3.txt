★Why is there no phase modulation radio?we have AM radio and FM radio, but Why is there no PM radio?
There is phase modulation radio.  It is incorporated in the more modern radios that we have like WIFI, cellular phones, etc.  However, both AM and FM are very old technologies that were adopted from the beginning of the broadcast industry, where standards and manufacturing processes have been adopted by both the broadcast industry as service providers and manufacturers of consumer equipment. Changes that affect the industry often take years to implement and change over.  If it works - and both AM and FM work really well - why fix it?  This, I think, is the reason.  There is no real economic engine that would drive a change.  By the way, just as an end note - both AM and FM are very robust technologies.  They are the most dependable for communication in areas of wide spread disaster, when mobile and data networks are compromised.    Embed Quote
