★How does Spotify Radio work?
From a user perspective, you can start a radio channel based on an artist, playlist or song using the "Start Radio" button or context menu. Once you are in radio mode, the Spotify client will play songs related to what you based the radio channel on (for some definition of related). If you don't like the song you can jump to the next one. From a technical perspective, the Spotify client makes a request to a specialized radio service which holds radio selections for a large subset of all our material. The radio suggestions are built using analysis of previous playback data. For some in depth information about the specifics of the methods used to create the radio channels, there is a presentation by Erik Bernhardsson (tech lead in the discovery team) available here: NYC Machine Learning (video and slides)    Embed Quote
