★What is the best internet radio platform?
I'm a big fan of Slacker Radio. Stations based on genre, decade, with excellent fine tune controls. I find that more related music is given to me by Slacker, versus music which may or may not be related thematically on Pandora. Slacker allows for 6 skips per hour, per station, and short ads are played every few sounds (something around 3 or 4 songs before an ad I've noticed). Just my preference, but a worthwhile alternative.    Embed Quote
