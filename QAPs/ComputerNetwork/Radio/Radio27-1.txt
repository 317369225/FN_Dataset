★Will there ever be an iPod Touch with a 3G radio?
iPod touch 3G? What would be the point? That would be much too similar to the iPhone. Apple would never do that. The reason people buy the iPod touch is because it's an iPhone without the monthly contract. They're not going to buy them if they have to pay for the 3G. they'll just get an iPhone.    Embed Quote
