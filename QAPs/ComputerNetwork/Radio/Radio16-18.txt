★Why is Conservative talk radio so much more successful than its Liberal counterpart?Based on Arbitron data, eight of the top ten commercial programs are Conservative talk radio.  No Liberal talk radio programs are in the top ten.  Air America was the last Liberal attempt to gain a stronger market share and it was a dismal failure.  Why?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis...
As a liberal, I don't want to be told what to think or have my beliefs reinforced. Give me subjects as objectively as possible, and I will decide.  Same goes for MSNBC as for Fox...not interested.    Embed Quote
