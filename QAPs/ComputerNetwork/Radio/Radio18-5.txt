★Which hip hop songs can go into a radio friendly playlist for my kids?I'm putting together a hip hop playlist that I can play with my 2 young children in the background, without having to worry about them picking up foul language. I've been going through my hip hop collection but am struggling to find quality tracks without explicit language in them. Any suggestions (artists, tracks, albums) would therefore be very much appreciated!
I Can by Nas is probably appropriate: Whilst it talks about drug usage, it tells a story of how working hard - and avoiding drugs - can get you to where you want to be. I know I can (I know I can!) Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!) If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!) I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!) http://rapgenius.com/Nas-i-can-l...    Embed Quote
