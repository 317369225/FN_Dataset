★What is the future of radio?Should it move toward noncommercial community content? Should it race to the lowest common denominator (as much of it has)? Will the great content that is left move somewhere else?
Radio, nowadays, is far more than just being an entertainment medium. It does not only provide a platform for fun to the listeners but also make them aware of several goods and services being launched in the market from time to time. In addition, it also keeps the listeners updated with the latest happenings of their city. With Internet or Online Radio, it has already taken a relevant step towards extending its reach to the most possible number of people. This indicates that Radio, in future, would not enter the world of extinction, but it will have a flourishing market in the coming years.    Embed Quote
