★What are terrestrial radio CPMs?
CPM stands for Cost Per Thousand. It is used as a way to calculate the cost of impressions. $5 CPM means you are paying $5 for every 1,000 times (impressions) that you ad/message is heard. If a radio station has an Average Quarter Hour listening audience of 10,000 listeners, and you are paying $100 per commercial, your CPM would be $10. Alternatively, if a station is selling you commercials for $50 per, but they only reach 4,000 listeners, your CPM is $12.50, therefore the higher-priced commercial is actually more valuable.    Embed Quote
