★Why is Conservative talk radio so much more successful than its Liberal counterpart?Based on Arbitron data, eight of the top ten commercial programs are Conservative talk radio.  No Liberal talk radio programs are in the top ten.  Air America was the last Liberal attempt to gain a stronger market share and it was a dismal failure.  Why?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis...
Part of it is not the ideology. It is partially that liberals get on radio and are sonorous pretentious bores while conservatives energize their audiences. On a liberal talk radio show, the background music is always very mellow and calming. The host speaks very softly. It feels like a seance. On a conservative show, the background music is more upbeat and the volume shifts are more sudden. The host speaks aggressively and energetically. The tone is sarcastic. It's reminiscent of the 1960s disc jckeys yelling, "Listen to this!" I don't give a damn what ideology you have. I'll listen to the second one every single time.    Embed Quote
