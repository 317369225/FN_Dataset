★How relevant is radio in your life?Music radio, talk radio, news / traffic radio? Please include a brief listening profile.  I'm curious to compare to my own.  If radio is not relevant at all, please explain why.  I am equally curious about that.
Radio was the technology that fed my childhood and preteen obsession with American pop culture and music. Until the mid-2000's or so, online streaming or downloads were either nonexistent or relatively underground -- so radio was still an important way for people to discover music. Nowadays, the only radio I listen to is the one playing inside the station of my college radio (WZLY 91.5 FM). I'll tune into webcasting for WZLY as well as podcasting for NPR and This American Life (sometimes I skip the podcasting altogether and skim through the transcription.) As for music, I listen to curated music services/blogs like 8tracks or prettymuchamazing.com. Radio in its traditional form is basically irrelevant to my daily life nowadays, especially since I don't drive, though radio has been a key influence in my interest in pop culture, public speaking, and interviewing people.    Embed Quote
