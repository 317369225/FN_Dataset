★Which radio stations around the world are closest to BBC Radio 4?
I think there's an English language parochialism to a couple of these responses. France Inter has a very rich mix of current affairs, discussion, documentaries, science, arts, comedy and music. And if you switch over to France Culture, you get a similar range of topics with a depth and seriousness which might stretch some listeners but which is often really stimulating. I happen to know French radio and not that of other European countries, but I doubt it's the only example.    Embed Quote
