★Why is Conservative talk radio so much more successful than its Liberal counterpart?Based on Arbitron data, eight of the top ten commercial programs are Conservative talk radio.  No Liberal talk radio programs are in the top ten.  Air America was the last Liberal attempt to gain a stronger market share and it was a dismal failure.  Why?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis...
The personalities are more interesting/inflammatory and they're giving unique viewpoints that you don't usually get from media.  They're just better shows.  I actually really love watching Bill O' Reilly even though I almost never agree with him.  He's entertaining, funny, debates loudly with guests. Also, it's about the only place in media where I can see viewpoints which differ from the typical MSNBC liberal kind of stuff.  I tend to agree more with liberal viewpoints, but nonetheless it's nice seeing something else.    Embed Quote
