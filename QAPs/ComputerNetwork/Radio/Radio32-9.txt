★Why don't radio stations play better songs?I can find such great songs through the internet but not on the radio.
I find your question a bit vague. How do you classify songs as good or bad? In Indian context, I have found radio stations for old songs (example AIR FM Gold) as well as new FM radio stations catering to recent releases (example Radio Mirchi, Radio City...). Select the programs depending on your taste. :)    Embed Quote
