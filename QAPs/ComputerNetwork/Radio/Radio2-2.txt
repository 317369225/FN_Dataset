★Which radio stations around the world are closest to BBC Radio 4?
Closest as in "most similar to" rather than geographically (BBC Radio 3 and the World Service broadcast from some of the same London buildings)? Radio 4's eclectic mix of news, drama, arts and science and - of course - bell ringing is unique. It's developed organically since it began as the Home Service in 1939. You can listen across the world via bbc.co.uk, which I make :-) However, the BBC's World Service carries several R4 programmes - things like More Or Less or the Reith Lectures so is the closest comparison. Although the editorial tone is quite different, I'd also that say US public radio is the closest non-BBC place for "built" documentaries or magazine programmes. Not individual stations but syndicated NPR and PRX shows.    Embed Quote
