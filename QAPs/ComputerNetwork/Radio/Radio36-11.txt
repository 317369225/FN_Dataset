★What radio shows or podcasts are similar to This American Life?
I've listened to most of these podcasts mentioned and I agree.  But I would suggest The Memory Palace, Criminal, and Freakonomics, to round out my most-favorite-evers. I think good storytelling is important in a podcast, I listened to Shannon Cason's Homemade Stories in its entirety and was impressed. My own personal geekdom makes me like The Skeptics Guide to the Universe and I just started listening to The Lesser Boneparts, which are stories from history, but not necessarily romanticized and told in the style of "dudes talking about history". Hope you check out and like these!  Always looking to expand my list, plenty of misses out there for me.    Embed Quote
