★Why hasn't satellite radio displaced terrestrial radio?
As with anything that requires money, consumers must determine the cost-benefit of a service or product. Most radio listening happens in one of three places: At home, at work (non-driving profession), and in the car. Suddenly paying for a radio service does not extend the amount of time you can spend listening to radio. Your life determines that. So, for the average radio listener who spends maybe 30 minutes a day with radio, $13/month can be hard to justify. Many people bring up the case of satellite radio's music stations not airing commercials. While this is mostly true, it doesn't change the fact that commercials are not as much of a nuisance as you might think. In fact in a study done by Coleman (http://www.arbitron.com/download...) it was proven that radio holds an average of 92% of its listeners through a commercial break. It is true that even radio executives were surprised by this news, but you can bet it was welcome information. As an aside: Rush Limbaugh was the one and only show/station/thing in this study to actually have a larger audience after a commercial break than he did before the break. This means listeners who tuned in during a commercial break waiting through the commercials to hear what he had to say next. Love him or hate him, this is why he's still on the radio, and paid big bucks to stay there.    Embed Quote
