★Why is Conservative talk radio so much more successful than its Liberal counterpart?Based on Arbitron data, eight of the top ten commercial programs are Conservative talk radio.  No Liberal talk radio programs are in the top ten.  Air America was the last Liberal attempt to gain a stronger market share and it was a dismal failure.  Why?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis...
Simple.  Liberals don't want a liberal counterpart to right-wing talk radio.  Instead, they listen to thoughtful, intelligent programming that doesn't have a political agenda: National Public Radio.    Embed Quote
