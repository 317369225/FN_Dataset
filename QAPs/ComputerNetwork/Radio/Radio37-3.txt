★What is a better alternative to Pandora internet radio?
It depends how you like to discover music.  There are many services that recommend other artists based on the ones you like, Pandora is not unique.  Last.fm, Jango, Slacker are just a few examples.  Personally, I find that Pandora starts to repeat songs and artists fairly quickly and does not help me discover new artists, but everyone likes to discover music their own way.  I'll take a great DJ over Pandora's algorithm; the human element is hard to replicate and will also play music based on similar artists.    Embed Quote
