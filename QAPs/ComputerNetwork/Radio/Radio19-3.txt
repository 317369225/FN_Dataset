★How relevant is radio in your life?Music radio, talk radio, news / traffic radio? Please include a brief listening profile.  I'm curious to compare to my own.  If radio is not relevant at all, please explain why.  I am equally curious about that.
Absolutely. There is still nothing has the immediacy and reliability of radio, because it employs professional journalists. Twitter has immediacy but not the same level of reliability as the tweets are often from participants in an event, and thus filtered through their own perspective.   If a major event breaks, I still switch on the radio. In addition, radio broadcasters* are taught to paint "word pictures" (or at least develop that skill over time). For that reason many people watch sports events on TV with the sound muted, while listening to radio commentary of the same event - especially if they want more detail and less hyperbole.   Radio is still the best medium for real-time discussions between people; it's possible to hear the emotion in their voice (no need for smileys!) and it's easier to follow than a chat room with everyone talking at once.   It also still has an edge, I believe, in discussion generally, for several reasons. It's easier to pick up the phone and call talkback than to sit and type a comment; but being on the radio is still seen as somehow more important than being online, so in most (but by no means all) cases you'll get more signal-to-nise than in, say, blog comments. And while services such as Pandora and Last.fm, along with the myriad of internet "radio stations" are a great way to discover new music, I still enjoy getting in the car, switching on the radio and hearing what the alternative music station presenter has chosen to surprise me with today.   * Disclosure: I've been both a rock station DJ and a talkback host on several stations.    Embed Quote
