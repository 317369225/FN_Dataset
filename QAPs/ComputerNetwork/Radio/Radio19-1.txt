★How relevant is radio in your life?Music radio, talk radio, news / traffic radio? Please include a brief listening profile.  I'm curious to compare to my own.  If radio is not relevant at all, please explain why.  I am equally curious about that.
Two hours of radio every commute day.    Embed Quote
