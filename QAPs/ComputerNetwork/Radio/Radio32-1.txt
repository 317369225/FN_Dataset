★Why don't radio stations play better songs?I can find such great songs through the internet but not on the radio.
As a former DJ, I can tell you something radio companies don't want you to know: Radio stations don't exist to play songs. Radio stations exist to play commercials. It would depress you to hear staff conversations in this regard. Things are now so automated, so formulaic, because all that matters is performing up to certain audience number expectations so that ad sales rates can be maintained and grown. If the audio from area public restrooms brought enough listenership to justify bumping ad rates, they would do it. (This explains the number of country music stations nowadays.) If you want good music, skip terrestrial radio. It's a wasteland. Go for personal recommendations of friends and social networks; use Pandora, Spotify, and other services that can recommend new-to-you material; go discover CD Baby; and do your part in sharing and spreading the word, especially of new, independent artists.    Embed Quote
