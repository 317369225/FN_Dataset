★Which hip hop songs can go into a radio friendly playlist for my kids?I'm putting together a hip hop playlist that I can play with my 2 young children in the background, without having to worry about them picking up foul language. I've been going through my hip hop collection but am struggling to find quality tracks without explicit language in them. Any suggestions (artists, tracks, albums) would therefore be very much appreciated!
If you want radio friendly AND clean, then you should definitely go with Will Smith. Some specific songs: Getting Jiggy With it Summertime Men in Black Miami Just the Two of Us I am willing to bet that most of the songs in his discography[1] are free of cursing. Some other artists and songs: Lupe Fiasco*: Daydreamin', The Show Goes On, Kick Push Lauryn Hill* Common*: The Light [1]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wil... * For this artist, be sure to double check the lyrics to any tracks not listed here.    Embed Quote
