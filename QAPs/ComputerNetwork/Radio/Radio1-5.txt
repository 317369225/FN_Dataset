★What is the future of radio?Should it move toward noncommercial community content? Should it race to the lowest common denominator (as much of it has)? Will the great content that is left move somewhere else?
The future of radio will be a saturated market with the likes of - Spotify, Google Play, iRadio, SiriusXM, Slacker, TuneIn Radio, Pandora, Clear Channel and many others all competing for you to listen. FM stations are losing market share quickly, the future will be cars that are capable of being connected to the Internet seamlessly and Internet radio will emerge. This is a battle of David and Goliath, who will be the victor?    Embed Quote
