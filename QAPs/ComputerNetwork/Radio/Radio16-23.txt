★Why is Conservative talk radio so much more successful than its Liberal counterpart?Based on Arbitron data, eight of the top ten commercial programs are Conservative talk radio.  No Liberal talk radio programs are in the top ten.  Air America was the last Liberal attempt to gain a stronger market share and it was a dismal failure.  Why?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis...
DISCLAIMER: I genuinely consider myself neither "conservative" nor "liberal," and find the terms limiting and irrelevant. What matters to me is making a concerted effort to discover the true facts of an issue and then draw the most rational, objective conclusions especially when my personal feelings on the matter initially bias me towards one conclusion. Easy explanations and viewpoints are, by definition, more readily accessible to a wider cross-section of the population. Many conservative viewpoints tend to be "reflex-based," emotional, or blindly nationalistically self-serving in nature and thus easier to grasp. Therefore, conservative viewpoints are accepted by more of the population and thus more successful.    Embed Quote
