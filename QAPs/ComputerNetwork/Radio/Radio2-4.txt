★Which radio stations around the world are closest to BBC Radio 4?
In Australia the closest you would get to a service like BBC Radio 4 would be ABC Radio National. It describes itself as the "Ideas Network" with a focus on "the latest in science, books and publishing, religion, social history, the arts and current affairs" as well as programs of "music, comedy, book readings, radio drama and poetry".  It can be heard across the country and complements the national news and parliamentary broadcasts service (News Radio) and the local radio stations in capitals and regional locations. Almost every one of their programs is available as a podcast and some are also rebroadcast to the Asia Pacific region via Radio Australia (the part of the ABC that I work for).  There is more info on their website (of course!)... and I would personally recommend these programs: Future Tense, The Science Show, All In The Mind and Hindsight.    Embed Quote
