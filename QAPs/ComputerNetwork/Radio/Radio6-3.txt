This paper, IIRC, tries to ask if biology can be approached with the rigor and abstraction of electrical engineering. Many IGEMs later, the answer is still no. There have been many devices built, such as oscillators, clocks, and light transducers, but one thing that is still missing is amplifiers or really any way to keep the signal from petering out to nothing past your regulatory machinery. In my opinion, if you want to build biological circuits, you may have to remove or abstract the part of the machinery that consistently tries to grow , evolve, and kill itself while doing whatever abstract task you have set for it. IE: cell-free biotechnology.    Embed Quote
