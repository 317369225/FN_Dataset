★Which radio stations around the world are closest to BBC Radio 4?
BBC Radio 4 is unique in that it contains an incredible range of varied programme content from live hard news to comedy, features, arts, drama and whimsy, all knitted together by live contemporaneous continuity sequences and drawing on the BBC's vast global journalistic resource. There is no other station in the world that covers this range in the same depth and intellectual rigour, however many broadcasters make many of the kinds of programmes you'll hear on BBC Radio 4. I would recommend searching through some of the US public radio content, including that from WNYC in New York, WGBH in Boston and Public Radio International - PRI. Similarly CBC in Canada produces some imaginative features and documentaries, as do South Africa's SAfm network and some Chinese State Radio outlets if you accept their provenance for what it is. You'll notice that all of these services are funded publicly or from some form of  government intervention. This is largely because high quality speech radio is expensive to produce and often of narrow appeal. Much of it would not be commercially sustainable. A good way to introduce yourself to a wider range of speech radio from varied broadcasters is via podcasts. You'll find there are also many highly-produced podcasts from enthusiast publishers which have never been anywhere near a radio station. If you enjoy BBC Radio 4's eclecticism this can be a rich seam of new ideas.    Embed Quote
