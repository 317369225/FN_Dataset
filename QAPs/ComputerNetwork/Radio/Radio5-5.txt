★Is Internet radio really radio?
It can be, but it isn't always. Pandora has appropriated the label of radio for its music streaming service, but I'd argue (as James Cridland has on Quora and elsewhere) that a shared human experience is what makes radio radio. It's about the selection and contextualization of the music, not the playback. There are internet radio shows that meet that criteria, and it's probably fair to say some highly automated over-the-air broadcasts don't.    Embed Quote
