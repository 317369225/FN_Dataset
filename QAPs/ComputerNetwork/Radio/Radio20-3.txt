★What's the best internet radio app for Mac?I'd have liked  a Tunein Radio desktop app but it doesn't look like there is one.
For the times when opening iTunes for a radio station seems like an overkill, if command line doesn't make you cower in terror, install cmus via homebrew. Save all your favourite radio stations' links as individual or aggregate *.m3u or *.pls playlists in a dedicated directory. You'll then write "cmus" at the command prompt > "5" > [browse to your directory that contains your playlists] > [Enter]. Enjoy! Snowtape (Snowtape 2 for Mac) is USD 30 or CAD 35. It's an elegant solution, although costly, perhaps because it also allows one to rip, tag, filter and trim the recordings. This is the first app for Mac that is similar to Tunein in terms of offering an online directory of radio stations categorized according to genre and/or country. VOX Music Player has a USD 4.99, CAD 5.79 radio add-on that also offers an online directory of radio stations.  My favourite app for ripping radio streams on Mac is Radio Ripper. This little gem is only CAD 4.59.    Embed Quote
