★Which hip hop songs can go into a radio friendly playlist for my kids?I'm putting together a hip hop playlist that I can play with my 2 young children in the background, without having to worry about them picking up foul language. I've been going through my hip hop collection but am struggling to find quality tracks without explicit language in them. Any suggestions (artists, tracks, albums) would therefore be very much appreciated!
Great question. It's a popular one now, but check out Lupe Fiasco's "The Show Goes On." I may be interpreting it incorrectly, but it seems like a pretty positive song with a lack of inappropriate/sexual/violent imagery.    Embed Quote
