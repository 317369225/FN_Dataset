★What is the future of radio?Should it move toward noncommercial community content? Should it race to the lowest common denominator (as much of it has)? Will the great content that is left move somewhere else?
Music streaming on a traditional alarm clock radio will soon be coming to an end as online streaming services become more popular. These online services, such as Pandora, iHeartRadio, and Spotify have almost unlimited possibilities when it comes to the artist selection or type of genre. Most of these online services offer ad free versions for a low fee, and even without paying that fee, commercials are less frequent than on FM and AM stations. Another reason is that because iPhones, Androids, and Blackberrys are getting more and more popular, more people have access to these types of services, increasing their popularity even more. As smartphones and tablets become more popular, we can expect to see a rise in more online services, thus entering a new era where new technology is dominant, and traditional measures of doing or participating in activities will soon fade away and be replaced by more online and "techy" solutions.    Embed Quote
