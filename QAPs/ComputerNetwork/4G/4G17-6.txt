★Is AT&T's "new" 4G network just their 3G renamed?I read something to that effect a week or two ago...
I guess another question is “What does 4G mean?” I’d argue the usage patterns of advanced smartphones and tablets make for the start of the 4G-Era. At the high-end, the experience of mobile data is now starting to be so different from the 3G-style usage we’re used to that some way to conceptualize this shift is welcome. 4G encapsulates that new experience, no? The 4G Era is about network connectivity, but probably a mixture of HSPA+, LTE, WiFi and perhaps WiMax. It is also about devices, services, interactions, apps, communication, collaboration and other richer experiences that will develop over time. The ITU wisely realized it’s not the body to arbitrate the question of what is 4G. Calling an HSPA+ network a 4G network might be technically debatable, but we’ve moved on. The 4G experience is emerging and I think there’s substance behind it. Even at a network level 4G is not just defined in radio performance terms; it’s all-IP, it’s software-orientated, it’s heterogeneous access, it’s authentication, security, transactions... << hey, look I answered my own question. Can you do that on Quora? What’s the etiquette?
