★Why is 4G (Advanced) named LTE and not 5G?
I would guess that when the name was chosen, the folks involved really thought it was a long term plan.  It wasn't until later, when WiMax showed up and was looking like a threat to traditional mobile service providers, that LTE was moved ahead into reality.but by then, the name was established.
