â˜…Why is 4G (Advanced) named LTE and not 5G?
If you look at the picture above, IMT-Advanced which is supposed to define what '4G' should be, is not even closely satisfied using normal Release-8/9 technology. Hence many people in technical circles often refer to LTE as 3.9G or pre-4G. The LTE-Advanced networks in Release 10/11 and even Release-12 do not exactly satisfy the IMT-A requirements but the marketing folks are referring to it as 4G, 4.5G and even pre-5G. Personally, I would define these LTE-A networks as 4G and when we will have a network that satisfies the IMT-A requirements, it could be billed as 'Real' 4G. In my understanding, 4.5G involves WiFi working together with LTE-A networks. There is a lot to gain from Wi-Fi, especially the newer standards in 5GHz bands. With regards to 5G, no one knows as of yet what it would involve.
