â˜…What's the difference between 4G and 4G LTE? What would differ if I bought a 4G phone as opposed to a 4G LTE phone?
AT&T introduced the phrase 4G LTE as their marketing term, probably because it rhymes and 4G is recognizable as after 3G. Technologically it meant capable of using both LTE (fastest) and HSPA+ (next fastest) as well as earlier standards like 3G and EDGE. The term HSPA+ was probably judged too long to include in a catchy phrase. Previous to AT&T's launch, 4G was an industry term covering a variety of post-3G technologies. If a phone is listed as 4G you have to ask more specifically what standards and speeds it supports.
