★Why do 4G phones consume more battery?
The 4G (WiMAX) radio is a separate chipset from the 3G (EV-DO Rev A) chipset.  The phone doesn't switch from 3G to 4G - when in a 4G area, both the 3G and 4G radios are connected at the same time.  The phone uses 3G for voice and 4G is for data only.  It's a simple solution to add 4G in providing you with the benefit of a faster connection, but with the drawback of more power consumption.  If you really don't need to use 4G, just turn it off.  Alternatively, charge the phone more often if you can.  Charge it at home, in the office, in a car, etc.  While the decreased battery life isn't favorable, many people accept the compromise to have a faster connection where Wi-Fi isn't available.
