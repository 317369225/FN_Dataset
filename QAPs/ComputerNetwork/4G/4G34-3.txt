★What do terms like CDMA, GSM, 3G, and 4G mean?Pretend you're explaining this in practical terms to my grandmother.
If Grandma wants more: CDMA - Code Division Multiple Access; this is one of the classes of schemes that spreads energy over a "wide" spectrum.  Its has the following desirable qualities:  everyone uses the frequencies simultaneously, so use planning is simple; capacity (number of calls supported) is a soft number that varies depending upon conditions as well as target voice quality; there are no guard bands (that means lost potentisl for communication); etc. TDMA - Time Division Multiple Access; this is one of the narrow band classes of schemes that start and stop transmissions such that greatear amplifier power spikes are produced and greater energy is spilled onto the neighbor, which means more RF pollution and costlier batteries, etc.;  in this scheme each user is assigned a frequency and a time slot; one frequency has several time slots; thsi scheme requires guard bands in time as well as spacings of frequencies to prevent collisions over the air.  CDMA is far more useful hence TDMA is well down the slope to commerical oblivion, GSM - (really should do this in French) Global System for Mobile Communications.  This sytem encompasses both a network side and an air interface.  The air interface is TDMA.   2G, 3G, 4G are just gimmicky unrigorously defined names that roughly describe the generation of communication technology.  Roughly, 2g is TDMA, 3g is CDMA, and 4g is OFDMA.
