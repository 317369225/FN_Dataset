â˜…What is the difference in 4G reliance and 4G Airtel?
Reliance is planning to launch 4G via TDD-LTE (time division duplex) while airtel has launched 4G via FDD (frequency division duplex) technology. One needs 2300 MHz spectrum for TDD-LTE launch, while 1800 MHz spectrum for FDD-LTE launch. Reliance has 2300 MHz spectrum for all the states of India and 1800 MHz spectrum for some states. Airtel also has both the spectrums in most of the states. 1800 MHz spectrum provides more penetration compared to 2300 MHz, which may result in better data throughputs. Currently there are lesser number of devices in India which support TDD LTE technology compared to FDD ones, but China is planning to launch 4G networks via TDD LTE and Chinese market is huge enough to influence device ecosystem. Reliance is speculating the same. Right now, reliance will concentrate on dongles and CPEs, giving 4G services in form of WiFi.
