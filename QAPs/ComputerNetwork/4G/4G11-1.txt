â˜…What will be the killer app for 4G networks?Carriers are currently limiting data usage in their 3G networks, yet they are pitching 4G to be the next big thing. What can be done with increased speed without increasing data limits?
Your question is the wrong way around - the operators are limiting 3G data use because of capacity constraints. 4G gives higher capacity at lower cost, which will ultimately mean both higher speeds and (more importantly) more reliable and cheaper connectivity. Compare 3G data costs now with what was charged for GPRS, for example.
