★How is the HTC Evo 4G?For those who have early versions, how does it compare to the iPhone & other Android phones?
My dad has the EVO. He switched from a Treo 800w. iPhone was not an option because he loves Sprint and does not want to switch to AT&T.   Setup was rocky - the out of the box experience could be better. For example, the voicemail personalization spends a lot of time telling you basic facts about voicemail passwords in a way that cannot be interrupted. Then when it comes time to type in your new voicemail password, the keyboard is nowhere to be found. This was frustrating for him.   He also took some time to get used to the on screen keyboard. He prefers physical keyboards but he wanted to try the EVO for the 4G speed and for the tethering.   Now that it's up and running, he loves the 4G speed (he's in Seattle temporarily). He particularly enjoys watching sports on it. I've turned him on to Layar as well, which he seems to like. More apps to come. So far battery has not been an issue. Size is not an issue either; he has large hands, so he prefers the larger device.
