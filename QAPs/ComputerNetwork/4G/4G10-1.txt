â˜…Which is the best 4G network in London?Optimized for speed, service area and cost ( in that order)
I'd get all-you-can-eat on 3. Then, it's free 4G if and where your device recieves it. Free roaming on contract and after 30 days of Pay as You Go in 8 countries (more to come) If you travel, or want awesome service, get 3. Believe me, it's wicked!
