★What's the best Verizon 4G Android phone?I upgraded to the HTC thunderbolt in April but returned it because the battery life was terrible and I figured I would just wait for the Motorola Bionic. But I can't wait anymore and would like to chose the best from the ones that exist: Thunderbolt, Samsung Charge & LG Revolution (am I missing any?)...
Best??  Kinda loaded question.  I've really been happy with my Samsung Stratosphere (2?).  I feel the need for a real keyboard, which this has, and while the Android OS is two versions behind (I think mine is the Dill Pickle version) the old beast does everything I need.  Think they are still available, in some places, and the deals are great..
