â˜…What do terms like CDMA, GSM, 3G, and 4G mean?Pretend you're explaining this in practical terms to my grandmother.
In super layman-terms, wireless transmission/reception is analogous to traffic driving down roads. When your phone is connected to the network, you can think of it as a small town, now connected via an on-ramp to a network of freeways/roads. As we progressed from GSM (2G), to 3G(CDMA/WCDMA) to LTE/Wimax (4G), the road widths changed, the number of roads changed, some cities closed down, some new ones opened up, the traffic rules changed -- the goal being to move more cars (information), between the towns and cities.
