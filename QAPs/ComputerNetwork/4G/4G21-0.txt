â˜…What comes next after 4G LTE?
After '4G' LTE comes the 'real-4G' LTE-Advanced. 3GPP the organization that is responsible for standardising LTE and LTE-A releases the standards as part of different releases. LTE for example was Release-8 and Release-9. LTE-Advanced comes from Release-10 onwards. Initially, some of the vendors and operators decided to call Release-10/11 as LTE-A, Release-12/13 as LTE-B, etc. 3GPP released a statement (3GPP Statement on LTE-Advanced status) saying that they intend all future releases to be still called LTE-A. So for a long term we will still see LTE-A being used, until maybe 5G.
