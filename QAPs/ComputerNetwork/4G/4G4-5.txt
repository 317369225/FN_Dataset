★How is the HTC Evo 4G?For those who have early versions, how does it compare to the iPhone & other Android phones?
The Evo ads a forward facing camera for video chat/video conference.  It alo has a built-in hotspot that will support up to 8 devices, though there's an extra per-month fee. I've heard concerns about a quick-draining battery, but I have yet to test the phone myself.  The biggest advantage for me (along with the beautiful screen) is the coverage in my area.  Not 4G, but better 3G coverage than Verizon or AT&T (which is terrible here).  If AT&T were doing their job, I'd have an iPhone already and wouldn't be even considering the Evo.  Note:  if you order from Radio Shack, there's not a good return policy:  once you leave the store, it's yours.  Order direct from Sprint, and if you find that coverage stinks, you can return it and get out of the contract.
