★What exactly is 4G/LTE and how does the technology work?Thank you for your answers. Some might have misunderstood the question due to my phrasing. I'm looking for an answer from a science perspective.
LTE, an abbreviation for Long-Term Evolution, commonly known as 4G LTE, is a standard for wireless communication of high-speed data for mobile phones and data terminals. In LTE mainly 4G Mobile device  and cellular Towers are totally new components. It has, 1] UE(User Equipment) = Its your LTE supported Mobile/Dongle. The UE has different category depend on how many antenna it has and etc. Achieved data rates are, 2] EUTRAN (Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network) = It is wireless radio communications network between UE and EPC. In simple words It consist of many Mobile communication towers. These tower means eNodeB. eNodeB = Its install in a city or big region. It send and receive data from UE. Also It tells how much data a particular UE should send in real time depend on type of service subscribed by UE and type of data. LTE supports TDD and FDD modes of operation on air. Generally FDD is used for Voice calls, TDD for packet data. In India Airtel 4G use TDD thats why only 4G data available while voice calls routed on 2G/3G network. There are four types of cells/nodes i.e. femtocells(Range 10m-100m, support 8 - 32 users), picocells(Range 100-200 m, support 32–128 users), microcells(Range 1-2 km, support 100–256 users) and macrocells(Range 100 km, support hundreds of users). A Home eNode B (HeNB) is an LTE femtocell and it has similer features like eNodeB. This HeNB can be installed in Home/Mall/Lift/office/Hotel/bar to have better coverage and less battery consumption by UE. HeNB has its own external data cum power supply cord, see following image. This HeNB Talk to EPC via HeNB-GW. 3] EPC (Evolved Packet Core) = It is back end wired network for connectivity to internet.
