â˜…What do terms like CDMA, GSM, 3G, and 4G mean?Pretend you're explaining this in practical terms to my grandmother.
They are different types of cellphone technology. 1G was analog voice. Huge brick phones. 2G was digital = voice + text. Nice small phones with long battery life but no internet. 3G = voice + reasonably good data. Most smartphones & todays phones. 4G = broadband wireless data, with voice as VoIP. Really fast data, and smartphones in the future. They are different technologies: CDMA is a standard used in USA and a few other places for 2G & 3G eg by Verison GSM was a rival standard for 2G, that is used in most of the world WCDMA and HSPA are the follow-on technology for 3G (but in America some people still called it GSM to emphasize its roots and just to confuse people) LTE is the 4G technology used everywhere Don't worry about what the abbreviations stand for: they don't mean anything understandible
