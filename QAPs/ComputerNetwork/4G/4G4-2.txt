★How is the HTC Evo 4G?For those who have early versions, how does it compare to the iPhone & other Android phones?
It's physically bigger and heavier than most of the other popular Android phones.  The screen the same resolution as the Nexus One, but larger -- makes typing slightly easier.  Software is pretty much the same as any other Android.  The 4G coverage is spotty.  Personally, I haven't found any particularly compelling features versus the Droid or Nexus One (at least none worth the trouble of switching to Sprint).
