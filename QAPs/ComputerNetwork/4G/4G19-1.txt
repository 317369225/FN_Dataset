â˜…What is difference between 4G and 3G LTE?
In short, the speed and delays incurred in the transmission. LTE is not 3G or 4G, but if placed in either it would have to be 3G because it does not meet the 4G requirements. It is very often called 3.5G or 3.9G. LTE-Advanced does meet (as I understand barely) the requirements of 4G mobile technology so it is therefore 4G. There are many differences between these technologies, I guess one worth mentioning is the huge gap between the throughput thresholds imposed by the standards. To be 3G you need surpass 200kbps (which is extremely low) but to be 4G you need to break the 1Gbps downstream barrier, which is very difficult today. In other words, there is not an impressive "jump" between EDGE, 2G and 3G, but between 3G and 4G is a big difference. I don't know the delay requirements, but I think 3G requires delays in the order of 100-200 ms while 4G is in the order of 10 ms.
