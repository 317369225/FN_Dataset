â˜…Will the next iPhone have LTE or some sort of 4G chipset?Will the iPhone have 4G?
It is 99.999% certain (100% in my mind, but I'm saying otherwise as insurance if it doesn't) that the sixth-generation iPhone will have 4G LTE capability. EDIT: The sixth-generation iPhone, the iPhone 5, does in fact have LTE.
