â˜…What will be the killer app for 4G networks?Carriers are currently limiting data usage in their 3G networks, yet they are pitching 4G to be the next big thing. What can be done with increased speed without increasing data limits?
Depends on where you are in the world. For Verizon, its LTE network is at 700MHz, which makes it ideal for mid-speed but relatively low-capacity, long-range, deep in-building services. Conversely, in markets like Sweden, the current deployments are at 2600MHz, which make the networks more suitable for dense urban hotspot applications - especially for PCs with USB modems. Indoor penetration is not great, however, but where it *is* available, it's good for very high-speed data for mobile broadband. It will not be good for things like smartphone-based video calls or for M2M because of indoor penetration variability. @
