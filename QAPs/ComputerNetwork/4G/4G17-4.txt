â˜…Is AT&T's "new" 4G network just their 3G renamed?I read something to that effect a week or two ago...
I used to be purist about this - if its not IMT-A compliant then its not 4G... But then I remembered my first proper job at Vodafone after writing up my PhD - making GSM work properly for commercial launch. It was the new system with new features, performance and technology. It was Generation++. Whats enough to make G++? In that case HSDPA was a huge leap so is that 4G? R99 was 3G but was not PS friendly (i.e. internet friendly) and so on. Open the floor to debate HSUPA, HSPA+, LTE, LTE-A (WHich features!!!) etc...
