â˜…How is the HTC Evo 4G?For those who have early versions, how does it compare to the iPhone & other Android phones?
I have the EVO and love it. The bigger screen makes it incredibly easy for me to read anything (especially emails) and now when I see iPhones et. al., I can't imagine being on that small of a screen. It's fast and responsive for the most part, and actually tends to make apps on the Android (inferior to Apple's platform no doubt) better because of the ease of use. Battery life isn't an issue IF you turn off Sense (which I don't care for in the first place) and run Advanced Task Killer - I regularly get 25-30 hours from it.
