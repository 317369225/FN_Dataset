â˜…What will be the killer app for 4G networks?Carriers are currently limiting data usage in their 3G networks, yet they are pitching 4G to be the next big thing. What can be done with increased speed without increasing data limits?

Today's AR apps struggle with slow processors, high power consumption, slow and flaky mobile/server connections, and limited PAN/Bluetooth speed. 4G will let AR move from novelty to every day utility.
