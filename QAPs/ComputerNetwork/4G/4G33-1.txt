★Does Clear 4G WiMax wireless broadband work well?How good is the coverage? How does it compare to Verizon, Sprint, etc.? I'm curious about the SF Bay Area. http://www.clear.com/plans
Clear equals Sprint 4G.  Verizon and AT&T both offer a superior technology called LTE which is faster and already more widespread through out the country.  Your specific situation may vary but all three companies offer 4G to the bay area.
