â˜…What's the difference between 4G and 4G LTE? What would differ if I bought a 4G phone as opposed to a 4G LTE phone?
4G is synonymous with LTE, but it doesn't always refer to LTE. Case in point. T-Mobile was late to the LTE game, and as a result enhanced their current 3G infrastructure to such an extent that it is faster in most instances than LTE. Enhanced 3G uses tech such as HSPA+ and AWS to acheive these high speeds and refer to it as "4G" purely for marketing purposes. As a T-Mobile customer myself, I turn off the LTE radio on my TMO devices because their 3G(aka non LTE 4G) is much faster. AT&T enhanced their 3G networks after their LTE rollouts and followed T-Mobile's lead in seeling their services as 4G and 4GLTE. In summary, the 4G moniker is generally nothing more than marketing hyperbole. 4G = 3G HSPA+ or 3G AWS. 4G LTE = LTE
