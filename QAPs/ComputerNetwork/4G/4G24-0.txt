â˜…What is better in terms of reliability, speed & signal quality - a smartphone or a 3G/4G dongle?
There is no discernible difference in 3G/4G technology for dongles and smartphones. They get the same reception from place to place because that is a matter of how the local signal is broadcast, not received. But yes, since the dongle has no battery, it will be a slight drain on the laptop. Most consider the hassle of not having to charge it to get internet with the trade-off. Dongles, because they only do one thing, are clearly cheaper. Most service providers give you a discount on the data compared to phones too.
