★What do terms like CDMA, GSM, 3G, and 4G mean?Pretend you're explaining this in practical terms to my grandmother.
If this is for Grandma, let me over-simplify. I may take some criticism with this, but it's the best I can do... Things like CDMA and GSM (or TDMA, iDEN, AMPS, etc) are just different technologies to enable today's mobile phones to work. As they take different approaches to do the same thing, they aren't compatible with each other and require different specially-tuned antennas to work. In a sense, it's like an AM/FM radio. Yes, they do the same thing, but offer different benefits. As for 2G/3G/4G, one could also think of this in simple terms of speed and data. 2G is like your old modem, 3G is like a DSL or Cable line to the internet, while  4G is like being connected to a T1 line. More data and is seemingly faster. Once again, I'm simplifying a lot, so some may come in with better metaphors. These just help me explain it to my Mom without too much trouble.
