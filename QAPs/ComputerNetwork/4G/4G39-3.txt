★What's the Viterbi algorithm, and how is it applied to CDMA/3G/4G wireless communications?I know it has something to do with hidden markov models, and Andrew Viterbi was a cofounder of Qualcomm, but can someone explain the algorithm in plain english? And is it what makes CDMA-like digital communications possible?
In addition to the above, at the most basic level the algorithm and coding theory harkens back to Claude Shannon's original work in "The Mathematical Theory of Communication" published by Bell Labs.  In it he laid the basic theoretical ground work upon which all modern digital technology and communications are based.  It all essentially boils down to creating a hard limit to how much information can be pushed through a communication channel and how quickly it can be done.  The Viterbi algorithm, which can be called a convolutional code, improved upon the speed at which information could be pushed through a channel and obviously has direct application to cellular communications.  You can actually read Viterbi and Omura's text "Principles of Digital Communication and Coding" (1979) for free online or acquire the inexpensive edition I talked Dover Publications into reprinting a few years ago. It's surprisingly accessible given what many would consider a difficult topic.  Bernard Sklar's text on communications also does a reasonable job of covering some of the basics as I recall.
