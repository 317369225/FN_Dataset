★Is AT&T's "new" 4G network just their 3G renamed?I read something to that effect a week or two ago...
Essentially to answer your question, NO, AT&T's current HSPA+ network is not technically 4G.  The ITU laid out specs for 4G and called it IMT-Advanced.  The document calls for 4G technologies to deliver downlink speeds of 1Gbps when stationary and 100Mbps when mobile.  Let's just say that HSPA+ doesn't quite meet that requirement.  They're upgrading to LTE later this year, which most people refer to as a 4G technology, but in its current state it doesn't meet the ITU standard. Without getting into all the techy stuff I think it's safe to call WiMax and LTE 4G technologies. Anything short of that is just a marketing department trying to earn their salaries.
