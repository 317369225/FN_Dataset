★Is AT&T's "new" 4G network just their 3G renamed?I read something to that effect a week or two ago...
It's largely a matter of semantics. Technically, the current versions of both LTE and WiMAX are not 4G either - ie they do not comply with IMT-Advanced standards. Ideally, ITU would have been much clearer about specifying IMT-A = 4G a few years ago, but for some reason they didn't, and as a result everyone has had a go at muddying the waters. What's particularly ironic is that the WiMAX community spent ages convincing the ITU that it should be treated as 3G, so it was legally allowed to use the same spectrum bands as other 3G technologies... In fact, the whole notion of branding HSPA+ as 4G as a marketing approach was quite possibly my fault in the first place. I suggested it on my blog in Nov 2009 - http://disruptivewireless.blogsp...   'In fact, if WiMAX and LTE operators can use 4G as a branding device, I see no reason why HSPA+ operators shouldn't too.' And as someone has pointed out, later versions of HSPA+ have higher peak (theoretical) rates than LTE anyway. I saw something at MWC in Barcelona pointing out a roadmap to (I think) 368Mbit/s using multi-channel HSPA Dean Bubley
