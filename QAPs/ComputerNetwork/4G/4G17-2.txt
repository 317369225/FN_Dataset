â˜…Is AT&T's "new" 4G network just their 3G renamed?I read something to that effect a week or two ago...
Yes. After T-Mobile started their new ad campaign where they called HSPA+ "4G," AT&T responded by adding the 4G tagline to their own advertising (on the basis that they also offer HSPA+ service). It's unclear what AT&T will do later this year when they roll out LTE; at that point, they would need two different "4G" coverage maps unless they did something crazy like rebrand LTE as "4.5G." The opportunity for consumer confusion is large.
