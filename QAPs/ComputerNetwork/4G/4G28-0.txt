â˜…Why do 4G phones consume more battery?
Three factors: How many radios are active at once? Each radio draws power. Extra circuitry, and often an extra chip. More treansitors, more MIPS = more power; more chips = more power Higher data rates on 4G require more power (wider bandwidth, high order modulation, MIMO) A phone can have one, two or three of these reasons to draw more power, and have shorter battery life. To expand: First, it helps to distinguish which ''4G'' T-Mobile is HSPA+. This is really 3G (HSPA+, 5MHz channel, same chipset). You could say it has best battery life of any 4G device, but that is hard core marketing spin!) Clear / Sprint 4G - which is your EVO. This will have the worst power consumption. As Philip Solis and Mike Chan have said there are two separate chipsets, and both are operating somewhat independently, drawing current. ie the 4G chip is not the same as the 3G one. Verizon LTE and (soon) AT&T LTE. This will draw more power as it has faster data, an additional radio. Early versions will have dedicated chip (as Mike says) so will be comparable to the Evo, but will be somewhat better as integration between 3G and 4G is smarter. Within a few months the next generation of handsets will be far better, using integrated 3G+4G chips as they are available. These draw less power (fewer devices, higher integration is a good thing) and will have far better integration of the services. There are fewer 4G cellsites than 3G ones, so on average your phone will have to 'shout louder' to get a connection to a further cell: that also hurts battery life. This is a reason people are proposing many, many more 4G small cells and femto cells for 4G All of which said, 4G inevitably draws more power than 3G (and Why does 3G mobile cellular signal use more power than 2G?) so unless you are using the data service you could switch it off
