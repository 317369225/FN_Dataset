★What is the difference between 3G and 4G networks?
In the industry, the term "4G" is used exclusively to refer to the LTE standard. Several US carriers like to call their service 4G, but improved UMTS/3G (like Tmobile has) or Wimax (like Sprint/Clearwire have) is not really regarded as 4G.  Wimax is closer in terms of throughput but is missing important features in most implementations, such as the ability to handoff a call from one cell to another. I disagree with the first comment above which states that Verizon LTE is not 4G.  I realize I am a newbie on this site but until 2 years ago, I ran a company which sold mobile test equipment and was intimately involved in the industry. I should also note that starting with LTE, all mobile networks are expected to become data-only.  Voice will be carried on the network as VoIP exclusively.
