★What is the difference between 3G and 4G networks?
Nothing really. There are technically no official 4G networks, based on the ITU definition of what is 4G. LTE has a roadmap to get to 4G, but not the versions released to date. So all networks operational to date, including WiMAX and LTE versions from Clearwire and Verizon don't quality, nor does T-Mobile's HSPA network, which would never qualify. THe ITU requires an ability for a sustained 100 Mbps down, 50 Mbps up on a reliable link to qualify as 4G.   What you see today is a marketing ploy getting their Data only network labelled as 4G to separate themselves from other products, which is just a slight improvement on what they had, i.e. HSPA to LTE, EVDO to LTE, etc...
