â˜…What is the difference between 3G and 4G networks?
There are many differences and there's no room to clearly state all of them here. But in an extremely brief answer, the key differences to highlight (between 3G and 4G) are: 1. At the PHY layer, CDMA was replaced by OFDMA and SC-OFDMA. The main reason behind this change is OFDM PHY's suitability for building next generation broadband wireless systems while maintaining low complexity, flexible BW allocation, and providing increased spectral efficiency ( i.e higher data rates). 2. 4G is an all IP network with a simple (relatively) flat IP-Based architecture, an E-UTRAN connected to an Evolved Packet Core (But there's a CS-Fallback capability for voice) 3. The UTRAN hierarchy of 3G becomes E-UTRAN in LTE, 3G's central RNC connecting NodeBs to the Core Network (CN) is removed. In 4G eNodeBs are directly connected to each other and to the EPC (simpler architecture). The main aim is to reduce latency, improve the handover process and facilitate load sharing.
