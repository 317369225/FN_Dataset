★What's the best Verizon 4G Android phone?I upgraded to the HTC thunderbolt in April but returned it because the battery life was terrible and I figured I would just wait for the Motorola Bionic. But I can't wait anymore and would like to chose the best from the ones that exist: Thunderbolt, Samsung Charge & LG Revolution (am I missing any?)...
It changes all the time, but currently I would look at the Samsung Galaxy S4, LG G2, and HTC One.  If you want a huge screen, look at the Note 3.  If you want something smaller, look at the Motorola X or Galaxy S4 Mini.
