â˜…How fast is 4G LTE?
By 4G LTE I assume you mean LTE-Advanced. The normal LTE being rolled out in the world is known as '4G' in marketing terms but its not a correct term. So if we look at both the LTE and LTE-Advanced LTE: The theoretical max is 300Mbps DL and 100Mbps UL in 20MHz spectrum. Some documents show upto 350Mbps but lets just assume 300Mbps as its reasonable high. In practice, getting a 20MHz contiguous band may be difficult in most parts of the world. Also, the practical rates would be far lower due to interference and large number of users. Lte-Advanced: The main feature in LTE-Advanced related to general speed is Carrier-Aggregation that allows the operator and LTE-A capable device to aggregate upto 5 20MHz bands, so in theory the max. speeds would be 1.5Gbps (300Mbps x 5) DL and 500Mbps UL. As you can guess, in practice this may be impossible but nevertheless its a good figure to have. In the US, MetroPCS was the first to launch LTE but its been overshadowed by AT&T and Verizon probably because its relatively local compared to others. Anyway, a recent article in PC world gives a good summary of speed comparisons on the different US networks. It should give you a good idea of the practical speeds in different parts. http://www.pcworld.com/article/2...
