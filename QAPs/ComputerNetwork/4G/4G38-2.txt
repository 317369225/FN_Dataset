â˜…Will the next iPhone have LTE or some sort of 4G chipset?Will the iPhone have 4G?
Doubtful. Apple has a history of waiting until technologies are more fully developed before putting them in their products. Given this pattern and how new LTE is, I wouldn't expect it until the iPhone 6 at the earliest.
