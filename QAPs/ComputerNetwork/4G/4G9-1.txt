â˜…What are the differences between 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G?There's been an evolution in this telecommunications technology over the years, with nomenclatures like 2.5G etc. Recently, Samsung has claimed a breakthrough with 5G: Samsung claims 5G tech breakthrough What does all this actually mean? How has the technology evolved that would result in it being called "xG"?
Its been a while so I am adding to Rupert Baines answer: 1G = analog 2G = digital, voice (GSM) 2.5G added data (GPRS) 2.75G faster data (EDGE) 3G = digital, supported data, packet switched (WCDMA, EvDO) 3.5G faster downlink data (HSDPA) 3.6G faster uplink data (HSUPA/HSPA) 3.75G more enhanced HSPA (HSPA+/eHSPA) 4G = wireless broadband 3.9G Release 8/9 LTE - though marketing folks refer to it as 4G. (My reasoning why its not 4G here: Zahid Ghadialy's answer to 4G: Why is 4G (Advanced) named LTE and not 5G?) 4G Release 10/11/12 LTE-Advanced 'Real' 4G LTE-A when IMT-A requirements are satisfied 4.5G = LTE-A + Wi-Fi 5G = not yet defined Much faster. Likely to be real ~2020/25
