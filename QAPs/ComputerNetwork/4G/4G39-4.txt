â˜…What's the Viterbi algorithm, and how is it applied to CDMA/3G/4G wireless communications?I know it has something to do with hidden markov models, and Andrew Viterbi was a cofounder of Qualcomm, but can someone explain the algorithm in plain english? And is it what makes CDMA-like digital communications possible?
To add to Jesse's answer, the general problem that the Viterbi algorithm is applicable to has the following characteristics: 1. You get an ordered (usually by time) sequence of observations. 2. You have a set of probabilities (emission probabilities) that map any observation to states. P(s,o) is the probability that s happened given that you saw o. 3. You know the probability of state transitions - how likely is the current state to be s when the last one was s`. Using the Viterbi algorithm, you can figure out what the most likely sequence of states was. i.e. some version what actually happened. Not sure how it applies to CDMA but the coding scheme might lend itself to properties 2 and 3 above. It intuitively makes a lot of sense for speech recognition. This is a super-clear explanation: http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Ba...
