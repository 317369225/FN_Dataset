â˜…Will the next iPhone have LTE or some sort of 4G chipset?Will the iPhone have 4G?
I think right now the radio is the biggest problem. The iPhone is already pretty limited in its battery life, and 4G/LTE radios suck down juice the way a body builder drinks protein shakes. The chips that are currently in production are, in Apple's words, "not ready yet." My guess is iPhone 6 is probably more likely.
