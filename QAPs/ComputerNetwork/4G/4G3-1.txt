â˜…What's the best Verizon 4G Android phone?I upgraded to the HTC thunderbolt in April but returned it because the battery life was terrible and I figured I would just wait for the Motorola Bionic. But I can't wait anymore and would like to chose the best from the ones that exist: Thunderbolt, Samsung Charge & LG Revolution (am I missing any?)...
I think you might have a look of android phones designed by chinese companies. like MX3, OPPO find7... my first answer on Quora.
