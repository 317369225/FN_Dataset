â˜…What's the best Verizon 4G Android phone?I upgraded to the HTC thunderbolt in April but returned it because the battery life was terrible and I figured I would just wait for the Motorola Bionic. But I can't wait anymore and would like to chose the best from the ones that exist: Thunderbolt, Samsung Charge & LG Revolution (am I missing any?)...
I'm looking for the same, but I'd say Samsung has always come through for me.
