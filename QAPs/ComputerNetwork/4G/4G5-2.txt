â˜…How is the Redmi Note 4G?
From a perspective of a hardcore-gamer I may ask you to reconsider your option. But on the other hand if you want it for normal day-to-day usage like surfing net, using WhatsApp and other things then its massive 3100 mAh battery would help you to survive for a full day. Moreover, the Redmi Note 4G is getting the latest MIUI 6 in just a few days(if it hasn't already) which has improvements on UI, the camera and the most important battery-life. You may want to buy this as soon as possible!
