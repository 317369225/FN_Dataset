★What will be the killer app for 4G networks?Carriers are currently limiting data usage in their 3G networks, yet they are pitching 4G to be the next big thing. What can be done with increased speed without increasing data limits?
I actually don't see much changing because while the over the air speeds are increasing the connections from the tower back to the Internet are still slow & expensive.  This is because in virtually all cases the wireless provider must purchase connections from a local wire line provider to reach the Internet.  We also don't see enough competition to drive the large carriers into optimizing their networks for efficient data transfer and as long as the public accepts (and keeps paying for) contracts that limit them to 2GB of transfer we won't have a wireless revolution in the US.
