★How is the HTC Evo 4G?For those who have early versions, how does it compare to the iPhone & other Android phones?
I have had the Evo for 3-4 months and love it. I had a Palm Pre previously and that was a great phone (and always like and carry cutting edge phones), but the software options for the Android platform are spectacular.  The Evo is large in area but thin - I carry it in my back left pocket without a case (only using a screen protector).  I bought a really nice and inexpensive charging cradle for my desk (Kidigi on ebay).  Battery life is reasonable (using Launcher Pro and ATK).  Features and performance of this phone is excellent.  I love this phone and am trying to convince my wife to get one to replace her Palm Pre (but she is resistant to change and also wants to keep her Pre until it breaks).  Took me quite a long time to find the utilities and apps to make this phone really work great for me.
