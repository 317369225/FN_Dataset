★How much faster is 4G relative to 3G?I know that 4G is being claimed by many of the carriers now and it is based on 3G+ ... an upgrade (not 4G)
A couple of related questions: Is AT&T's "new" 4G network just their 3G renamed? Can we consider WiMax and LTE as 4G? HSPA+ which is sensibly described as 3.5G has a top speed  R8  gives 42Mbps downlink, 11Mbps uplink for HSPA+ in current versions, with a roadmap to higher rates. [EDIT to include Kang's correction].  WiMAX (as used by Sprint & CLEAR) can deliver 40Mbps LTE (Verizon & soon AT&T) depends on which channel bandwidth the operators uses (it is a more flexible standard) but the headline rate for advertising is 100Mbps. With LTE-A the maximum rates could be a lot more (hypotetically 1Gbps) but in reality few carriers will have enough spectrum for that to be practical. Three important caveats All of those are 'headline' numbers. No-one will ever get them in reality. The rate you will get depends heavily on how crowded the network is (wireless is a shared medium). Busy city centre at peak hours will be far worse than the same place at 4AM. The rate you get depends on geography: how far from cell-tower you are (at a few miles you'll get the same slow service with all technologies equally), are there walls or metallised windows in the way, etc etc There will not be a simple answer to this, or to ''Which network is fastest'' - expect a lot of reviews, useful websites and debate.
