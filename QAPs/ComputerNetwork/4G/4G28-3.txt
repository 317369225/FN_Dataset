★Why do 4G phones consume more battery?
The UI always says "switch 4G antenna" . Even if you are not downloading anything- it still consumes a lot of battery. Leaving Wifi on consumes very little battery. compared with leaving 4G on. I strongly suspect that the 4G signal needs to be boosted.  You can switch 3G data network off. If you do it, you will discover numerous 4G deadspots. My question was not about battery life. I have an after market battery with 3500 mAH. In fact, I have sveral and I switch them as needed. WiFi locations have become very iffy with explosion of tablets and smartphones.4G is a life saver in many airports and coffee shops.   Is the 4G signal at a different frequency with much poorer building penentration, and needs a boost?
