★What is LTE (4G)?
LTE means long term evolution. it's the next generation network after 3g. generally ，the term represents the wireless part of the network. in 3g time, the wireless part is composed of RNC and nodeB. However in LTE network, there's only enodeB which acts as rnc and enodeB. The core network changes a lot in LTE network, the SGSN becomes MME and GGSN develops into sae-gw which means SGW and PGW. And the MME only handles signalling data in LTE network. The user plane data transfers directly from enodeB to SGW. By using this type of network, the speed of the user-plane can be enhanced a lot, besides the network is becoming simpler
