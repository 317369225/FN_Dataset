★Is AT&T's "new" 4G network just their 3G renamed?I read something to that effect a week or two ago...
Yes, their 'new' 4G network is the 3G one renamed This is purely marketing: the 'new' network is the same network (HSDPA/HSUPA and moving to HSPA+) they had last year and which was then described as 3G.   Indeed, to illustrate the confusion their advertising campaign about 'The fastest 3G network' is still running and is exactly the same one they are now selling as 4G ?! They will be launching LTE which most people describe as 4G - heaven knows how they will market that when the time comes... For more discussion on 'What is 4G?' and are they right to describe it this way Can we consider WiMax and LTE as 4G?
