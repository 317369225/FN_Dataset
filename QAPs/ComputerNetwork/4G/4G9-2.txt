â˜…What are the differences between 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G?There's been an evolution in this telecommunications technology over the years, with nomenclatures like 2.5G etc. Recently, Samsung has claimed a breakthrough with 5G: Samsung claims 5G tech breakthrough What does all this actually mean? How has the technology evolved that would result in it being called "xG"?
There are institutions in charge of standardizing each generation of mobile technology. Each generation has requirements that specify things like throughput, delay, etc. that need to be met to be considered part of that generation. In some cases when companies get close to meeting certain requirements, but they are not entirely met, they call it a fraction of that generation say 3.9G (almost 4G). I'm not sure if there is any control over those specific claims, but they can certainly be sued if they call it 4G. As for the particular news article attached to this question, they claim to have reached 5G, this standard, as of today, still does not exist, so nobody can claim to have reached 5G yet. Preliminary discussions agree that 5G will be placed somewhere near the 10Gbps downstream static (when the mobile device is not moving), so in my personal opinion this is still far from 5G. Actually 1Gbps is the 4G static download speed threshold, so this quite close to 4G. On the other hand, the claim might rest on the fact that these are preliminary tests, assuming they can significantly improve the throughput they might be on their way to 5G.
