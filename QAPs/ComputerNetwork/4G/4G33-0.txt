â˜…Does Clear 4G WiMax wireless broadband work well?How good is the coverage? How does it compare to Verizon, Sprint, etc.? I'm curious about the SF Bay Area. http://www.clear.com/plans
I guess it depends which market you're in, and where you're testing it from. I conducted some non-scientific tests on Sprint 4G (which is Clear's infrastructure) in Silicon Valley and posted my results here: http://bit.ly/g9yj8Y
