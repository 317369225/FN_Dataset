★What's the Viterbi algorithm, and how is it applied to CDMA/3G/4G wireless communications?I know it has something to do with hidden markov models, and Andrew Viterbi was a cofounder of Qualcomm, but can someone explain the algorithm in plain english? And is it what makes CDMA-like digital communications possible?
To understand Viterbi decoding, you need to understand Convolutional Encoding. They work on concert with each other, so make sure you take a look at both. Bottom line, convolution encoding takes random data and puts into a encoded process, sometimes this is Markov, other times it uses other encoding, depending on if it is voice or data and the amount of protection versus latency. Once you encode with one of these techniques you can use a Viterbi decoder, that assumes given the last pieces of valid data, the only logical next step can be the following bit. The problem is that if you have too many consecutive errors, the whole process is lost and you have to start over.   So if the process defines the path as 0, 0, 1, 1, 0 and that last bit comes across as a 1, you can replace that data and move on, correcting the error and therby reducing the energy to transmit that bit, in that you can accomodate so many errors. The more you encode, the more gain you have, but the more latency is created which will kill voice.
