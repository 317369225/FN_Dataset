â˜…What is 4G and whats the hype about?
Honestly, there is nothing about the current implementation of 4G that helps most folks unless you are in a mobile-dense area. While yes, 4G provides a healthy boost to your browsing speeds, offers a bit more clarity and QoS to call features, it's mainly a need for carriers so they can stuff more into the air in a smaller space, helping the, to maximize efficiency and save a few pennies in operations (gaining more in profits). There are also some eventual security related aspects to various 4G technologies. That's not something to care about until networks are 4G only and there is no longer a need to drop down to 2/3G technologies. that should start happening in earnest in 2017. Does it make your life better? No, not really. It might help in some instances, but as a great value proposition, the only things carriers can offer are speeds and feeds.
