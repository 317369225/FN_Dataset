â˜…How is the HTC Evo 4G?For those who have early versions, how does it compare to the iPhone & other Android phones?
I can't stand it. The Evo's battery life is absolutely atrocious. I can go from full overnight charge to nothing by mid-morning. I'm running ATK and that helps marginally. I've resorted to hiding spare battery packs everywhere as well as spare chargers. And that's without 4G running. I've just decided to ignore the 4G features because that makes battery life even worse. For most applications, you don't really need the extra bandwidth anyway. Size wise, it's definitely a bulky phone and much bigger than the iPhone. But you get a bigger screen. As for Android vs. iPhone, here's a post I did on the tradeoffs: http://redesignmobile.com/2010/0... Short version is that it depends on what you want out of your phone. The iPhone is much more polished and has a much better out-of-the-box experience; Android is rough around the edges but a lot more customizable.
