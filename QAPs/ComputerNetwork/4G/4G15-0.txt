â˜…What exactly is 4G/LTE and how does the technology work?Thank you for your answers. Some might have misunderstood the question due to my phrasing. I'm looking for an answer from a science perspective.
Good answer by Demian Blair but let me add some more details. '3G' was officially known as 'IMT-2000'. 4G is oficially known as 'IMT-Advanced'. ITU defined certain requirements that has to be met by a technology to be considered as 'IMT-A' or '4G'. There were 2 technologies that satisfied the criteria, 802.16m and LTE-A Many tech savvy operators like NTT Docomo, refer to LTE as pre-4G or 3.9G because LTE-A is supposed to be 4G, not LTE. The marketing people on the other hand refer to LTE as 4G and LTE-A as 4.5G and in one case recently, even as 5G. Personally, I wouldnt call LTE-A as anything other than 4G. Having said that, LTE-A as it stands at the moment, doesnt satisfy the requirements for IMT-A as shown in the picture below As it stands at the moment, the LTE devices you are able to purchase belong generally to UE category 3 (theoretical max DL = 100Mbps, UL = 50Mbps) or category 4 (DL = 150Mbps, UL = 50Mbps). The next generation of devices about to be released or released in some markets are the category 6 devices (DL = 300Mbps, UL = 50Mbps). The next evolution most likely will be category 9 devices (DL = 450Mbps, UL = 50Mbps). To read more about the categories, see: New LTE-A UE Category 9 and 10 in Rel-11
