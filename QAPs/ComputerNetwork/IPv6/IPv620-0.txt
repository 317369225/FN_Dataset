★What are IPv6 addresses?Global unicast, Multicast, Link local, Unique local, eui 64 and autoconfiguration.
Global unicast is an address which is part of a network prefix that has been allocated by a central authority (the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) that can communicate directly, point to point over the global Internet. Multicast is an address space where multiple devices can conenct to one another. Link local is a self-assigned address assigned limited to a specific link (e.g., ethernet or point to point link) which is significant only on that link and is not visible from any other link.  Even if no other address is assigned to a device, the devices that share the same link can communicate with each other using IPv6. Unique local is an address used for a network which is not managed by a central authority but maintained as unique inside a private network. These are analogous to IPv4 RFC 1918 addresses. Eui-64 is a 64 bit MAC address, or a 48 bit MAC address padded out to 64 bits.  These 64 bits may be used in the lower 64 bits of an IPv6 address (the "Internet ID") when not using privacy addressing. Autoconfiguration is a method of self-assigning an IPv6 address and learning which gateway should be used for off-net communication.  I wrote a blog on this at IPv6 Automatic Addressing.    Embed Quote
