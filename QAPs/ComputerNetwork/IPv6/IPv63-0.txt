★Does Amazon Web Services support IPv6?Can I give an EC2 instance a public IPv6 address? Can I access S3 over IPv6? If not, when?
As of November 2014 they don't support IPv6 on VPCs (which they are pushing all EC2 users towards). This holds for both ELBs and EC2 nodes with VPCs[1]. Jeff Bar, an AWS employee, was asked yesterday and said: 'nothing to report at present, but we know people need it'[2].
