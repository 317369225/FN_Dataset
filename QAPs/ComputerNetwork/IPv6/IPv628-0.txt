★What will potentially replace IPv6?Of course IPv6 is still enroute Technologies, Standards and use case once we exceed it capabilities.  Keep in mind designers of IPv4 never believed it would ever be exhausted.
Most people have a really hard time grasping truly large numbers. IPv4 total address space is about 4 Billion, and that seems pretty big but we've pretty much run out. So, now we have IPv6. Where IPv6 was 32-bits long, IPv6 is 128-bits long. Now, it's easy to look at that and say, oh, it's only 4 times bigger. In actuality, it's 7.9x10^28 times as big as IPv4. That is a ridiculously huge number. It's so big that it's hard to put in perspective just how large it is. Here is what they look like written out: IPv4 = 4,294,967,296 IPv6 = 340,282,366,920,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Even that 7.9x10^28 number is dumbfoundingly huge. Let's say we give out the equivalent of the entire IPv4 address space every second. It would take 2.5x10^21 years to exhaust the address space. The age of the entire universe is postulated to be only about 1.4x10^10 years old (14 billion). If you started at the beginning of the universe as we know it and started giving out 4 billion IP addresses every second, by the present day you would have used up .0000000000056 % of the total IPv6 address space. I think it's safe to say that we're going to be ok with IPv6 up until we replace the current system with something completely new. It could be quantum entanglement networks allowing FTL communication. Who knows. Edited: typo    Embed Quote
