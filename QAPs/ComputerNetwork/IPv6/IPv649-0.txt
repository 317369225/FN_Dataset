★We all have already heard of IPv4 and IPv6. But what about IPv5? What is IPv5 and why are we converting straight to IPv6 and not to IPv5?IP = Internet Protocol.
The main problem with this question (and it is asked a lot) is the assumption that "version" is a sequential, monotonically increasing number such as a software version.   This is not the case; it is better to think of that field as a "class" or "type" field, where the number stands in place of a name.  By convention, the field is called "version" but it does not behave as one would expect a version to behave. In late 1990, the deficiencies of the Internet Protocol (version 4) were evident and the IPng (IP Next Generation) IETF project was launched.  Several "IP version" proposals emerged from that, and you can read way more than your fill on the topic at Scott Bradners IPng site at http://www.sobco.com/ipng/.  If you really want a feel of the behind the scenes politicking, check out http://www.pdfio.com/k-747356.html.  Bob Hinden tells a story of the early history of IPng and the battle of the IP versions in the attached video, including the time when IPv7 was "mandated" as the new Internet Protocol version at an IETF meeting in Kyoto.     Embed Quote
