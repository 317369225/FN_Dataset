★Does IPv6 reduce routing latency?Why or why not?
One ammendment to Jeff Loughridge's excellent answer. During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, there may be additional delay introduced at the points in the network where address translation occurs between the two address spaces. If you are an end user, there isn't much you can do. If your ISP only supports IPv4, then your traffic needs to be translated to IPv6 for IPv6 hosts. If your ISP supports IPv6, then traffic will have to be translated to IPv4 reach IPv4 hosts. If your ISP supports both IPv4 and IPv6 as well as your host, then the proper network should be selected on a per host basis. Unless, as Jeff points out, your traffic takes a more circuitous route based on the address space. If you are a content provider, you really want to add IP and DNS support for both IPv4 and IPv6 so that end users can reach you using both address spaces.    Embed Quote
