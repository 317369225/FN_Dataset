★Why Facebook timeouts in IPv6?While I am using 6to4 with my dd-wrt router, and set my Win7 to default IPv6, my facebook connections went timeout or very slow connection. Any idea?
6to4 routing depends on the "kindness of strangers."  By design, you have no way to predict which 6to4 gateway you are using, what path it takes, and who is managing that device.  As a result, your experience will range between unpredictable and unacceptable. You should avoid the use of 6to4.  Ole Troan outlines the reasons in some detail on the IETF draft : Request to move Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds (6to4) to Historic status. If you are running DD-WRT and you must use tunneling, consider using Hurricane Electric's IPv6 Tunnel Broker instead.    Embed Quote
