★What is the benefit of IPv6?It seems like NAT is good enough.
See http://www.aaisp.net.uk/kb-broad... and also http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc65... NAT is a burden on every peer-to-peer application developer. It's a pain in the neck trying to develop kludges that will work with different kinds of NAT translators. Even worse some users are behind multiple levels of NAT. Developing say an instant messenger application that does user-to-user direct message passing or file transfer is an example of this. NAT is a kind of invisible software tax on this kind of app development. Technologies like STUN attempt to lower this cost. Teredo does so too. Remote access is made nightmarish by NAT as well. Say that you are away from home and you want to reach into your LAN at home and administer some box or other, or print something on your own home printer. In this case NAT is your enemy.    Embed Quote
