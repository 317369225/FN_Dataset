★What will be used next after IPv6?
Nothing because, as it's conceived, IPv6 allows to never run out of IP addresses. They could probably improve it somehow but you don't replace something working good for heck of it, unless there's something better. Anyway, as we're talking about protocols (i.e. generally accepted standards), even if there were something better, it would take years for the IT community to generally accept it. In fact, like you probably know, we're still transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6. Transitioning isn't something so immediate because you have to upgrade servers and the Internet backbone is formed by huge servers. In order to upgrade them you have to temporarily take them down and you can't do that without a proper planning because that could cause huge slowdowns and crashes. What's more, upgrading a server can go South and make things worse sometimes because an upgrade is always a little bit like tumbling dice: you can't know what you'll get. Hope that makes the picture clearer but I barely scratched the surface of it.    Embed Quote
