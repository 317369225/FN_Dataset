★How much on an effect will IPv6 have on the average user?I tried to access http://ipv6.google.com/ and i'm unable to. Does it have to do with my internet provider or my PC.
I am not a networking specialist, but I think IPv6 shouldn't have a direct effect on the user, I mean the user shouldn't do any special configuration to his computer if it's not and XP or older. Windows XP supports it (but you have to install it as a separate service, configure it) and Windows Vista/7 fully supports it by default. You ISP should upgrade its network or integrate its actual IPv4 network with an IPv6 network. Hope other people will give you a better answer...    Embed Quote
