★Why haven't more ISPs used IPv6?It seems inevitable that all ISPs will migrate to using the IPv6 standard.  What are the reasons why (in detail) this has not occurred in a more robust manner?
For one, not all enterprise/carrier network gear fully supports IPv6. Some have vastly limited support, serious flaws, or it simply don't work at all, even if it's brand new or current generation. Some work perfectly. Your mileage may vary. Secondly, many ISPs still have plenty of room and they can take care of tight spots by simply shifting around IPv4 address blocks, especially for consumer/home users that are assigned dynamic IP addresses anyway. Some are not so lucky, but live in denial. Some strongly feel that IPv4 is the ONLY way to go, and will do just about anything to ensure that "IPv6 doesn't happen." It is truly turning into a holy war (see also: platform war, Mac vs PC, etc) with some big players STRONGLY in one camp or the other. They'd rather stare at each other over the fence instead of working out their objections. Lastly, there's a severe lack of understanding and education. People, including ISP network engineers, fear change and things they don't understand. Yes, IPv6 is vastly different, but it works and you can learn it. All engineers and sys admins need to get over themselves and learn what is inevitably going to happen. On a good note, some ISPs and enterprise network operators ARE testing or even already in production with IPv6. World IPv6 day is coming up, and you will see who the leaders are that are actively building what they need to make for an easy transition. Bottom line: learn to operate the dual stack (v4 and v6 in parallel) and be ahead of the pack.    Embed Quote
