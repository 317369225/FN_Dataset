★Will IPv6 be cheaper for me?My apartment is made of concrete walls and my wifi router is unable to get through the thick walls. I have telephone points in all rooms so i drag my modem around..but bsnl doesn't like it and allows me one dynamic ipv4 address on one telephone point in one room and has asked that i get seperate broadband connections for each room if i want or wifi range extenders.
I'm not entirely certain what a "telephone point" is, but I suspect I know what the problem is.  IPv6 won't make a difference.  They clearly configure your modem so that only one CPE can be registered with it.  This is very common among broadband ISPs.  It does allow them to be more spare with IP address ranges, but it's not the only reason.  Modems just aren't like our household ethernet switches or old hubs.  It's typical for even the most dirt cheap switch to have just enough memory in it to address 12 bits worth of devices (a little over 4,000).  Cable modems can't.  Essentially they need to offload the responsibility of getting all your devices connected to you. Granted, restricting it to one single CPE is ridiculous because you end up with an extreme lack of flexibility.  I noticed my own ISP recently dropped the default modem config to just one CPE as well.  I couldn't figure out for the life of me why I couldn't get my new wireless access point working.  Finally realized what it was, cleared modem (e.g. power cycle), worked fine.  Modems that don't clear their registrations on a power cycle are not unheard of though, so that might also be a condition of your problem.  You might look for a 'factory' reset button on the modem though.  Shouldn't hurt anything, the modem will just take a while longer to come up because it has to do its initial frequency ranging all over again, but once it's locks, it's going to download it's boot file just like it usually does and behave normally after.    Embed Quote
