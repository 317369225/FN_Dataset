★What will be used next after IPv6?
The IPv9 standard (described here) should handle things once we outgrow IPv6's address space.  At least until parallel universes are discovered.... The humor value in the IPv9 memo is that it is a direct response to the fact that IPv6 provides enough IP addresses so as to afford every man, woman, and child on the planet enough addresses such that they could assign unique IP addresses to each cell in their respective bodies.  And even this uses less than a billionth of the available IPv6 address space. It is, quite simply, difficult to conceive reaching the point where we need more IP addresses than IPv6's design affords.  The larger problem is whether we'll be able to build routing algorithms that can route such a large address space efficiently.    Embed Quote
