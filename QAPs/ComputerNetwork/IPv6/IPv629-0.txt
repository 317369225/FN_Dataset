★How widespread is IPv6 in India if any?Which of the major ISPs in India are IPv6-capable?
Not very.  Cisco aggregates worldwide IPv6 statistics at Cisco IPv6 Lab: IPv6 Deployment, where you can see only 0.25% of user traffic from India is IPv6 (behind the world average of around 1%). Although India is highly committed to IPv6, rollout has been slow.  IPv6 test - Statistics for India shows a nonrandom sample of IPv6 tests from India from the IPv6/4 connectivity and speed test website. The tunnel providers (Hurricane Electric and gogo6) are #1 and #3, with MTNL Delhi and BSNL at #2 and #4. A Wikipedia article (IPv6 deployment) tracks IPv6 Deployment by country with user provided notes on what providers offer IPv6.    Embed Quote
