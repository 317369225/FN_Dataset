★When will Verizon FiOS support IPv6?Officially the rollout was supposed to begin in 3Q 2012.  What's causing the delay and when will it actually happen?
Adding IPv6 support has to be done end-to-end. That means that not only do the intervening routers have to support it, but the caching engine, the shaping equipment, the provisioning system, the SIP server, and everything else related to service has to to support it. So, while they may have IPv6 support across the network, they may be running into problems with the VoIP servers or the provisioning system. This is one of the reasons why v6 adoption has lagged, and it's not a visible problem to anyone outside of an ISP.    Embed Quote
