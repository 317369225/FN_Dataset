★Why couldn't MAC addresses be used instead of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses for networking?
Consider a real world analogy:  I need to send a message to "123 Elm Street," "PO Box 5465," or even "16453 SomeGloballyUniqueStreetName."  While the names may be locally or globally unique, I don't know exactly how to reach them unless I know something more about how to find the neighborhood.  I could conceivably pore through nationwide directories looking for the specific street to determine where I would send it, but this implies that I have an up to date universal directory of every street name throughout the nation. Post offices introduced Postal Codes (ZIP codes in the US) in order to introduce a hierarchy of addressing to route paper mail.  A ZIP code of 95134 provides increasing specificity from left to right.  A mail sorter sees the "9," and can just toss the item in the bucket destined to the western US.   Once it gets nearer to the western US, it will get routed towards region "51" and then when it gets to region 51 it will be sent to post office "34." Mail sorters working in station 34 should be able to uniquely identify the street address (e.g., 123 Elm Street) in its service area.  They are also in a better position to track local address changes and quirks about special considerations for a given address. In this case, the ZIP code is analagous to the Layer 3 address (IPv4 or IPv6) and the street address is analogous to the MAC address.  While you could route directly on the street address (MAC address) in theory, the addition of a heirarchy of addressing makes routing much more efficient by encoding specific location information inside of the address.    Embed Quote
