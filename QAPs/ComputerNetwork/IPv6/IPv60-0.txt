★What is IPv6?
Internet Protocol version 6.  It ever so slowly replacing Internet Protocol version 4, which is currently the most used version of the IP.  It basically specifies the addressing of computers on a network(s) and sub-networks.  More specifically, TCP/IP networks which include the Internet. IPv4 addresses are running out, as each publicly addressed computer/device must have one.  They have 32 bits represented in decimal notation like: 192.168.1.1.  IPv6 increases the amount of addresses available exponentially by using 128 bits represented in hexadecimal notation like: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.    Embed Quote
