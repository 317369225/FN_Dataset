★What is the impact of IPv6 on VoIP?What is the impact of the migration from IPv4 to IPv6 for VoIP technologies, Asterisk, etc.?
There are positives and negatives to an IPV6 migration specific to VoIP.  On the positive side, there's IPV6 support in versions 1.8+ of Asterisk and this support is improving all the time.  Additionally, IPV6 addresses issues of NAT traversal more elegantly than IPV4 which makes it preferable for use looking forward.  However, there are many application houses and service providers that have been slow to adopt IPV6 and a wholesale migration might leave you out in the cold or at least restrict your options in these categories. I encourage anyone using Asterisk to begin experimentation with IPV6 as soon as possible.  We all know that the migration to IPV6 is an inevitability.    Embed Quote
