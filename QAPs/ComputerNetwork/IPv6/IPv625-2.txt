★Will IPv6 be cheaper for me?My apartment is made of concrete walls and my wifi router is unable to get through the thick walls. I have telephone points in all rooms so i drag my modem around..but bsnl doesn't like it and allows me one dynamic ipv4 address on one telephone point in one room and has asked that i get seperate broadband connections for each room if i want or wifi range extenders.
first, ipv4 &  ipv6 are like unique address scheme  given to our pc in world,  so that everyone can communicate with each other. ipv6 is de newer addressing  technology. there s no relation between a addressing technology(ipv4 or ipv6)  & speed i would suggest try "Power Line ethernet Communication"    Embed Quote
