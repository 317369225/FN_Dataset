★Who are the technical leaders driving the IPv6 rollout in Brazil?I am especially interested in UOL.com.br contacts.
The best resource is undoubtedly the group at NIC.br, specialy the guys from ipv6.br. There's a mailing list, and there's an yearly seminar about IPv6 implementation. Network engineers from companies like UOL and Globo.com usually participate. Some names for you to follow include Antonio Moreiras and Ricardo Patara. These folks participate in ICANN and are responsible - among other things - for managing IP address allocation for Brazil. Just for the record, I was present to the 2014 seminar and I was surprised to see how far we are now, compared to a few years ago. Some major telcos were there, and for the first time I remember thing "now it goes". Carlos Ribeiro    Embed Quote
