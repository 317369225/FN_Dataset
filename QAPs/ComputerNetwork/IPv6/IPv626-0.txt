★When will Verizon FiOS support IPv6?Officially the rollout was supposed to begin in 3Q 2012.  What's causing the delay and when will it actually happen?
I can give one possible explanation.  One of the problems ISPs face is that when they finally start going live with IPv6 and/or CGN solutions, ARIN (and presumably other RIRs) is immediately going to start punishing the ISP.  You'll never get so much as a /24 out of them ever again.  The incentive to rush into a position of never being able to get a public ipv4 address again is more daunting than the current situation of having to whine, cry, beg, and plead to get more.  In other words, nothing is going to happen until the well is truly dry.    Embed Quote
