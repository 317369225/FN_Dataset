★What is the benefit of IPv6?It seems like NAT is good enough.
RFC 4684 Speaks to your question on NAT and IPv6 in depth but, I will summarize some of the limitations of NAT in IPv4 and how IPv6 can improve on them. First the primary purpose of NAT was to reduce the consumption rate of IPv4 addresses.  Many nodes could now share a single IP address.  This works well for simple networks but what if there is a large number of nodes on the inside of the firewall such as with ISPs?  You could get into a situation that forces you to use cascading NAT. Therefore, you run into problems where multiple nodes behind a NAT firewall need to offer a service on the same port. IPSec is another driving reason for IPv6. IPSec does not always play nice with NAT traversals although extensions can help; mainly encapsulation in UDP and a keep alive so the connection isn't cut off. This is a burden on the firewalls supporting it. If one side is behind a stateful fiirewall without port forwarding configured to that particular host, then the host behind the firewall must initiate the connection.  If both sides are behind stateful firewalls then you have some really interesting configuration issues. These are two limitations with IPv4 and NAT that IPv6 will help.  There are workarounds for both, but they are computationally expensive for the firewall, require a lot of configuration, or both.    Embed Quote
