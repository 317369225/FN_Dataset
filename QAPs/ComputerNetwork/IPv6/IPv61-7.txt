★What is the benefit of IPv6?It seems like NAT is good enough.
No that's the point. NAT is not enough. NAT has some disadvantages: 1. It makes the process slow since you will take some time to process the packet, store information, and process it back when reply comes from other side. 2. It violates the rule that middle hosts will only see upto layer 3 in the packet since it also checks the incoming and outgoing port in the packet. 3. Depending on what type of NAT is there, it may be difficult to establish P2P connection between 2 clients behind different NATs. There are whole STUN and TURN protocol just based on this: WebRTC in the real world: STUN, TURN and signaling - HTML5 Rocks There are others more like security concerns as well. But it should give you an idea that NAT is just a hack and not a solution to depleting IPv4 addresses.    Embed Quote
