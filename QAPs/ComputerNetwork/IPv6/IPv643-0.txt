★Will the proliferation of IPv6 reduce the need of a router?Since the whole internet would be able to reach more devices directly.
No. Routers are the fundamental building block of IP networks and will continue to function in that role with IPv6. In IPv6, network address translation (NAT) will no longer be needed for home networks, thus getting us closer to the end-to-end principle on which the Internet was based. While devices will communicate using IPv6 without NATs in the middle, the data path will still traverse routers. Routers are needed to interconnect networks in a scalable fashion. IPv6 does not introduce change in this regard.    Embed Quote
