★What will be used next after IPv6?
This question presupposes that we're actually going to start using IPv6 at some point :) VPN, supernetting, and ubiquitous local networks have taken a lot of the pressure off of IPv4. Most people don't see a pressing need to switch to IPv6 unless they are running extremely large private networks when everyone understands and is totally comfortable with IPv4. That will change as more of the world comes online in a really serious way, but not before. When we reach the future described in some science fiction (I think Peter F. Hamilton?) and we're measuring processing power in flops per atom in the solar system we'll use IPv9 (if we're still using IP at all). But IPv6 should last us a good long time, probably long enough to get us to whatever lies beyond IP.    Embed Quote
