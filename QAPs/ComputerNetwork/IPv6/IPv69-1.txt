★How will IPV6 affect China's Great Firewall?
There's also DNS pollution, using ipv6 would solve this problem cause GFW works on ipv4 only currently. At least this is how I deal with GFW at school right now. But I bet it won't be long before the GFW guys work out this problem. Ipv6 is still not prevalent in China, but when it is, the authorities won't stand by watching. Problems of the GFW could temporarily be compromised through technical measures, but to disable GFW forever, there could be only one way -- promoting the freedom of speech. Technical measures could only be catalyst, right?    Embed Quote
