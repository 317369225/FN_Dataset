★Is it possible to switch my home network to exclusively IPv6 without a loss of functionality?How would this work?  Any tutorials out there?
Based on experimenting on my own in multiple consumer network environments, I wouldn't recommend trying to go IPv6 only as it will likely result in a lot of errors - mainly due to the fact that a large portion of the Internet is severely behind in supporting IPv6. This is demonstrated by the fact that the majority of consumer routers still don't support native IPv6, and most telco's are still trying to figure out how to best handle the transition without impacting customer service. You're probably better off implementing a dual-stack environment that prefers IPv6 over IPv4 whenever possible. On a side note, I highly recommend going to HE.net and signing up for their (free) IPv6 certification. You'll learn a ton about how IPv6 works, and it will walk you through setting up various IPv6 environments.    Embed Quote
