★Why haven't more ISPs used IPv6?It seems inevitable that all ISPs will migrate to using the IPv6 standard.  What are the reasons why (in detail) this has not occurred in a more robust manner?
I agree that it is inevitable that ISPs will migrate to IPv6 eventually. The key word there is "eventually" - in an economy that values quarterly results above all else, and especially in a business with tight margins already, there is perceived value is delaying/pushing IPv6 back.  (To be honest, I am OK with an ISP taking their time, planning their deployment and doing it right - as long as they are not just sticking their head underground hoping it never happens to them.  Ignorance, in this case, should be criminal - and may actually be legally actionable by their shareholders!)    Embed Quote
