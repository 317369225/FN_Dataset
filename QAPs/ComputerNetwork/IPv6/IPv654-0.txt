★What networking technologies does IPv6 render unnecessary?NAT (Network Address Translation), for example, has become an enormously popular solution to the impending IPv4 address exhaustion, but like NAT traversal, no longer seem necessary with IPv6.
A better question might be what has IPv6 changed significantly. NAT-PT can still be used to translate between IPv6 and IPv4 (something we're likely going to have to do for years). DHCPv6 exists as one means of address assignment. IPv6 is extensible for IPSEC and Mobility. Other extensions, such as for QoS, could also be developed. IPv6 does not have a traditional Broadcast address - it uses Multicast instead. IPv6 identifies each flow so QoS and other forms of traffic management will be more efficient.    Embed Quote
