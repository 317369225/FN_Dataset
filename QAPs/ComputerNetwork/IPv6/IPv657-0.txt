★Why are IPv6 addresses only 128 bits long instead of 256 bits?Considering quantum computing & advancement in nanotechnology.
Because that would have been wasteful. More bits in the address mean more overhead in every single packet. And it wouldn't have added any capabilities to the protocol. 2^128 is already a huge number and no one has made a credible argument that it's not enough. BTW, the right way of solving this problem was to make the address variable length. This was discussed and rejected.    Embed Quote
