★Does the Xbox 360 support IPv6?I've been looking into getting into a Comcast IPv6 trial, but if my 360 doesn't support IPv6, it can take some tinkering for it to work. Microsoft hasn't responded emails or tweets about this question.
Even though the Xbox 360 and Xbox Live do not (yet) support IPv6, note that xbox.com does. xbox.com has address 65.55.42.140 xbox.com has IPv6 address 2a01:111:f009::3b03 The Xbox One does support IPv6.    Embed Quote
