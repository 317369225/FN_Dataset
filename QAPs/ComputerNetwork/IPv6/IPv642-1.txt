★Is it possible to switch my home network to exclusively IPv6 without a loss of functionality?How would this work?  Any tutorials out there?
This depends on what functionality you require. If all the functionality you require can make use of application layer proxies (e.g. HTTP proxy, email MTA, such like) then, presuming you run such proxies somewhere at the edge of your network and the IPv4 internet then you won't lose any functionality. However, the chances are there are at least some services which you don't want to or can't proxy easily, such as perhaps file-sharing or VoIP (Skype). These functionalities you would lose. In short, to answer is it possible (at the moment): Almost certainly *not*.    Embed Quote
