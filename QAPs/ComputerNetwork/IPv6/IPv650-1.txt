★What is the relationship between IPv6 and HTTPS?When I use ipv6 in my school,I can only access some websites by https
Nominally, IPv6 is a network layer protocol while HTTPS is an application layer one. The two are independent from each other, and connected by the transport layer protocol TCP. As long as TCP runs, HTTPS runs, no matter what runs beneath TCP, IPv6 or IPv4. Such is the design of protocol layers, to encapsulate details and implementation. Given your question and your affirmation of being in China, however, the most likely cause that you can only access certain sites over HTTPS is the GFW. GFW employs various means of censoring and filtering, and some of the methods do not work when the connection is encrypted. So, for example, over IPv6 you can access https:// but not plain http:// version of Google. This does not have anything to do with IPv6 per se.    Embed Quote
