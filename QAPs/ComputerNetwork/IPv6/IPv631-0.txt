★What is the impact of IPv6 on VoIP?What is the impact of the migration from IPv4 to IPv6 for VoIP technologies, Asterisk, etc.?
We just did a major overhaul of an Asterisk installation. Pulled out 6 Digium cards and went pure VOIP ( sorry Bryan M. Johns ) We used a server with 2 Ethernet connections. One going to the interior private network, the second on a public address space in our DMZ. Firewall is pin holed to allow traffic from their service provider and remote workers through. This avoided the thorny issue of NAT transversal, and looks like it will work for IPv6. The big advantage is that you won't need to call your ISP and ask for more public ip numbers. This client had 2 open numbers so we were in good shape.    Embed Quote
