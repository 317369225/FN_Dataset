★What is it going to take for IPv6 to be adopted?When do you estimate that IPv4 will be replaced?
It has been adopted but slowly. IPv6, when it was developed in 90's, failed to deliver any benefit besides more address space. As a result, it has not been adopted as quickly as people like to. Even when IPv4 address space is depleted, ISP community mainly in USA will be very creative such as large scale NAT. So when you have a big part of Internet running IPv4, IPv6 will always be the "bad guy" that will make it compatible to legacy IPv4. There are various tunneling schemes but none is easy.    Embed Quote
