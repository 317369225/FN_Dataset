★How much on an effect will IPv6 have on the average user?I tried to access http://ipv6.google.com/ and i'm unable to. Does it have to do with my internet provider or my PC.
As for accessing google via IPv6, the short answer is "both." Your PC and your ISP need to have native or tunneled access to an IPv6-enabled network to access that site. In the larger picture, when the conversion is all complete (years from now) the average consumer won't be affected a whole lot. Things should just work. In the interim, the average consumer is probably going to have to upgrade their wireless router in their home and learn some very basic IPv6 functionality to get it working on their home network. Current operating systems should be able to handle it as well (though some are a bit wonky in functionality). Hopefully the big cable and phone companies will write up some really good web-based resources to help out their customers get started when they pull the trigger and enable it to your premise.    Embed Quote
