★Does the transition to IPV6 introduce significant security vulnerabilities?..and is there a market for IPV6-specific security products?
Yes. There are several reasons why. New attack vectors - IPv6 introduces ICMP-based "helper" protocols such as Neighbor Discovery and Router Advertisements. These are potentially vulnerable to spoofing, denial of service, and redirects. Another new attack vector is inherent in adding a new Layer 3 protocol: attackers have a new method for reaching your network. Let's take an example. Most network components use access control lists to limit access to a device or network. In more than one IPv6 network I've encountered, access control lists that limit ssh to routers exist for IPv4 but are missing for IPv6. Oops! Lack of Operational Experience with IPv6 networks - IPv4 has been the foundation of the commercial Internet. Over the last several decades, we've accumulated a wealth of security best practices for IPv4 networking using routers, firewalls, load balancers, and other network components. Both network operators and vendors do not have years of knowledge in operating IPv6 networks. (Yes, IPv6 has been around for a long time; however, the breadth of deployment is minute compared with IPv4). Lack of IPv4/IPv6 Feature Parity in Network Gear - Every IPv4 feature would have an equivalent in IPv6 in an ideal world (plus IPv6 specific features to address IPv6 specific security issues). This isn't the case. CPE network equipment is notoriously poor in implementing IPv6 in general and IPv6 security features in specific. Even some high end equipment have significant security gaps when it comes IPv6 security. To address your question on a market for IPv6-specific security products, I'd respond that vendors that can offer integrated IPv4/IPv6 security solutions will see a competitive advantage. I don't see a fit for IPv6-only security products since IPv4 and IPv6 will co-exist for a very long time.    Embed Quote
