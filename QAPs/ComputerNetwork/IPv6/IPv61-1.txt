★What is the benefit of IPv6?It seems like NAT is good enough.
ISPs like Comcast and AT&T are already hiding their users behind a NAT as they run out of their quota of allocated IPv4s. However, for large Internet companies like Google, Yahoo and Facebook, NATs are a serious threat to business. As the user's exact IP address is not available, it is hard to get the precise geolocation. Advertising algorithms, content customization of portals, directing users to their local version of the portal, location based search results/suggestions, etc are all heavily dependent on the user's exact location. IP addresses are also widely used in abuse prevention systems. For example, to prevent DoS attacks security systems try to block IP addresses that send more than a certain number of requests per second. In case of NAT, blocking one IP might result in blocking off thousands of users. Spam/Fraud prevention algorithms that analyze large log files of click data also depend upon IP addresses. Sophisticated login systems use location as well. If you're logging in from California everyday and suddenly someone tries logging in from New York using your username, the system might show you a Captcha or ask a security question to avoid an illegal login.    Embed Quote
