★What are the differences between IPv4 and IPv6?
IPv6 is a new packet format that is not interoperable with the IPv4 packet format. At a high level, IPv6 differs from IPv4 in the following respects: * Simplified base packet header * Options implemented as header extensions * Larger address space * Support for jumbograms up to 4GB * Support for end-to-end fragmentation, no support for en-route fragmentation * Built-in support for multicast, no support for broadcast * Built-in support for stateless address autoconfiguration * Built-in support for authentication and encryption    Embed Quote
