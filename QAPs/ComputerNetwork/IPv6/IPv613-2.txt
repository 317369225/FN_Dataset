★How long is it going to take until mass adoption of IPv6 (>50% of users with IPv6 only)?
One of the issues has been that NATing IPv4 addresses has helped tremendously in cutting the need for new address spaces. Another factor I see is Public Cloud adoption, as more and more organizations move to the public clouds, they don't need address spaces of their own and public cloud providers are very good at consolidating address spaces. If PaaS takes off, there will be even less need for end users to worry about IP address management. So overall I think the urgency for IPv6 adoption has greatly diminished because there are so many factors that keep us from just running out of IPv4 addresses altogether. Its hard to say when we finally will. We seem to invent many direct and indirect ways to mitigate the issue.    Embed Quote
