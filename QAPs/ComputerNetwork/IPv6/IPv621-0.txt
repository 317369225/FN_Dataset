★What's going on with IPv6?Is anyone using it? Does any software support it? Are people waiting for something? Why am I still seeing IPv4 addresses everywhere?
It's a catch-22. Big western countries have jumped on the Internet two decades ago and ensured they would be well supplied with IPv4 addresses. Naturally, most successful services on the Internet, such as big websites like Google, Amazon, Netflix and Facebook are well supplied with IPv4 address space. ISPs therefore don't see an immediate need to push IPv6, since there are so few other services requested by customers that are exclusively reachable by IPv6 (this isn't true for some Asian countries). While most operating systems have supported IPv6 for almost a decade now, home networking equipment hasn't. Since tasks like upgrading and dealing with your customers that barely manage to set up their cable modem/router are so time consuming and complex, introducing IPv6 is a support nightmare for ISPs. Besides that, lots of home equipment, such as WiFi access points do not support IPv6 yet or would require a firmware upgrade, leading to prohibitive costs for a full on rollout. ISPs instead start pushing a dual-stack, where they silently introduce IPv6 side-by-side with IPv4. Those customers that have the right equipment will be using IPv6, if available, others won't. At some point adoption will tip, granted enough customers have upgraded to more recent hardware. I expect that to be at least a 5-10y process. In the meantime, you will have large parts of the Internet go IPv6 only, particularly in countries that have adopted the "net" much later and weren't able to secure large parts of IPv4 address space for themselves. This will lead to "black-holes", or in other words, networks and services that aren't globally reachable due to routing issues on the web for a while.    Embed Quote
