★Does the transition to IPV6 introduce significant security vulnerabilities?..and is there a market for IPV6-specific security products?
Absolutely.  It's going to be absolute mayhem, I suspect.  Especially with tools like the thc-ipv6 suite (http://thc.org/thc-ipv6/) and Scapy (http://www.secdev.org/projects/s...) so readily available.  Being on the internet without a firewall is going to be absolutely perilous for a while.  Some of the fun you can have with fake router advertisements alone will make us reminisce about the good old days of the Windows ping of death. The upside is that with such tools available, a lot of these problems will be uncovered quickly.  The downside to the average user is going to be when the new wireless access point they just bought because their ISP is requiring all their CPE should support ipv6 already has a critical vulnerability that requires a firmware update.  Probably not a daunting task for most Quorans, but not something you'd expect from Aunt Tilly. I've already personally encountered programming bugs in core c libraries in *nix distributions stemming from inappropriate handling of AF_INET, AF_INET6, and AF_UNSPEC.  Minor bugs, fixed ages ago, but if *I* (with my non-programmer background, read-only c skills) can stumble onto this kind of thing, what else is out there waiting to be discovered?    Embed Quote
