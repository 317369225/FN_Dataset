★Will the proliferation of IPv6 reduce the need of a router?Since the whole internet would be able to reach more devices directly.
Routers are needed every time you connect two networks with each other. Let's say network A is 172.16.0.0/24, and network B is 192.168.178.0/24. If a device in network A wants to reach one in network B it needs to know the IP of a device that has a connection to both networks and can forward the packages between the two. That device is the router - the only difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is that in IPv6 the router won't pretend to network A that all traffic it sends IS in fact from network A, but will simply forward all packages into and out of network B without altering them. This is an important point - in IPv4 using NAT routers, every single connection passing through the NAT router has to be entered into the NAT table so that the router knows which connection has to be translated how - which is a major drain on router performance.    Embed Quote
