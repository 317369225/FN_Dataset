★Why is IPv6 not implemented in India?
IPv6 is used in other countries beacuse the combinations of ip adresses are over in those countries(Like we have phone numbers. So initially we have started 10 digit number with digit 9, when all combinations got over, we startrd with digit 8, then 7 and so on). But there are ip adresses available in India as the use of computers and laptops is less in India as compared to countries like U.S.A. So when we will fell that all IPv4 adresses are over so we will switch to IPv6.   IPv4 format is like 101.168.99.26, so we have many permutations and combinations for providing ip addresses to peoples. As those digits can be from 0 to 255 in all four places. It is 32 bits adress. On the other hand, IPv6 format is 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1. When we will require such format as address will over, we will use them    Embed Quote
