★Will the transition to IPv6 be invisible/transparent for most people?From the "consumer" perspective, let's say.
It will not be visible to most people but sophisticated users (such as hardcore gamers) are likely to suffer quality of service in some areas. But as long as networks make the switch to IPv6 from IPv4, which I am noticing is escalating daily, than consumers will not suffer QoS; most personal computers are IPv6 ready and major operating systems in commercial, business, and home consumer environments have implemented IPv6. The risk however is two fold: Projected IANA addresses pool would be exhausted first quarter of 2011, with various Internet registries using up their allocation by year end. IPv6 is for most part is not compatible with IPv4 at packet level and translation services have practical issues.  IPv6 and IPv4 are therefore treated as almost entirely separate networks. My personal opinion is that "necessity is the mother of all inventions".  Three years ago,  IPv6 was in its infancy in terms worldwide deployment. Since then there's been major progress and there's immediate need to address problem, especially with risk of QoS, there will be sense of urgency to deploy faster. I'm optimistic!    Embed Quote
