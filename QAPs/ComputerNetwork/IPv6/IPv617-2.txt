★IPv6 from IPv4 - is that possible?My ISP and my Router does only support IPv4 at the moment. Is it possible to Access IPv6 pages from my home-network in any way? Proxy or whatever? I want to add an IPv6 to my webserver and I want to check if its working. Ideas?
Your best bet is to configure the 6to4 protocol on your router.  This is the easiest and simplest way to get up and running, and enables a big block of ipv6 addresses for anyone with a public ipv4 address.  It uses public proxies anycasted on the ipv4 network to enable setup with no configuration. The Apple Airport routers/APs support 6to4 out of the box.  Many Linksys ones can support it with alternate firmware, (such as OpenWRT), though this requires much more setup on your part. Failing that, set up a manual tunnel to a free ipv6 tunnel broker, though this requires substantially more configuration (read: time) on your end.    Embed Quote
