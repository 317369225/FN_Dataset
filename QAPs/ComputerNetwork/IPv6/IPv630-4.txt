★How much on an effect will IPv6 have on the average user?I tried to access http://ipv6.google.com/ and i'm unable to. Does it have to do with my internet provider or my PC.
I argue IPv6 will have a profound effect on the average user. For your desktop/laptop, port forwarding will become a thing of the past. Applications will no longer need to use buggy UPnP or waste bandwidth and resources to maintain a persistent connection. The average user will have a much better experience setting up VNC/remote desktop and will be able to stream their files to their tablet or smartphone without a middle man. It would provide direct competition to Dropbox, LogMeIn, and other services that help us cope with the evils of NAT/PAT. Each computer will have at the very least a public and a private IPv6 address, enabling the seamless filesharing across a home network that all operating systems seem to lack. With the rise of smart appliances, every electrical device in your home can and hopefully will have an IP address. Every electrical socket, fridge, lightbulb, washer & dryer can learn when electrical demand is highest and accordingly turn off or delay activities to save money. This will become increasingly important as more plug-in hybrids and full electric vehicles begin are introduced to the market. IPv6 is essentially a bugfix for everything that went wrong with IPv4. The internet will slightly better for it. If you want to get started with IPv6 now, I reconmend using freenet6, since it's the easiest to install: http://gogonet.gogo6.com/page/fr...    Embed Quote
