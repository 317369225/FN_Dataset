★How widespread is IPv6 in Asia?I believe that Asia is running out of IPv4 addresses faster than other areas. Is IPv6 prominent there already?
IPv6 deployment in the Asia-PAC region surpasses all other regions. The combination of many current users (most with multiple IP-enabled devices per person) and large populations getting online for the first time (think China and India) drive the adoption of IPv6. Network operators understand that the days of plentiful IPv4 addresses have ended. APNIC, the local Internet registry (LIR) for IP address assignments, has one /8 of IPv4 address space remaining. APNIC is the first LIR expected to be depleted of IPv4 address space.    Embed Quote
