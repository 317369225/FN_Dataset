★Does IPv6 reduce routing latency?Why or why not?
IPv6 does not reduce latency. The top contributors to delay in packet networks are propagation delay (i.e., the speed of light in fiber), queuing delay, and serialization delay (the time to write packets to the wire). These factors are agnostic to IP protocol version. In the near term, the transition to IPv6 may increase delay. The IPv4 Internet has rich inter-connectivity between ISPs in paid transit arrangements and settlement-free peering. Since all ISPs have not implemented IPv6, the network paths for IPv6 will be longer in some cases. This additional latency will be reduced over time as IPv6 is more widely deployed.    Embed Quote
