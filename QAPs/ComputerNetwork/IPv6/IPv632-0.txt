★How widespread is IPv6 in Asia?I believe that Asia is running out of IPv4 addresses faster than other areas. Is IPv6 prominent there already?
Asia is a big place! Cisco aggregates worldwide IPv6 statistics at Cisco IPv6 Lab: IPv6 Deployment (cisco.com), where you can see adoption country by country as well as grouped by region. In Asia, Japan and Bhutan (!) lead the way in percentage of IPv6 traffic, but the level of IPv6 adoption is lower than you would expect for a region which is simultaneously experiencing explosive user growth and a total exhaustion of IPv4 address space.    Embed Quote
