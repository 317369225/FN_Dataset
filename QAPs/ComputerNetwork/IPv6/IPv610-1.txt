★Does the Xbox 360 support IPv6?I've been looking into getting into a Comcast IPv6 trial, but if my 360 doesn't support IPv6, it can take some tinkering for it to work. Microsoft hasn't responded emails or tweets about this question.
I highly recommend the Comcast trial (probably 6RD, right?).  Last I heard, checked the XBOX360 does not support IPv6, but you can still participate in the trials - they don't take away your IPv4 :). Also, Jeff - I'd watch the terminology ... 6to4 is a specific example of an automatic tunneling mechanism, allowing an IPv6 node to (possibly ;) ) reach another IPv6 node over an IPv4-only infrastructure.  With the XBOX360 not doing IPv6, I think what you meant was a translator (e.g. - NAT64) ... ?    Embed Quote
