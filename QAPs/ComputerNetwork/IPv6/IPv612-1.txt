★Why should I switch over to IPv6?My ISP supports IPv6 (*), letting customers run a dual stack (IPv4 with IPv6). Why should I enable IPv6? It doesn't help alleviate my usage of an IPv4 address, for example. (*) Comcast Reaches Key Milestone in Launch of IPv6 Broadband Network
As Tony Li noted there is no killer app.  Having said that I do encourage people to dual stack.  As more people are reachable over IPv6 the web sites and services around the world also add v6 capabilities and eventually nearly all of what we see today will be reachable over IPv6. There exists the potential for a killer app over v6, probably something that requires large numbers of customers with public facing addresses rather than NAT'ed ones, but until there is enough critical mass its hard for us to even see it.    Embed Quote
