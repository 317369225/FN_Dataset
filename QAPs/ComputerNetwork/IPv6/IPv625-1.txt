★Will IPv6 be cheaper for me?My apartment is made of concrete walls and my wifi router is unable to get through the thick walls. I have telephone points in all rooms so i drag my modem around..but bsnl doesn't like it and allows me one dynamic ipv4 address on one telephone point in one room and has asked that i get seperate broadband connections for each room if i want or wifi range extenders.
U can use a repeater.    Embed Quote
