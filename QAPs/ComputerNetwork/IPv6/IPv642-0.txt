★Is it possible to switch my home network to exclusively IPv6 without a loss of functionality?How would this work?  Any tutorials out there?
Not yet.  There are a number of technologies kicking around like NAT64 and 464XLAT shims to try to make this possible, but nothing is fully mainstream yet for home networks. T-Mobile USA has switched to an all IPv6 network, but they needed to include a special software shim for 464XLAT in all handsets as well as accompanying NAT64 infrastructure support. We're slowly getting there, but a number of popular ill behaved IPv4 applications (I'm looking at you, Skype) prevent the wholesale switch in the absence of additional software on every endpoint.    Embed Quote
