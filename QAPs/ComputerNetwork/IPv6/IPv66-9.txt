★When will IPv6 replace IPv4 completely on the planet?
IPv6 will never replace IPv4. While, IPv4 has outlived its usefulness, it will never get entirely replaced by IPv6 and its main reason is that vast majority of the devices connected to the Internet today are not compatible with IPv6, and the dual-stack technology ensures that legacy IPv4 devices will still work for the foreseeable future. A dual stack network is a network in which all of the nodes are both IPv4 and IPv6 enabled. IPv4 and IPv6 are not directly compatible and network scientists couldn't simply flip a switch and turn off IPv4 while most of the world still depended on it. While dual stack network technology is expensive, it seems the only possible solution to continue well into the future.    Embed Quote
