★Why haven't more ISPs used IPv6?It seems inevitable that all ISPs will migrate to using the IPv6 standard.  What are the reasons why (in detail) this has not occurred in a more robust manner?
Until very recently, when an ISP wanted to get more IPv4 addresses, they just asked their Regional Internet Registry (RIR) for a new allocation, and reasonable requests were always fulfilled, and when the Registry needed more addresses to fulfill new requests, they went to the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA) and asked for a new allocation, and those requests were always fulfilled. Until IANA ran out of numbers. Now, when an ISP goes to their Registry to get a new allocation, the answer in some places is, "We'd love to give you the addresses you want, but we're running on reserves. Tell us about your IPv6 plan. We have plenty of those addresses for you."  Right now, ISPs are mostly responding by trying to figure out how to aggregate large numbers of subscribers behind multiple levels of Network Address Translation (NAT). Basically, the IANA free address pool has always been an externality for the ISP industry.  They profited until they exhausted it, as naturally happens in such economies, and only now are they coming to grips with what must be done now that their shared commons has been trashed.    Embed Quote
