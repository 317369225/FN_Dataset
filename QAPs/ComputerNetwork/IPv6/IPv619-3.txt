★What is it going to take for IPv6 to be adopted?When do you estimate that IPv4 will be replaced?
Ubiquitous sensing and the work being done in the IETF towards 6lowpan/ROLL is going to be incredibly influential in the next couple of years, as every sensor and actuator becomes an IPv6 device.  There could easily be several orders of magnitude more sensors embedded throughout the world then there will be other devices, and they'll all need an IP address. LTE, one of the 4G cell standards, also relies on IPv6 -- I remember seeing at some point in Verizon's requirements for 4G handsets that v6 was mandatory and v4 was optional.    Embed Quote
