★What will potentially replace IPv6?Of course IPv6 is still enroute Technologies, Standards and use case once we exceed it capabilities.  Keep in mind designers of IPv4 never believed it would ever be exhausted.
IPv4 uses 4 octets of binary numbers; it has a total pool of just over 4 billion addresses available to it (232 ). When it was developed, it seemed unlikely that pool of addresses would be exhausted. Of course, we know better now. IPv6 uses 8 groups of hexadecimal numbers giving a total pool of 2128 numbers. to put that into context, that would be enough to allow a couple of million addresses for each person currently living on planet Earth. If that pool were to be exhausted, the chances are that a new method of networking might be needed; that could be completely different to the existing protocols, so might require totally different ways to make connections (which is partly what addressing is for). But the chances of that happening are on the slim side. (Never say never!)    Embed Quote
