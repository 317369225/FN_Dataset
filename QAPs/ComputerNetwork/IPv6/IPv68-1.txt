★What are the cleverest IPv6 addresses?Either in use or not. i.e. Facebook has 2620:0:1cfe:face:b00c::3 I believe.
A colleague of mine wrote a blog on this at Fun with IPv6 which points to a discussion at IPv6 Day Has Started My favorites Sprint uses 2600:: , A tip of a hat to the 2600hz phone hacking tone. (now 2600::aaaa, since apparently some implementations couldn't cope with the perfectly valid address of all zeroes).  Facebook uses face:b00c (“facebooc”) (as in 2620:0:1cfe:face:b00c::3) BBC was sure in include BBC: 2001:4b10:bbc::2 And Cisco's "Cisco Dog Food" was a reference to the concept of "eating one's own dog food," which means to use your own products, now matter how hard it is at first.   2001:420:80:1:c:15c0:d06:f00d There is a lot more room for cleverness.  I'd expect Starbuck to have cafe, and icanchancheezburger to have 101:ca75 (LOLCATS) and at least some security company to have 1337 ("Leet."). There is lots of hexspeak out there, but few companies have felt the need to be whimsical with their IPv6 addresses. Note: Lancaster University Network Services went for b00b:1e5, as I'm sure others did.  More puerile than clever, really.    Embed Quote
