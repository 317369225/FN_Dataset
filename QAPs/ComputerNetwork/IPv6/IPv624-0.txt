★Has Cisco implemented IPv6?Internally, I mean. I know IOS supports IPv6, but I am wondering if they use it on their corporate intranet.
The cisco.com website participated in World IPv6 Day on June 8, 2011 and went permanently live on World IPv6 Launch Day on June 6, 2012. The official story of the Cisco IPv6 rollout is at http://www.cisco.com/web/about/c..., which is part of the "Inside Cisco IT" series at http://www.cisco.com/web/about/c.... http://www.cisco.com/go/ipv6 is the official portal for all IPv6 related information at Cisco. As of 2014, the overwhelming majority of internal enterprise and lab networks are dual stacked.  Individual applications are IPv6 enabled as the vendors provide appropriate support.    Embed Quote
