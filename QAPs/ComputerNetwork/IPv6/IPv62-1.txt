★Does Android support IPv6?
rAndroid can get IPv6 address through DHCP,but it is disabled by default on most phones.If your phone has already been rooted,you can check this file:/init.qcom.sh.You are likely to find this: # # Suppress default route installation during RA for IPV6; user space will take # care of this # for file in /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/* do     echo 0 > $file/accept_ra_defrtr done So you can see IPv6 is disabled.To enable IPv6,You can either modify boot.img,or simply run this script: #!/system/bin/sh for file in /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/* do     echo 1 > $file/accept_ra_defrtr done Please be aware that your file system should be remounted as RW before you run this script.    Embed Quote
