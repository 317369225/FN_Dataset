★Is there a correct way to put an IPv6 address in a URL?Is it possible to put a numeric/hex IPv6 address in an HTTP URL?  Please provide examples that work in major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
Since the colon (":") is already reserved in URLs to separate the IPv4 address or host names from the optional non-default TCP port number of a connection, literal IPv6 addresses (which always contain colons) cannot be used without some modification. In order to distinguish between the two contextual uses of the colon, a literal IPv6 address needs to be enclosed in square brackets ("[ ]") when used in a URL. Consider www.sprint.com which has an IPv4 address of 65.173.211.241 and an IPv6 address of 2600::aaaa.  To connect by address, the URL would look like: http://65.173.211.241 http://[2600::aaaa] To connect to a specific port (say, 8080), the URLs would look like: http://65.173.211.241:8080 http://[2600::aaaa]:8080 RFC 2732 covers all of the gory details.    Embed Quote
