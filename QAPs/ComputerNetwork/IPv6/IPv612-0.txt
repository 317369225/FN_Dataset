★Why should I switch over to IPv6?My ISP supports IPv6 (*), letting customers run a dual stack (IPv4 with IPv6). Why should I enable IPv6? It doesn't help alleviate my usage of an IPv4 address, for example. (*) Comcast Reaches Key Milestone in Launch of IPv6 Broadband Network
This is one of the biggest problems with IPv6.  There is no 'killer app'. There is no good reason to switch over, or even run dual stack.  There are a number of risks in enabling v6 (e.g., firewall bypass). For most people, there's just no point, other than academic learning.    Embed Quote
