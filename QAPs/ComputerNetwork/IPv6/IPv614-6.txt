★Why couldn't MAC addresses be used instead of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses for networking?
MAC addresses are a layer 2 technology whereas IP addresses are layer 3 technology.All these routing protocols works in layer 3 ,here only routers operate and send data through the network and making the internet possible. Routers work in layer 3 which is the network layer. IP addresses are specially classified as loopback ,private and other various stuff it is not the case with MAC address, MAC address is used for sending and receiving frames from a node to another within a local network with the help of a switch  whereas IP addresses are used for routing packets within a subnet.    Embed Quote
