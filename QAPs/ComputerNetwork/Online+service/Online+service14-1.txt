★Are there any online services that can help test a candidate's programming ability?This would be as part of a complement / filter to a selection process.
Brainbench [http://www.brainbench.com/] provides an online coding aptitude test. Their tests are basically a timed multiple-choice quiz. I was subjected to one a couple of years ago. I wasn't overly impressed, not because I didn't do well (in fact my scores weren't disclosed to me), but there were several questions which were factually incorrect (and so basically unanswerable), and the scope of questions seemed very scattered. Ultimately I just don't think quiz-style tests would be as effective as actually getting people to write code, so I'd advise you to look for that feature when deciding on a service.    Embed Quote
