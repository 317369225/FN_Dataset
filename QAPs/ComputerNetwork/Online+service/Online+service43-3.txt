★What are the best online services to help a small business grow their sales?
What are we doing about small businesses around the world? Why is it that all our technology, economics know-how and investment capacity, we cannot make even a minor contribution to main street businesses. Why can't we create inclusive capitalism? Needless to say these are not new questions. However, one who is familiar to the developed and developing world, the contrasts keep gnawing at me. It became clear that finding a solution to the problems of those at the bottom of the economic pyramid should be my next entrepreneurial journey. It was also clear that we have to learn from the successes and failures of the past, the promises made and not fulfilled. Doing more of the same, by refining the solutions of the past - financial aid and governmental support, subsidies, regionalized NGO based solutions is important and has a role to play, but has not redressed the problem of sustainable competitive advantage for main street small businesses. Although federal, state, local governments and NGOs worked tirelessly to promote small businesses and local entrepreneurship, the idea of large scale entrepreneurship as a possible solution to small business sustainability has not taken root.   Tradeseam is a social media startup that is focused on helping small business owners gorw their business efficiently.    Embed Quote
