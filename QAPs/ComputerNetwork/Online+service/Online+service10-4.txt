★What are the best online services/tools to efficiently learn Japanese?Not necessarily full courses (those would be nice though), but also flashcards, calligraphy lessons, online tutoring and everything helpful that japanese language learner should use.
I'm surprised iKnow: http://iknow.jp/ is not on this list. They have a great online community of language learners, specifically tailored to learning Japanese. The amount of content they have is huge, and it's all organized in a pretty methodical fashion for you to actually progress and learn rather than just browse. In my opinion it's one of the best out there, in combination with jisho.org    Embed Quote
