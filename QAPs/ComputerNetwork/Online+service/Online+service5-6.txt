★What are some online services that provide group collaboration on the web?I have a group of 30 or so disparate partners that we want to be able to communicate together online.  Think Yammer with message boards.
One of the leading solutions is Kanban Tool (http://www.kanbantool.com). While it doesn't have an active chat feature, you will be able to easily communicate with team members through Comments section. Each assigned team member will be notified once you post a new comment. Boards are really flexible and allow you to customize your work flow to your needs. It has a 30 day trial that allows you to use the tool with as many users as you want to.    Embed Quote
