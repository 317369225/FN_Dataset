★What are the best online services/tools to efficiently learn Japanese?Not necessarily full courses (those would be nice though), but also flashcards, calligraphy lessons, online tutoring and everything helpful that japanese language learner should use.
Not limited to just Japanese - But I recommend you to give Memrise a try, it employs a novel learning strategy compared to vocabulary flashcards. Personally, I spend 5~10 minutes on a daily basis and so far I have acquired (retained and understood) more than 200+ words/phrases in less than 2 months. Oh, and, they have an app, which also makes it quite convenient to use on the go.    Embed Quote
