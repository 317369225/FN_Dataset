★What is the best free online service for family trees?Should be a company that can be trusted with detailed personal information, have an excellent user interface, should allow for different non-standard family scenarios to be represented in a sensitive manner, and must support the GEDCOM file format for input-export.
I've tried Geni, GenesReunited, MyHeritage, and Ancestry and I will say without a doubt Ancestry is the strongest tool available. Geni is filled with very inaccurate data since most of it's content is user created. I've found very little factual backing behind most of these claims. So, that being said, I definitely recommend starting on Ancestry and filling out as much information as you can about what you know. You can start a tree for free there, it's just the ability to retrieve public documents that costs money. However, once you have filled in as much information as you have, activating the subscription for a month where you can really devote a lot of time to it is really worth it. If you spend enough time working in that month, you will be surprised with how much $30 will get you, if you are conscientious of the information you are accepting as being correct. I've also found that knowing how to google properly is quite helpful and there are many sources like findagrave.com that have been intrinsically important to the building of my 5K member family tree. Lastly, I would be sure to ask around at your local library (or wherever your family is from) and also check to see if there is a genealogy club. People who have lots of experience in such specific areas will be quite a big help to you, and as a genealogy enthusiast/hobbyist, there is nothing more rewarding than helping people discover their ancestors.    Embed Quote
