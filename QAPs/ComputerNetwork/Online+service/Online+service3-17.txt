★What is the best online service to track SEO rankings for a website?I want to regularly track my startup's SEO results across multiple keywords and search engines. I would prefer to use an online service instead of a program. Regularly emailed reports and suggested keywords or tactics would be helpful.   
Just started trial with RankTackr (shows Alexa ranking and Indexed pages!) but think this will be canceled (now canceled). (UPDATE: After using TrackMyRanking along with SerpScan for a few days the reports from Accurate daily search engine ranking positions are better). It seems SerpScan is more preferable at least for my taste and I did pay to get the 15% discount. SerpScan also scans your keywords to see any available EMDs on the exact keywords that are being checked for ranking (a pleasent surprise). I also like the rule creations to be alerted when ranking improves or decreases. http://www.SerpScan.com is priced well in comparison and offers more as far as white label reports without the high investment. I'm testing it out with the 20 URLs and 100 keyword plan. Obviously the keywords added will be those that are in-process of promoting to the top. You should also check out the All-In-One Business Dashboard | Cyfe which looks pretty in-depth (I'm looking for a simple web-based rank tracking tool), although I'll dig into this one later as it looks impressive for many other metrics and apps/widgets. I had to come back and edit this just to say Cyfe is loaded with all those right elements bringing it all onto one dashboard making this simply an amazing time-saving focused creating, value producing tool; and I only added one widget so far ;) You get a Free Trial Month and then it is either $19 or $14 a month depending if you pay for the year or pay monthly.    Embed Quote
