★What are other international alternatives to Airbnb online service?Especially outside USA. How are they compared to Airbnb's success? Are they known, how do they differ from each other, what are their fees and how do they solve security questions?
There are a sleuth of new Airbnb-like competitors on the market today trying to recreate Airbnb's success. Regionality As previous answers have pointed out there are regional alternatives which can be competitive. This means that most of the non-English speaking world is a land grab for the vacation rentals market. In Israel for instance the largest site is http://GlobalHomeHotel.com . Although why regionality would be a large factor is still quite mysterious as one would suspect that as internet businesses their headquarter locaion wouldn't matter much. I would theorize that this has to do with the cultural assumptions that are poured into the design language. Business Models As far as business models are concerned, the new de facto standard as been free to list with commission at time of sale. This model is relatively new as the previous incumbent bohemoth HomeAway charges a flat rate listing fee. One complication is that sites that operate in the U.S. (like Airbnb and Homeaway) are required by law to have their users file with the United States IRS, regardless of whether the user lives in the United States. Other sites, like Global homehotel, do note suffer from this regulatory problem. Security Security is a dangerously unanswered question. Houses on Airbnb have been ransacked and robbed. In New York and Chicago short term private vacation rentals are acutallly illegal for Fire Hazard reasons (exit routes aren't posted). (Disclosure, I work for GlobalHomeHotel.com)    Embed Quote
