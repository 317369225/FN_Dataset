★Will real estate brokerage ever be a 100% online service, as in no need for real estate agents?
First let me start off by saying that I am a Realtor and a Web Developer. I have been thinking about this topic for a very long time. The thing to remember is that Real Estate is one of the largest investments that people make in their entire lives. Agents play the role of helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions. While it may sound relatively simple, Save for a Down Payment, go online, find a nice home and make an offer. There is that issue of being overwhelmed by the thousands of homes for sale and trying to find that needle in the haystack. Agents who have been in the business for a while and know the communities well, can actually be a very valuable resource. When you look at the online market today and the trends, you will see that websites dedicated to for sale by owners, don't do as well as the others like Zillow, Trulia or websites that are owned by Agents that are powered by IDX, which in my opinion are the best sites to use.    Embed Quote
