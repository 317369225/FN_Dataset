★What is the best online service to track SEO rankings for a website?I want to regularly track my startup's SEO results across multiple keywords and search engines. I would prefer to use an online service instead of a program. Regularly emailed reports and suggested keywords or tactics would be helpful.   
If you're running a SEO agency, my vote goes to http://Reporb.com. It helps us to track all our clients keywords rankings + it also helps us to build, compile and send our reports to all our clients without us doing any work on our part. We have looked far for a tool that would generate an easy-to-understand report that our clients will appreciate and Reporb has been the best at it so far. + It also helps us to track rankings for our more local clients.    Embed Quote
