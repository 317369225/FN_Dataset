★What are some online services that provide group collaboration on the web?I have a group of 30 or so disparate partners that we want to be able to communicate together online.  Think Yammer with message boards.
I've tried a lot of services and according to me the best (for its semplicity) is TRELLO. In Trello you have boards and cards. The boards are the spaces in which you can organize the cards; in every board you can create lists. The cards stand for what you want; a card could represent a project (with its subtasks, due dates attachments, etc) or a topic of a forum. Every card has an internal chat and can be public, private or restricted to the users that you have defined. In Trello you can share everything (boards, cards, lists). An other great service is Podio. It is more complete than Trello, but also more complex. It's perfect if you need a lot of tools to organize your team. In Podio you can create simple and personalized apps. Then there are Asana and Producteev. I don't know exactly the service you need, but you could also use Google Apps (if you have a domain, you can associate it to that Apps). For example: - Google talk to Chat; - G Calendar to organize your meetings or dates; - Google Drive to share documents and to collaborate in the creation of G Docs: you can collaborate in real time to the same document (your collaborators can see your changes in real time). Similar to Google Apps there is Skydrive and Sign In by Microsoft. There are available the web apps of Office Suite. There is Messenger to chat (now perfectly integrated with Skype) and Hotmail Calendar to Organize your meetings. If you need only to chat and be notified when your collaborators add, delete, modify, post something, you can try Hojoki. I use it, and according to me is very useful.    Embed Quote
