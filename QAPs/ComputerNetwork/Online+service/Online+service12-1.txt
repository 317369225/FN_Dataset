★What are the best online services for backpackers?I believe that CouchSurfing and  WeHostel are great tools, but I am wondering who are the other one.
Hostelling International are good (http://www.hihostels.com). Previously used them in Canada. They are cheap, the stay included free attraction tickets and also make arrangements for you to stay in other company owned Hostels (if they have one in an area you want to visit). Just takes the hassle out of booking yourself.    Embed Quote
