★Will real estate brokerage ever be a 100% online service, as in no need for real estate agents?
This San Diego-based startup made the case and presented a vision earlier this fall in San Francisco - Allre Lets You Buy And Sell Your House Online Without A Real Estate Agent | TechCrunch: The Internet has disintermediated almost every business that used to  rely on brokers — except for the real estate industry. There, we still  pay huge fees to agents who often do very little for their money and  aren’t necessarily on our side. Allre,  which is launching at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2014 today, wants to bring  the real estate business into the 21st century by giving buyers and  sellers a single platform for buying and selling their homes. We already  buy everything else online, after all, so why not a house?    Embed Quote
