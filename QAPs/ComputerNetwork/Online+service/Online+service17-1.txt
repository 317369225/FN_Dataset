★What is the best online service to create Flowcharts?The plus feature would be an ability to share and work on the same chart with others at the same time. Like in Google docs.
I really like http://creately.com because it has some cool tools to support drawing of flowcharts. I really like its one click automatic creation of connecting objects. So you can simply create a whole flow without dragging and dropping objects again and again. This alone saves me a lot of time. It also supports collaboration so you can co-edit your diagram. Clickable diagrams, one clicks styling are few other additional features.    Embed Quote
