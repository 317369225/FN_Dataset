★How do online services marketplace startups deal with fraud?I'm building a  marketplace for a particular type of service. Before my startup, these service providers were used to receiving 100% of the payment upfront. Because of the increased risk in marketplace startups, I'm thinking of creating an escrow feature to help with fraud. Are there any other methods I could use?
I didn't understand the escrow feature you're referring to. In my experience as the founder of a rather large online services marketplace; fraud is definitely a problem and there is no generic answer that can be provided without going into the details of your company. However there are certain types of fraud that are common to pretty much all online startups: People who buy & use services on your platform with their own CC and make a chargeback People who buy & use services on your platform with a stolen CC and the real owner makes a chargebackFor the first group, the best way to fight it is to put systems in place to prove they bought & used your services. The best of those systems probably being 3D secure payments. For the 2nd group it's more complex but 3D secure also solves it and you can also often identify patterns for their behaviours: large purchases, last-minutes purchases, purchases from unusual countries, hidden IPs, etc. Hope it helps a bit.    Embed Quote
