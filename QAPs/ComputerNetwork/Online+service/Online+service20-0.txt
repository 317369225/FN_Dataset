★What is the best online service to create Mind Maps?We use http://www.mindmeister.com but is there anything better or similar?
I think Mindomo looks better.  I had some update probs (hanging) with MindMeister.  They say they have fixed that, but I haven't used it much since. [Update, Sept 2012: Mindmeister has made some big improvements, and it's now my preferred online mind mapper.  MindMeister today uses HTML5 while Mindomo is still stuck on Flash (when using a Windows PC).  Flash is gradually fading and is not available on some platforms (notably Apple iOS) but there is an iOS version of Mindomo.] I like bubbl.us because it supports cross links and linking phrases, so it can make concept maps as well, but it does not allow attachments to nodes. Mind42 is free.  Wisemapping is free and open source so you can install it on your own server. There are some diagram-creating on-line apps that can (sort of) make mind maps, but I don't find them so mapping-aware as specific mind map apps. So they are not quite so quick to brainstorm with.  There's a neat list of these here: http://www.mind-mapping.org/Vics... and that site is where I check most things about mapping.    Embed Quote
