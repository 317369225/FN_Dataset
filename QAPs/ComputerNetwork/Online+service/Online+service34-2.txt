★Is there an online service with a REST-like API for sending faxes?I'm not looking for a personal solution but rather one that could be added to a web application. I don't want awful complicated APIs and a simple metered service (you pay only per fax, no other setup etc. charges) would be ideal. Does such a thing exist?
You  might want to take a look at Aculab Cloud (http://cloud.aculab.com).  They have Python and .NET APIs for  writing fax broadcast or fax reception applications.    Features include: T.30  fax termination up to V.17 speeds, call progress monitoring (incoming and  outgoing), automatic detection of fax calls, dynamic switching between fax and  voice within a call, Group 3 TIFF image file manipulation library, supports  multiple page formats and properties, application control of individual pages,  supports unlimited page length and header/footer formatting, supports fax on  demand – polled mode.   You  pay per minute whilst your fax application is running.  There is also free  sample code on the site to help you get started.    Embed Quote
