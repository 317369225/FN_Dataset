Site owners should have site audit reports generated often. At http://www.webceo.com, the Site Auditor tool comes in three sections: 1) Broken Link Reporting (Internal, External, Images, Anchors) 2) General Optimization Issues (X pages of your site have duplicate Title Tags, etc) & you don't have a Sitemap in the form of Sitemap.xml in your root directory 3) Landing Page Optimization (where you indicate what 3 (or more) keywords you want each page of your site to be optimized for and we tell you what you have to do to achieve that). You shouldn't try to optimize any one page for more than 3 or 4 keywords, but you should be sure to capitalize on the fact that most people don't place ALT image tags behind their images, thus losing a valuable SEO opportunity for themselves. The Free Version allows you to Site Audit for 2 projects, home page only, while using a basket of 90 keywords. Current and potential customers and coworkers (especially your webmaster) can see these reports not only via mailed PDF files, but also because you may have published them at ReportSharing dot com where they can provide themselves with their own passwords to login any time. With the White Label Pro Plan for $119/mo you can also create a sub-domain like Reports dot YourDomain dot com and have everyone logon there with their own chosen passwords to see read-only reports or to actively participate in using the tools.    Embed Quote
