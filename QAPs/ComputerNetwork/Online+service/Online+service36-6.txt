★Are there any free online services that allow the hosting of PHP scripts and MySQL creation?I need to test my app and cannot get any other server running. I seen this but not sure if it is legit: http://www.serversfree.com/
All the free hosting sites that I am aware of that have what you want do not offer SSL, So if you are just building a site for nonsecure work, many have suggested a generic search of the Internet. Since you asked directly, try here <Free web hosting with PHP, MySQL and cPanel, no Ads>. I do not know the site that you mentioned either. Good hunting.    Embed Quote
