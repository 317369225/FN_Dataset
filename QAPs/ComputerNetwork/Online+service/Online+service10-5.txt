★What are the best online services/tools to efficiently learn Japanese?Not necessarily full courses (those would be nice though), but also flashcards, calligraphy lessons, online tutoring and everything helpful that japanese language learner should use.
If you want to read Japanese on a website quickly(instead of looking up a lot of unknown words and kanjis) I suggest you try to download 'Rikaikun' for firefox or 'rikaichan' for google chrome. For an online dictionary with example sentences, try jisho.org. lang-8.com has native people correcting your 'diary'. Very nice place to meet people! ^_^ 'maggie sensei'(a website) explains lots of slang and expressions + more and she also answers questions posted if you want a 'break' look up bumnumba1 on youtube..His lessons are... interesting at least lol Hope this helps!=D    Embed Quote
