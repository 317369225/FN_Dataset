★Will real estate brokerage ever be a 100% online service, as in no need for real estate agents?
That is our goal at ListingDoor.  We Just finished our final beta testing. ListingDoor.com is simplified web application that gives homeowners everything they need to sell their home, save the commissions, and keep their equity instead of handing it over to a real estate agent.  As much as real estate firms would like to keep the monopoly/cartel process, controlling access to information just doesn’t work anymore and agents are no longer the primary source of information.   Currently a homeowner interested in selling FSBO (For Sale By Owner) has very few options to get their home in front of potential buyers and although this market is growing, no competitor offers what ListingDoor offers. We have created a really cool and simple web application for homeowners to list, market and sell their own homes - without handing over a dime to a real estate agent.    With ListingDoor, in under 1 hour a homeowner can calculate an accurate current market listing price, create a professional custom brochure and really cool yard sign which they can pick up next day at their local FedEx Office, create custom website for their home, publish their listing to national listing services, and launch a highly targeted online social media marketing campaign. We provide everything a real estate agent does and more. Best of all, everything is geared towards their home not a promotional campaign for the real estate firm.    Embed Quote
