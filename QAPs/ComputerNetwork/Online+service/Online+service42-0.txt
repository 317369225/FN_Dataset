★What online services allow me to publicly list a free event?Ideally so that people actually show up.
Eventbrite is always free for free events, and you can list them publically. The product also integrates with social media, so that attendees are encouraged to share the news that they are attending your event right after they purchase their ticket. We have found that this word-of-mouth boost your ticket sales, and gets more people to show up to your event. (There's more info here: http://blog.eventbrite.com/socia...) I’m the Community Manager for Eventbrite, so feel free to shoot me a message if you have any other questions.    Embed Quote
