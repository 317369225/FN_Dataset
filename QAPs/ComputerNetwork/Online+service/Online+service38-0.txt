★Why are there no online services that have significant exposure of negative feedback?Related to What are some drawbacks of adding a negative feedback feature to a social network service? Apart from seller / service provider ratings, like Amazon and Yelp, what are some existing online services that do aggregate negative feedback?
If you take for example Yelp: after several bad reviews place soon shuts down. Quora with a lot of downvotes will collapse answer. With consistent negative feedback if you will not improve you would disappear. Exceptions are government services and sports teams, negative feebdack on those is everywhere. They still exist. Relationships there are irrational.    Embed Quote
