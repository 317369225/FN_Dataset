Submit your website to Google Web Master Tools and Bing Web Master Tools. Both tools provide SEO related issues (Duplicate meta descriptions, Long meta descriptions, Short meta descriptions, Missing title tags, Duplicate title tags and etc.) on your website. SEOMoz tools is also very good to find more issues and to do further improvements. But it's not free, you have to pay USD 99 per month.    Embed Quote
