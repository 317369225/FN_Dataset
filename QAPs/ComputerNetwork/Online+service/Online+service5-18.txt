★What are some online services that provide group collaboration on the web?I have a group of 30 or so disparate partners that we want to be able to communicate together online.  Think Yammer with message boards.
Clinked could be a possibility for you (http://clinked.com). Like Yammer, Clinked is an Enterprise Social Networking software. Unlike Yammer, Clinked is also Document Management software as well as Project/Task management software. Within Clinked, you can also set up sub-groups for specific members, which sounds like it could also be useful to you. A key feature to Clinked is the discussion boards. You can hold meetings/discussions with select groups or select members. These are all stored online so you can refer back to them if need be. There are also the other social elements such as @mentioning where you can mention specific people and they will subsequently be notified that you've left them a message or comment. These comments can be left under any file or page etc. This really does help to increase the efficiency of your groups. You can create documents and collaborate together on those, or work privately. You get a minimum of 1 Terabyte storage, which is a huge amount that will last a long time. Clinked is a considerable way ahead of many of it's competitors and is constantly developing new features to improve it. Have a look at http://clinked.com to find out more information. If you need any more help, just drop me a message- I work for Clinked :)    Embed Quote
