★What are some online services that provide group collaboration on the web?I have a group of 30 or so disparate partners that we want to be able to communicate together online.  Think Yammer with message boards.
Our team (Hall) uses Asana to keep track of tasks and projects. For communication, we use Hall. We're able to chat and share everything via this one tool. We create rooms tailored to specific projects, or fun things like lunch, which makes it easy to split up projects and focus on the necessary. We're all about collaboration and teamwork at Hall!    Embed Quote
