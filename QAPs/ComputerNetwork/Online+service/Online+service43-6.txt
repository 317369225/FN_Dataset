★What are the best online services to help a small business grow their sales?
One of the best recommendations I have is identifying and implementing a great CRM combined with email marketing and social media marketing platform that can automate and systematize much of your sales and marketing processes. Small business owners are plagued by not having enough time, energy, manpower, and financial resources. These challenges can be combated by leveraging automation to generate, qualify, nurture, and convert leads into sales. A good CRM system w/ marketing capabilities allows you to grow a customer base (or list), communicate with them on a regular basis, and segment them into buckets that allow for better better marketing and sales targeting by your sales force (or VP of marketing). We've identified these issues are so troublesome for small business owners that we built an entire company, Lumnari, centered around building and implementing an integrated sales and marketing automation strategy into businesses to help them increase sales.
