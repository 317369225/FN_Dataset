★What is the best online service to create Flowcharts?The plus feature would be an ability to share and work on the same chart with others at the same time. Like in Google docs.
My personal favorite is a command-line tool Graphviz. You might find several online versions like GraphViz Workspace (it looks rather ugly, I'm sorry). The unmatched beauty of the approach is that you type your flowchart in text: Source -> Target Target -> End Something -> End And you get a visual representation of your chart. No mouse involved. No monkey-business of arranging your nodes: With some configuration, result might be pretty neat, saved to SVG for even more visual post-processing.
