★What are the best free online services/tools to efficiently learn Mandarin Chinese?
Call me biased, but I hope it is LearnYu. For the past year, I've been working on this unique kind of online Chinese course. It's an intelligent learning system that will automatically optimize your learning program. It realizes your weak points and dynamically generates exercises designed to help you improve on them. I really believe this is the next evolution in online language-learning. This site will be available for free to the public starting February 2015, or before if you join the waiting list. To get immediate access, or learn more about the site, check out LearnYu - Automagic Chinese Course Here's a comparison of LearnYu with existing Chinese courses:    Embed Quote
