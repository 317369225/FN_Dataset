★Are there any free online services that allow the hosting of PHP scripts and MySQL creation?I need to test my app and cannot get any other server running. I seen this but not sure if it is legit: http://www.serversfree.com/
If it's for testing/staging reasons, I agree with Faisal that AWS will provide pretty flexible environment. It will also let you transition to production with the same technology if needed. I haven't tried docker with LAMP, but it should work - Docker Hub Registry Pricing I wish there were a provider like Heroku that would let you host LAMP stack. Heroku itself doesn't have MySQL, so it would not work for you. There maybe other providers that have it. Also, you may want to look at Nitrous.IO for a dev environment. I think they support LAMP stack.    Embed Quote
