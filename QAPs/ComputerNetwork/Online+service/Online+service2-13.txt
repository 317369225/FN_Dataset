★What is the best free online service for family trees?Should be a company that can be trusted with detailed personal information, have an excellent user interface, should allow for different non-standard family scenarios to be represented in a sensitive manner, and must support the GEDCOM file format for input-export.
I have been using http://imlee.com , it works great as family networking site. The family tree UI is really awesome. Its free, private and secure and has some nice features. Its provides an online family diary to store all the family details, you can share photos, news, updates and also reminds you about birthdays and anniversaries within the family.    Embed Quote
