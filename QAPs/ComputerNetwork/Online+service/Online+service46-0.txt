★What are common applications of survival analysis in current online services?How is survival analysis is applied in companies such as Facebook/Amazon/Google?
I work for one of the larger tech companies based in San Francisco and we use survival analysis in both Sales and HR to predict 1) customer subscription length and 2) employee behavior like attrition. Survival analysis is an extremely powerful class of predictive analytics that can be used with any time-to-event predictions (i.e. how much time is expected to elapse given X variables before a certain event happens to a certain person). I've worked extensively with the Cox Proportional Hazards Model for Time Dependent Covariates to predict attrition rates for individual employees. Survival modeling is highly potent, so much so that executives in my company question the ethics behind the predictions we are making. For example, if an employee has a high probability of leaving the company in the next quarter according to my model, what sort of intervention should be taken? Should we fire employees before they leave? Should we talk to them? Or let them expire on their natural course? Should employees know we are running such models on them and releasing that data to their managers? It's scary to think what we can do with survival analysis.    Embed Quote
