★Are there any online services that can help test a candidate's programming ability?This would be as part of a complement / filter to a selection process.
This is an old thread, but thanks for the shout out Tristan Bice. I work at Gild, so I wanted to chime in. As Tristan eluded to, companies are using our product (Gild Source) as way to qualify developers (active/passive job seekers and even current candidates). It's literally putting context to a developer's resume. We've created a code evaluation technology that analyzes developers' code from open source sites, which helps companies focus on proven skills...rather than just a resume (although a resume is still important). There's a lot of talented developers that get overlooked because they don't have traditional measures of success (i.e. went to Harvard), so it's important that companies look at the one thing that truly matters...code.    Embed Quote
