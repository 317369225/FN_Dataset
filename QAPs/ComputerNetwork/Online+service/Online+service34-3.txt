★Is there an online service with a REST-like API for sending faxes?I'm not looking for a personal solution but rather one that could be added to a web application. I don't want awful complicated APIs and a simple metered service (you pay only per fax, no other setup etc. charges) would be ideal. Does such a thing exist?
Yes, it certainly does exist.  We wanted exactly what you were looking for, so we built it ourselves.  It's called Phaxio (http://www.phaxio.com) and is a simple, RESTful, json-based API with pay as you go pricing.  Most importantly, it's been designed with the modern web in mind, and our feature set is unmatched by any other cloud-based product in the space. We have features that allow you to build up the pages you send in "batches" and only make one phone call every few minutes (thus avoiding busy signals).  For sites that are continually sending a lot of faxes to one number (like restaurant ordering apps sending orders to restaurants), this is almost a make it or break it feature. We're web developers ourselves, so our customers feel comfortable knowing that we will continue to innovate and constantly address any problem one might encounter sending and receiving faxes from a large-scale or high traffic software system. If you have any questions about fax and integration, please feel free to contact me directly. -Josh Nankin Co-founder, Phaxio    Embed Quote
