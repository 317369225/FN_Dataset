★What is the best free online service for family trees?Should be a company that can be trusted with detailed personal information, have an excellent user interface, should allow for different non-standard family scenarios to be represented in a sensitive manner, and must support the GEDCOM file format for input-export.
I have a 200 member strong family tree spanning 4 generations running on Geni ( http://www.geni.com ). If your requirement is limited to keeping track of family members, should work fine for you. Geni is forever trying to monetise its site by getting me to find out if my lineage can be traced back to the Queen of Engand or Barack Obama, (and more recently, Aishwarya Rai), or by merging various trees. These would probably work in the West where geneology is big business but have limited or no utlity for me in India. Though Geni has a social networking interface reminiscent of Facebook, it's difficult to put up links to photo sharing sites, or even to share links for that matter.  Other issues have been with less tech savvy members from older generations losing passwords and finding themselves locked out of the site. Even though I am a site administrator, I have limited powers in such scenarios.    Embed Quote
