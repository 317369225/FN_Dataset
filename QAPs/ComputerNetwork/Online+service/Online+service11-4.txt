★What is the average conversion rate from free trials to paying users of online services?What are some specific examples?
I agree with John, it greatly depends on the product, trial type, pricing plans, etc... In my experience I've seen rates all over the place; but on average I would say the expectation is that you are going to convert a minimum of 40% of free trial signups into paying customers. The best I've seen in my experience has been 59% and probably an average of 50% across the brands I've worked on.    Embed Quote
