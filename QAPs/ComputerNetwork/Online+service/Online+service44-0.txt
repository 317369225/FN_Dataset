â˜…What is best way to promote a new online service?We recently launched a new service which is meant to increase traffic on websites by injecting fresh & updated content. I think the service is starting up too slowly. I wonder what we should be doing to increase adoption. The service is freely usable at http://www.mashupxfeed.com. TIA for your help.
Wld Would suggest to segment the targeted market and tailor communication efforts towards each segment.
