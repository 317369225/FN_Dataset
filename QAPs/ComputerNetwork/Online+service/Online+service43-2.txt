★What are the best online services to help a small business grow their sales?
Sales are hard for small business.  Owners need to be focused on serving current clients and lack the time and the skills to be consistent in business development.  That is probably their greatest obstacle to growth. The good news is, most small businesses, especially professional service companies, already have the relationships that they need to grow.  They have time invested in building networks on LinkedIn, Facebook and even Twitter.  They have current and past clients, active vendors and a bunch of friends and family who would love to send over business if they only knew how to.  The missing link is the ability to see the wood for the trees across social and business networks and focus your efforts on the relationships that are most likely to get you business.  Basically - small businesses need a simple way to use what they have to get what they want.  That means making networks actionable and looking at your contacts through the lense of your goals.  Check out www.bizily.com.  We do that.    Embed Quote
