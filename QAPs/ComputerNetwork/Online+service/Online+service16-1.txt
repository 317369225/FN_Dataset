★What is the best free online service for hosting podcasts?
Free is always a red flag in podcasting because it comes with compromises that in the end, usually hurt your show more than it helps. But one free service that I have used since I started podcasting in 2006 is blip.tv. Most people don't realize that they will also host your audio as well as your video content. They give you great stats and unlimited file sizes. They have always been the best of the "free" options however the price comes in the form of download speeds for your subscribers. Anything over approximately 5mb is going to be really slow to download. This can hurt your product, making people mad and frustrating them to the point of unsubscribing. But if you have to do free, they are a great option. As always, make sure to use Feedburner in conjunction with any service you end up choosing because (especially in the cases of free) you'll decide at some point in the future that you want to move hosts and Feedburner allows you to do this without affecting any of your current subscribers.    Embed Quote
