★What are the best free online services/tools to efficiently learn Mandarin Chinese?
Hello, I’m Jennifer, a full time Chinese teacher from Beijing China.  As for Mandarin language study, I recommend beginners to start from Chinese Pinyin. Chinese Pinyin is a Roman-letter based system that China now uses to mark the pronunciation of Chinese characters. That is to say, Chinese Pinyin is a way to represent Chinese characters and express the sounds in Chinese language using the alphabet. There are other systems to express Mandarin, but Chinese Pinyin is the most accepted and widely used. Once you learn Chinese Pinyin you will know how to pronounce any word in Mandarin using a Chinese dictionary. The earlier you start Pinyin, the easier to grasp the correct pronunciation.   Useful Resources for online learning: 1.Popular Chinese words: http://resources.echineselearnin... 2.Business Chinese: http://resources.echineselearnin... 3.Chinese test: http://resources.echineselearnin... 4.Chinese learning newsletter: http://www.echineselearning.com/...
