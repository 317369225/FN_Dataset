★What is the average conversion rate from free trials to paying users of online services?What are some specific examples?
My experience is with trial software rather than online services based on selling DR programs on Download.com to software publishers.  The number I work with is generally fairly low.  A 3-5% conversion rate is a range I've commonly seen in helping clients determine ROI on programs on Download.com.  Obviously a lot depends on the various techniques you can leverage to induce (or incentivize) people to make the jump from trial to paid that I had no impact on.  In fact, that's probably an interesting follow-up question...    Embed Quote
