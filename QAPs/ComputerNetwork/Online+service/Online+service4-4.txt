★Which Church has the best Online Service?I am very interested in looking a great online live church services to see what are the leading techniques to follow. Thanks,   _tim
I would recommend Northpoint Community Church.  We are a large church in Metro Atlanta, with a small church feeling.  The music is incredible and our pastor Andy Stanley talks rather than preaches.  They have live streaming services Sunday @ 11 & 6.  There are also lots of podcasts available on iTunes.   The live stream URL is www.northpointonline.tv    Embed Quote
