★What is best way to promote a new online service?We recently launched a new service which is meant to increase traffic on websites by injecting fresh & updated content. I think the service is starting up too slowly. I wonder what we should be doing to increase adoption. The service is freely usable at http://www.mashupxfeed.com. TIA for your help.
Are you from mashupxfeed and you’re asking how to increase traffic to your site or you bought the service from them? If you’re from mashupxfeed and you’re asking how to increase traffic to your site, then you’ve just written the worse testimonial for the service. If you’re using their service and it’s not working as well as you think it should, firstly, you should be talking to them. That said, there are several problems I see with the service from an SEO point of view. It just appears to be a content aggregate, so in terms of rankings, Google would be ignoring all your “fresh and updated content” as duplicate. Google (and content owners) have done a lot of work using new tags that allow people to specify original content, so this is something Google is well on top of. This isn’t to say people wouldn’t find the content interesting, but I don’t see how it would get new people to your site unless you were promoting the site content outside passive search. Please clarify and I can give you a more specific answer. :)    Embed Quote
