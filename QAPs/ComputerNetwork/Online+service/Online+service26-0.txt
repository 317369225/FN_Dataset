★What online services exist to identify people's specific accents?Is there a service where I can upload an audio file of myself speaking and a dialectologist or linguist will give an analysis? It'd be cool if it included specific regions vs. more general information.
Not quite. I'm not sure there is anywhere you can get an analysis of your own dialect by a trained linguist per se, but there is something called the speech accent archive which allows you to browse English accents. You can submit your own to be included in the database, and compare yours to those already in it It uses a passage which includes all the phonemes in English, so it's a strange bit of prose but it gets the job done.    Embed Quote
