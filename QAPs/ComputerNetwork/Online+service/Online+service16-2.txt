★What is the best free online service for hosting podcasts?
It depends on your needs and the profile of your podcast. For all mentioned sites you have to check their TOS, so you know a) what you're allowed to upload (e. g. if you're using music - how is it licensed? is it "podsafe"?) b) what the hoster is allowed to do with the upload (who "owns" it). Here are some possibilities (but again, please check their TOS!) - archive.org - soundcloud.com - mixcloud.com    Embed Quote
