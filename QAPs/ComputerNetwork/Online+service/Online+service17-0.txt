★What is the best online service to create Flowcharts?The plus feature would be an ability to share and work on the same chart with others at the same time. Like in Google docs.
**Note** I'm not sure what Quora's policy is on "double posting", but I just wrote this answer for a different (but very similar) question.  If it's OK, I'd like to repeat my answer here.  Quora admins, if I'm doing something improper here, please let me know!  :-) I am a HUGE fan of LucidChart (http://www.LucidChart.com).  LucidChart is an HTML5 based web app that performs beautifully inside of modern browsers like Chrome and Firefox. LucidChart offers excellent real-time collaboration, very similar to Google Docs and Spreadsheets.  They consistently roll out small improvements and new features, and their community support is very good.  I just can't say enough about how awesome these guys are. As for Flowcharts, LucidChart has intelligent shapes.  Drag a flowchart shape to your page, edit its text, then drag a line from one of the shape's points.  When you "drop" the line, you'll be presented with a mini-palette of flowchart shapes, allowing you to select the next shape in your process. I know there are other apps that may do Flowcharts just a bit better, but when you factor in LucidChart's unequaled performance and collaboration, it's hard for me to suggest anything else. Happy Charting!    Embed Quote
