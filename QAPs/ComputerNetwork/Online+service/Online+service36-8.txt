★Are there any free online services that allow the hosting of PHP scripts and MySQL creation?I need to test my app and cannot get any other server running. I seen this but not sure if it is legit: http://www.serversfree.com/
There are many offering free PHP+MySQL hosting, none from reputable companies, and any of them can stop providing the service at any given time. If you are after shared hosting managed by the host, then my advise is to buy a very cheap hosting plan, many companies start at around 3$/month. If you want to mess around with the server files and install everything yourself, then you can get a virtual private server from $1.99 per month from VPS Cheap    Embed Quote
