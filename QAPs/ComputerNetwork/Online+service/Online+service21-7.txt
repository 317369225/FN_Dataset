★Which is best free online service, that can provide me rank of my site's SEO quality?I have my own site, I did some stuff of SEO. But I m not sure about its accuracy, that I have covered all the points or not, is there any online service that can provide me such analysis. As well I want to know if I can get data about my site's rank in google for perticular search term and related suggestions reagarding seo if any.
I think there are two aspects of SEO that it is critical that you focus on. The first you are obviously thinking about is improving SEO ranking. Now I could create an entire college major around SEO so we aren't going to be able to answer it all here. But what I will say is that joining and participating in the SEOMoz community is a must. Their application, education, and information you get from the community is unmatched anywhere else without paying thousands of dollars.   The second thing I would say to do is implment and become an expert in web analytics tools such as Google Analytics. This will help you 1) pick the keywords that you will be optimizing for 2) Know what keywords are performing the best and which ones you need to drop from your list 3) See how people are finding your site which will help you know where the holes are and what type of content you need to add.    Embed Quote
