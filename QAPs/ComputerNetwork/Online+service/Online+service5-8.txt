★What are some online services that provide group collaboration on the web?I have a group of 30 or so disparate partners that we want to be able to communicate together online.  Think Yammer with message boards.
Wiggio.com is a free online toolkit that makes it easy to work in groups.  It's easy to use, and provides all the tools you need to collaborate efficiently -- and nothing more.  You can try it out for free at http://wiggio.com.  Let me know if you have any questions.    Embed Quote
