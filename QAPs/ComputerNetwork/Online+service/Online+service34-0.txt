★Is there an online service with a REST-like API for sending faxes?I'm not looking for a personal solution but rather one that could be added to a web application. I don't want awful complicated APIs and a simple metered service (you pay only per fax, no other setup etc. charges) would be ideal. Does such a thing exist?
I've been happy with both Interfax and Faxage for a fairly high volume application.  They both have reasonable APIs and generally offer reasonable latency. One thing I HIGHLY advise for any business-critical, third-party service like this is to have a second provider on hot standby.  All of them have hiccups occasionally and you don't want to be dependant on any single one.    Embed Quote
