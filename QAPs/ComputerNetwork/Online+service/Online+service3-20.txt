★What is the best online service to track SEO rankings for a website?I want to regularly track my startup's SEO results across multiple keywords and search engines. I would prefer to use an online service instead of a program. Regularly emailed reports and suggested keywords or tactics would be helpful.   
We dropped Raven Tools for Optify... We get what we needed in Optify PLUS on page SEO analysis and tracking... let's us be more organized in our SEO efforts and is paying dividends in the first few weeks! Let me know if you need a cheaper than retail account... I can hook you up!  :)    Embed Quote
