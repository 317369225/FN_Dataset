★Will real estate brokerage ever be a 100% online service, as in no need for real estate agents?
Not as long as properties are different. Different locations, conditions, features etc. Buyers & Sellers can get alot of information online but they lack the context for it and it's application to the local market. Plus there's physically being there for showings etc. That's my opinion.    Embed Quote
