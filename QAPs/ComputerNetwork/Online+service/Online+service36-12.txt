★Are there any free online services that allow the hosting of PHP scripts and MySQL creation?I need to test my app and cannot get any other server running. I seen this but not sure if it is legit: http://www.serversfree.com/
DigitalOcean dot com provides SSD cloud VPS hosting from $5 per month. They offer $10 credit by free coupon (It was SSD2014, I don't know if it is still valid). You can choose from preinstalled LAMP, Ruby, etc or install your server from scratch. It is good for developers to play with their apps. I am using it but I am not an affiliate or something like that.    Embed Quote
