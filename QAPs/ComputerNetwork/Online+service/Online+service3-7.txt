★What is the best online service to track SEO rankings for a website?I want to regularly track my startup's SEO results across multiple keywords and search engines. I would prefer to use an online service instead of a program. Regularly emailed reports and suggested keywords or tactics would be helpful.   
If you want just strait-up rankings reports, http://authoritylabs.com is your answer. Any time you try to track more than a dozen or so keywords from your local machine you are going to run into issues, so it's worth paying for a service. We are using AuthorityLabs to power the rankings aspect of https://serps.com (as are Raven and other SEO tools).    Embed Quote
