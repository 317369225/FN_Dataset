★Are there any online services that can help test a candidate's programming ability?This would be as part of a complement / filter to a selection process.
There are a couple of testing services that I have heard of success from. Gild: A number of companies (not recruiting firms) are now using Gild as a service for screening both active and passive job seekers in the SW Engineering sector. and... PreVisor (who has acquired Brainbench) offers a number of services for testing software specific skills (C#, Java 5, OOP, SQL, etc...) and general non engineering areas as well.    Embed Quote
