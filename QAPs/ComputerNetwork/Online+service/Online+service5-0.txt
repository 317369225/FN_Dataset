★What are some online services that provide group collaboration on the web?I have a group of 30 or so disparate partners that we want to be able to communicate together online.  Think Yammer with message boards.
You may want to have a look at eXo Cloud (http://cloud.exoplatform.com). You can create a social collaboration workspace in like five minutes and then add as many partners as you want. It's a ready to use social collaboration platform with activity streams, profiles, spaces, forums, team calendars, polls and more. The message boards in eXo is very advanced and fully integrated.
