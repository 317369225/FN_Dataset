★What are some online services not available in Canada?Follow-up on http://news.ycombinator.com/item...
Pandora, Hulu, the ability to stream videos from Comedy Central and the major US networks. Canadian Netflix is also super lame. Skype-in numbers are not available. Lots of online shopping sites (clothing/fashion) will not ship to Canada, but this seems to be getting better with time. Lots of times Amazon.com will tell you during the final stages of checkout they won't ship a specific item to Canada.    Embed Quote
