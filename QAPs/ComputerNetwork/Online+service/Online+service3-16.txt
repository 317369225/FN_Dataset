★What is the best online service to track SEO rankings for a website?I want to regularly track my startup's SEO results across multiple keywords and search engines. I would prefer to use an online service instead of a program. Regularly emailed reports and suggested keywords or tactics would be helpful.   
Now I use only http://rankinity.com, since there is a setting on the regional, the use of many of the key words, the evaluation of competitors. And what is most useful for me, analysis is carried out very quickly. I will say from personal experience, I've tried a few online services, but each had flaws, or spend a long time searching, or did not compare competitors.    Embed Quote
