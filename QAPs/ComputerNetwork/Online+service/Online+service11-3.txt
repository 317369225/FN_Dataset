★What is the average conversion rate from free trials to paying users of online services?What are some specific examples?
Free to paid conversion for modern, well run online businesses is closer to 15%. It's interesting to see how far we have come since the days of the first cloud free trial success (Salesforce.com)! My data comes from the 100+ online businesses we have analyzed at Totango.com. Not all trial users convert equally: About 20% of trial signups are "active users" (as defined by their actions such as "logged in at least once" to "added 3 users", etc.). For very well tuned marketing machines the % of active trial users can be 30%. Active users exhibit a trial to paid conversion up to 40%. The rest of the users convert at much lower rates, around 10%. Knowing this you can focus your time and resources just on the trial users most likely to convert. This way you actually will increase your overall conversion (by more than 30% Zendesk found: http://www.totango.com/customer-...). In parallel find ways to increase the number of trial users who become "active" 1. better leads: get more users like the ones who look like and come from the channels that brought you the "active users" 2. better product: maybe there is something about the first impression, the first screens that turns away the new trial users. nCircle was able to improve successful trial setups by 3x by analyzing usage: http://www.totango.com/customer-... 3. engage users: send tips and reminders to the non-active group to try and get them to behave like the active ones    Embed Quote
