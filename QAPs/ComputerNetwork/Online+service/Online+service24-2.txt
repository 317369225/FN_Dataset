★What are the best free online services/tools to efficiently learn Mandarin Chinese?
One of the first major players in the space was ChinesePod (http://chinesepod.com). There is a great deal of free content and a large community around it, but to get sufficiently comprehensive access to materials I suspect a paid plan is required. I still subscribe to their free podcasts which include both basic lessons and nice chunks of audio for advanced learners. Another option is Popup Chinese (http://popupchinese.com) which has all of its lessons available for free subscribers, and then additional features such as transcripts for those who pay. There is also a strong forum community of learners. Having good dictionary resources is also important. I recommend Nciku (http://nciku.com), and have used Dict.cn (http://dict.cn) in the past also. For a large number of example sentences to help with developing a feel for linguistic usage in context, try Jukuu (http://jukuu.com).    Embed Quote
