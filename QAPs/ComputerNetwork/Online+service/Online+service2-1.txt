★What is the best free online service for family trees?Should be a company that can be trusted with detailed personal information, have an excellent user interface, should allow for different non-standard family scenarios to be represented in a sensitive manner, and must support the GEDCOM file format for input-export.
I used Geni briefly but was quickly put off by its relentless emails asking Iif I was interested in for-pay services.  I currently use ancestry.com and am happy to pay for the service. A free online option is to download the FamilySearch tree maker software (https://familysearch.org/products) to create your gedcom file which you could upload to your free FamilyTreeMaker page (http://familytreemaker.genealogy...) There are many free genealogy resources.  Here are a few of my favorites: HeritageQuest offers its database of census, books, and Freedman records for free to various libraries.  FamilySearch.org provides a wealth of genealogy archives for free.  Fold3.com (formerly footnote.com) provides free military records.  Findagrave.com provides some cemetary records. Many countries offer free record searches, some are better than others.  Canada provides a good amount of their records online.    Embed Quote
