You may want to try http://marketing.grader.com/ This analyzes your whole website, blog, social sharing/links and and give you grading on the basis of its analysis. However, no tool can get you accurate analysis as it need some logical reasoning as well and. Tool have set guidelines for each attribute/element and analyze your websites on the basis of those guidelines only.
