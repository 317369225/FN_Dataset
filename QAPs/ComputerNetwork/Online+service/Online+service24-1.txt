★What are the best free online services/tools to efficiently learn Mandarin Chinese?
I agree with Peter's recommendations for the most part.  For a slightly alternative set of choices though, my picks are: www.chinese-forums.com (a community for learning and resource sharing) www.cc-cedict.org/editor/ (a user collaborative Chinese-English dictionary) www.imandarinpod.com (a free source of educational and news podcasts) www.csl-pod.com (another free source of educational podcasts in Chinese) Jukuu (句酷) and nCiKu (n詞酷) are excellent resources as Chinese-English dictionaries.  For Chinese-Chinese dictionaries, there are: www.zdic.net (a set of dictionaries divided into characters, words, and phrases) dict.revised.moe.edu.tw/ (a dictionary maintained by the government of Taiwan) I also highly recommend MDBG (http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/) which provides a variety of tools for studying Chinese such as coloration of characters by tone and insertion of spaces between Chinese "words" in a given text. Lastly, for study of Chinese characters, I strong recommend www.zhongwen.com which provides a very complete mapping of characters and their component pieces as well as semantic information. Happy studying!    Embed Quote
