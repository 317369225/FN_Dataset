★What are the best free online services/tools to efficiently learn Mandarin Chinese?
Hey there, I'm not sure about free, and you can find an article I recently wrote about why free isn't necessarily better here: Learning mandarin online free - is free necessarily good?. The free issue aside, if you're a stone cold beginner in learning Chinese, I highly suggest you check out Rocket Chinese - I've recently done a demo video and a review of why I think this course is the best Chinese learning software out there to learn the language, and to learn it FAST. Here's a link to it: Rocket Chinese Review - from a native Chinese and English speaker. Hope this helps! Cheers Baggio    Embed Quote
