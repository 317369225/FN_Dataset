★What is the best online service for creating charts & graphs?
I am sure there are a lot more sophisticated tools out there but www.Wondergraphs.com has been getting a lot of attention for a good reason- usability. For a slightly unconventional method of data visualisation, I found numberpicture.com quite helpful too - they are unfortunately not fully developed at this point. GDocs is good for really simple data which you need to create in under 1 minute.    Embed Quote
