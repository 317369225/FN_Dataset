★Will real estate brokerage ever be a 100% online service, as in no need for real estate agents?
I think the Internet will removed many brokers from the market but I don't think it will be something that will remove all agents. One of the services that the Internet can replace agents for is marketing, and many will argue that it already has removed many agents from the market.  The thing that will keep in the market will be local market knowledge and pricing.  As best as Zillow and the other guys try they will not be able to accurately price a home.  They also will not be able to truly help with staging, answering questions or other knowledges that the average home buyer or seller would not know. On the commercial side, I don't think the internet will ever replace the broker as there are so many more moving parts in commercial transactions that a knowledgeable agent is worth it's weight in gold.    Embed Quote
