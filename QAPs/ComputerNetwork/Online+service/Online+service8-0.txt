★What online services are Veblen goods?Which companies sell online Veblen/Luxury Goods -- where consumer preference for buying them increases as a direct function of their price? (Curious about examples of Online Services and not E-Commerce).
Second Life- They sell exclusive virtual goods such as cars and properties. A player tends to buy these goods at a higher price to gain respect and status in Second Life. Similarly other games for example Pet Society, Farm Ville, CityVille and Mafia Wars follow same model, they offer collectible items at higher price (in real currency) The Entropia Universe, an online game created by Swedish company Mindark, entered the Guinness World Records Book in both 2004 and 2008 for the most expensive virtual good ever sold and in 2010 a virtual space station, a popular destination in this game, sold for $330,000.This was then eclipsed in November 2010 when a player sold a virtual resort on Planet Calypso for $635,000; this property was sold in chunks, with the largest sold for $335,000. PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: In 2010, I was conducting research on Virtual worlds and their impact on our society. I was doing this for a private game development house which now  has 50 game titles, which are monetized through virtual economy. I started to play different games such as Second Life, FarmVille and Pet Society. While playing Pet Society I won a collectible item which was not available in the market as soon as other players learned about it they started to offer me money to sell it. After 1 month of tight bidding from different players I sold it for $700.  Sources http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ent... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vir... http://www.psfk.com/2010/01/virt... http://www.petsociety.com/ http://www.farmville.com/ http://secondlife.com/    Embed Quote
