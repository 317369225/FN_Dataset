★Who are some self-made animated video online services?I've found the ones at http://www.youtube.com/create . Are there any others interesting enough? Thank you!
The video services mentioned in other answers are all excellent but the level of time investment to learn them varies dramatically, as does the pre-prepared assets you have to add to the assembly. The other key point is this. The ROI on a video is usually a function of the investment you put into it in time or money. Think of a video in terms of views that can earn conversions. I call it "cost per view" or CPV. The higher that dollar number the worse off you are. The sweet spot is a video with lots of converting views that didn't cost much. Another new spin on the self-made animated video service is Moovd which animates your text. It's fast, simple, striking video with nothing to learn that you can make in minutes. You can test-drive it for free.  Moovd |Easy Animated Business Videos    Embed Quote
