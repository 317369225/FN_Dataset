★How do online services marketplace startups deal with fraud?I'm building a  marketplace for a particular type of service. Before my startup, these service providers were used to receiving 100% of the payment upfront. Because of the increased risk in marketplace startups, I'm thinking of creating an escrow feature to help with fraud. Are there any other methods I could use?
Yes, like Arnaud Bertrand I didn't understand the escrow feature you refer to completely. The most important thing to remember is you need to limit your exposure to fraud. A lot of payment gateways operate with a payment system that works by taking receipt of the payment and then distributing it to yout business. This can be good for fraud prevention as if it occurs you are not exposed as a business, payment gateways like this one - http://www.neteller.com/business... - will invest substantially in their own fraud prevention technology, in order to offer this kind of reliable service for their customers, which allows small business' including start-ups to offer the same service to their customers. These features can include 3D secure and other established payment protection systems - so online payment gateways are another option.    Embed Quote
