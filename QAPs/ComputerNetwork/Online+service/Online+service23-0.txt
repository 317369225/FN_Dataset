★What's the best "business plan" designing online service?
I'm proud to be conceptual author of LivePlan (Business Plan Software | LivePlan) which has no free version and 50K active users. It's a web app available on a subscription basis (base price $19.95 per account, which includes two users and three plans, with discounts available) that respects the fact that all business plans should be unique. It doesn't do dumb fill-in-the-blanks, but rather guides you through the information you should provide, with a lot of help developing GAAP-literate, financially and mathematically correct financial projections, based on your assumptions.
