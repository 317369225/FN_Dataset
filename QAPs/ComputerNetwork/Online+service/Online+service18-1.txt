★Is "Freemium" the best business model for internet online services?In general, to make a company profitable, is it the best business model?.
No one can give a definitive answer. Here is my take. Yes, freemium works for sure, but is it the best business model? I don't know One school of thought says, if you have a kick ass product which is delivering value, charge for it. However, I think it is more of an Utopia. With such crowded markets and competitions mushrooming, the best way to attract users is to provide a freemium model. If you already have an incumbent player, either you prove your product is at least 40% better ( what ever be the parameters you judge on) and charge a premium else use the freemium model to move some existing customers to your service. Remember, for critical services such as Payment Gateway ( for an ecommerce portal) switching has its costs and portals typically do no like to switch even if you offer your service at 10-20% lesser cost. For any other "good to have" services ( say - Social Media tools, Sentiment Analysis tools) freemium should work best because there is no other way to attract users in an already crowded space. But, if you seriously feel you are delivering considerable value, charge for it and charge a premium. Some big corporations have money to spend and all you need to do is to convince them on the reasons of charging the premium.    Embed Quote
