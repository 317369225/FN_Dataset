★What are some online services that provide group collaboration on the web?I have a group of 30 or so disparate partners that we want to be able to communicate together online.  Think Yammer with message boards.
Give LumoFlow a try! It's similar to Yammer but has much better functionality for collaborating with partners. http://www.lumoflow.com    Embed Quote
