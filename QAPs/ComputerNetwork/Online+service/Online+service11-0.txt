★What is the average conversion rate from free trials to paying users of online services?What are some specific examples?
The conversion rates depend greatly by product, trial type, the source of the trial customers, cost of the product, etc. At GoToMyPC and GoToMeeting, we typically converted 40% - 45% of our trails into paying customers. However, we required a credit card BEFORE you could initiate the free trial. We only converted those trialers who actually used the product, as we quickly learned that converting everyone who did not cancel when the trial was completed was a great way to generate chargebacks and angry customers. We also gave users the option to trial the product without a credit card, if they bailed on the credit card page. Despite aggressive follow-up, such non-credit card trails generally converted in the low single digit range (typically 2% - 4%). At CallWave, we had a similar credit card trial conversion rate, in the 40% - 50% range. I hope this is of some help. John    Embed Quote
