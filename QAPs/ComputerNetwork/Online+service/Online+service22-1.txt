★What's a good online service for virus removal?
From what I gather, people are coming up with new viruses all the time. Plus other very creative ways to take over your computer and gain access to personal and private data. Plus, even charge you money for doing this as well.    Even Big Business is having a hard time keeping up with hackers. Home Depot, just last week, was the latest victim of computer hacks on its' client list.     I personally use a service ( for a fee) provided by Centurylink that cleans up and removes the latest junk from my computer. I hope they will always be on top of what is happening especially for what they are charging me.   Whenever, I had AOL and downloaded their included for "free" protection, I would have nothing but trouble with my computer afterwards. Which would immediately go away if I removed the AOL download.    The problem with the latest over-the-counter methods is that they are out of date before you even purchase them. The best thing to do is get a service (for a monthly fee) that continuously protects your computer.   Do not open any E-mails from anyone whom you do not know, no matter what the intro is. There are quite a few "tricks" out there. With new ones coming out every day. Moreover, do not let anyone access your computer looking for problems as a "free service." They will quite likely screw it up and then charge you to fix it. An old trick will be a pop-up that says your computer is slow or doesn't have enough memory and what all.    I had just purchased this brand new computer with the highest storage and RAM available and I immediately received a message that my computer was to slow and did I wish to fix it? Go figure?    Embed Quote
