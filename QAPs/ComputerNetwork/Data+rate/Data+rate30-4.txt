â˜…Why are data transfer rates not uniform?When I transfer files (for example, pictures) from one folder to an other folder on hard drive of my laptop, the transfer rate varies between 1MB/sec to 15 MB/sec. Why does this variation exist?
if you have a antivirus in place with realtime scan enabled (which you should unless you use linux) then depending on the file content it may take more or less time for the AV software to give the transfer his blessing, IMHO that is just one of a myriad of reasons for variable file transfer speeds, which in my case they usually go from fast to slow, and they stay that way until the transfer ends, only when using linux I saw transfers to get back to a faster speed after a slowdown, reading the book "modern operative systems" by Andrew S. Tanembaum gave me some insight onto what's going on inside a computer when you start a file move. I recommend that book for the truly interested guy, even if you're not a geek and just a plain user and ignore all the complicated stuff in that book, the author goes a long way to try to explain everything in layman's terms, super simple.
