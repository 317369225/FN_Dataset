★Why are data transfer rates not uniform?When I transfer files (for example, pictures) from one folder to an other folder on hard drive of my laptop, the transfer rate varies between 1MB/sec to 15 MB/sec. Why does this variation exist?
Basically, hard drives are very complicated in the way they work. They are not like tapes, which store information linearly, but data is spread all across the drive. Let me give a very simplified explanation of what is happening when you copy data on your harddrive:  Moving the read-/write-head to a new position takes time, in which no data can be read or written. With transfers on the same platter, the head has to move from one place where the original data resides, read it, move to the new place for the copy of the data, and write it there. Also, every operation is tracked in a "catalog", so the device knows in what physical location every file is stored on the disk. The smaller the files, the less time the hard drive spends writing data, and the more overhead it has to do. As for the variation, that depends on many factors. There is always stuff happening on a computer, be it OS services like indexing, optimizing, saving, ... all of these need to access the hard drive, which interrupts the copy process for a split second, therefore taking away time from the copy process. Also, the CPU is busy doing other things during the copy, like displaying what is happening on your computer, and since the hard drive needs instructions on what to do, it has to wait for the CPU sometimes. Also, since data is scattered across the drive, the time the read-head takes to reach its new position varies as well, again taking time away from the copy process.
