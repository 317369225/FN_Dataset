â˜…How much does a subscription to Nielsen radio ratings data cost?
It depends on how you want it. If you want full access to data from a specific market (for the sake of argument, let's say you want access to ratings and demographics of programs from the Philadelphia metropolitan area, because that's where I have my numbers from), I was quoted around $30,000 per month. If you just want overnight data or final numbers for one specific program or a list of programs from either a specific market, or nationally, you can also do what I think Nielsen calls ad-hoc reports, which start around $1,000. Nielsen also offers full reports, where they do research and not only give you ratings, trends, but also demographics data. They tend to run in the thousands of dollars each, although they're rather comprehensive from my understanding. It's not cheap.
