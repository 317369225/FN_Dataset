â˜…How can I measure my heart rate data during exercise?
There are heart rate monitors(HRM) that could be bought in sports stores. I suggest buying those that don't need for you to stop the activity that you're doing. I have used HRMs that have chest straps with paired watches 'cause at that time those were more accurate than the ones without. Though I'm not sure if there are available heart rate monitors now that are accurate without the chest straps.
