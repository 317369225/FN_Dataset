★Why did India choose 2400 MHz as 4G frequency when other countries went with 600-800 MHz? Does it lead to higher data plan rates?
No. It doesn't lead to higher data plan. In India 2300MHz is TD-LTE while in developed countries 600-800MHz is FD-LTE. 1. FD-LTE requires two separate channels for uplink and downlink while in TD-LTE uplink downlink exist in same channel hence TD is cheaper compared to same frequency of FD 2. In TD uplink and downlink ratio can be changed dynamically that means download bandwidth can be increased if more users are downloading at the same time. 3. TD support more users (you can think as in FD 1 user is alloted 600 MHz bandwidth while in TD if 4 users share 2400 MHz bandwidth then each will get 600 MHz bandwidth same as FD but the trick here is this 2400 MHz bandwidth is shared by more  than 4 users say 8 users. Now all the users don't use LTE same time suppose 4 users using at time 1 they will get 600 MHz each and at time2 other 4 users are using they will also get a bandwidth of 600 MHz and if at time3 6 users are using they will get 400 MHz bandwidth each.) so for the same cost 8 users are served instead of 4 (though at they will get less bandwidth,compared to FD ,if all users are using at the same time) hence reduces the cost. So actually data plan will cost less.
