★As data rates on I/Os go higher, wouldn't that make EMI a bigger issue?
This actually wasn't much of a problem until clock speeds got up to 20MHz, at least not with the Motorola CPUs used in Macintosh, for instance.  We finally had to start routing specific signals first, sometimes between ground planes deep within the PCB.  We also had to ensure that address lines were almost identically the same length- going so far in some cases to form spirals in the shorter runs to extend their length to match other lines.  Same thing with the data bus.  All signals going off to I/O were through back-match resistors.  Some signals needed pull-down terminating resistances to reduce reflections.  Fun design!
