â˜…Econometrics: When doing a regression on macroeconomic data, do you regress the underlying data or the rate of change? How do you choose?
I guess the only answer to this question is experience and pattern recognition, and hopefully over time you will develop an acumen for recognizing what types of regressions to run. To give you an indication of how hard this problem can be. Think about just the concept of equity returns. As a financial concept it's effectively driven by net income, which on a macro scale is the equivalent of GDP. So you might want to regress US aggregate equity returns again US GDP. However that just doesn't work. You'd actually have to regress equity returns again US GDP growth (the 1-2% number we hear about in the news). And it can't be nominal growth, it has to be real growth. But that doesn't work either. Stock returns are a forward looking number, so you have to look at forward forecasts for US real GDP growth (maybe with a one to several year lead-lag). But I just read a GSAM research paper that basically says (you guessed it) that wouldn't work either. Since equities at any given time are already pricing in forward earnings expectations, to see a change in equity prices (and predict returns), you'd have to look at changes in the forward forecast of US real GDP growth, regress equity returns against that, and you'll see some interesting results. Tough problem, right?
