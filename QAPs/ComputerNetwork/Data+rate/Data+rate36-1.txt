★Is there a way to remove heart rate data from Strava?I'd like to record HR data but not publish it publicly (similar to what Garmin Connect does).  Is this possible with Strava?
FIT File Tools allows you to remove selected fields (like heart rate or power) from a Garmin fit file before uploading it to Strava.
