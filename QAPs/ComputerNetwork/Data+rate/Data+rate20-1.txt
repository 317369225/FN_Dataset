★Given a schema that will not change in any 6 month period, and a data rate of around 50 - 70 Gb a month is there any reason not to use MySQL?
It depends on your data & traffic. With the correct tuning, you would be ok up to 50-70% of your hardware capacity; beyond that, it is a physical limit (drive spindle & seek speed, installed memory, etc).  At some point, that data wont fit on 1 server. What will you do? scale up, or scale out? You can't scale up forever. Scaling out with MySQL isn't simple, but it can be done (Google & Facebook, + many others have done it). It starts with de-normalization of your data & covering your data into silos.  Then sharing the silo of data on the software side.  All of this can be done from the get go of development. You can also look at no-sql solutions that offer sharding built in. However, they have their own trade offs.  Every scenario is different, I hope this helps.
