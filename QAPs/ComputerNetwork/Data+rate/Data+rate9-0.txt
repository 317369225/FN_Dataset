★What is the data rate difference between standard and "higher quality" audio settings on Pandora?The Pandora app for Android offers an option for "higher quality audio" but presumably this uses more data.  How much more?
According to - How Much Data Does the Pandora Radio Application Use on an iPhone? Wi-fi; default is 128 kb/s Cell network: 64 kb/s or 128 kb/s Pandora Premium (Wi-fi): Up to 192 kb/s On the other hand, per Pandora's help, mobile devices never receive more than 64 kb/s -(See Pandora | Audio Quality ) which contradicts the above. I assume it is the same for Android.
