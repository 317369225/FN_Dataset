★Why have the cellular companies like Airtel, Vodafone, Reliance etc in India increased the data pack rates? Shouldn't they get cheaper with time?
The problem with data and spectrums in India(and some other countries as well) is that during the 3G(or 4g) spectrum auctions companies had to bid a higher amount than what they could recover in the short run. So the question is why would a company invest in a technology that is very unlikely to yield profits and will be obsolete before it does? The answer is to retain their most valued customers. If only one of these companies had given you a 3G offering then you surely would've left your service provider and moved to the one that did. Now having bought the spectrum, what do you do with it. You have a technology that most people are unwilling to try out because you want to make a profit and the people are not ready to pay as much. It's like having a movie play in a theatre without having any people in it to watch it because the ticket price is too high. You will try to minimise your loss by giving out tickets for cheaper. Data packages were cheap to begin with for the same reason. Although you are right about other telecom services- that it should get cheaper with time as the capital expenditure has already been done and recovered, the truth with data packages  is different. They are not getting more expensive, they are losing the discount that was available earlier.
