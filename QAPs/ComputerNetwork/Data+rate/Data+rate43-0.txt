â˜…Why did India choose 2400 MHz as 4G frequency when other countries went with 600-800 MHz? Does it lead to higher data plan rates?
The decision was dictated by the availability of spectrum 2010. At that time, the only available band for broadband wireless access was 2.3-2.4 GHz. The choice of band doesn't impact data rates but the cost of deployment depends on it, to some extent.
