â˜…If my Bluetooth enabled device (smartphone, tablet) is now connected using BT (headphones, car hands-free, etc), can it also connect to a BLE device (like a watch) for the low data-rate communications?
BT smart (LE) and BT classic (non LE) aren't supposed to be backward compatible. However, if all of your Radios are on the v4 spec, there is a better chance they will because it provisioned the option from the component OEM to have to choice to run reduced energy consumption, the classic profile or both modes. Tnen it would also be up to the hardware platform engineers to support the firmware for both. So if your logic had support for both options, but handset design chose not to deploy the drivers and the profile, then you would need to modify the firmware via patch to do it, or perhaps request the OEM to help out. An OTA patch would be much easier for the user, I would assume..
