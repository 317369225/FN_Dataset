â˜…What is the data usage rate of Skype for iOS?This is a follow-up question to Does any VOIP solution for iPod Touch provide a feasible iPhone replacement?.
I expect that iOS version has the same requirements as any other Skype version. Skype uses the same core and rewrites UI only for different platforms. When in a voice call - 128kbps max and can be less (if there are limiting factors). Smaller bandwidth - poorer voice quality. See Skype FAQ https://support.skype.com/faq/FA... On average, Skype uses between 3-16 kilobytes/sec depending on bandwidth available for other party, network conditions in between, callers CPU performance, etc. When idle - 4kbps max. See https://support.skype.com/faq/FA... On average Skype uses 0-0.5 kilobytes/sec while idle. Video calls require: Minimal - 384kbps High Quality - 500kbps HD video - around 1.2Mbps Relevant FAQs: https://support.skype.com/faq/FA... https://support.skype.com/faq/FA... From personal experience 64kbps is enough for a cellphone-like quality of voice call.
