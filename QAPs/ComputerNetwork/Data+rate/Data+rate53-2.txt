★Apple Watch in 2015: In what form does Apple Watch return heart rate data to the apps? What is the frequency and precision of data points?
How Apple Watch measures your heart rate: The heart rate sensor in Apple Watch uses what is known as photoplethysmography. This technology is based on a very simple fact: Blood is red because it reflects red light and absorbs green light. Apple Watch uses green LED lights paired with light‑sensitive photodiodes to detect the amount of blood flowing through your wrist at any given moment. When your heart beats, the blood flow in your wrist — and the green light absorption — is greater. Between beats, it’s less. By flashing its LED lights hundreds of times per second, Apple Watch can calculate the number of times the heart beats each minute — your heart rate. The heart rate sensor can also use infrared light. This mode is what Apple Watch uses when it measures your heart rate every 10 minutes. However, if the infrared system isn't providing an adequate reading, Apple Watch switches to the green LEDs. In addition, the heart rate sensor is designed to compensate for low signal levels by increasing both LED brightness and sampling rate. Apple Watch may also be connected wirelessly to external heart rate monitors such as Bluetooth chest straps.Ref: Official Apple Support
