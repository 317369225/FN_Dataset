★Why did India choose 2400 MHz as 4G frequency when other countries went with 600-800 MHz? Does it lead to higher data plan rates?
2400MHz is TDD band, 600MHz is FDD band India choose 2400MHz based on the spectum availability. So we had to adopt TDD since 2400MHz was only avaialable. All developing countries use TD LTE , Eg China , India etc In TDD BW is time shared for Uplink(UL) and Downlink(DL), FDD BW is frequency shared ,i.e at any point we get Full BW in UL and DL. So Data rates are better in FDD compared to TDD. Since spectrum is used efficiently i.e same frequency used for UL and DL   data plans  might cost less in TDD
