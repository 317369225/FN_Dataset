â˜…Econometrics: When doing a regression on macroeconomic data, do you regress the underlying data or the rate of change? How do you choose?
Highly context dependent, but from what literature I've seen if you're looking at variables of political interest (e.g. democracy index, life expectancy) then underlying (per capita) numbers are of interest. When looking at interest rates, unemployment, etc, you should look at growth rates. But consider the case of unemployment - changes in unemployment tend to be caused by shocks, but a steady-state unemployment relates to a complex combination of factors (growth rates, interest rates, total debts, deficits[change in debt], and more), AND exhibits hysteresis - a return to former conditions after a big shock doesn't necessarily set unemployment back to where it was. Economists have worked very hard on these types of problems, so instead of doing the experiments yourself, look to econometrics and macroeconomics papers - they'll probably have a lot of cases of interest.
