â˜…Why the mobile data rates have been consistently increasing since BJP government has come to power?
Ha ha. I couldn't stop laughing. What next? Mosquito bites you and you might tell BJP is the reason. The reason for increased data rates are two simple things 1) Supreme Court cancelled the 2G Spectrum licenses that were allotted in 2008, which were outside the eligibility criterion. This affected almost major telecom players because they purchased lot of 2G Licences in many states. So they had to increase the prices 2) Rise of Whatsapp and other texting medium through mobile internet completely stopped the use of SMS packs and Call packs. So, a case of Demand Supply theory. If there is a demand for data packs, its price increases
