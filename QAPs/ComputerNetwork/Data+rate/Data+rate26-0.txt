★If my Bluetooth enabled device (smartphone, tablet) is now connected using BT (headphones, car hands-free, etc), can it also connect to a BLE device (like a watch) for the low data-rate communications?
That depends on the capability of your phone/tablet device. The simple answer: Bluetooth and Bluetooth LE are 2 fundamentally different technologies, just covered under the same umbrella. To simplify the compatibility-topic for the end-user, the "Bluetooth Smart" Logo certification was defined. Knowing how a device was certified tells you what it is capable of: "Bluetooth" Devices alone are ONLY capable to communicate via "legacy" Bluetooth. They don't support Low-Energy profiles. "Bluetooth Smart" ​​​Those devices are ONLY capable of Low-Energy communication. They cannot talk to "legacy" Bluetooth devices but only to devices which also support LE. "Bluetooth Smart Ready" ​​Those devices are capable of standard Bluetooth AND Low-Energy (LE) communication. Nearly all new phone/tablets launched in the last year are "Smart Ready" So if your phone/tablet is a "Bluetooth Smart Ready" device, it is capable to use LE in communication with another LE device. ​ ​ Just check the product packaging or website for the logo. Simple check: If your device runs on Android 4.4 since you purchased it or is a iPhone 4 or newer, it is "Smart Ready" ;) The technical answer: Check how your device was certified by looking up its Bluetooth certificate. Open this webpage: https://www.bluetooth.org/tpg/li... Search for your device model (i.e. "D802" for the European LG G2) Select the QD-ID in the result. Expand the List on the bottom to see all profiles. Check whether at least the "Generic Attribute Profile" is listing a feature as "over LE"If yes, your device can talk to Low-Energy devices. You will still need a app on the device to use this feature though. LE devices are mostly using custom protocols to communicate with each other using the above Generic profile.
