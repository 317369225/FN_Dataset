â˜…Given a schema that will not change in any 6 month period, and a data rate of around 50 - 70 Gb a month is there any reason not to use MySQL?
The reason to use NoSQL is often driven by the kind of things you'd like to do with your data. The details you gave don't really address that issue. If SQL lets you do what you want, and your database fits into a single server (which yours does), and you don't have a fanatic query rate, then go SQL. If SQL gets in the way (graph computation, anyone?), you don't want to have a fixed schema, or your database is Really Freaking Huge, has a high write rate, or a high read rate, then NoSQL might be your cup of tea.
