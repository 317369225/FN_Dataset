â˜…Why are data transfer rates not uniform?When I transfer files (for example, pictures) from one folder to an other folder on hard drive of my laptop, the transfer rate varies between 1MB/sec to 15 MB/sec. Why does this variation exist?
It depends on several things, but mostly on one underlying fact of modern computers and operating systems: Computers only EVER do one thing at a time. Everything your computer is doing, it's doing so quickly that you just don't recognize the linear, time constrained progression of its processes. It divides all of its resources up among the tasks that it has been charged with, be it a service you have no idea is running in the background, an internal hardware process that must be done to utilize different peripherals, or an application you're actively using like your web browser, video player, word processor, etc. So,if your computer were designed to ONLY copy files, at the hardware level, you would experience the maximum transfer rate, unhindered, consistently. However, because your computer may be meeting demands you, itself, or a network put on it, it cannot devote all of its time to copying and still continue to function.
