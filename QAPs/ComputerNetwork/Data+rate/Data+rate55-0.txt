★Which iPhone apps can currently capture heart rate data to send to the Health app?For example, capture heart rate with a Polar H7 HRM and send to Health via the Strava or Runkeeper app.
You can actually connect your strap directly to iOS and the data will dump directly into Health Kit.  Just go to Settings > Bluetooth and connect. The bummer is there isn't a way to chart your workout (e.g. Elevation, Distance) versus Heart Rate in a meaningful way.  Apple currently blobs the BPM data in a bar chart where each bar contains an entire hour of data. I'm on the hunt for a simple app that charts minute-by-minute HR data against the minute-by-minute distance/pace/elevation data.
