★Is it legal to publish data visualization using IMDb movie and ratings data?
Just build your cool idea. If they care they will let you know. I'm not a lawyer, but if you aren't making a lot of money then they probably won't care.  :) More precisely, if you aren't making a lot of money, then it probably isn't worth it for them to pay their lawyer to send you a cease and desist. Just build your cool idea and then let me know when it's done so I can look at it. I like movies and data. A lot.
