â˜…Does Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing provide high data rates compared to the single carrier modulation?If yes, please elaborate. my second question is, How would IFFT/FFT blocks in OFDM implementation create signals that are ORTHOGONAL to each other?
In one word: no. In two words: it depends. Basically, (data rate) = (symbol rate) X (number of sub-carriers) = (bandwidth). Since each sub-carrier occupies less bandwidth, the symbol rate decreases, and the overall data rate remains the same. The specific scenario might affect the way you use each scheme, so in different situations other modulation is more efficient. For instance, if you have long delay spread, you would like to add longer guard intervals, which consumes more bandwidth from the single carrier modulation. On the other hand, if you have Doppler spread, OFDM might loose some of the carriers, while single carrier would be less vulnerable.
