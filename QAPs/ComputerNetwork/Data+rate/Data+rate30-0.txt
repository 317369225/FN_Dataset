â˜…Why are data transfer rates not uniform?When I transfer files (for example, pictures) from one folder to an other folder on hard drive of my laptop, the transfer rate varies between 1MB/sec to 15 MB/sec. Why does this variation exist?
It may depend of how the files are stored on your hard disk, for example if your data is heavily fragmented it will be slower to read because your HDD has to constantly seek data on the drive. (This is less and less important as filesystems and disk scheduling algorithms improve, and they have got a lot better those last years.) It may depend on the size of the files. Again different filesystems handle that differently, but as a rule, for an equal total size, it is almost always longer to process a lot of small files than one or a few big files. If your disk is doing something else while you are copying your files, it obviously impacts performance since it uses some drive I/O throughput. This can happen even if you as a user are not doing anything important with the disk, for example maybe your OS has just decided to do some disk-intensive background maintenance job now and it trashes your transfer rates. Also, be aware that the transfer rates reported by many OS are very inaccurate, especially when copying small files.
