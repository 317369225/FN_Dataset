★Is there a way to remove heart rate data from Strava?I'd like to record HR data but not publish it publicly (similar to what Garmin Connect does).  Is this possible with Strava?
Jack, Currently, a Strava user has an 'all or nothing' option to either publicly or privately post activities. In other words, You can not optionally hide/unhide various datapoints in an activity (e.g. Power, HR, etc) from being seen publicly or not. It could make for a great Premium User feature to allow for those options (hint hint, Mark Shaw). Ride on, Greg
