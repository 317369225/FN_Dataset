★What are the data rates at the two LHC experiments - both raw data and at the various filtering stages?
Disclaimer: I am not a member of either experiment and many of these numbers should be verified by members of their respective collaboration. The LHC collides beam (nominally) at 40MHz (currently its running at 20MHz).  Each detector at the LHC temporarily stores these results from the collisions (that are measured in detectors) on custom hardware.   The raw event sizes are in the ballpark of  few megabytes.   The data is then analyzed by custom hardware and software to determine whether the collision events are sufficiently interesting to be recorded permanently to tape.  This process is known as triggering.  The triggering happens at several stages known as trigger levels.  CMS has two trigger levels and ATLAS has three trigger levels.   The final triggering level results in an output stream of events of 100 to 200 Hz. The LHC runs on average for 10million seconds per year and therefore records around 1 billion events per year each resulting in each detector recording a few petabyte of data per year permanently. After the events are stored, several steps of data processing occur in the hours to days after the data is recorded.  This is known as reconstruction, where particles are identified in the raw data.   The reprocessed data is what is typically analyzed on a day-to-day level by the experimentalists.
