★What data sources allow access to hospital data? Infection rates, readmission rates, etc?This article mentions these things should be avaliable.  http://professional.wsj.com/arti... However I can't find them anywhere.
I am not sure what sources WSJ article mentions, but U.S. Government hosts a tool called "Hospital Compare" which is part of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Quality Initiative (Medicare Hospital Compare Quality of Care). Data used by this tool is downloadable - this data (provided by the hospitals) is in public domain. Quality measures that the tool gives you access to include: Timely and Effective Care (Process of Care Measures) Heart Attack (Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)) Heart Failure Pneumonia Surgery (Surgical Care Improvement Project) Emergency Department Care Preventive Care Children's Asthma Care Readmissions, Complications, and Deaths (Outcome of Care Measures) 30-day death (mortality) rates and 30-day readmission rates Serious complications - AHRQ Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) Hospital-acquired conditions Healthcare-associated infections Use of Medical Imaging (Outpatient Imaging Efficiency Measures) Survey of Patients' Hospital Experiences (HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems)) Number of Medicare patients Spending per hospital patient with Medicare You can download the source data starting from this webpage: Downloading the data. Ryan Panchadsaram is one of the people behind the initiative to provide an easy access to government databases (including but not limited to healthcare) - see Introducing Alpha.Data.gov for some details.
