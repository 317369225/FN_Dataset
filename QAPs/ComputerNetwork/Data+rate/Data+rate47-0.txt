★What are good sources of historical exchange rate data?
The answer depends on what the data will be used for. You might be able to obtain daily high lows for a particular currency pair from a number for websites, just do a google search, but if you need high frequency data, such as tick by tick, one min, five mins reuters xtra or bloomberg terminals bloomberg terminal would be your best bet.  These are generally the tools that we refer to for analysis while trading. If you can add specifics such as the currency pair, the type of data, and dates for which you want the data, I might be able to help.
