★Econometrics: When doing a regression on macroeconomic data, do you regress the underlying data or the rate of change? How do you choose?
One thing to think about is stationarity. If you regress a nonstationary series on another, you are likely to  obtain spurious results. In this case you should take first differences of the independent variable. You can see this by generating two random nonstationary series (e.g. using cumsum(arima.sim(n=1000, model=list())) in R) and regressing one on the other. You are likely to find a strong relationship which is, of course, meaningless. In this case, there is nothing wrong with the residuals at first sight, but they turn out to be autocorrelated. There is an exception if both series are co-integrated, as in the GDP vs. equity returns example discussed before. In this case, however, the asymptotic distributions of the OLS estimators are no longer normal and you will need an error correction model for inference.
