â˜…Econometrics: When doing a regression on macroeconomic data, do you regress the underlying data or the rate of change? How do you choose?
Yes it does depend on the context. GDP growth is usually expressed as real rate of change, as we don't care about stock or nominal levels. It is usually more important what form the dependent variable has as this determines how you estimate the model. For the independent variables you can play around with different forms and chose the ones that maximise the fit. There is 2 schools on this: macro-econometricians will derive every form of a variable through theory, whereas statisticians will usually use what fits the model best. Keep in mind that technically the rate of changes 'integrates' the variable as if there was a unit root. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uni...
