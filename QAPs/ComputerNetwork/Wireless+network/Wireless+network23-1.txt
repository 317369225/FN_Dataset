★How can I speed up my home wireless network?
Usually Home networks are not so fast due to the interfering frequency band's which are already used by some other AP, Routers around you. Try to use some networking tool which scans your surrounding and shows you all the other router's and their bands. Try to choose the frequency band which is used by minimum or no one around you so that their packets wont interfere with your packets and vice versa. For more info about bands see this List of WLAN channels Limit the devices connecting to your router to minimum. It will reduce the contention between them.    Embed Quote
