★What's the best way to extend the range of a wireless network?
1) Get a wifi analyzer (for your smart phone) and make sure you are using a radio channel that has low noise.  Out of the box, most of the APs are on channel 6.  If you and all your neighbors are using 6, you get poor coverage because of the noise.  Moving it to channel 3 or 10 might cut the noise level in half.  You should only need to make the change on the AP ... the client devices will figure it out. 2) Buy a higher gain isotropic antenna from Amazon.  This will improve the transmission / reception and is a really cheap fix.    Embed Quote
