★How can you alleviate interference problems on 802.11 wireless networks?Any good tips?  It gets to be a problem with lots of companies in an office building, each with one or two networks.  Would 802.11n be more robust than 802.11g?
Yes 802.11n is more robust than 802.11g - many of the features of 802.11n will avoid some types of interference brought on by legacy 802.11a/b/g implementations. The best way to alleviate interference problems is to get yourself a spectrum analyzer.  AirView (starting at $49) Wi-Spy (starting at $99) AirMedic (starting at $999) What the other responses have linked to will only show Wi-Fi devices - which do not take into account non-wifi sources of interference which can be anything from microwaves, cordless phones, bluetooth, baby monitors and wireless video cameras.  They can't show adjacent channel interference.  These tools will only show you that you have interference occurring and provide no way of alleviating a non-wi-fi interference.  They also don't take into account that Wi-Fi channels overlap.  It isn't just Wi-Fi on the same channel, but the neighboring channels that you need to avoid as well. Some good tips include: Moving Wi-Fi routers (and clients) to 5 GHz 802.11a/n. Try to only use channels 1, 6 and 11 in the 2.4GHz band. Try to avoid having to APs on Channel 6 next to each other.  Alternate. Use inSSIDer to avoid overlapping channels. Get a spectrum analyzer for larger mission-critical wlan implementations. Perform a site survey to map the signal strength coverage.  The only two options to Wi-Fi interference are avoidance and elimination.  A spectrum analyzer will help you track down a device to eliminate and show you which channels to avoid.  Wi-Fi software will tell you which channels are being used but do little in terms of actual interference.    Embed Quote
