★What is the best value wireless network extender?I am looking for a good range, but for a reasonable price. It would also be good if it was "plug'n'play".
Our site, IT Central Station, is a crowdsourced platform for real user reviews. Recently a reviewer wrote about HP Wireless and why it has helped his wireless networking: "The HP 3800 switches not only have the flexibility of a stackable form factor, they have 10 Gb expandability to support bandwidth-intensive applications, providing investment protection for future needs. The flexibility we have is a huge benefit. We now have a system that can cope with future demands and can create new systems demanded by the users. It is much more flexible when you have to add more equipment: we no longer have to pull new cables because they are already installed in the racks. You just have to add the new equipment, put the network connections into the network switches and it just runs the way it should."
