★What is the evil twin method in wireless networking?
Let me explain you evil twin with an example: Consider you have a router at your home with its WiFi name "Tick" Consider a hacker who wants to hack into mobile phones, accounts, computer, etc using Phishing. Now this hacker will create a WiFi signal using hotspot with the same name as that of your router ("Tick") This new WiFi is called evil twin and it has stronger WiFi signals than your router. Mobile phones and laptop use a strong signal to connect than a weak one. This causes your gadgets to get connected to new "Tick" aka evil twin. This hotspot will send you phished websites, log into your communication history, etc. Using WPS, evil twin can be prevented. (Citation needed)    Embed Quote
