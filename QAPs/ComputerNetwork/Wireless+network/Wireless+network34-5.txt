★Is pCell, from Artemis, really "the Holy Grail of wireless networking"?
It's not %100 clear that something new is being demonstrated in Artemis' videos. Here's an article that goes into detail on how to calculate the maximum data rates for LTE: LTE Peak Capacity Explained: How to Calculate it? In 5MHz of spectrum we should expect a maximum downlink of 36.7Mbps with 2x2 MIMO or 18.3Mbps SISO (single antenna).  This would be in absolutely ideal conditions of course (FDD, QAM64, no errors - really only in a laboratory) and does not include IP overhead. Now what seems to be key is how do we compare this pCell to LTE 2x2 MIMO?   They claim what they are doing is not MIMO so should we compare against the SISO capacity of 18.3Mbps?  In which case this would be a significant improvement in capacity.  However, there are several base stations (at least) involved in this demo so surely the correct comparison is against the 2x2 MIMO figure?  In that case not even the entire 5MHz capacity is being used in the demonstration (the one with 8 iphones running HD video content). Edit:  Steve Perlman stated elsewhere that stacking the iPhones in the way that he does in the demonstration would result in so little spatial diversity that MIMO gains would become ineffective - can anyone comment on the truth of this?    Embed Quote
