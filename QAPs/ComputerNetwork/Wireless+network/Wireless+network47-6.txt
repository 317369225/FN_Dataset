★If I poach wireless from an open wireless network, am I probably going to "get hacked"? Should I never do that?
If you use a lot of open connections, you should probably at least use a personal VPn service at least to encrypt the connection on your computer. OverplayVPn (https://www.flashrouters.com/ove...) is a very good provider of personal VPn service for users. Although you do have to be wary of honeypots like Pineapple Routers which broadcast open signals just so they can hack into your devices. I read up on this at: https://www.flashrouters.com/blo... Free Internet is nice, just be smart and careful if you have highly sensitive data on your computer.    Embed Quote
