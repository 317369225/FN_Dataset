★Why is wireless network connectivity inherently slower than a landline internet connection?Is the answer higher chances of packet loss? Hence the justification for PowerLine network adapters, and other similar technology.
Two big reasons: 1. Wireless is typically a broadcast domain with multiple wireless clients using the single wireless spectrum to transmit data. This leads to collisions, packet loss, and retransmissions, which all lead to lower throughput. Wired on the other hand is nowadays a point-to-point connection between your system and a switch. The medium is not shared and hence there is no packet loss. 2. Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Pathloss affects wireless signals on the physical level causing errors in the packets as they are re-constructed at the receivers. This again leads to packet drops and retransmissions.    Embed Quote
