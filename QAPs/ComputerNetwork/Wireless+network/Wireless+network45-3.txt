★What is the best way to diagnose packet loss in a wireless network?
Since anonymous states to know some basical troubleshooting tools like ping and traceroute and we are only restricted to the wireless layer: I alway try to stress the link to see where it start loosing packets. To acomplish this I use ping in flood mode (requires Linux, I think you can't do it without it). Connected to your wireless network with a Linux running box issue as root: ping -f your_AP_IP_number You'll get a point printed in the screen for every packet sent. The same point will be deleted by a back-space for every packet received, so it goes pretty graphical. Also, you can stress test it even more by increasing packet size like this: ping -f -s 15000 IP_address Poke with that 15000 until it breaks. If you have some sort of wireless traffic monitoring somewhere, you will see the amount of traffic it generates. Cheers!    Embed Quote
