★What are the best blogs about wireless network?
Not really a blog but http://nostringsattachedshow.com is a regular podcast with news about wireless technology from many vendors... I'm pretty sure those who put this together met via the Wireless Tech Field days originally started by Stephen Foskett As the about page says, Well the No Strings Attached Show, NSA Show for short, is brought to you by some of the brightest and best Wireless engineers from various walks of life. We have a wireless CCIE, a CWNE, and a handful of other certifications. Each of us brings a different view on the products that we use on a daily basis to provide Wireless networking to the masses, this will hopefully lead to some interesting discussions on the podcasts!    Embed Quote
