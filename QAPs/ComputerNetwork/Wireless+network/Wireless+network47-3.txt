★If I poach wireless from an open wireless network, am I probably going to "get hacked"? Should I never do that?
A common and simple means of people harvesting sensitive passwords is to setup rouge APs with default names like "linksys" with no security to draw people into connecting to them.  Then you go to what you think is a legit banking site of other and your information is captured.  Even people with legit APs are at risk: http://webcache.googleuserconten... So depending on where you are connecting it would be at your own risk.  You are most likely not going to get hacked but if probability caught up with you it sure would suck.  More on general risks: http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmatet...    Embed Quote
