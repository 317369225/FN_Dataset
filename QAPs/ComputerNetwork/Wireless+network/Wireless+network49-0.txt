★What's the best way to determine if unauthorized users are connected to your home wireless network?Assuming you've already setup the normal security best practices, but someone manages to crack your password, what would be the best way to monitor and be alerted of this scenario?
Apart from the usual network hackery, sniffing, etc, most Wi-Fi routers have a DHCP tab on their web interface, which lists DHCP leases of all clients that were recently connected to the network. This usually includes MAC and IP addresses and occasionally host names. It's not much in the way of monitoring, but it's a quick, easy, relatively low tech solution.    Embed Quote
