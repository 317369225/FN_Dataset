★What's the best way to determine if unauthorized users are connected to your home wireless network?Assuming you've already setup the normal security best practices, but someone manages to crack your password, what would be the best way to monitor and be alerted of this scenario?
Here's one method I thought of - All devices connected to the network occasionally send an ARP broadcast packet to other devices in the network to figure out their MAC addresses. This packet is received by every other device on the network. So if you open up Wireshark, and run it for a while, and filter it to only view ARP requests, you'll see a list of devices which are in the network, with their MAC and IP addresses.    Embed Quote
