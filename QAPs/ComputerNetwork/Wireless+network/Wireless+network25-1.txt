★How do I set up a wireless network for conference on a budget?
One idea is with customer-premise equipment (CPE) that is small and portable enough to be setup and taken down as needed.  Given that wireless connectivity works differently depending on the environment (buildings, plants, hills, etc), you should look for something that has a few different setup options.  There's an article about CPE units here: Customer-Premises Equipment for Wireless Networks  It doesn't say in the newsletter, but the cheaper of the two (the 2.4 GHz model) is less than $70.  Those are both able to be set up and taken down quickly, can be PoE powered, and also have multiple "modes" to allow different functions in a wireless network. You may need more than one, however, to fill the area depending, again, on the size, shape, obstructions, etc.  Although it's not an exact match to your application, this infographic shows a CPE in use in a warehouse as an example.  Warehouse Wireless Network    Embed Quote
