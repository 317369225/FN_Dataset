★What are the greatest technical challenges for wireless networks in the next 10 to 15 years?
Two things I can think of, one is directly related to the core wi-fi and other to the networks: 1. As the number of wireless devices (within each home for instance) increase, the spectrum gets more and more crowded and devices will find it difficult to continue to deliver higher and higher throughput. At the same time, the demands for bandwidth over such wireless connections will only increase with the number various video and cloud based applications increasing. All this will require some very difficult problems to be solved in channel utilization, interference mitigation techniques etc. 2. Increase in the number of wireless devices in the workplace as well as in consumer homes, will create a nightmare for network managers (esp considering that many of these devices will appear and disappear and will never be formally approved by the network managers (eg. BYOD)). To address this problem, new and innovative techniques for remote network device management will have to be developed.    Embed Quote
