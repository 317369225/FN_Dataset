★Is it possible to get a wireless network to perform as fast and stable as a cable connected network?Here at our small business we keep struggling to set up our wireless network to perform stable and fast. We have about 30 desktops/laptops, and about the same number of mobile devices such as iphones and tablet pcs. Is it possible to set up a great wi-fi network with a bunch of Cisco Small Business Gigabit N Routers?
You should go for enterprise wifi products which will provide the stability you are looking for but not the speed of a wired network. These are the times for all enterprise wireless networks with more and more companies going for it and lots of competition in the wifi market. You should look for Meru or Ruckus.    Embed Quote
