★Is wireless network security a boring area?
It depends who you talk to. I personally find anything in networking to be exciting. Whether it be wireless, wired, SDN - it's all good. We're going to see a lot of great advances in networking over the next few years. The new wireless 802.11AC is going to change things greatly. But it also opens the network to greater attacks because it's faster so more attacks can happen per unit of time. Coupled with more complex applications, the security field is wide open. But SDN is the game changer for things. You'll be able to do so many things that you can't do now. It's a great time to be in networking. Others' eyes glaze over when I start to talk about anything like that. If your eyes just glazed over then you may probably find wireless network security boring.    Embed Quote
