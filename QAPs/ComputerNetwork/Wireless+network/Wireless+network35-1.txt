★Can wireless network administrators view my Terminal (Mac app) activity?The hostname changes when I am connected to a wireless network. Does this mean administrators could potentially see my terminal activity?
No. Macs can get hostnames through reverse DNS and it depends on whether or not the DNS server is also caching hostnames with the IP addresses it hands out. edit: here is a good link that explains a bit more: http://superuser.com/questions/7...    Embed Quote
