★How realistic is the idea of building a national public wireless network?Funded by taxpayer money & creating new jobs, seems like a win-win, could this be a realistic endeavor?
This is completely do-able if you take away control from the broadcasters association. The amount of one-way traffic that Judge Judy and Days of Our Lives gum up is unbearable. A very small percent of people still get their television over-the-air, but this "dead air" still sucks up a huge chunk of the good spectrum. This is even after air transmission went digital and each broadcaster effectively got 3 times as many channels (that could fit in the same 6mhz per channel.) We shouldn't let broadcast regulation from 1930 dictate how we use the spectrum today. Take what belongs to the public, establish a channel of news and information, and auction the rest. Add a stipulation that it must be xx% used or defaults to re-auction.    Embed Quote
