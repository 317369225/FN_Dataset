★Is it possible to get a wireless network to perform as fast and stable as a cable connected network?Here at our small business we keep struggling to set up our wireless network to perform stable and fast. We have about 30 desktops/laptops, and about the same number of mobile devices such as iphones and tablet pcs. Is it possible to set up a great wi-fi network with a bunch of Cisco Small Business Gigabit N Routers?
Speed? No, you can't match wired speeds today and likely won't be able to for some time. Wireless is a shared medium which means that AP's have to wait for a clear channel before they can broadcast. That right there diminishes throughput to roughly have of the rating.  802.11n [1] may theoretically be able to reach 300 Mbps or even 600 Mbps, but you won't ever see more than 100Mbps on a *good* day. Add in the fact that WLAN's are at least an order of magnitude slower than wired, and you won't get close. Stability? Yes, but a lot depends on the type of access point you have, how far away your nodes are from the AP, the types of nodes connecting, and any interference. If all goes well, WLAN is quite stable. I typically recommend using both. Use wired where you can run them and in particular where you will have semi-stationary locations like desks and kiosks. Wired networking is going to be faster and more reliable over all and use wireless for your mobile devices. [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEE...    Embed Quote
