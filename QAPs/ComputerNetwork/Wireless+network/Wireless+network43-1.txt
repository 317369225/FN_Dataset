★Is it possible to make a private wireless network that has its own "internet"?A small scale internet service that I can send and receive data with to hardware devices I set up in my home without being connected to the actual internet.
Sure. Ingredients: Servers (In the software sense) most likely http, but it does not matter. A way of identifying the servers so that you can connect to them which is most likely IP address Clients Optional: DNS root and caching servers Even more optional: Time servers, Certificate servers Can't think of anything else that is needed. Sure you could have routers and firewalls and switches and proxy servers but all of this assumes that you are using IP.    Embed Quote
