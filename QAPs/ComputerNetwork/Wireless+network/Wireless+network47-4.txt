★If I poach wireless from an open wireless network, am I probably going to "get hacked"? Should I never do that?
It depends on your definition of "hacked." When on an untrusted network, it is easy for someone to eavesdrop onto unencrypted connections. To put it more simply, when you are viewing web pages without https:// at the beginning, they'd be able to see what webpages you are going to, and information you are submitting. It is for this reason that most webpages with login screens use TLS/SSL encryption (https://) for those login screens. For websites that do not encrypt the login screens, and specifically do not encrypt the submit method for the password field, that info would be sent in the clear, and you could theoretically have your password stolen. If they try to eavesdrop on encrypted connections, they may be able to see the destination of the information, but they won't be able to see the information itself. It will appear as gibberish. Things get more interesting if they try to manipulate the connections, and not simply eavesdrop. They can attempt a Man In The Middle attack, to act as the server to you, and act as a client to the server you are trying to connect to. This would allow them to view encrypted information. This is only possible if you allow it, by clicking through messages like the one below: Also when on an untrusted network, an attacker is in a good position to try to find a remote exploit in your computer, since they can find some information about the software you are using, and are able to manipulate the data. This is the primary reason you would not want to connect to the DEFCON network, for example. All of these actions require a malicious person to want to perform them. The average unsecured wifi will not have this threat.    Embed Quote
