★Why does my Moto G (second generation) connect to my wireless network, but say there is no connectivity?
You mentioned that since updating your device you had to face Wi-Fi problems. I reckon that this might be due to some update error. Something went wrong and your Wi-Fi started malfunctioning. If resetting your device doesn't help then you might want to try and install the Stock OS that was pre-installed on your device when you bought it. You can find the steps to it on  XDA-Developers Android Forums or else just Google it. After doing this, if you still face the same problem, then this might be an issue with your hardware. You might want to check that. Hope this helps!:)    Embed Quote
