★Why is wireless network connectivity inherently slower than a landline internet connection?Is the answer higher chances of packet loss? Hence the justification for PowerLine network adapters, and other similar technology.
Inherently - because copper is a better conductor than air so it is easier for a better signal (better SNR=more data). Also because wireless "spreads" more than a wire (point to point) so you share the signal with others, and each user only gets a portion (of course, that ideal for broadcast like TV, radio).. Finally there is more bandwidth (bigger channel) and Shannon's Law says max data rate is proportional to bandwidth and SNR (#1). Packet loss is a result of these.    Embed Quote
