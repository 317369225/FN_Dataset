★How realistic is the idea of building a national public wireless network?Funded by taxpayer money & creating new jobs, seems like a win-win, could this be a realistic endeavor?
Yes, it seems like a win-win.  And in a different political environment, it would be.  In the past, large-scale infrastrucure projects have had a stimulative effect on local economies. (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoo... and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Int... for examples).   Unfortunately, today's situation is different.  Notice that I do not say worse; the econonomic situation in 1931 - when the Hoover Dam was contructed - was worse than today.  But today's electorate is too divided to prioritize infrastructure over tax cuts.   The other hurdle is that many other, older, infrastructure (ie roads and bridges) is badly in need of repair, and any funds slated for infrastructure need address those need first.   This is one of those ideas whose time will come - maybe not tommorrow, but one day.  This economic downturn won't last forever. And when it does turn around, 21st-century infrastructure goals like this will probably seem like no-brainers, and our children will scratch their heads and wonder why our generation didn't get the job done.    Embed Quote
