★Can I connect to a LAN and Wireless Network at the same time?My company has a secured network and an unsecured wireless network. The unsecured network is for people who want to stream music. Most people use a separate device, but I don't own one and have no desire to buy one. I'd like to be able to be connected to both networks simultaneously. How would I do that?
if secured network is wired, then you can connect to both networks at the same time. there might be some fancy software on your computer that deactivates wifi if your wired adapter is connected, but that is overrideable. further on you can use either the hosts file, or the route function in command prompt to resolve hosts on the network that isnt on the default gateway network    Embed Quote
