★What is the best way to diagnose packet loss in a wireless network?
Well, without details I can only give some general tips: 1.  Run a scanner like Welcome to inSSIDer 4 and make sure you aren't have good signal strength and are set to a channel that isn't crowded.  You may need to consider going to a 5 ghz AP if there are too many 2.4ghz in your area. 2.  Run a virus scan on your computers. 3.  Ping the default gateway and a public IP address like 8.8.8.8 to see if the problem is local or an Internet problem. 4.  Try other Wi-Fi devices and see if they all have the same problem, or if it is only local to a single computer/phone/etc Once you determine where the problem is, you can go ahead and try to fix it. It may involve replacing your router/AP, updating drivers on your wireless adapter, reporting packet-loss to your ISP.    Embed Quote
