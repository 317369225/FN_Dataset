★Why haven't municipal wireless networks worked?Some cities and towns have tried it, but nothing has taken off.  Is it a technology problem or something else?
It's never been a technology problem per se. The technology has been there. It comes down to vendor lobbying and politics. I have studied quite a few examples (not just in the US, but worldwide) as to why municipal wireless networks have not taken off? OEMs like Meraki and OpenMesh (See www.meraki.com and www.open-mesh.com) have made deploying grid (mesh) based municipals networks very easy. Some of the issues / hurdles are: Bandwidth Provisioning: The problems always come down to deciding who will supply bandwidth. Single carrier solutions are seen as a threat, multiple carrier solutions end up in quarrels of price disparity. When you ask how many people want a Wifi solution, hands go up! Practically - not many. Abuse probability quite high. Content Filtering Roll-out plans - which area gets it first Budget cuts Vendors lobbying for their technology Simple projects say worth $20,000 get blown out of proportion to figures like $500,000, $1+ Million, etc. ROIs are weak, a not-for-profit budget, eventually gets hammered into a commercial project Pilot roll-outs are always met with bandwidth criticism. Not enough speed. The library argument - "well Internet is free in the library, why should we spend more money" Optimism turns to pessimism once more parties are involved. Lots of in-fighting between groups. NIMBY - for some reason, many don't want to provide power and antennas without being adequately compensated, and the compensation figures asked, basically means, you pay utility rent, real-estate rental and pay for my internet bill also.
