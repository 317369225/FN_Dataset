★What's the best way to extend the range of a wireless network?
Knock down all the walls in your house and move your family into tents in the garden. I found all solid objects, including people, really affect the range. When I did this, my surfing speeds went way up and my fantasy football team got 3rd place in the league, My best ever result! But, its hard to keep warm at night and my clothes can get wet. Also I dont think my landlord will see the same benefits that I did, so its not all upside.    Embed Quote
