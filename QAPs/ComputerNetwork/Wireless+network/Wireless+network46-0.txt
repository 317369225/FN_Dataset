★Why does my Moto G (second generation) connect to my wireless network, but say there is no connectivity?
I can only suggest you to goto to service centre if available. else better option is to root your mobile and enjoy. Even though rooting voids mobile warranty, I don't see better option here. and without customer support what's the use of keeping mobile in warranty. For more information about rooting please head over to XDA developers site. hope it helps. Thanks for A2A.    Embed Quote
