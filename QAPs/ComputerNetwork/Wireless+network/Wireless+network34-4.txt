★Is pCell, from Artemis, really "the Holy Grail of wireless networking"?
No - at least not based on the information/demo so far.  What is being demoed seems entirely within the capabilities of existing LTE technology. Demo 1 shows a total throughput of 60 Mbps with 4 HD videos at 7.5 Mbps each, and 2 4K videos at 15 Mbps each. For a 10 MHz LTE system, the peak single cell throughput is about 100 Mbps (with 4 antennas at least for the base station). So, demo 1 is showing the system achieving about 60% of single cell capacity. Demo 2 shows a total throughput of about 20 Mbps with 8 iphones playing HD videos (at ~ 2.5 Mbps). Comparing that to a 5 MHz LTE system, the peak single cell throughput is about 50 Mbps (with 4 antennas at least for the base station) . So, demo 2 is showing the system achieving about 40% of single cell capacity. Admittedly, achieving close to advertised peak throughput of a cellular system itself is an achievement, but not impossible in a carefully orchestrated demo.
