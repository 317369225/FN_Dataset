★What's the best way to extend the range of a wireless network?
Depends on your requirements (doesn't it always?): The free option is to continue trying different configurations of range extender and access point. Also see Are there easy ways to enhance my WiFi signal? The cheapest not-free option that requires the most time might be to build yourself a directional antenna. (For more directionality, search for "pringles cantenna", for less try "parabolic cookware antenna"). The more expensive option is to buy another WRT54G and set up WDS. This is akin to using the range extender, but with more smarts. Unfortunately, this will probably halve your throughput when connected to the "repeating" router. (This may not be a big deal; half throughput may still be faster than your internet connection.)    Embed Quote
