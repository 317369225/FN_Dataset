★If I poach wireless from an open wireless network, am I probably going to "get hacked"? Should I never do that?
You are not "probably going to get hacked." If the open network is someone's personal network, it likely has a limited number of users anyway. Using an open network at a coffee shop is more dangerous because of the awareness others have of its existence, and the variety of users that come and go. If you don't want to get hacked, then (a) make sure you're running the firewall service on your PC or Mac and (b) if you're on a PC, spend some money on Norton or other protective software [or just throw it out and get a Mac].    Embed Quote
