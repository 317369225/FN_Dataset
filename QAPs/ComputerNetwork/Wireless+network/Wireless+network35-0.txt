★Can wireless network administrators view my Terminal (Mac app) activity?The hostname changes when I am connected to a wireless network. Does this mean administrators could potentially see my terminal activity?
By itself, no.  The hostname changes because DHCP (the utility that provides an IP address) also provides you with a new hostname. This is probably being presented to you as part of your Terminal prompt. Of course, if your system has been compromised, anything is possible.    Embed Quote
