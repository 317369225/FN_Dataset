★How can I learn wireless networking for free?And most specifically about mesh networks, sites like Coursera or Khan Academy - couldn't find a suitable one yet
I'd highly recommend studying the Certified Wireless Networking Professional [ Home ]certifications. They are not free. However, they are industry agnostic. This means the knowledge you learn within this training applies equally to all vendors. Once you have learnt the basics, then look towards the vendor that provides the technology you want to run and support. It could be Cisco, HP, Aruba, Ruckus, Aerohive, amongst many others. Once you (or your boss) has decided what technology you want to run, then hop over to there website and find all the free whitepapers and manuals about how there technology works. These vendors probably offer training courses as well. They may be free, or they may be paid for. Find out whats covered during the training and do it.    Embed Quote
