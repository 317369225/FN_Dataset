★Is it possible to make a private wireless network that has its own "internet"?A small scale internet service that I can send and receive data with to hardware devices I set up in my home without being connected to the actual internet.
Here is what i would suggest: Take an old computer and install Centos on it & choose a Static IP for it, let's say 192.168.0.2 Install or check that bind (/named) on your centos Turn your centos into a web server. Configure named Create DNS zone in named to map your internet domain name that you create to your web server IP for Itisaniceday.mynewextension A 192.168.0.2 In your client (PC, Mac) use the DNS server IP of your centos server (192.168.0.2 (considering your computer IP is on 192.168.0.XXX). When you want to come back to the real internet remove this DNS.    Embed Quote
