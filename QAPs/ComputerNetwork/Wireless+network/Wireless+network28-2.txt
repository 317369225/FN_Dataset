★How can you alleviate interference problems on 802.11 wireless networks?Any good tips?  It gets to be a problem with lots of companies in an office building, each with one or two networks.  Would 802.11n be more robust than 802.11g?
In general, planning the layout of access points (APs) for the entire floor or office is a good idea. that way you can make sure adjacent APs(on the same & different floors)  don't interfere. If you are adding  a new AP and that is causing a problem, I have seen some people use directional antennas. Detecting coverage: You do have to walk around with a wifi device/laptop to look for holes in coverage or interference, because coverage is affected by concrete, steel, water in the construction. If you already have a 802.11g setup, adding a 802.11n will probly cause some interference. Not sure how much more robust 11n is on its own network.     Embed Quote
