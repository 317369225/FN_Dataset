★How is HTTP2 going to affect mobile devices UX when connected on a wireless network?
tl;dr It makes use of compression in headers and also it is a binary protocol which is very efficient to parse as compared to text one. Also, it is multiplexed. Detailed one: Why do we need header compression? Patrick McManus from Mozilla showed this vividly by calculating the effect of headers for an average page load. If you assume that a page has about 80 assets (which is conservative in today’s Web), and each request has 1400 bytes of headers (again, not uncommon, thanks to Cookies, Referer, etc.), it takes at least 7-8 round trips to get the headers out “on the wire.” That’s not counting response time - that’s just to get them out of the client. This is because of TCP’s Slow Start mechanism, which paces packets out on new connections based on how many packets have been acknowledged – effectively limiting the number of packets that can be sent for the first few round trips. In comparison, even mild compression on headers allows those requests to get onto the wire within one roundtrip – perhaps even one packet. This overhead is considerable, especially when you consider the impact upon mobile clients, which typically see round-trip latency of several hundred milliseconds, even under good conditions.
