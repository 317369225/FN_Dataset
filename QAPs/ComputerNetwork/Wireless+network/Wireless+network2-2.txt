★What will be the underlying technologies in 5G wireless networks?
Adding to Zahid Ghadialy's answer. As he rightly mentioned "technologies that are being discussed". However, that implies the technologies may or may not be the building block of 5G but are just under consideration and topics of research. For example, there are some research and theories that already suggest FBMC does not complement the Mass-MIMO in entirety, and thus has been fading out of consideration lately. As, 5G is more seen as LTE-evolution it seems to be more likely that it will be built upon LTE technologies rather than replacing it completely, which makes MIMO, esp. Mass-MIMO one of the core technologies that are being studied. To me what seems to be more interesting is to understand the idea, motivation and driving forces behind 5G technology and innovation. On a higher level this is what I feel the technologies that will dominate the 5G research for the time being. # Spectrum access and efficiency   - Massive MIMO and Massive Beam Forming   - Centimeter-Wave and Milimeter-Wave   - New Waveforms and Modulations # Deployment   - Multi-RAT integration   - Radio Virtualization   - Ultra-High Speed Additionally you may also look into my answer to another related question: Rupesh Agarwal's answer to Which is the next major upcoming technology in mobile telecommunication after 4G?    Embed Quote
