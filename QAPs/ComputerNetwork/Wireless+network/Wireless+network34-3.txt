★Is pCell, from Artemis, really "the Holy Grail of wireless networking"?
They're using 5G techniques (known as "network MIMO" or "cooperative MIMO" in the literature) to to create independent channels for each user through beamforming.  They're the first ones to demonstrate it working in practice on ordinary cell phones, probably at least 5 years before the rest of the industry.  I wrote a detailed explanation about how it works (and how it could be a game-changer for more than just communication) in my blog post here: How Steve Perlman's "Revolutionary" Wireless Technology Works - and Why its a Bigger Deal than Anyone Realizes    Embed Quote
