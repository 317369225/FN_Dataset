★Why is wireless network connectivity inherently slower than a landline internet connection?Is the answer higher chances of packet loss? Hence the justification for PowerLine network adapters, and other similar technology.
The single big difference between a wireless connection and a wired connection is the medium. With a wired connection (copper, fiber, etc.) you have a medium whose characteristics stay almost the same from installation to eternity. So it is not so difficult to design and maintain a communication scheme that would give the best performance for that medium. With a wireless connection as in a terrestrial cellular connection or a WiFi connection, the medium is the environment around the devices that keeps changing constantly. Once the signal leaves your device it's going to get reflected, attenuated, delayed, blocked and what not, before it reaches the intended receiver. And the worst part is that you can never perfectly keep tracking these changes in the environment. That means you have to rely on a statistical model of the environment or channel, and statistically your chances of seeing a bad channel are much higher in a wireless scenario compared to a wired one, where it stays the same. In other words, a wireless channel is inherently more error prone than a wired channel and your communication scheme must take that into account. Usually this means that your system is not as robust as a wired system, although sometimes the variations in the channel can be used to your advantage as well. But then why use wireless at all? Because it's convenient (no messy cables, no digging up roads), it is cheap (no expensive copper or fiber) and it is getting better everyday!    Embed Quote
