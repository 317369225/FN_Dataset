★If I poach wireless from an open wireless network, am I probably going to "get hacked"? Should I never do that?
As several others have mentioned: context matters. Besides DEFCON, where you ought to know better, there's also "vacation hacking" (reported by Fox, salt as appropriate), where ne'er-do-wells make fake APs or sniff traffic looking for interesting things. I sometimes share internet from my phone to my laptop on a wireless network called "ireadyouremail" just to give people pause. As for mitigating the problem: It's unlikely that your laptop will itself be compromised if you just leave it turned on and connected. The danger comes from man-in-the-middle attacks (it looks like your bank, but isn't), and other sorts of redirection (attaching malware to every website you visit). Also, avoid using passwords over insecure protocols: check your IM, twitter, and mail clients, music scrobbler, etc. to make sure they're encrypting your passwords at least, and avoid giving passwords to websites not using the "https://" protocol/prefix while on an open network.    Embed Quote
