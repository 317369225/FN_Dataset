★Is pCell, from Artemis, really "the Holy Grail of wireless networking"?
Color me skeptical. Others have commented on the radio effects. Let me point to the wired side of the equation. Even if the radios are perfect, they have to be tied into wired bandwidth somewhere. And that wired bandwidth has to have the aggregate capacity of all of the subscribers using those radios. And that aggregate capacity is difficult to deploy in cities and is expensive. More so when it isn't being used. To make a business that lives up to these claims, they have to vastly over-provision, as compared to existing networks, and thus they would have to charge drastically more than what people are paying now. I'm out, and I'm betting that most other folks are a bit too price sensitive too.    Embed Quote
