★Is it possible to make a private wireless network that has its own "internet"?A small scale internet service that I can send and receive data with to hardware devices I set up in my home without being connected to the actual internet.
It is. If you have LAN connection to access internet on your laptop, you can share it over Wi-Fi with multiple users. Now, how to do it depends on which OS you are using. I would recommend google "LAN to Wi-Fi" specifying your particular OS.    Embed Quote
