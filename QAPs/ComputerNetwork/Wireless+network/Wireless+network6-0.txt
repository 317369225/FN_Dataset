★Which country has the best wireless networks?
Japan or Korea In both countries it is almost unheard of to get a blackspot or for coverage to drop. Both countries have ubiquitous 3G service (HSPA+ = 3.5G)  or '4G' if you use the US cell co definition!) and both are deploying LTE very aggressively. Even in areas without LTE the 3G networks are denser and faster than anything available in USA. Indeed, my colleague recently said 3G in Seoul was considerably faster than AT&T LTE in Southern CA.    Embed Quote
