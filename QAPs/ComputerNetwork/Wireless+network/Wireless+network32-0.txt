★What is the difference between Bluetooth and other wireless networks?
Generally speaking, Bluetooth is used to establish a relationship between two devices (though each device can maintain more than one of these relationships - but most don't) that functions as a wired connection. So a Bluetooth headset can connect via Bluetooth to a phone or other music playing device, and provide sound from the device to the listener. Unlike WiFi, Bluetooth connections usually have to be explicitly and exclusively set up between the two devices, with each device understanding and accepting the relationship (often through a dynamic passcode). Bluetooth connections are secure and deliberate and dedicated.    Embed Quote
