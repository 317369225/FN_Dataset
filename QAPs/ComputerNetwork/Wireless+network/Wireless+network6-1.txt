★Which country has the best wireless networks?
The US believe it or not, has the fastest and most widespread adoption of 4G networks in the world. Many countries are still on 2.5G networks as mobiles are just being introduced. The high cost of deploying networks and the unwillingness for consumers to pay high prices for mobile plans and devices is what is halting growth, especially in times of economic turmoil like what we are in now. Plus, how could you ask for company? Every country has different companies. You don't see Europe's Orange in the USA, Canada's Bell, or Mexico's TelCel. In the US (especially the West Coast), I'd go with Verizon or Sprint.    Embed Quote
