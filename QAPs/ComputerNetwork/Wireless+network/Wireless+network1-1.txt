★What's the best way to extend the range of a wireless network?
My personal experience with WiFi range extenders has been poor.  The problem was that I couldn't tell when they were working or not, and if they worked they didn't work very well.  I have had much better luck connecting a wireless bridge back-to-back with an access point.  With this setup, I can tell if it's working because I can access each device separately over the network as each has it's own IP address.  Another advantage is that where it is desirable the wireless bridge and the access point can be connected by a long cable.   From what you say, your parents' situation may resemble mine, so I'll describe it in some detail.  My router is on the second floor at one end of the house directly above the (unfinished) basement stairwell.  The basement is small, and most of the house is over a crawl space.  I have a wireless bridge in the basement stairwell about eight feet below the router.  It is connected by a long Ethernet cable to an access point that is mounted on a floor joist in the crawl space at the other end of the house.  The access point is a POE (power over Ethernet) device, that can receive power via the Ethernet cable.  Its power supply is in the basement stairwell and connects to a POE injector there.  This setup has been completely satisfactory.  Many, if not most, inexpensive routers can easily be configured as access points or wireless bridges.  FWIW, my router is 802.11n, but I needed to do what I did to get a good signal all over the house. Added:  You probably can configure the Linksys range extender as an access point or wireless bridge.  Also, you need to use a different channel from the router and from any other access point for each access point.    Embed Quote
