★Is it possible to get a wireless network to perform as fast and stable as a cable connected network?Here at our small business we keep struggling to set up our wireless network to perform stable and fast. We have about 30 desktops/laptops, and about the same number of mobile devices such as iphones and tablet pcs. Is it possible to set up a great wi-fi network with a bunch of Cisco Small Business Gigabit N Routers?
You might also want to upgrade your Wireless AP/Router to an enterprise one, one that can cater to more connection handling, etc. Ubiquity Networks, Meraki, Ruckus Wireless, etc. are all good choices. Do remember, wireless networks work in half-duplex, i.e. they cannot transmit and receive at the same time (which obviously your wired networks can do). But getting 30-50 people strung up on a regular Cisco or Linkshit (aka Linksys) router will tax it much. If you can use a mesh-network, it will significantly balance the load and also provide you with backup wireless should one of your devices do down. It is always a good idea to put a hardware based router in the front if you can, and just use the APs for connectivity.
