â˜…What do clients/employers/recruiters look for in a UX portfolio in Los Angeles?What if you are just beginning and don't have any projects to show yet? Where do you start?
I think this is difficult to answer, because I have completed a lot of UX work, but have little to show for. Part because much of the work is somehow protected (for instance intranet work), part because it is difficult to point out what I have worked on. My CV portfolio is a list of all UX related projects I have attended, what I did there and a reference person they may contact. If some of the clients are interesting, well, a list of clients might be sufficient. UX professionals often need to be allrounders and have different skills. People skills is necessary and hard to put on resume. The interview process is therefore very important. @@
