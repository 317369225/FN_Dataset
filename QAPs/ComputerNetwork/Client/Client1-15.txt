â˜…HTML5: What are the most important client-side (HTML5/CSS/JavaScript) libraries and why?I defer to the quora community to define "important" through the use of upvotes, as that's largely inevitable anyways.
"Most important" is obviously subjective, but at the highest level here's what I use: HTML5 Boilerplate - Great starting point, includes Modernizer (typically comes with Boilerplate) - for feature-detection, so you can use progressive enhancement or graceful degradation at your leisure jQuery - Manipulating markup, monitoring events, adding interactivity Those are the core that I've used on the vast majority of my recent sites. All of the frameworks listed above definitely look interesting though, and I'm looking forward to learning more about them, and possibly integrating them into my next project!
