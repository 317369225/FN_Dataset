â˜…What do clients/employers/recruiters look for in a UX portfolio in Los Angeles?What if you are just beginning and don't have any projects to show yet? Where do you start?
UX designer is a pretty unclear role. Some companies emphasize the photoshoppy visual design side of this more than interaction and wireframes. I'm going to assume that a user experience designer's main roles are to define what a product should do, how users should interact with it and where things are on the screen. I'd want to get insight into two items: 1. How did they solve a common problem (like a user login or signup flow) This shows me how much they understand convention and lets me know if they reinvented the wheel for the sake of it. What's cool to see is when people have a different solution to a common problem that only works for their product. 2. How did they solve a hard / uncommon problem? What process did they go through to break down the problem, and what were the different deliverables they prepared. Talking through the process with the deliverables in front of you is probably the only way to get a good understanding of whether the person knew their stuff. Some things that are warning signs (to me): - Too much documentation. If it looks like the schematic to the space shuttle, they probably didn't break down the problem well enough. - Too much design If you want to click it or lick it, with very few exceptions, the fidelity is too high.
