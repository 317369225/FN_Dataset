★What do clients/employers/recruiters look for in a UX portfolio in Los Angeles?What if you are just beginning and don't have any projects to show yet? Where do you start?
Recruiters and clients don't know what they are looking at when they look at a portfolio. Hiring Managers do if they have a design background. Here's what seems to be work: Two or three big stories describing the process of building a product A bunch of short stories describing what you did, and what the positive effect was on the product Show not just wireframes but other deliverables like personas and user journeys Photos are great for showing in-process work The stories don't have to be big properties either: I routinely use a 5 page project as one of the big stories because the site has a 12 to 14 percent conversion rate. That impresses anyone and it shows you can live within resource constraints. And you know what's really cool? If you can step them through the working product on a mobile device or tablet. When talking about your portfolio, consider your audience. Product Managers, Project Managers, and Designers all have different context and different goals, so you might have to tell the story differently with each audience. And remember that the user experience vocabulary you might be so proud of won't be relevant when speaking to certain stakeholders: but many product teams are small, and you might be the only designer interviewing. They may not know what ethnographic research means, but they will understand customer visits. Here's a link to a blog post I wrote about it... The UX Portfolio: Telling Your Story ...and Lynn Teo has an even better presentation. Lynn Teo: Portfolios Matter — Building the Portfolio to Win the Job
