â˜…Is it okay to say no to clients?
The most important thing is that you solve your client's problem. Saying "Yes" or "No" is relative. Your company exists to provide a solution to a problem. Car Washes solve the problem of dirty, smelly cars. Mobile Game Developers solve the problem of boredom and yearning for the specific creative expressions your company provides. Sometimes the client will want you to carry out a solution which will not actually solve their problem. This is when you have to take time to educate them a little more about the specifics of their problem or the solution they are fixated on. Lets say you have a customer who wants to buy a present for a friend's child. they want that present to be the novel World War Z, which they think is very popular. If you explain that the book contains mature themes and graphic violence, which the friend might not approve for their child, and then suggest a better book, this is not saying "No." Sometimes a client will want you to solve a problem your company has no expertise in, or provide a service which you do not. Taking time to help them find a more appropriate company is not saying "No." It is still a solution! Think of it as saying "No" to this specific solution, but "Yes" to the customer's specific needs. And if the client insists, you can always do what they ask, knowing that you will not be held accountable for bad results. You told them it wouldn't work, and most of the time, clients will accept that. Always try to provide the client with some kind of value, make their trip to your company in some way useful, and they will appreciate that. You might not earn any money, but you will have earned trust, which will definitely lead to money, later!
