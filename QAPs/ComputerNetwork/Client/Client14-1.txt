â˜…Is this the craziest client ever?
Well, I am not a lawyer, but.. I would probably, in this order: withhold any further delivery of the work product (and cease working on it as well.) Prepare an invoice for any outstanding charges, and remind your client of the contract that you both agreed to. Attach a copy of the contract to the invoice. Give him a hard deadline for payment, and make clear that if the deadline is missed the next letter will be from your attorney. In any event, I'd probably prepare to not be working with him in the future. He doesn't sound like the WORST client ever, but he sounds like a turd and one that is getting ready to start cashing in on the goodwill that he's managed to build with you. Don't give him the chance. Get paid, then cut him loose.
