â˜…What do clients/employers/recruiters look for in a UX portfolio in Los Angeles?What if you are just beginning and don't have any projects to show yet? Where do you start?
If I wanted to hire someone for UX work, I'd look at examples of how they solved specific problems. This could be shown through wireframes, mockups, videos, or even text. But I'd want to know that the person I'm going to hire has had an active role in improving a project in a measurable way.
