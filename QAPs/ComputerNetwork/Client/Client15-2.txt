â˜…Is it okay to say no to clients?
Of course, yes is always better. But when you have to say No, I find a better answer is Why? (Why do they need XYZ?) Walk them through your logic, trade-offs, alternatives, risks, etc. More often than not, you can counsel your client to understand limitations, and help guide them to a win win solution.
