★What do clients/employers/recruiters look for in a UX portfolio in Los Angeles?What if you are just beginning and don't have any projects to show yet? Where do you start?
There have been several great responses provided here, many of which relate to portfolio presentation. But I'd like to back up a bit in my answer. If you are working with recruiters (internal or external) they need to be able to see your work ahead of a formal portfolio review in order to determine if you are the right type of designer for their role.  What I look for is a sampling of work showcasing your skills, design style and passions along with a brief description of the project and your role in it (crucial).  Often times I run across portfolios with sample work in which it's clear the designer was part of a larger team, so what was their actual contribution? If it's not clear you may not even get invited for a presentation as Hiring Managers don't have the time to dig for that information.
