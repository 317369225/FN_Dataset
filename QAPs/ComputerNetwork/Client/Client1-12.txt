â˜…HTML5: What are the most important client-side (HTML5/CSS/JavaScript) libraries and why?I defer to the quora community to define "important" through the use of upvotes, as that's largely inevitable anyways.
Most people dabble in JQuery, few people really use it to its full capability. I'm constantly amazed how much this little library does for you, for a couple of years, I was trying to rise above JQuery and conceited enough to actually start writing my own framework, at the end, I just had to concede that JQuery does it better. You don't always need JQuery and you shouldn't allow it become a crutch, for most simple, straight-forward applications, there is simply no need to load a whole library just to style or animate a few things, there is a time and place for JQuery, but just know this, once you summon the power of JQuery, you no longer have any execuses not being able to do anything.
