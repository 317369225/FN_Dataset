★Is it okay to say no to clients?
Definitely. There are times when the client is not a good fit for you or that the request is not something that would be the best for your business. For example: 1) The client could ask you to do something that would damage your reputation with your other clients or make it harder for you to get additional clients later on. For example if most of your clients are church groups and school groups, they might not like you taking on a client that they do not want to be associated with in any way.   2) Time dedicated to some clients is more than the money you could earn elsewhere. These clients can soak up resources far in excess of the amount they pay. My wife worked for a company where one client accounted for 1/3rd of the calls to customer support. And they were only paying $120 a month for the service. If you have one of these clients, then you need to say no to them or else get them to start paying more in line with the cost they are incurring.
