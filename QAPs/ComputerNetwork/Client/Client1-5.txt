â˜…HTML5: What are the most important client-side (HTML5/CSS/JavaScript) libraries and why?I defer to the quora community to define "important" through the use of upvotes, as that's largely inevitable anyways.
If you are doing anything data-intensive on your client-side you could also find a client-side database quite useful. There are a few options including some built-in (if a tad complex - IMHO) ones: IndexedDB and WebSQL. If you want something modern and easy to use and query I would check out http://www.forerunnerdb.com Disclaimer - I wrote ForerunnerDB and it is now used in a major production project that reaches 6 million active users for a third party client.
