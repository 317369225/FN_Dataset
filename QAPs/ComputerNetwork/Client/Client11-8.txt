â˜…What do clients/employers/recruiters look for in a UX portfolio in Los Angeles?What if you are just beginning and don't have any projects to show yet? Where do you start?
I've been responsible for interviewing/evaluating experience designers for almost 4 years. The portfolio is definitely important, and I typically look for samples that represent a full design lifecycle (from insight gathering on) but they don't necessarily need to be from a single project. What's more important than the actual deliverable, however, is the articulation of the work, in particular 1) exhibiting passion 2) displaying an ability to cope with challenges. Passion is important because you have to LOVE this work to do it well; I firmly believe you can't be successful in the UX/XD field unless you live it/breath it. And, for #2, it doesn't matter how much we believe in our own work/designs or if we think it's right: how we have impact in the world is convincing others to make it happen. In interviews, I always question a piece of the portfolio to see how they react; if they provide good rationale/explanation and exude confidence, then they are likely to be a strong employee candidate.
