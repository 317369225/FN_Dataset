â˜…HTML5: What are the most important client-side (HTML5/CSS/JavaScript) libraries and why?I defer to the quora community to define "important" through the use of upvotes, as that's largely inevitable anyways.
"Important" is very objective word. If you build complex desktop-like web apps, it might be better to choose from component frameworks, like YUI, Dojo Toolkit, etc. Another option is DHTMLX, a mature JavaScript/CSS UI library: http://dhtmlx.com
