â˜…What do clients/employers/recruiters look for in a UX portfolio in Los Angeles?What if you are just beginning and don't have any projects to show yet? Where do you start?
I've been interviewing a lot of UXers lately as we continue to build out our UX team at 99designs and the key things I'm looking for in a UXer are: Research skills - have they done user research to inform and validate designs (user testing, contextually inquiry etc). I find a lot of people call themselves UX designers but don't have these skills. Passion - do they live and breathe good design. Do they have their own blog or website where they talk about it and are they active in the local scene etc. Collaboration skills - are they team players or do they think they know it all? I look for a designer that brings a team together and helps carry them forward. It doesn't have to be their idea but they can spot someone elses good idea. Outcomes focus - Do they talk about the effect their work has had with a business perspective i.e. it reduced churn, increased satisfaction etc.
