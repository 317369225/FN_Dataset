â˜…HTML5: What are the most important client-side (HTML5/CSS/JavaScript) libraries and why?I defer to the quora community to define "important" through the use of upvotes, as that's largely inevitable anyways.
Obviously jquery and of course it is most widely used DOM library ever.... I even prefer bootstrap too, which is from twitter.
