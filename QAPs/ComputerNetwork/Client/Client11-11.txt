â˜…What do clients/employers/recruiters look for in a UX portfolio in Los Angeles?What if you are just beginning and don't have any projects to show yet? Where do you start?
What I think helps clients/recruiters is seeing well-communicated examples of specific problems solved, demonstrated as brief sets of text, photos, sketches, and wireframes... whatever tells a compelling story. They need to see evidence of thinking and creativity within constraints, rather than a portfolio of wireframes. Also, something like your 'finest hour', a featured achievement that is interesting, with something to demonstrate your domain knowledge, customer benefit and user benefit.
