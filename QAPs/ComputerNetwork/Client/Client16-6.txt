â˜…What is the best Twitter client for Linux?
There're a lot of them. You can use the one that fits your needs. In adittion to those native ones, you can also try Mozilla AddOns, like Yoono or Echofon. My client of choice is Turpial, it was mentioned before by Gabriela, easy to use and simple. At last, you can try one and another untill you find the perfect fit for you, no harm done.
