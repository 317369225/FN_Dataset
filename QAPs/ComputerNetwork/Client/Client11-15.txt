★What do clients/employers/recruiters look for in a UX portfolio in Los Angeles?What if you are just beginning and don't have any projects to show yet? Where do you start?
Depends on the client, some will search for jobs you did in their same area, some will search for prestigious clients you had before so they can feel prestigious themselves if they hire you, some will look at your portfolio as if they were looking at you and some will look at your portfolio to see how you can solve issues and deal with tasks. But I think if I was to hire a UX guy, personally I would look more at him presenting his portfolio than at what is inside the portfolio  :)
