â˜…What's the best email client for Mac OS X?
I think this one depends on what you use for your email provider. I love the stock Mail app, but it's abysmal if you're a Gmail user. If you're not looking to sync contacts then Outlook 2011 is pretty great. I used MailPilot for OS X and really loved how it organizes email and allows you to treat your inbox like a to-do list. If you're not using email on a ton of other devices, I'd have to go with Mail Pilot as my favorite.
