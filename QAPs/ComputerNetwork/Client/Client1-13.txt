â˜…HTML5: What are the most important client-side (HTML5/CSS/JavaScript) libraries and why?I defer to the quora community to define "important" through the use of upvotes, as that's largely inevitable anyways.
RequireJS: An AMD implementation. Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) aims to provide the module and package managing system to client side JavaScript (Like exports and require in CommonJS). No more Global Object pollution and can request JavaScript files only when needed. More information please refer to http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.... IMOH if you want to write complex client side application, RequireJS is recommended.
