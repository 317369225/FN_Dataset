â˜…What's the best email client for Mac OS X?
there aren't any if you ask me. I find mail too basic; with a lack of plugins and decent keyboard shortcuts; the lack of labels and starring [hard to flag emails on iPhone] is killer too. I always read emails on my phone, think I should reply on my desktop but then forget - starring is required. GMail always feels like a web app, MailPlane partially solves this but its oh so slow still - for example you have to watch a stupid progress bar when you compose a new email, and emails open in the web "one window" format. MailPlane does have good integration with copy/pasting images into new emails, and adequate - if very ugly - attachment handling via drag and drop. Thunderbird and Postbox infuriate me to no end. Super slow, when they're doing anything they appear to lock you out from doing anything else (eg: when you're scanning a mailbox), and Postbox has no end of clutter that actually makes it quite hard to read an email without opening it in a new email. Outlook under Crossover is exactly as annoying as you imagine. It looks terrible and eats RAM. Also when it crashes the wine layer crashers, which is a kick in the nuts. Entourage is okay except it has a bizarre arbitrary limit on the email database, and emails aren't indexed via spotlight meaning it takes forever to search stuff. It also eats memory and requires you to buy Mac Office. Ugh. I've also had Entourage randomly hose my email database twice, causing a good 24 hours of it indexing and re-downloading my ~70K emails. Thunderbird and Entourage are also their own worlds with little to no synchronisation with the Mac environment; specifically address book. Presently I'm using MailPlane (which is the best of a bad bunch) and GMail on the iPhone via the web/html5 view.
