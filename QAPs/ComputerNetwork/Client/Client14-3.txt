★Is this the craziest client ever?
I would leave him a message saying that you don't want to end on bad terms, but if he doesn't get in touch and take care of payment, you'll have to get lawyers involved since he's not leaving you any other avenue.  I'd escalate from there to just a letter from the lawyer before starting actual legal proceedings. Also, if you have any mutual contacts who might be in communication with him, you might ask them to help him understand that by not communicating he's forcing you to play hardball. Also keep in mind that he might not actually have the cash (but also that if he's tight on cash, the people who get paid will probably be the ones that make it least comfortable for him not to pay).  If he does communicate, I might volunteer that if he needs time you can put together a payment plan -- but if you do, it will need to be signed and you should decide and make clear up-front what criteria would have you start legal proceedings (e.g., 2 weeks past due on any payment). -Daniel
