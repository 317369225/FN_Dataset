â˜…What do clients/employers/recruiters look for in a UX portfolio in Los Angeles?What if you are just beginning and don't have any projects to show yet? Where do you start?
I think Amber shares a great approach. A UX Designer who can successfully show a smart approach to a project through storytelling, as well as deliverables to illustrate an end product, makes a great one two punch. Jeff Gothelf from The Ladders recently blogged about the relevance of a portfolio for UXD professionals, which generated some great discussion within the community. I also weighed in from a recruiter's perspective, as I source UXD professionals for companies with varying UX needs. You can view the blog here: http://bit.ly/hVKoBw
