★HTML5: What are the most important client-side (HTML5/CSS/JavaScript) libraries and why?I defer to the quora community to define "important" through the use of upvotes, as that's largely inevitable anyways.
One of most used library (I'm an author of this library) what I use every day is jQuery Role: https://github.com/kossnocorp/role. Instead of popular class– and id-based selectors jQuery Role provide easy way to find and manipulate elements with role attribute: $ ( '@search-field' ) will return <div role= "search-field" ></div>. It's great idea because logic no more depend on styles. You can easy refactor css and don't fear break something.
