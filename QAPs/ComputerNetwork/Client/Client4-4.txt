★What's the best email client for Mac OS X?
Mailbox is currently in beta for Mac osx. It is a new mail client, owned by Dropbox. It is easy to apply for a beta copy if you visit their website (http://www.mailboxapp.com).  It has recently been reviewed by the verge and they raved about how easy it was to churn through emails with the intuitive swipe gestures. You can read the review here (http://mobile.theverge.com/2013/...).  Additionally, it is on ios and Android. I'm hoping for a Windows client soon. It has a clean UI and the way it is utilised is similar to a to do list. Snoozing emails, reminding you do look at it in the evening etc. I highly recommend it. It is currently limited to Gmail accounts. Let me know how it goes.
