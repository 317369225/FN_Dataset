★What do clients/employers/recruiters look for in a UX portfolio in Los Angeles?What if you are just beginning and don't have any projects to show yet? Where do you start?
UX recruiters tend to compare the deliverable's deliverables with the finished product.  As we all know sometimes the finished product has changed or was never there.  Many UX portfolio's portfolios are more akin to artistic portfolio's portfolios and therefore recruiters lack the necessary context to gauge or to evaluate the candidate's skills as they relate to user experience.  Some recruiters place great emphasis on the visual aesthetics, without regarding to the user research involved.
