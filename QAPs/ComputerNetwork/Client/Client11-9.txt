â˜…What do clients/employers/recruiters look for in a UX portfolio in Los Angeles?What if you are just beginning and don't have any projects to show yet? Where do you start?
Unless you are going for your first job, IMHO the UX portfolio is dead. Businesses want to know about ROI (i.e. how are you going to improve the business and how will you do it), not about how you could superficially cover up cracks and make it look 'awesome'. Indeed, the chances are that most employers won't know what is good design is, they will be looking to you to show leadership on how they develop their product or service. Use previous project documentation (persona's, prototypes, wireframes, sitemaps, taxonomy spreadsheets) to illustrate stories and what role you could play in optimising KPI's...indeed, you could help them explore what KPI's they should be tracking.
