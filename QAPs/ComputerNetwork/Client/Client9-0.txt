★What is the best IM client on Ubuntu?Web apps included
I use Pidgin on the desktop because of better voice and video integration, and a handy screenlet that you can put on your desktop to keep all contacts visible.  I use Empathy on the netbook because it integrates into the indicator applet, and the Facebook chat support is better (in Pidgin, it takes a little while to show Facebook contacts, and that's after installing a plugin for Facebook chat- Empathy's Facebook chat is included by default).  Those are really the only two contenders for true all-in-one solutions, to the best of my knowledge.
