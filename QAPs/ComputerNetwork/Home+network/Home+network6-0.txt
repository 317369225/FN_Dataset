★Would Firesheep capture HTTP sessions of people connected to my protected home network?
This depends a great deal on how your home network is protected.  If you're using WEP, then the answer seems to be "Yes, FireSheep could capture these sessions."  WEP restricts access to your network, but once authorized, it seems like they do nothing to encrypt traffic intended for another client from your eyes.  If you're using WPA or WPA2, the traffic on your network is encrypted, making it harder for a user authorized to use the network to get access to the cookies needed to hijack your session.  There are attacks that can be employed against these, but they're much harder and FireSheep is quite simple.  I believe a network using WPA or WPA2 is safe from what FireSheep does (at least without combining it with other attacks). If you're using WEP, I think it's worth considering moving up to WPA2, or at least WPA, although this is a good idea even without FireSheep.
