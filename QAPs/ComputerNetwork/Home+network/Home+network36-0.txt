★What's the best solution to isolate my home network (personal, business, voip, printers)?
I cannot see any reason why you should want / need to use VLANs; their primary function is to provide segregation of resources in networks where bandwidth is being becoming an issue due to the constant transmission of data packets between hosts. As a very rough rule of thumb, this might happen in a LAN where there are more than 200 hosts and 25 servers (it's actually a lot more complex).   VPNs can be managed in a variety of ways; as long a the customer has the appropriate hardware, it could be done using a piece of client software from a PC direct to them.   Real time applications such as VOIP, video streaming etc. will work more effectively with Quality of Service (QoS), but it needs to be happening across the whole connection, otherwise it's a waste of time. I doubt that you would need QoS internally.
