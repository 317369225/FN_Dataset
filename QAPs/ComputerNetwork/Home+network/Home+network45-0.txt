â˜…What are some open source Firewall/IDS software which I can use to protect my home network?Today, a colleague suggested me http://www.pfsense.org/. It seems it provides firewall service, but no intrusion detection. So, is there a better option?
http://sectools.org/tag/ids/ Sectools lists the top voted security and penetration testing tools in various categories, one of these being specifically for IDS's At present, Snort http://www.snort.org/ has been rated highly for a few years now; while there's quite a steep learning curve if you've not used an IDS before, the system is very powerful and is used by a number of enterprise grade solutions as part of their offering.
