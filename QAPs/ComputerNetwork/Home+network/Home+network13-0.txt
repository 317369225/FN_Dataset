â˜…What are the three must have features for a home network switch?Assuming I want: (a) gigabit speeds, (b) easy extensibility in the future, (c) GUI driven management than can be understood by non-CCNA types, and (d) plays nice with other brands or types of network equipment, like routers for instance.
I am assuming you don't mean a home router/switch combo but rather a stand-alone switch. Unless you are planning to do something unusual, like run a home lab, any Gb switch will do and will work with any other Ethernet gear. Chances are you don't or won't need QoS, VLAN's, or other switch features on your home network because you simply aren't going to run that much bandwidth across it to cause congestion. QoS is a bigger issue for LAN to WAN traffic. If you are building a home lab, then any low end switch from Cisco, HP, Netgear, etc, will do. I'd look at few things for a home lab: Gb interfaces: 8-24 should be sufficient Quiet: fanless or low speed fans are a plus. These things can be noisy. PoE if you want to run VoIP phones, net cams, etc. You probably don't need a separate power supply unless you are going to require lots of PoE ports. GUI interface. If the switch is manageable, then it will have a web interface at the very least.
