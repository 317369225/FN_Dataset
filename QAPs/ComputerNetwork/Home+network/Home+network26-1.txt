★What is the best way to set up a home network?Like many homes, we have a number of devices and many files for storage.  What's the best way for all these files to be shared across devices so they aren't sitting on different machines etc.  We run Apple products, I'm not adverse to a cloud solution, just finding that I'm becoming paralysed by choice (and in the meantime I'm filling up space on my hard drives!)
Most routers support usb access todat,so you could connect an external hard drive to an up to date router today, or you could connect a NAS device to your router and even improve performance :)
