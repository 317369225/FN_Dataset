â˜…Internet Security: How can I protect my home network from unsafe browsing?I live in a house with 4 other guys. Our network is constantly having issues. My suspicion is that some people are not browsing the interwebs) safe? I have a Mac if that matters and we're running an n class router.
You do need a good Internet Security system installed. One approach you may want to look into is having a Private Cloud platform for all your internet browsing. I use a company called Jumpto. You get free 250 MB per month bandwidth and additional bandwidth for everyone you invite to join. It provides complete security, privacy and anonymity on the web. Have a look when you get a chance.
