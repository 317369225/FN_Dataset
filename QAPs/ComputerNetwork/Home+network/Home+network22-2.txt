â˜…I have had my home network hacked twice now. What should I do?I have refromatted all my devices even ipads and iphones, changed ISP's. No help. Afraid he will escalate and go after my bank accounts.
I recently read this: Misfortune Cookie Vulnerability which suggests a way a hacker might get to your local network even if the obvious things like WiFi security are addressed. But if you changed ISPs you would have got a totally different ip address, so it seems likely you have vulnerable WiFi or a device with persistent malware, or you are re-installing some malware after you reformat. Or you have something like a vulnerable wordpress server, stupid SSH password etc. We can't guess without more information.
