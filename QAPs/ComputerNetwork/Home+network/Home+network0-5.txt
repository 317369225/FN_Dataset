★What is the best way to secure Wireless (Wi-Fi) Home Network?
There are a couple of ways to secure Wi-Fi for your Home Network. You can enable encryption, change password for web access, along with many other ways that have been listed below by other users. However, some may not have access to this and so, we have gathered some really great tips for accessing and using Public Wi-fi: Be aware. Public Wi-Fi is inherently insecure – so be cautious. Remember – any device could be at risk Laptops, smartphones, and tablets are all susceptible to the wireless security risks. Try to verify it’s a legitimate wireless connection Some bogus links – that have been set up by malicious users – will have a connection name that’s deliberately similar to the coffee shop, hotel, or venue that’s offering free Wi-Fi. If you can speak with an employee at the location that’s providing the public Wi-Fi connection, ask for information about their legitimate Wi-Fi access point – such as the connection’s name and IP address. Consider using your cell phone If you need to access any websites that store or require the input of any sensitive information – including social networking, online shopping, and online banking sites – it may be worthwhile accessing them via your cell phone network, instead of the public Wi-Fi connection. Pylon created intelligent Wi-Fi for your home, where you don't have to worry about passwords, encryptions or security issues. Owners can control the degree of access each device or user has on their network. For example: Best friends can have unlimited access, while casual party guests can have access for an hour and the nosy neighbor can't have access at all. All information accessed is kept on your base station and never leaves your house! If you'd like to check out what we've created, visit Pylon Products! Hope this helps!
