â˜…Which would be better for a home networking solution -- Ruckus or Luxul?Ruckus is about 3x the cost -- is it worth it? Having a good home network is very important to me.
You probably won't see a difference between the 2 vendors, the main thing you'd want to check out is what kind of radios your endpoint are using (802.11b or g or n or ac) then choose an AP that can accomodate everything you have at the highest speed - it might make sense to upgrade any devices that can't run 802.11n at the least, if you run your AP in mixed mode then every device's performance will be affected
