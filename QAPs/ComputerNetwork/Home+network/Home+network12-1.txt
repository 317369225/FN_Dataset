â˜…What's a good way to run a firewall/NIDS on a home network?Which software? Snort? Which hardware? OpenWRT? Raspberry Pi?
To start with : I am not sure it will be very interesting to set this up on a home network. YMMV but the traffic in such a network is painfully boring and predictible. You are likely to already have a firewall in your access router. Some providers will allow you to plug your own router and then something with OpenWRT or Tomato makes sense. You could also use an older desktop and plug a modem card in, then build the firewalling there. I am a fan of shorewall (http://shorewall.net/), you will learn a few things on the way. As for an IDS: Snort is the classical solution. Give a try to Suricata (http://suricata-ids.org/), it's modern alternative.
