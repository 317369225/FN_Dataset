â˜…Which best software to use to transfer files across the home network?I use uTorrent across the WAN and FastCopy from hard-disk to hard-disk. Both I find very reliable. How about for computer-to-computer transfers on the same LAN? Pause, resume, verify features would be awesome. Freeware would be great too.
Have you looked at robocopy? Ships with windows, does reliable copy. Doesn't have pause/resume, but it verifies and lets you skip files you've already copy so resuming is as simple as running the same command.
