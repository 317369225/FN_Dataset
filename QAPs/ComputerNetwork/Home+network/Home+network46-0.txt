★How should a technical person get an overview of home networking alternatives?Is there a compact, informative guide somewhere? I need to sort out the terminology quickly and set up a cheap, reliable network for my family. This is a follow-up question to What is the best wireless access point or router for the home?.
The quick answer is no. [a day later: http://lifehacker.com/5553789/wh... The longer answer goes something like: If all you're doing is setting up WiFi for a normal sized house, the process is pretty simple. Any consumer-level router/switch/access point combo unit (that's pretty much all of them) will cover you on the hardware end. Some pointers: • Brand names exist for a reason. The cheap, off-brand hardware might work, but there's no telling how long it will last, or how well it will cover you. • 802.11n is at least twice as fast as 802.11g. If you've got devices that support it, .11n is well-worth the buy. • Dual-band equipment is basically a must have if you plan to mix a/b/g & n. It's also really handy if you plan to have a lot of devices on the network at one time, or plan on having heavy bandwidth usage. • Position the access point high, away from interference. Remember that this is a radio signal. Creating coverage is a lot like opening an umbrella — the higher you open it the more area it will cover before running into the ground. • Materials like brick, cinder block, metal, bodies of water… all interfere with radio signal. If you've got a lot of anything really solid (hopefully, there's not too much water indoors :), you might need to get a second access point. • http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/index is a popular open-source, third party firmware that supports many consumer routers and adds features that most do not come with out of the box. That's what I've got off the top of my head
