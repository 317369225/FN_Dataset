★At what point did ISPs decide to allow, but not support, home networks?When I got my first cable modem in 1998 part of the contract said that networks of any kind were prohibited.  They were trying to get customers to purchase a separate modem for each computer.
The reference to "networks" in the contract might refer to a prohibition on reselling the Operator's bandwidth commercially. As a broadband vendor supporting North American MSOs in  the late '90s I don't recall any discussion around preventing home network use, but I do know there were active efforts to prevent individuals from setting up their own 'mini-ISPs' using the, at the time, limited bandwidth available in the cable plant.
