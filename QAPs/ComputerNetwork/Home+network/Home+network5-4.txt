â˜…Which best software to use to transfer files across the home network?I use uTorrent across the WAN and FastCopy from hard-disk to hard-disk. Both I find very reliable. How about for computer-to-computer transfers on the same LAN? Pause, resume, verify features would be awesome. Freeware would be great too.
In our college we prefer to use DC++ your files, your way, no limits . Its pretty good, all you need to do is setup a hub on one of the computers on the nework using PtokaX Direct Connect Hub and run the DC++ on both the machines and you can send an receive data very quickly by sharing the desired folder. DC++ does provide excellent data rates. Setting up Ptokax takes a few minutes and is pretty straight-forward and rest of it child's play.
