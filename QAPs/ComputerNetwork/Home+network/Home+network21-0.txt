★How do I protect my home network from my SmartTV?The reviews of smart tv's suggest that they are a significant security risk in any home network. How do I configure my home's network to view the TV as that kind of security risk?
If you assume a SmartTV can be compromised, you want to isolate it.  You will need a capable home router that supports DMZs and/or multiple isolated wireless SSIDs (like a guest SSID). Once you have that isolation,  put the SmartTV in the DMZ or on a private or guest SSID that can only access the Internet and not your home devices.  This may prevent you from streaming movies form your NAS. If you are paranoid, you may want to have a NAS dedicated to only Media that lives in that DMZ. If you have a less capable home router, you may be able to isolate individual IP addresses or MAC addresses so they can only access the Internet.  It all depends on the capability of your home router.
