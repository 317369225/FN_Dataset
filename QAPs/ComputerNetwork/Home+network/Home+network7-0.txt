â˜…How do i delete a Yammer internal/home network?I created an exernal network. After the first invited user was activated, a home network was created. But there seems to be no admin for that home network and we want to delete it.
I found the answer on another site [1]: On a free network there are no admins, the only way an admin exists on the network is if it is a paid network. Since the content in a free network is owned by the individual users, per our user policy, it is not possible to delete an entire network. However, users can delete their accounts individually by signing into Yammer on the web and completing the following 2 steps: Delete messages: Delete all of their messages one by one by going to More > Delete below each post. Delete their account: Click the person icon then "Edit Account" in the upper right corner, click "Preferences" from the left-hand column, and then click on "Delete your Yammer Account" in the right hand side of the page.[1] How do you delete a Yammer network?
