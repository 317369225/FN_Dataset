★What is the safest home network wireless authentication option?
Rakkhi,  is the kind of password you describe more secure than a properly-punctuated-and-capitalized sentence of 20 to 40 characters, which necessarily will contain upper case and lower case letters and punctuation marks?  I I tend to use sentences for WPA keys because it is possible to have a long but easy to remember one, and I don't need to type them often.
