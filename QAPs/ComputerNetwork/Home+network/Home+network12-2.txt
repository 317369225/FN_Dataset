â˜…What's a good way to run a firewall/NIDS on a home network?Which software? Snort? Which hardware? OpenWRT? Raspberry Pi?
I would have to agree with Wojtek on his first point; you my not find terribly interesting traffic occurring. I have, however, played with pfsense (https://www.pfsense.org) and have used it as a replacement to consumer routers/firewalls. It's got a nice GUI interface, and you can also use a CLI as well. I've found it to be good to learn on as I used it to segregate my actual network and a few test networks. As far as IDS, I've only had minor experience with snort; if memory serves me correctly, pfsense has an installable package for snort. Hardware wise, I started using pfsense on a VERY old Pentium 2 computer with a 4GB hard drive and 256Mb of RAM. It ran fine on there and only upgraded hardware because I started wanting to play with several more advanced things at the same time. I upgrade to a 1U SuperMicro Atom server with 8GB RAM to run ESXi hosting my pfsense machine.
