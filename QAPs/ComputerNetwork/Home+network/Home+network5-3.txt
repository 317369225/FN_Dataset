★Which best software to use to transfer files across the home network?I use uTorrent across the WAN and FastCopy from hard-disk to hard-disk. Both I find very reliable. How about for computer-to-computer transfers on the same LAN? Pause, resume, verify features would be awesome. Freeware would be great too.
I would use either HomeNet Manager:  HomeNet Manager Helps Setup, Secure, and Troubleshoot your Home and Wireless Network or ViveDrive:  ViveDrive
