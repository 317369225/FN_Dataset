★What is the best way to set up a home network?Like many homes, we have a number of devices and many files for storage.  What's the best way for all these files to be shared across devices so they aren't sitting on different machines etc.  We run Apple products, I'm not adverse to a cloud solution, just finding that I'm becoming paralysed by choice (and in the meantime I'm filling up space on my hard drives!)
A nice SOHO offering for NAS storage combined with a great WiFi router would serve you well. My personal recommendation: * Netgear ReadyNAS    - Others in the space include Drobo, QNAP & Synology * Apple Airport Extreme * If needed Cisco/Linksys 8 port switch However in the Apple space, somethings in iPhoto and all of iMovie need an 'Apple Formatted' hard drive. In this case, I recommend Thunderbolt storage from G-Technology or Promise.
