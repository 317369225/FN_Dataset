★Which would be better for a home networking solution -- Ruckus or Luxul?Ruckus is about 3x the cost -- is it worth it? Having a good home network is very important to me.
I wouldn't recommend either for a home solution unless you live in a 200 room estate and need seamless roaming between dozens of access points.  How many square feet (or meters) do you need to cover? What kind of building (single family home, condo, apartment, etc) is this and the approximate age of the building? What areas, if any, outside of the home itself do you need to cover?  Think about porches, sitting areas, and other outdoor "living" spaces you'd like have to have coverage in as well as covered areas like garages or workshops. How many concurrent connections do you think you'll have? How much effective bandwidth do you need inside the network and what will your connectivity to the Internet be in terms of speed?
