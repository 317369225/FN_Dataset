â˜…Which VPN service can you use to keep your entire home network secure from those that might be spying on you and with bad intentions?
VPN service will help you mask your IP address from monitoring by Government or Geo-tracking websites for censorship for some streaming. You will notice slower speed when VPN is turned on. There is a latest technology called SmartDNS, which is also the same and your speed will be the same as your prescribed speed from ISP. Downside is that SmartDNS will only mask out your IP for certain websites depending on the provider. VPN itself is not enough to solve your problem. The best way is to configure only certain MAC address of all the physical devices to allow to connect to your Modem or Router and turn on Maximum Level Security in your firewall & browser & Router that you use. Configure SmartDNS in your router. This way, hacker will have to a few firewalls to break before getting into your PC/devices. I've tried many VPNs before and found PureVPNis the best in term of speed/security/price. Best of all you can share with your 5 best friends for concurrent usage and it provides both VPN/SmartDNS. Only 0.82 cents per month if you take up 1 year plan. :)
