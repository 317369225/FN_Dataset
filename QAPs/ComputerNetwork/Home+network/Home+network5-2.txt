â˜…Which best software to use to transfer files across the home network?I use uTorrent across the WAN and FastCopy from hard-disk to hard-disk. Both I find very reliable. How about for computer-to-computer transfers on the same LAN? Pause, resume, verify features would be awesome. Freeware would be great too.
I use a product like the free Filezilla server, which is an FTP server you can run on the machine you want to give and take files from. It's faster than a shared drive because it's there for one thing only - moving files. You can download it at FileZilla - Server Download It's a little confusing to first set up, but once you've got it, it's fast. And if you're nerdy you can figure out how to enable the multiple threads/connections.
