★Is there a webapp for monitoring my home network?I want to "See" what is slowing down my internet connection.  But I don't want to have to download and install anything. (Like: Wireshark, etc.) Looking for something like:  http://www.speedtest.net/  but with more features.
Hi, You don't need any third party application or a webclient to know what apps are consuming your bandwidth. You could simply open the "Resource Monitor" provided with Windows. To open the “Resource Monitor” panel, go to Start => Accessories => System Tools => Resource Monitor. It pretty much does what you are asking for. Hope this helps!
