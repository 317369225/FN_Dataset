★Is my home network an Ethernet if I only have 1 computer device?
Ethernet is a set of standards for how to connect computers into a network with wires.  These days you typically see it in the form of cables that look like this... Even if you hooked up some computers with these kinds of connectors you wouldn't say that you have "an ethernet", you would just say you have a network (one that happens to use the ethernet standard).  In any event, if you only have one computer in your house and it isn't networked to anything you neither have "an ethernet" (something nobody has) nor any kind of network at all.  If you have one computer and it is connected to the Internet somehow, it is not unlikely that you have connected your computer to some kind of network device provided by your DSL or cable TV provider either via ethernet or by WiFi.
