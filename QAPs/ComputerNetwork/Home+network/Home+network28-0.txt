â˜…How can I access my hard drive on another computer outside my home network?I have a dedicated media centre with 250GB worth of audio and video. I'd like to access this computer's shared directories while at places like starbucks, which are outside my home network.
You'll need to set up a VPN. Kind of a pain. If you're running a Windows7 computer, use the following instructions to create an inbound VPN server. http://www.howtonetworking.com/V... Give your PC a static IP. On your home router, open ports 1723 tcp/udp and 443 tcp/upd to the static IP you assigned your system. Use DynamicDNS to create a static hostname to the external connection of your home router: http://www.dyndns.com/services/d... Your biggest constraint will be bandwidth. You may be able to see the files, but keep in mind the difficulty of accessing them and using them. You'll probably need to transfer (copy them) to the local computer before use. Your next biggest problem will be your ISP who may shut down these services to your router if you're not paying for business class services. They may see this VPN traffic after a while and take action by just turning it off, leaving you quite frustrated. It may be easier for you to consider cloud replication instead of direct access to your machine. Example: Dropbox. Files synchronize and replicate to machines instead of requiring direct access. No VPN, no DNS, no ISP anger... cleaner, faster, easier.
