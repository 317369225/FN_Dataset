â˜…How can I add another wireless access point to my home network?
Here are the general steps of what you will need to do. There is a link below that goes into more detail. Before you connect the extra AP (Netgear, in your case) to your Internet router (the DLink), change it's IP address to something on your network outside the DHCP range. Make it a static address. Connect to your extra AP and disable the DHCP server. Connect one of the Netgear's LAN ports to one of your DLink's LAN ports. You will probably need a Ethernet cross over cable to do this. Try it with what you have. If the link light comes on, you are OK. If not, get a cross over bable. Do NOT use the Netgears WAN Port. While you can go Netgear WAN to DLink LAN, it gets more complicated and you have multiple address spaces to deal with. Set-up wireless on your Netgear and you are set to go.
