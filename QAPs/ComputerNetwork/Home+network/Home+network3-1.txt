★What are good options for home network storage and backup?
I have a DLINK DNS 323 2 bay network storage enclosure.  It's easy to set up, works with PC and Mac and has the benefit of accepting pretty much any 3.5" drives you want to put in it. I've been quite happy with it. http://www.dlink.ca/products/?pi...
