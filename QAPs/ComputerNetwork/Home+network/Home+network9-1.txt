â˜…How to connect two computers on a home network?I have a desktop computer(win 7) and a laptop (win 8) in my home. I want to access one from another. Ex. I want to access and transfer files and folders in my laptop from my desktop and viceversa.
If you are on the same network, you can turn on Windows sharing for specific folders. Create a home group or join one if it already exits. You can access the other computer through this home group(via a password set up during homegroup creation).You can read and write files into those public folders. Windows 7 uses 128-bit encryption key for file sharing, so no need to worry about security either.
