â˜…Which VPN service can you use to keep your entire home network secure from those that might be spying on you and with bad intentions?
Every VPN provider has its own capabilities like HMA or PIA which Kurt John has mentioned. However, in your case you need to pick the provider equip you with ultimate anonymity & security. HMA is more inclined towards Proxy / streaming which not at all would be right fit solution and on the other hand PIA has no such reputation in the market and client experiences. Pick up the provider that could you offer large number of security protocols like SSTP, OpenVPN , Stealth browser, Internet kill switch etc. Suppose Business VPN by PureVPN offer more than just VPN like "Stealth Browser - Which would not keep any search data/logs/cache etc", "NAT firewall - Block unwanted traffic" and Internet Kill switch etc.
