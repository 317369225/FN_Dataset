★How do I wire a home network from telephone board to RJ45?
If you want to first determine which wires go to which room, you need a short circuit tester (e.g. a multimeter has such functionality) and a loop back plug (you can build your own if you wish - image attached). For each room, plug in the loop back into the RJ-45 and then with the multimeter in your patch room try to find which of the lines are short circuited.  Label each set of wires with the room as you identify them. Once this is done, you'll need a CAT5 patch panel to run the wires into (the phone boards electrically connect the wires from different rooms together since telephone wires work that way - ethernet wires cannot be electrically tied together).  From the patch panel, you can run each jack to a port in your router.
