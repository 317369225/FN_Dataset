★What is the optimal setup for wired home networking?We're going to re-wire a house and I'm not satisfied with my existing gigabit router and wireless repeater setup.  I'd like several rooms hardwired such as the office, living room, master bedroom and kitchen.  Sound like Cat5E is the way to go.  Anything I should be mindful of?
I doubt cat6 would cost much more, and you might as well future-proof as much as possible. Consider how many drops you want at each location. Again, making additional runs along the same line probably won't increase costs too much. Use a qualified installer and all should be well. You almost certainly don't need high-end switches like Cisco, just proper wiring.
