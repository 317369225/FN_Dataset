â˜…What is the best way to secure Wireless (Wi-Fi) Home Network?
Best answer would be Rose Ab as the answer of mine would be same. If you are keen on purchasing your router also check for backdoor if it exist for your router. Know your router transmitting power ensure that it is placed in such a way that it can transmit accordingly enough for your premises. Next issue is everybody is telling you to use WPA/ or WPA2 it depends on your router setting and on the level of devices whether they would support it or not. It is recommended to use WPA2 with AES encryption. Change all factory setting for the router, remove remote login facility if you want hide your SSID broadcast and also change default SSID name. If you have stop broadcasting your SSID, you can skip for MAC FILTERING for sure also from time to time check your router to see who is on your network. Also if you got any android devices try using any software which is easily available freely to test the network and improve it where possible then.
