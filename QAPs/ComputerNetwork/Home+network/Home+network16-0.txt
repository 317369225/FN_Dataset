â˜…Is there an Android app that allows multiple devices to connect as video intercoms on a home network?I have two tablets on docks, hooked up to the network, and two retired phones on wires, also hooked to the wifi. I want to be able to pick up any of them and video conference with another one without having to use Skype or other methods that require accounts. I just want the network identification to do the job, not separate email accounts or whatever.
Searched for "video intercom' on Google Play, found some interesting apps -- for example audio with Bluetooth, could be used by motorcyclists(!). If you've tried some apps and haven't found what you're looking for, leave a comment. I've been looking for an interesting Android app idea to work on.
