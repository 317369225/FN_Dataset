â˜…Will closing outbound ports make a home network safer?I have a Linux box acting as a firewall/router at home. The configuration is closed by default and I have opened the ports that we use as needed. Is there any benefit in that, or am I just making my life more difficult by having to configure my firewall each time I add a new app that has a custom port?
What you're doing is fine, but I would let any app go out on any port it wants to and let that app stop using the port when needed. I don't know that I would block all outgoing ports though like you've said. I would only worry about incoming ports. That means I trust my internal devices to be safe and clean. If my internal network had public access or some other unknown devices then I might restrict outbound as well to prevent abuse like spamming or sending ddos.
