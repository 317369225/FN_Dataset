★What are the three must have features for a home network switch?Assuming I want: (a) gigabit speeds, (b) easy extensibility in the future, (c) GUI driven management than can be understood by non-CCNA types, and (d) plays nice with other brands or types of network equipment, like routers for instance.
I would highly recommend the Cisco 100 series switches. They are reasonably priced and support connections of 10/10/1000 megabit per second, depending on the model. Setup is wizard driven and firmware updates are released periodically. These switches also support more advanced option like Quality of Service (QoS) to ensure prioritization of voip traffic for example.  The old Linksys RV082 routers only support 100 mbps connections but are still in my opinion the perfect devices for large home networks or small business implementations with no IT staff.
