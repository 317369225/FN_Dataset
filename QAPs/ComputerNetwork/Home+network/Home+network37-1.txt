★How do I join two home networks with different IP schemas?I have one router with a 192.168.5.x set up and another router (connected to the first) with a 192.168.10.xx schema.  How do I network these computers now?  Both routers are running DD WRT.  Thanks!
When you need to join two different IP subnet/schemas, you would invariably need a router, or anything that will do Layer 3 routing. Most SOHO routers have single WAN interfaces, so they might fair well. A Layer 3 switch would be ideal, but are costly. You might want to give an old Linux box a try and strap on say www.Vyatta.com on it - (its free and once heck of a Routing/Firewall/IDS OS).
