â˜…How can I access my hard drive on another computer outside my home network?I have a dedicated media centre with 250GB worth of audio and video. I'd like to access this computer's shared directories while at places like starbucks, which are outside my home network.
You can use various remote support tools such as Logmein, gosupportnow, GoToMyPC etc. for remotely accessing computers outside your home network.
