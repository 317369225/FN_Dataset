★At what point did ISPs decide to allow, but not support, home networks?When I got my first cable modem in 1998 part of the contract said that networks of any kind were prohibited.  They were trying to get customers to purchase a separate modem for each computer.
Having been in the ISP business since 1996, I'm not aware of there ever being a time when ISP's generally had a policy about allowing or disallowing home networks.  A simple NAT router would make such a policy nearly impossible to enforce.  Supporting a home network is a very different beast.  No two home networks are the same or even consist of the same elements.  Since, in many cases none of the elements were purchased from the ISP, they ISP's support straff has limited knowledge of them.  Additionally, assisting a customer with home-network configuration becomes a liability issue.  "Touch it once, own it for life" is a common mantra.  All too often, even kindly assistance to a customer results in angry calls weeks or months later with claims like: "After you helped me get my router set up, my printer stopped working.  You broke my printer and now you have to buy me a new one."   TR-069  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-069) offers significant relief for ISP's and home-network configuration.  However, retroactively applying TR-069 to existing home-network configurations is impractical.
