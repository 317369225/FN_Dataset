â˜…I have had my home network hacked twice now. What should I do?I have refromatted all my devices even ipads and iphones, changed ISP's. No help. Afraid he will escalate and go after my bank accounts.
Make sure your router isn't vulnerable - some routers cannot be fixed, while with others you just need to disable WPS if enabled (PIN based security) and make sure you're using WPA2 with a strong password (for example a sentence that contains punctuation and numbers). It's also possible that your router has been compromised, so you might want to upgrade its firmware (even if there's no newer version available). There is also a thing called persistent backdoors, which use different chips inside your devices to escape reformats. That's generally pretty advanced stuff, and difficult to get rid of, so your best bet might be trying to somehow get on the hacker's good side. I doubt you're in that much trouble, though - except if you have something very important to hide or somebody hates you a lot.
