★What big-picture questions about digital signage/digital out of home networks still need to be answered?What high-level questions commonly asked by C- or VP-level execs still lack satisfying answers, and which are the most troublesome?
Paul Flanigan you are exactly right.  Another measurement I feel is in some ways a better way to analyze whether you are getting your moneys worth is Return on Objective.    Are the digital displays working the way you want them to.   For example in Doctor offices DDS can reduce on the perceived wait time.  How do you measure this?  Look at the number of return customers over a period of time even better yet sell advertising to drug companies.  You can't can any better form of targeted advertising than that.  "Ask your doctor about...?"   Digital signage will only be as good as the content displayed.  That is the key to the success of ANY digital signage solution.
