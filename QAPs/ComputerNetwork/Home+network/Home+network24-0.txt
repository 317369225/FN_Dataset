★How can I increase transfer speeds between two computers in a home network?I'm getting sub G speeds despite having a N router with WRT, I can't even play SDTV video stored in one computer from another without it being all choppy and broken.
The problem with a wireless connection is that it is half duplex. In other words, you cannot send and receive at the same time. So you have a pipe that is supposedly1GB, but the flow must stop in order for acknowledgement packets (ack) to get back to the router. My first though would be to switch from TCP/IP to UDP as the transmission protocol. A few missed packets are not going to ruin the viewing experience.And UDP doesn't need confirmation of packet delivery. It is assumed that the receiving PC is getting all the packets and in the correct order. Next though would be to increase your packet size, cuts down on the number of acks that the receiving computer needs to send, assuming that UDP does not work. Add ram to the receiving computer. Increasing the buffers may help. Probably, should have said this first. Try a wired connection, just to make sure that at 1GB full duplex playback is good. There may be other issues and if playback stinks with a wired connection; then you know the issue probably isn't your connection at all. Check your wireless environment. Try this software and see what is going on.   http://www.metageek.net/products... Sorry, this answer is so scattered. Best order of business try the system on a wired connection; then if that is good switch to UDP
