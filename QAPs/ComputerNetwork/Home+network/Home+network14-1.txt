â˜…Will closing outbound ports make a home network safer?I have a Linux box acting as a firewall/router at home. The configuration is closed by default and I have opened the ports that we use as needed. Is there any benefit in that, or am I just making my life more difficult by having to configure my firewall each time I add a new app that has a custom port?
It all depends on what you are trying to achieve. Think of your house. Closing the windows and doorways going to the outside world ensures that nothing gets out through those windows and doorways. All outbound traffic will exit only through permitted windows and doorways. This does not necessarily translate to a safer network in terms of what can leave your house. You are not controlling what gets out but only the paths that can be used to get out. Unless ofcourse, you are able to inspect everything that is exiting those doorways. Might be easier to lock away the stuff you want to secure! There are other implications that you may want to consider. Application performance, response time, customization, etc. Let's think about this in terms of opening only one gate for people to leave the stadium at the end of a sports event. Guess what, there will a long queue and it will take a long time for people to exit. And then if you want to inspect them all on the way out.....guess what, you are not going to be popular. And oh, how does the in-stadium hardware leave the stadium if the door is too small/narrow/not tall enough, etc.....which means customization of anything that does not fit.
