â˜…How can I monitor my wireless home network to view the bandwith used by each computer?Sometimes my connection is slow, and it'd be helpful to know if one of my housemates is downloading large files 24/7.
You either need a router that would provide this function natively, very few ones do and they are expensive. Alternative, look at Gargoyle (See: http://www.gargoyle-router.com/i...) or Tomato (See: http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato). Both these are firmware upgrades for Linksys routers (and some other routers). Once installed on compatible & supported hardware, it will do what you desire, give you individual breakdown of bandwidth usage (and even capping, etc.) for each user that connects to the Wifi.
