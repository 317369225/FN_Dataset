★How do I join two home networks with different IP schemas?I have one router with a 192.168.5.x set up and another router (connected to the first) with a 192.168.10.xx schema.  How do I network these computers now?  Both routers are running DD WRT.  Thanks!
If you must use two separate IP schemas, there are several SOHO routers (like the Cisco RVS4000) that allow VLANs to be utilized.  If you'd rather just have one IP schema, and since you're running DD-WRT, you could always change the IP of the second router from 192.168.10.x to 192.168.5.x and then set it to a bridged mode rather than a routing mode.  It will then perform as a Layer 2 switch (hub, really).  If you are using the first router (192.168.5.x) as a DHCP server, then you'd need to exclude the IP of the second router (as well as the IP's of any device connected to it).  As this bridged mode wont forward DHCP or BOOTP packets, the devices behind the second router will need static IP's.
