★I have had my home network hacked twice now. What should I do?I have refromatted all my devices even ipads and iphones, changed ISP's. No help. Afraid he will escalate and go after my bank accounts.
Call the police. This sounds like a deliberate attempt by one of your neighbors or someone who knows where you live and doesn't like you to find out something about you, considering not only this person has to be close enough to connect to your home network (within a hundred feet away from your router)  but is doing it multiple times. On the other hand this could be some punk who likes doing this kind of thing for fun, but I doubt it.  I'd be less worried about your financial information, which would've been made off with the first time and only attacked once before moving onto another target, and more worried about what someone might want to know about you or whatever company you happen to own/work for.
