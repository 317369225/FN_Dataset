★I have had my home network hacked twice now. What should I do?I have refromatted all my devices even ipads and iphones, changed ISP's. No help. Afraid he will escalate and go after my bank accounts.
Thanks everyone for your answers.  I'm really at wits end. Dean,  I live in a townhouse and really don't cross paths with any of my neighbors at all.  On my last reformat I connected a asus rt-ac87u router to my new at&t modem/router,  and following a friends instructions I set the router to be undiscoverable (unseen),  and set the router to only accept connections to a few of my devices like my MacBook, ipad and  iphone.  I gave it a complex password too.  My iphone and ipad had been erased at a friends house and reconnected to icloud. My MacBook was erased and reformatted at the apple store. Other than that I had connected to gmail, changed some passwords and that was it.  Within about 10 minutes I could no longer connect to the asus router and it periodically connected but would not connect to the internet.  The same happened with my other devices.  This was a brand new asus router.  It definitely appeared like the hacker was toying with me or else the router was broken and I was paranoid.   Other things happened like the MacBook making random beeping sounds in rapid succession and the screen image getting distorted.  I finally returned the router and just connected to the att router directly and am currently just letting the hacker play his games.  And by the way I had disconnected all equipment including my sonos system, my dvd player, tv and even replaced all the cable equipment.  Do you really think the likelihood is that this guy is a neighbor?  Could he get into my system through icloud or gmail?  Is there a service I can hire to catch this person?  Will the police actually do anything?
