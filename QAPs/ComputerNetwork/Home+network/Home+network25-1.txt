â˜…What risks do wireless networks expose in home networks?
If a proper encryption schema is not used or a flawed one (such as WEP or WPS) is used in the case of a wireless network in home, then anyone can get unauthorized access, or hack into the wireless network, can sniff data as well as spoof them for their dirty job or ultimately to get into any device connected to it-such as a PC, laptop or a smartphone. Some countermeasures are: 1.To turn off WPS. 2.To use WPA 2. 3.Limit the range of the router to the home vicinity. 4.And the best of all is to use strong password. I'm not saying that WPA 2 cannot be cracked, but it requires a lot of patience which most people lack and it discourages them to go on further.
