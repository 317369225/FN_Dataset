â˜…What big-picture questions about digital signage/digital out of home networks still need to be answered?What high-level questions commonly asked by C- or VP-level execs still lack satisfying answers, and which are the most troublesome?
The biggest one is the financial ROI. Will putting a screen in the right place at the right time with the right content not only justify the cost of the deployment, but will it turn a profit? The biggest question is: How do I make money with this? The competing input from agencies, consultants, hardware and software resellers, online sites, and internal research will only yield different answers to the same question. The answer is different for every single entity. Because no two networks are the same, no two answers are the same. And where one size of content would fit all (which made it easy for agencies to propose the ROI), the unique audiences and needs compound the work needed to create relevant, compelling experiences.
