â˜…What are good options for home network storage and backup?
I have a similar setup: 1. iMac Workstation 2. MacBook Laptop 3. Mac Mini Server 4. Drobo w/4x2TB Protected storage Drobo is attached to the mac mini. OS X includes software called time machine which can automatically backup to external storage (the drobo attached to the maci mini). Mac Mini maintains shared media files (video, audio, pictures) and also acts as a media hub via Plex and attaching to my television. I'm sure you could do something similar with PCs. Drobo is compatible with Windows also and fairly affordable and supports hot swapping/upgrading of drives.
