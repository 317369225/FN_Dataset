★What will Apple’s smart home network look like?
It's easy to make small computing devices which talk by wireless. At the simplest level, these could turn lights on and off. We could throw in sensors that see where people are and measure temperature,  look for smoke or spot intruders. Some devices could be more sophisticated. The networked device might intelligently manage the appliance. Or report back if something needs attention.   For instance, the freezer could send out an alert if door is left open.  Or the TV could switch to the channel that you were watching upstairs. The difficult part of all of this is the interface.  How do you present this mass of devices,  modality and functionality to consumers without complexity and annoyance. To win this territory, Apple would need to make a magical interface. One that works without any real need to see that complexity.   New devices just join the club and don't need setting-up.  Stuff would works the way you expect it to.  Users only go to a screen if they want something special. If Apple is going to make a wearable device, the job of the device will be to tell this system who is in the room. And if the system knows about the person, and the context, it can control the devices without any explicit intervention.  "He's watching TV, the big lights should be off. The sound system on. His favourite channels are at the top of the list. The kids are in bed, lets keep the volume under 3" If this is done right, it could be a big thing. The sort of  world-changing big.  If I am right, in ten years time, we might watch a movie, and tell whether it was made back in the day when people still had to operate light switches by hand.
