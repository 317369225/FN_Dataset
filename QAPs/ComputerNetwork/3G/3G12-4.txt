â˜…What are the differences between 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G?There's been an evolution in this telecommunications technology over the years, with nomenclatures like 2.5G etc. Recently, Samsung has claimed a breakthrough with 5G: Samsung claims 5G tech breakthrough What does all this actually mean? How has the technology evolved that would result in it being called "xG"?
To add to the already good answers, there is some controversy over the term "4G" HSPA is supposed to be 3.5G but HSPA+ is of course better than plain HSPA. Some people like to call HSPA+ 3.75G. And some telcos, eager to ... well lets call it put a positive spin on it round off the 3.75 into 4 and just call it 4G. Its analogous to HD and full HD. HD is of course lower in resolution than full HD. But people dont like to call their products by inferior names such as "medium def" or "lower than high def". So they instead took the good name, "high" in HD and gave the better tech another name, "full" as in full HD. LTE and wimax before wimax-M like wimax-E almost but not quite meet all definitions of 4G. One thing they don't meet is the requirement of 100 mbps bandwidth for stationary users. Some people call LTE and wimax E as 3.9G. And as with HSPA+, the telcos are only too happy to round it off to 4G to make it sound better. It is after all only a small distance away from 4G. LTE-advanced and wimax-M are almost ready. What will the telcos call it to differentiate it from LTE/wimax-E that they already call 4G? Of course the telcos want to make the old users feel that they have an inferior product, last years model so they need a name that reflects that and induces the consumer to upgrade. Some telcos might use the name "full 4G" or "advanced 4G". Some go all the way and appropriate the name "5G" even if the 5G stadard isnt out yet
