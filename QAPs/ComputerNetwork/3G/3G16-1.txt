â˜…Where is the "Enable 3G" option in the iPhone 4S settings?What section in iPhone 4S settings is the "enable 3G" option and is it still called that?
I have an iPhone 4S and the option is there under Settings-General-Network for Enable 3G, Mobile Data and Mobile Data Network. Not sure if it has always been there as I am now checking before international travel.
