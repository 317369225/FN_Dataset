â˜…What is the best 3G USB data card for Mumbai? Why?In terms of coverage, speed and reliability. Providers include Reliance, Tata Docomo, MTNL, MTS
Vodafone has a 3G data card and so does MTNL. Both Tata Photon Plus and Reliance Netconnect Plus are EVDO Rev A with a maximum download speed of 3.1 Mbps. MTS recently announced they will soon offer EVDO Rev B with a maximum download speed of 14.7 Mbps. In my experience, Vodafone 3G is poor and coverage is quite bad. Don't know about MTNL. I've used both Tata Photon Plus and Reliance Netconnect Plus and have had issues at various spots with both. While both are fairly good in Mumbai, I feel Tata Photon Plus has an edge. However, in terms of all-India coverage, Reliance is better.
