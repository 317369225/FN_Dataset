★What is a 3G Wifi router and the uses of a 3G Wifi router?
I'm not familiar with this term, but I suspect it refers to a device more commonly known (to me, at least) as a "hotspot": a device that operates both a 3G radio and a WiFi radio, allowing multiple devices to connect to it via WiFi and thereby use the 3G connection to the Internet.  It's essentially what most nontechie people would call a "wifi router", except instead of having an Ethernet (or DSL or cable) connection to the Internet, it has a 3G radio for that purpose. (Aside: I hate the fact that most people call gateways "routers".  Routers are a very specific class of hardware, and most gateways are not smart enough to be routers.)
