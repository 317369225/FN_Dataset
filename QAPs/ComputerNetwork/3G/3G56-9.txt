★Why don't netbook/Ultrabook laptops (particularly the MacBook Air) have 3G/4G connectivity?Given that iPads have it, and it would make life so much more convenient to have it built-in. Some (but not most) laptops, for example the Sony VAIO Z, have optional 3G/4G connectivity, but these tend to be expensive, high-end/business laptops. Why isn't the option more widespread/mainstream/common?
Cost.  Cost.  Cost. If you're like me in the past you didn't pay $100 a month for your cell phone.  And now you do.  And you can't live without it.  But then you're paying $100 a month for your wife's cell phone service too.  And the combination is starting to hurt.  So when you think about whether you need to spend another $60 a month or whatever for a two year contract to get 3G wireless for your laptop, not many people go for it. An iPad with 3G capability might cost you an extra $139 up front.  But at $50/month for 5GB on Verizon for the life of a two-year contract, you'll end up paying Verizon $1200.  You could buy two more Wi-Fi iPads for that much.  And a laptop consumes data even faster than an iPad. This summer Verizon is supposedly going to roll out their 'family' plans, allowing you to pay for data across multiple devices.  It is POSSIBLE that these plans will increase the willingness of people to have more devices with 3G service on them.
