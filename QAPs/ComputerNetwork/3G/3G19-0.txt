â˜…How good is the 3G coverage in Morocco?I'll be visiting Morocco for holidays, I haven't been for 4 years and now I have an Iphone, and an IPad, and wondered if i could use apps such as foursquare when i'm there
I used a Samsung Galaxy S while I lived in Errachidia, which is on the east side of the Atlas Mountains and just north of the Sahara. It's about as out in the sticks as you can get in Morocco, with the exception of the Western Sahara. I worked remotely for my home office in Chicago and used internet-sharing from the 3G connection in the phone for both my computer and my wife's. I also used that connection for making Skype calls. Youtube was a little slow, but tolerable. Maroc Telecom is the provider I used ($25 for unlimited 3G; no contract, just buy the SIM at any little store). I imagine you'll sticking to the major cities, so you won't have any problems at all.
