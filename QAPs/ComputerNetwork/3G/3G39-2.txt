â˜…Where is the disable 3G, enable 2G option on Samsung Galaxy Grand?Does anyone know how to disable 3G on a Samsung Galaxy Grand? Ideally I would want to disable 3G but continue using 2G to access internet/apps. At my work place 3G reception aint great hence there's constant switching from 3G to 2G and vice versa eventually resulting in a faster battery drain.
As far as I know (and I might be wrong) there is no option to do this on a Samsung Galaxy Grand. One way to disable 3G is by telling your service provider to stop 3G services. For example Idea users can sms the code DEACT3G to a specific number. The details are on their website. Check out the website of your service provider. Or call their call centre. :-) Thanks for the A2A.
