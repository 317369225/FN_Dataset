★Why don't netbook/Ultrabook laptops (particularly the MacBook Air) have 3G/4G connectivity?Given that iPads have it, and it would make life so much more convenient to have it built-in. Some (but not most) laptops, for example the Sony VAIO Z, have optional 3G/4G connectivity, but these tend to be expensive, high-end/business laptops. Why isn't the option more widespread/mainstream/common?
Tethering is a much better solution.  That way my wireless carrrier - and 3G/4G data choice is separate from my laptop choice.  Plus I can then easily swap SIM's when I'm out of the country, etc.
