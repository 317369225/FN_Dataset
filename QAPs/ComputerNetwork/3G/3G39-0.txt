â˜…Where is the disable 3G, enable 2G option on Samsung Galaxy Grand?Does anyone know how to disable 3G on a Samsung Galaxy Grand? Ideally I would want to disable 3G but continue using 2G to access internet/apps. At my work place 3G reception aint great hence there's constant switching from 3G to 2G and vice versa eventually resulting in a faster battery drain.
Personally I use a Samsung S3, but the TouchWiz overlay should remain the same or similar. Do let me know incase this doesn't work and I'll figure out how to better help you. 1. Go to Settings. 2. Go to More Settings under WiFi/Bluetooth/Data Usage 3. Go to Mobile Networks 4. Here you should get 3 options GSM/WCDMA(Auto Mode), GSM Only & WCDMA Only. 5. Select GSM Only option for 2G. You should be good to go!
