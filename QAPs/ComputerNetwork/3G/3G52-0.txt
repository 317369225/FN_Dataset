â˜…How well do AT&T 3G Microcells work at home?I particularly want to know whether I should be getting only one, or two, especially for a home that has multiple floors, all with bad reception
I finally got mine set up, and I'm pretty disappointed. Coverage is not noticeably better - I already had so-so coverage, and now I have so-so coverage. I still drop calls. I still miss calls that never ring the phone just go to voicemail. And I have a new problem: sometimes a call comes in and the audio is vibrating and resonating and totally impossible to hear, and I need to hang up and try again. In my experience I can't identify anything that is better with the Microcell, unfortunately
