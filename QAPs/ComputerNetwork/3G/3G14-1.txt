â˜…What is the best 3G USB data card for Mumbai? Why?In terms of coverage, speed and reliability. Providers include Reliance, Tata Docomo, MTNL, MTS
Reliance 3G data card works really well. Have been using it for several months and am very happy with it - great speeds and great coverage. Customer service is surprisingly good. Software is great too. Vodafone 3G data card on the other hand was absolutely terrible. Never got 3G speeds on it. Customer service is worse than aweful. Slow software.
