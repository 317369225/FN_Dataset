★What is the cheapest way to have 3G access world wide?Just prepaid or monthly subscriptions.
Sadly, there aren't many good solutions to this anymore.  Tmobile and Verizon used to have great global data packages but over the past couple years have pared them back to be rather stingy and uneconomical.  If you're going to be in one or two countries primarily (or just in the EU) it makes the most sense to get a local SIM w/ a large data package and use Google Voice or Skype to stay connected on the voice side of things. If you're way off the beaten path, try Googling or using Flyertalk to determine whether there's a good high-data package available in the country of your destination.  Otherwise you may have to bite the bullet and suck up the roaming charges with your carrier's plan.  At a minimum, call them though and make sure you're on the most generous roaming plan available.  Most carriers still have some sort of roaming plan that gives you an allocation of minutes/MB in roaming countries.
