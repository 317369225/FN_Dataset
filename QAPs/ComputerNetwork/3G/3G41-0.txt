â˜…Why was OFDMA not used in 3G?If using OFDMA has increased our internet speed in LTE then why was OFDMA not used in 3G, since this technology has been known for more than 50 years?
i don't know the reason exactly but i can tell you the probable reason. chip integration and circuit implementation! though these modulation techniques were there from the ages, the implementation circuits were not that easy to make. this is the reason why the microwave oven was costing as much as an average family's income for an year in the 60s. in 2004, when i have read that 4g has been successfully tested in Germany, it was said that the receiver was as big as a refrigerator. now a refrigerator sized circuit needed to be crammed into a very tiny chip that can be fit into your mobile phone. this obviously takes lot of expertise in design and the integration technology of cramming billions of transistors into a tiny chip. the OFDM and other modulation techniques are nothing but mathematics. they are the ways in which you can transmit the information reliably and quickly. but the implementation in terms of electronics takes years to realise atleast at that size. the 3g you are talking about was implemented in 2001 even before the colour mobile screens came into existence which were probably not that complex.
