â˜…How good is the 3G coverage in Morocco?I'll be visiting Morocco for holidays, I haven't been for 4 years and now I have an Iphone, and an IPad, and wondered if i could use apps such as foursquare when i'm there
3G coverage is good in most towns and cities and along highways and railways. Do note, however, that the iPhone and iPad are not marketed in Morocco and none of the three mobile providers (Maroc Telecom, Meditel and Inwi) offer support for these devices. I was unable to get 3G working on my iPhone with a Meditel prepaid card. Data roaming works fine, but it'll cost you.
