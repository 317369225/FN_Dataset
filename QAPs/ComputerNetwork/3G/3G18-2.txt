★What is the difference between 3G and 3D?
Both the terms 3G and 3D are way different than each others and used for different perspectives. Details mentioned below. 3G Stands For Third Generation Of Mobile And Telecommunications Technology. This term is broadly used for Mobile and Telecommunication Technologies only.  3G telecommunication is the standard used to define the data or information transfer rate to achieve mobile internet access or fixed wireless internet access. The minimum data or information transfer rate in 3G is atleast 200 kbit/s. Arrival of 4G enhances this data transfer rate further. Whereas 3D stands for 3 Dimensional and its the graphical representation of any object/drawing in 3 Dimensional. 3D refers physical representation of the object in 3 Dimensional space which originally captured on a 2D (2 Dimentional) environment. e.g. 3D computer graphics will be a three-dimensional representation of geometric data. Similarly 3D Movies, 3D TV Shows, 3D Printing and 3D Modelling are representation of three-dimensional surface or object created on specific 2D object/material/device. Most of the time to view the illusion of depth perception, you may need a 3D glass. Also arrival of 4D Movies enhances the experience of 3D beyond glasses. 3D Mobile Phone is one of the technology which combines 3G and 3D on one single device.
