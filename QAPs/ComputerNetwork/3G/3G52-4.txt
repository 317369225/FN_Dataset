â˜…How well do AT&T 3G Microcells work at home?I particularly want to know whether I should be getting only one, or two, especially for a home that has multiple floors, all with bad reception
I bought a Microcell yesterday. My experience with it thus far is mixed. -Acquisition: Currently, you must go to an AT&T store to get a Microcell. You can not order them online. I made the mistake of going to the store midday, so my wait time was about 30 minutes. Once I was being served, things went smoothly. I ended up spending roughly $150. There was a $100 mail in rebate I did not take advantage of. -Setup: Flawless. Went online and registered using my AT&T account, you can add up to 10 phone numbers with the device. You have to enter the device location (required for E911). The device needs to be located next to a window (GPS signal, again for E911). I placed it on a window sill that gets almost no line of sight to the sky, but I still got a GPS lock within a minute or two. The device was completely initialized after five minutes. -Results: Bad. The biggest problem is that my phone still associates with the tower (1/2 bars) even when it's in range of the Microcell. Sometimes powering my phone off and on again will cause it to start using the Microcell. I have also experienced a dropped call when the phone was associated with the Microcell. The return policy is 30 days + $30 restocking fee. I'm going to keep testing it for another week before I bring it back.
