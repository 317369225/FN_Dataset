â˜…What is the practical use of 3G in India?
To book a taxi in middle of the night, to VoIP family when you are alone, to Stream World Cup when you are travelling, to load Quora (apparently quora sucks on 2G). Also if you have a high end smart phone...you need 3G to match up and stop being called a spendthrift :P
