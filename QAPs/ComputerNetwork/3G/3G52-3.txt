★How well do AT&T 3G Microcells work at home?I particularly want to know whether I should be getting only one, or two, especially for a home that has multiple floors, all with bad reception
I like mine for the home office but it only works well when I'm in the same room with it.  If I'm two rooms away, it typically goes back to the 3G tower instead of the Microcell.  Haven't had any drop calls once the Microcell call is established. For me, it is worth the $50 (after $100 rebate) but I would be annoyed if I didn't have a traditional land line and was forced to buy multiple Microcells throughout the house.
