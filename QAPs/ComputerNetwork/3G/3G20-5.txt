â˜…What is the cheapest way to have 3G access world wide?Just prepaid or monthly subscriptions.
Blackberry + T-mobile USA. $20/month above the price of any plan for unlimited international 3G access. You can prorate it for the part of the month you're out. It's advertised as an "international e-mail" plan but you can get unlimited web browsing if you have get the settings "right" by clearing your APN. (The default APN settings of epc.t-mobile.com or wap.voicestream.com will get you hit with $15/MB roaming charge which will probably cost you your life savings -- get rid of the APN.) I wouldn't overuse it though, just so you don't show up on the radar. This unlimited international internet thing is not advertised as such, and the customer service reps don't know much about how it works either, so don't bother asking them (you'll get different responses from different employees). Also, I'm pretty sure you can't be out roaming for more than some several weeks continuously.
