★Where is the "Enable 3G" option in the iPhone 4S settings?What section in iPhone 4S settings is the "enable 3G" option and is it still called that?
Unfortunately, this option has been removed in the version of iOS 5 for the iPhone 4S, although it is still available in iOS 5 on older iPhones (apart from the CDMA iPhone 4). In iOS 5, unlike in previous iOS versions, the mobile network carrier you use decides whether or not to enable the 3G switch in their carrier settings file for the iPhone. This setting is opt-in, so "it will not be available for any carrier who has not specifically added the option (which is almost all of them)." The option is also redundant for legacy CDMA carriers, since turning off 3G had the exact same effect as turning off cellular data – they have no 2G GSM/EDGE network to fall back to. Unfortunately, there is not currently a way to hack or modify the carrier settings file on the iPhone 4S to enable the 3G on/off switch. I asked at the Apple Store in Cambridge, UK and was told it was "because the iPhone 4S is a world phone", which fits in with CDMA carriers not having a GSM 2G network to fall back on. Reportedly, iOS 5.1 will add this option back to the iPhone 4S settings.
