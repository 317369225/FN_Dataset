â˜…How well do AT&T 3G Microcells work at home?I particularly want to know whether I should be getting only one, or two, especially for a home that has multiple floors, all with bad reception
Mine works flawlessly. I have five bars for most of the house, four bars in the addition. Without it I have no reception at all. I've reset it on rare occasions when it didn't recover from the cable modem's flakiness. (Cable service here is horrendously bad.)
