â˜…Will LTE handsets require additional 2G/3G chipsets in order to roam on 2G/3G networks?3GPP suggests that LTE should inter-work with GSM and UMTS/HSPA/HSPA+. However, it isn't clear if this support applies to the equipment technology or if LTE chipsets will also inherently support GSM/HSPA.
Yes they will still require an additional 2G/3G chipset. This is until Qualcomm makes available the first LTE + 2G + 3G chipset sometime in 2011
