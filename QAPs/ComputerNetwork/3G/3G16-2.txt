â˜…Where is the "Enable 3G" option in the iPhone 4S settings?What section in iPhone 4S settings is the "enable 3G" option and is it still called that?
This option is not available in iOS 5 on the iPhone 4S. Network connectivity is handled automatically. Some background: http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/a...
