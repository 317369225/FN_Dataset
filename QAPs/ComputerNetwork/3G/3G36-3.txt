â˜…How reliable is the 3G in Sydney, Australia?I'm moving to Sydney in a month and was curious how dependable 3G is in the city and what the estimated monthly costs may be.
Visited Sydney a few years ago and went as far as Sussex to go fishing with friends. My friend used her 3G pretty much the whole way and didn't look frustrated. I'd say it's quite reliable (before signing up with an ISP there, you can compare various plans and get the best mobile broadband at comparebroadband).
