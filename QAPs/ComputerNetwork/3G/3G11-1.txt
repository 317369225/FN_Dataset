â˜…What are the best 3G prepaid plans in Odisha?What are the best 3G prepaid plans in Odisha and who are the providers for these ?
Whatever you do, don't buy yourself a Reliance 3G plan. It is the worst kind of service provider. I had a post-paid Reliance 3G connection and ultimately have had to surrender that and opt for a Tata photon+. Among the service providers, BSNL probably has the better network coverage, although it is nothing great!
