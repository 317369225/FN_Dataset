★Why don't netbook/Ultrabook laptops (particularly the MacBook Air) have 3G/4G connectivity?Given that iPads have it, and it would make life so much more convenient to have it built-in. Some (but not most) laptops, for example the Sony VAIO Z, have optional 3G/4G connectivity, but these tend to be expensive, high-end/business laptops. Why isn't the option more widespread/mainstream/common?
I think for the (MacBook Air at least) it comes down to Apple pushing the "Post-PC era"agenda. By restricting celular connectivity to their iOS product line, they are creating a demand for iOS products while avoiding ubiquity in their product lines. Also, the ( Verizon) iPad w/ 4G is able to serve as a wireless hotspot without additional carrier fees, hopefully eliminating the problem for many. Ultimately, we may see 4G LTE or LTE-A  make its way into the MBA down the road, but i would guess that data prices, bandwidth concerns, and lack of worldwide LTE coverage will prevent apple from adding the feature any time soon. As for Ultra books in general, I would assume Verizon and AT&T are in no rush to open their new spectrum to bandwith-hungry data hogs off contract when they already have you locked in for 2-years on a smart-phone data plan, especially as more 4G devices are activated.
