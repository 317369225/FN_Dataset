★What is the cheapest way to have 3G access world wide?Just prepaid or monthly subscriptions.
I have had very good experience for short trips abroad with XCom Global.  They charge $14.95/day for either a USB modem or a MiFi hotspot with unlimited data usage over 3G networks. I have successfully used them in Denmark, France, Germany, and the Czech Republic without any issues.  What I did was turn off data roaming on my iPhone, but still leave my Cellular Radio enabled so that I could still receive texts and phone calls.  I then had the MiFi hotspot hooked up to an external USB battery, which I then left running for most of the day in a backpack. I also had it hooked up to a cigarette lighter adapter when taking a road trip from one part of France to another so that I could properly use  GPS/Waze/Google Maps/Yelp to get around. That way I always had data connectivity when roaming around as if I was back home using my phone like normal. XCom Global web site: MiFi Rentals for International Data Service & Global Internet Access
