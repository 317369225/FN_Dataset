â˜…Why don't netbook/Ultrabook laptops (particularly the MacBook Air) have 3G/4G connectivity?Given that iPads have it, and it would make life so much more convenient to have it built-in. Some (but not most) laptops, for example the Sony VAIO Z, have optional 3G/4G connectivity, but these tend to be expensive, high-end/business laptops. Why isn't the option more widespread/mainstream/common?
It's not the cost of the chipset / antenna, etc, it's the cost of the Intellectual Property. One of the ways that mobile IPR licensing works is that you owe some of the creators of the 2G/3G/4G standards a proportion of the final sale price of the whole device. That's bad enough on a $500 phone / tablet, not a fixed fee per unit. On a $1500 MacBook Air, that could increase the sale price by >$200. I wouldn't pay that when I could just buy a $50 dongle or tether to my phone, so it's a very hard sell.
