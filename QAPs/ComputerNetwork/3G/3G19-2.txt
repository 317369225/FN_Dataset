â˜…How good is the 3G coverage in Morocco?I'll be visiting Morocco for holidays, I haven't been for 4 years and now I have an Iphone, and an IPad, and wondered if i could use apps such as foursquare when i'm there
3G cover is actually pretty good down here. You'll be able to use mobile apps without any problem. In large cities like Casablanca or Marrakesh, I'm able to use high demanding apps like Viber without any problem. My favorite provider is Meditel.
