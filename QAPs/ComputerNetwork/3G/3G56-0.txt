★Why don't netbook/Ultrabook laptops (particularly the MacBook Air) have 3G/4G connectivity?Given that iPads have it, and it would make life so much more convenient to have it built-in. Some (but not most) laptops, for example the Sony VAIO Z, have optional 3G/4G connectivity, but these tend to be expensive, high-end/business laptops. Why isn't the option more widespread/mainstream/common?
For a few reasons: • Cost: It isn't cost-effective to put in a 3G/4G chip into a machine that hardly requires it. Many urban/sub-urban localities have free WiFi available in a plethora of shops anyway.  • Battery: The battery life will probably whither to a pulp after strenuous use. If a smartphone battery sees significant decrease in battery life with 3G/4G, a machine that needs much more data for ample Internet consumption like the MacBook Air will probably see huge battery life drops. • Expensive: You mentioned the MacBook Air which has very high pixel densities both 11" & 13". You're looking at a lot more data needed to push pixels to a screen of that density resulting data caps to maximize very quick. Especially if HD content is consumed daily. •Speed: This one can be debated but 3G speeds can hardly keep up to par with general Internet consumption but they can none the less. 4G is probably the most suitable for speed but once again battery issues.
