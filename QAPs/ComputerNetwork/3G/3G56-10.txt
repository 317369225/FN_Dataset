â˜…Why don't netbook/Ultrabook laptops (particularly the MacBook Air) have 3G/4G connectivity?Given that iPads have it, and it would make life so much more convenient to have it built-in. Some (but not most) laptops, for example the Sony VAIO Z, have optional 3G/4G connectivity, but these tend to be expensive, high-end/business laptops. Why isn't the option more widespread/mainstream/common?
I think that it might be because 3G network isn't that fast yet. When using 3G on iPhone you accept that it might be a little slow, rather than on a computer where everything should be blazing fast.
