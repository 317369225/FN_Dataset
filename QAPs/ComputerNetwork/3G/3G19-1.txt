â˜…How good is the 3G coverage in Morocco?I'll be visiting Morocco for holidays, I haven't been for 4 years and now I have an Iphone, and an IPad, and wondered if i could use apps such as foursquare when i'm there
To be honest, 3G covering is even better than water and electricity covering in some remote areas. So you wont face any kind of problem to use your apps
