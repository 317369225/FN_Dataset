â˜…What is difference between 2G and 3G?
Rupert Baines's answer is spot on, but here are a few more details. Standard 2G has no internet connectivity. The are two main types of 2G - Code division multiple access (CDMA) and Time division multiple access (TDMA). The standard adopted in Europe is GSM, which is a TDMA-based standard. The United States still uses CDMA but many of the other countries which started using CDMA have since switched to GSM, for example India. 2.5G refers to 2G networks which also support General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). This gives you internet connectivity, but only with a fairly modest throughput. 2.75G is Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE). This squeezes every last bit of internet bandwidth out of GSM by using clever compression and transmission techniques. EDGE can be up to three times quicker than regular GPRS. 3G refers to Universal Mobile Telecommunications System in Europe and CDMA2000 in the United States. The radio frequencies used by 3G are different to the ones used by 2G networks so the cost to the operators of upgrading from 2G to 3G is high, both in terms of installing new infrastructure and purchasing licenses for the required frequencies. 3G networks were designed with data transmission in mind so the internet connectivity is usually much faster than on a 2G network. 3.5G or 3.75G can be used to refer to High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA and HSPA+), which is an enhancement to 3G analogous to EDGE for 2G. The potential data rates are theoretically above 100 Mbps, but rarely approach this in practice. My phone (an HTC Trophy running WinMo7) shows an icon containing a single letter at the top of the screen when a data connection is available. This letter indicates the available network type as follows: G - GPRS E - EDGE 3 - 3G H - HSDPA
