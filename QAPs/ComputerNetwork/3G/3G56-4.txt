â˜…Why don't netbook/Ultrabook laptops (particularly the MacBook Air) have 3G/4G connectivity?Given that iPads have it, and it would make life so much more convenient to have it built-in. Some (but not most) laptops, for example the Sony VAIO Z, have optional 3G/4G connectivity, but these tend to be expensive, high-end/business laptops. Why isn't the option more widespread/mainstream/common?
It can be added, but it will be costly for the customer. Imagine having to pay a wireless bill for an iPhone, iPad and a MacBook Air. With the latest update on the iPhone, customers have the ability to use the iPhone's 3G connection via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or USB. As a matter of fact, I was using my MacBook Air today for 3 hours outdoors while using my iPhone 4S's connection via Bluetooth. The MacBook lost about 40% battery while the iPhone lost about 50%.
