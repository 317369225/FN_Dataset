★What are the best 3G prepaid plans in Odisha?What are the best 3G prepaid plans in Odisha and who are the providers for these ?
Aircel sim ₹400 for 6 GB data. After use, buy another sim. Aircel is 4 times faster than Reliance, so its worth paying the extra 100/-. Moreover, u get 6 GB at once in Aircel, whereas in Reliance you get 2+2+2 GB in every 30 days, which means once 2Gb is over, you have to wait till it renews. Chose Aircel 3G for better and faster experience. Edit: Aircel has revised prices. Now 6 Gb Sim is 2+2+2 for 90 days for ₹450. And there is a 30 day 4 Gb sim for ₹300. Edit2: The 30 day 4Gb sim has become 3GB, with price at still ₹300. Reliance 6GB is now ₹380 with worst speeds. Never expect speed to touch the triple figure mark. On the other hand, Aircel had quite a few times shown speeds like 1.13MB/s on normal download, and 1.67 MB/s on a multi part download. Edit3: Now  Airtel and Vodafone have also launched 3G services . But Airtel has very expensive rates. Moreover , in my area Vodafone is facing connectivity problems . So I still prefer Aircel . I took a Speedtest  by Ookla and found that Aircel gave 1170 KB/s  as download speed. ​ ​
