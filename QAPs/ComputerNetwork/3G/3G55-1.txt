â˜…What the best PrePay GSM/3G data option in Germany?Plan to use my iPhone during a couple weeks long visit in Germany and would like to know what's the best option to the GSM/3G data in Germany on PrePay. If the most cost-effective is different than the most reliable please mention that in your answer.
