â˜…Which 3G provider should I use in China?I'm going to China for a month. I know it's easy to buy cellphone cards, but don't know about 3G USB dongles. Which company is the best service provider, and is service sold with the dongle like in the U.S., or separately, as is the case with cellphones? Should I go with China Mobile, China Unicom, or someone else?
If you are using Verizon, go to China Telecom, if you don't need data, go to China Mobile, other than that, go to China Unicom
