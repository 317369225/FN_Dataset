â˜…How reliable is the 3G in Sydney, Australia?I'm moving to Sydney in a month and was curious how dependable 3G is in the city and what the estimated monthly costs may be.
Vodafone has an appalling network in Sydney, especially for data and even in the city itself. Both Optus and Telstra are reliable, though Telstra is generally better and faster.
