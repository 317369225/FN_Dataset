â˜…Where is the disable 3G, enable 2G option on Samsung Galaxy Grand?Does anyone know how to disable 3G on a Samsung Galaxy Grand? Ideally I would want to disable 3G but continue using 2G to access internet/apps. At my work place 3G reception aint great hence there's constant switching from 3G to 2G and vice versa eventually resulting in a faster battery drain.
Thanks for A2A. I am also not familiar with Grand UI, but I think what Arjun Burgula mentioned should work (Settings->More networks->Mobile network). Play around with the options inside More Networks, it should be there somewhere.
