â˜…Why are 3G signals slow when riding a train?Is it because of the speed or bad coverage?
Essentially before any data communication can take place we need to learn the channel. This process is called channel training. The basic model involving the received data y from a transmitted data x through channel h is y=h*x +w in presence of noise w. So it is clear that we need to know h before detecting x. The time the channel remains constant ( called the channel coherence time) is important. Because a smaller coherence time implies the channel is changing frequently implying that we frequently need to relearn the channel, during which we cannot communicate any data ie x in the model leading to a drop in data throughput. This could be one of the reasons why in fast moving trains data throughput drops.
