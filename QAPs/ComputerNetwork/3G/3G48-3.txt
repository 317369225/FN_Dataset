â˜…How well does the Kindle 3G work in China?
Last year (2011), I was able to access all the web sites from Kindle 3G in China. However, this year, besides Wikipedia and Amazon, it did not allow me to access any other web sites such as Yahoo, BBC, or even Google. I tried it in several cities and the results are the same.
