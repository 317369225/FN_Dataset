â˜…Will there ever be an iPod Touch with a 3G radio?
I am starting to wonder whether there might be. The iPad ships in WiFi and 3G/LTE versions. So we could imagine Apple adding 3G or LTE to the touch and charging an additional $70/$100 But as Mitchell Yamada says, what would be the point? How would it differentiate itself from the iPhone? It would be a cheaper device. Because it would not be a true phone. It would not have a number you could call. It would be sold in different channels. It would sell to younger consumers interested in connectivity but not interested in a phone number and contract. So while there would remain a strong market for a conventional phone. I think this device would be an attractive option for a different demographic - one interested in social networking / gaming This is one area where Apple are much stronger than the Android platform and I think Apple needs to work out how to slowly shift power away from carriers and Samsung-controlled carrier shops.
