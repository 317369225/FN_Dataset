â˜…Why are the 3G data charges in India so overpriced?Can we expect any decrease in the prices? They are simply unbearable :(
Price for 3G internet is not high if compared with other countries. Although it is still expensive in India. Due to the spectrum and poor connection. Although don't worry. 4G is already here. Let it grow. Then the 3G prices will be come down.
