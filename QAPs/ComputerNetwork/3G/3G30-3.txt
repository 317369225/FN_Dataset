â˜…Why are 3G signals slow when riding a train?Is it because of the speed or bad coverage?
Traveling in a train has 2 factors which could cause 3G signals to be slow. 1 .. Faraday Cage effect - A train encloses you and your phone inside a steel cage, which makes radio reception difficult. 2 .. In a train, if you travel at velocities > 120 Kmph, there is a big drop in the theoretical data-rate. The 3G data-rate at igh speed is in fact much better than 2G, in fact this was one of the requirements when 3G was being developed. If you see section 4.1 of the following spec, 3G notches a good 384 Kbps at 120 Kmph. Page on Etsi
