â˜…Where is the disable 3G, enable 2G option on Samsung Galaxy Grand?Does anyone know how to disable 3G on a Samsung Galaxy Grand? Ideally I would want to disable 3G but continue using 2G to access internet/apps. At my work place 3G reception aint great hence there's constant switching from 3G to 2G and vice versa eventually resulting in a faster battery drain.
If your grand is running latest os 4.2.2, Go to > Settings On the Connection (first) tab >More networks >MobileNetworks here you will see your both SIM, select the on which you want to switch to 2G, and click on Only GSM.
