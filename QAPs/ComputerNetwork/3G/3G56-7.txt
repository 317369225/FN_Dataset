â˜…Why don't netbook/Ultrabook laptops (particularly the MacBook Air) have 3G/4G connectivity?Given that iPads have it, and it would make life so much more convenient to have it built-in. Some (but not most) laptops, for example the Sony VAIO Z, have optional 3G/4G connectivity, but these tend to be expensive, high-end/business laptops. Why isn't the option more widespread/mainstream/common?
In addition to the cost arguments listed above, another issue is carrier lock-in. Network incompatibility, especially in the U.S., would require laptop manufacturers to choose which carriers to support, or go the costly route of creating separate products for each network.
