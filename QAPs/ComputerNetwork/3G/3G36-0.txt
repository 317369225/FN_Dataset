★How reliable is the 3G in Sydney, Australia?I'm moving to Sydney in a month and was curious how dependable 3G is in the city and what the estimated monthly costs may be.
3G in Australia is generally very good - much better than I've experienced in SF. The best carrier is Telstra, with their super-fast "NextG" network, followed by Optus with standard 3G.  As for Vodafone, er, google 'Vodafail'. On Telstra, independent tests have reported download rates of 9Mbps, and I've personally had torrent speeds of 500KBps even way out in the country.  There are reports of more variable performance due to congestion in CBD Sydney (http://www.itwire.com/it-industr...), but it's still said to be much better than the other networks. If you're in the country for less than 12 months, you'd probably be best on a prepaid plan: http://www.telstra.com.au/mobile... Or if you'll be here for 12 months, a Freedom connect plan is better value: http://www.telstra.com.au/mobile... Also, if you just want a data service (no phonecalls), you can get a NextG mobile prepaid broadband service, with a USB dongle or WiFi router. http://www.telstra.com.au/bigpon...
