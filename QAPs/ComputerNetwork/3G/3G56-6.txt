★Why don't netbook/Ultrabook laptops (particularly the MacBook Air) have 3G/4G connectivity?Given that iPads have it, and it would make life so much more convenient to have it built-in. Some (but not most) laptops, for example the Sony VAIO Z, have optional 3G/4G connectivity, but these tend to be expensive, high-end/business laptops. Why isn't the option more widespread/mainstream/common?
It is all about cost.  The majority of netbook users don't need 3G access.  Sometimes it is also more profitable for companies to sell you an add-on accessory (say a 3G modem). The fact that one had to chose between GSM and CDMA in 3G communications was another constraint.
