â˜…What is the best 3G data prepaid plan in Malaysia?
3G Prepaid would be best from DiGi, just RM2 per day around the same price if you use Postpaid RM58 per month. Other operators you will see Prepaid charges more then the Postpaid. For coverage, if you are in Klang Valley area not a problem. They seems have upgraded since their partnership with TIMEdotcom, and now the speed is much more stable than before.
