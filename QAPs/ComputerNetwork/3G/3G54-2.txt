â˜…Which 3G provider should I use in China?I'm going to China for a month. I know it's easy to buy cellphone cards, but don't know about 3G USB dongles. Which company is the best service provider, and is service sold with the dongle like in the U.S., or separately, as is the case with cellphones? Should I go with China Mobile, China Unicom, or someone else?
The 3 carriers in China: CMCC, Unicom and CT all have different 3G standard, which needs to match your device's 3G protocol. If you use Android or iPhone, then you have WCDMA and you will HAVE to go w/ China Unicom for 3G. Have fun in China
