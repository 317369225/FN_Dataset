★Will a bird sitting on a power cable get electrocuted if its body resistance is lesser than the power cable?
No,if a bird is sitting on single power cable then it will not be electrocuted because it is not getting any earthing,we all see birds sitting over high tension cables even in rainy season. and YES if it touches both the cable and anything which is connected directly with earth.    Embed Quote
