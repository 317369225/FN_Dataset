★What will happen if I use a power cable that's not rated for my laptop?The original transformer was 19v and 4.74A, the one I'm trying now is 19.5v and 3.34A.
When you're looking at equipment and conductor ratings, current is more significant than voltage. Your new cable has a lower current rating, and that could be a problem. Your laptop should have a nameplate on the back that will indicate how much current the computer draws. As long as the laptop draws fewer amps than the rating of the transformer/ cable in use, you should be good to go. Otherwise, the transformer or cable may overheat, and that could spell trouble.    Embed Quote
