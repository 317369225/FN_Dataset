★What are the ways to increase the maximum electrical load on the network for a future bakery? There is 15kW, but it needs to be 60kW. One option is to get a set of new power cables, but how much is it going to cost?
That is going to be expensive, especially if the power company needs to install a larger transformer.    You might look into getting gas-powered ovens, a 60KW load is like $6 an hour of electricity, but only about $2 an hour of natural gas.    Embed Quote
