★Is it recommended to unplug a MacBook laptop when it's fully charged?I have the latest unibody MacBook Pro. I always keep it unplugged when it still has some battery charge left. I only plug it in when it needs to be charged (less than 20% remaining) and unplug it when fully charged. Is this recommended? Will this extend battery life? See especially #7 on http://forum.xda-developers.com/...
The battery life isn't affected much due to these actions. All you need to extend it a little is to keep it plugged after it is fully charged i.e. for about 30 minutes.    Embed Quote
