★Could Japan use HVDC submarine power cables to import electricity from other countries?Examples exist, for instance NorNed (connecting the electricity markets in Norway and Holland, total length 580 km, power rating 700 MW) and Basslink (connecting Victoria, on the Australian mainland, with the island State of Tasmania, total length 370 km, power rating 500 MW). South Korea, for example, is about 200 km away from the Southern Japanese State of Kyushu.
I posted this question.  Incidentally, a few days later, Masayoshi Son, the founder of Softbank (Japan), announced during a television segment that he is looking into the execution of this very idea!  A quick Google reveals that he has been talking about this idea for some time (e.g. Masayoshi Son "super grid" proposal). If anyone can do it, Son is probably the guy.    Embed Quote
