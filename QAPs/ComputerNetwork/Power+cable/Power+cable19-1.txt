★Animal Behavior: Why are birds not electrocuted when they perch on power cables?I've always wondered why this is. Do their feet not conduct electricity? Or is there another explanation?
Birds' feet conduct electricity, but not as well as the materials that power lines are made out of (usually aluminum). When a bird sits on a power line, there are two ways that current could go: through the power line conductor or through the bird. How much current takes each path depends on a property called resistance, which is basically how easy it is for charge-carrying particles (which could be electrons or ions in solution) to move through it. The resistance of a power line conductor is very low, because otherwise it wouldn't be very good at doing its job. The resistance of a bird is much, much higher. (Most of that resistance isn't inside the bird itself, but in the points where the bird's skin contacts the conductor.) Therefore, even though there is a current flowing through the bird, it is very, very small compared to the current in the power line conductor, and small enough that the bird doesn't even feel it. If a bird touches two different conductors that are at different voltages, or touches a conductor and an object connected to the ground at the same time, a lot of current will go through the bird, and the bird will be killed. This is more likely to happen to large birds like hawks and eagles. In some places, power companies have installed devices on poles to prevent birds from perching in places where they could touch more than one conductor at once, or to cover up one of the conductors so they can't touch it. (They do this because it is required by law and because it improves the reliability of the power system.)    Embed Quote
