★Is it recommended to unplug a MacBook laptop when it's fully charged?I have the latest unibody MacBook Pro. I always keep it unplugged when it still has some battery charge left. I only plug it in when it needs to be charged (less than 20% remaining) and unplug it when fully charged. Is this recommended? Will this extend battery life? See especially #7 on http://forum.xda-developers.com/...
You can leave it plugged after being fully charged as long as you discharge it completely and recharge it back atleast once a month to keep up the battery health. Having said that if you are on a move and cannot find an outlet, try to discharge the battery as much as possible before recharging it back again. Apple says that Macbook Pro can last 1000 complete discharge and recharge cycles and only to reduce its battery capacity to 80%. That means even if you discharge and recharge on a daily basis, it will be 3 years for your battery to fall to 80% capacity. Hope that helps.    Embed Quote
