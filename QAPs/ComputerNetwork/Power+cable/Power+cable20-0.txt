★Electrical Grids: What do submarine power cables look like? How thick are the biggest ones?Interesting trivia would be appreciated, too :-)
Submarine power cable thickness depends on the type of cable that is being used. The smallest have a cross-sectional area of about 95 mm and the largest about 1,500 mm. They come in both 3 phase AC and single core DC (deployment lengths will vary). Telecommunications cables weigh from 0.7 kg /metre for unarmoured  deep-water types (example shown above left) to 4.8 kg/m for cables with two layers of steel armour protection. In contrast, Power cables weigh up to 140 kg/m depending upon type. The above is a turntable for cable deployment on the ship from where the cable in slowly lowered into the sea. Various Cross-sectional cut-outs of Submarine Power Cables. Deployment Engineers inspecting the cable on the turntable, you can get an idea as to how thick the cable is. Here is a picture of the Submarine Power Cable on the turntable inside a ship being stored. It takes a few days for the entire cable length to be stored on the turntable. Another reference as to how a cut-out section looks like, without the armour sheathing on it. Here is another cut-out section of the submarine power cable. At the back-end you can see the turntable for the cable. You may also want to read up on this question: Faisal Khan's answer to How are major undersea cables laid in the ocean?
