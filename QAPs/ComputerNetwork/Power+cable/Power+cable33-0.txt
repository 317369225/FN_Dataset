★Is there any intelligent way to find where 12v power cables lead to replace a faulty power box?I have several surveillance cameras in a strip center that are not working but I don't know how to find the power box to fix replace.
It's possible they're each powered by individual "wall wart" adapters - you may be looking for the wrong thing. They might go to a power bar somewhere, or each camera may be powered from a nearby wall outlet or extension cord. Normally a central power supply for cameras would be somewhere near the recorder... If it's not there, the signal lines may have been extended from a previous location, so you could try following those from the DVR and see where they go. Short of that... get ready to crawl through some ceilings.    Embed Quote
