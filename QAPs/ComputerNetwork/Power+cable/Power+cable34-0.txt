★Where can I source low voltage power cables with a wide range of different colours and material protective jacket?I'm looking to source different types of low voltage electrical cables other than the standard black. I have cables that have woven protective jackets and others that are purple and bright green. Does anyone know where it is possible to source this type of cabling?
Look at cable distributors for telephone BellWire cabling.  It has many twisted-pairs with distinctive color-coded insulation. The cabling can be bought with a number of outer casings, allowing for burying, running through AC plenums, special casing for risers(vertical runs), and other fire prevention materials.    Embed Quote
