★Would a defective underground power cable be less likely to cause lights to flicker in very cold temperatures that are well below freezing?We have a problem with flickering lights. Sometimes they flicker. Sometimes they don't. The electrician says the interior wiring is okay so, assuming this to be true, the problem is probably in the transformer or the underground power cable. I noticed that the problem disappears when it becomes very, very cold (below freezing). Does this suggest that dampness around a defective cable is the problem?
Do your lights flicker rapidly in every room? Or do they blink out for a second or two? I would think that if you had a failing underground delivery cable the ground fault current would be substantial and trip a breaker or crowbar depending on where the fault is and of course you'd have no power then.    Embed Quote
