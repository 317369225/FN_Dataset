★Why does a power cable have higher shunt capacitance than an overhead line?
Because a cable has so many layers of dielectric surrounding it, which runs as long as the conductor. The capacitance is so much that it has to be taken into consideration. An overhead line is seperated from the earth by air, and at regular intervals, by porcelain insulators. The capacitance is usually neglected for voltage levels under 20 KV and line lengths under 80 kms. For other lengths and voltage levels, it is taken into account but will always be less than that of an underground cable.    Embed Quote
