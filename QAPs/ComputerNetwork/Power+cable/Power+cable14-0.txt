★How do you avoid tripping over laptop power cables?This has happened twice today and I'm pissed. Apple has a maglock so this wouldn't happen on their laptop. However I am using my Windows laptop nowadays and the cable somehow tangled round my foot or something else and the moment I stand up the whole laptop smashes on the ground. I have to use a Windows laptop for software and engineering purposes.
As you mentioned, use a MacBook that doesn't have this issue Be more cautious of your surroundings Pick up your feet when you walk    Embed Quote
