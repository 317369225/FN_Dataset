★Are there real health risks of living near high voltage power cables?
Yes. If you grow trees that reach up close to power lines, if you don't keep them trimmed back, they can cause a short and catch fire.  That would be very bad for your health.  And your property. Here's a stick on a power line: My in-laws live next to a power substation, where the high voltage lines (500 kV) are stepped down to the 120V used in homes.  One time there was a failure at the substation and it triggered a plasma arc.  Getting close to one of those comes at the risk of getting zappity zap zapped, plus an arc at 500kV also generates some ionizing radiation, which is known to cause cancer in sufficiently large doses. Other than those two physical hazards (fire and electrocution), there's nothing else of any real concern.    Embed Quote
