★Do Apple's laptop power cables have a design flaw that allows them to easily fray?They frayed once got replaced, and then frayed again. First fraying was so bad computer no longer got power from cable.
I've had a MacBook Pro for the last five years and I haven't noticed one. I don't travel very much with it, so the cord doesn't get a huge amount of wear. There's a plastic coating on the outside of the cables, which are also covered in a thin metal mesh underneath the coating, which covers the actualy wires. I believe (correct me if I'm wrong) that this is to cut down on the diameter of the cord. The metal mesh is very thin, as is the plastic coating. Their cords do tend to be thinner than other laptop cords. Same with the USB charging cords for iPhones, iPads, iPods etc. They may have sacrificed some durability for size in this case. Whether that's a flaw depends on what is more important to you. If treated well, they last a decent amount of time. Even when the plastic cover comes off, they still work. I have some white duct tape that I use to repair cords where the plastic cladding has come off. Or you can just buy a new one at the Apple Store. :) Built-in obsolosence maybe, but not a design oversight.    Embed Quote
