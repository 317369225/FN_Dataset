The minimum clearance required to avoid ionisation and radio interference which may be regarded as a health risk is the distance between the live conductor and ground on which the transmission tower have been erected, according to the picture, the gap is large enough for safe and sane living.... Hope this works out for you! All the best...! :-)    Embed Quote
