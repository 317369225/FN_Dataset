★A bronze clamp is used to connect ground to the shield of a 23kV power cable.  The shield is Aluminum. The clamp grabs the outer shield protected by shrink tube and then buried.   What would be the corrosion risk of these two metals in contact?Lifetime of the system should be longer than 30 years.
High risk. They are far apart on the galvanic series- aluminum is a powerful anode material. Also, that the joint is covered and buried will prevent anyone from noticing that this has caused a high degree of galvanic corrosion and essentially destroyed the connection.    Embed Quote
