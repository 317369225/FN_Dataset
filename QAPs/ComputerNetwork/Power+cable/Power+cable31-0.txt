★Would a defective underground power cable be less likely to cause lights to flicker in very cold temperatures that are well below freezing?We have a problem with flickering lights. Sometimes they flicker. Sometimes they don't. The electrician says the interior wiring is okay so, assuming this to be true, the problem is probably in the transformer or the underground power cable. I noticed that the problem disappears when it becomes very, very cold (below freezing). Does this suggest that dampness around a defective cable is the problem?
Sounds like animals are chewing the cable or connectors, possibly even at a transformer.  The reason it doesn't happen in very cold weather is that they are not burrowing near the cable.  They have moved into someone's house or garage/barn. It could also be loose clamps somewhere in the circuit.  In extreme cold weather, they are contracting, making a better connection.    Embed Quote
