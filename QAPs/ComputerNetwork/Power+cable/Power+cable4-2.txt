★What does the transformer on my laptop power cable do?To be specific: does this convert the (presumably powerful) current from the wall socket into something less lethal to humans and electronics?
It does two things: it reduces the line voltage from the wall to a lower voltage that the electronics are designed for, and it converts the alternating current to direct current. There should be a label on your adapter that spells this out specifically. From a Dell adapter that I have handy:     INPUT: 100-240 V ~ 2.5 A 50-60 Hz     OUTPUT: 19.5 V = 6.7 A This adapter can accept AC voltages (indicated by the symbol approximated here by "~", as in a sine wave) between 100 and 240 volts, with alternating frequencies between 50 and 60 Hz. These ranges make this a "universal" adapter, compatible with all of the different line voltage standards around the world. The maximum current it should draw from the wall is 2.5 amps, although the actual value may vary depending on the line voltage and the power being consumed by the laptop. The output of this adapter is a DC voltage (indicated by the symbol roughly approximated here by "="), at a level of 19.5 volts. This adapter is designed to supply at least 6.7 amps, again depending on the actual power being consumed by the laptop. Within the laptop, this 19.5 VDC is converted again to the various voltages required by the battery charge circuitry and the electronic components (5.0 VDC, 3.3 VDC, 1.8 VDC, etc.)    Embed Quote
