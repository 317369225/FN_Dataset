★Which way is better for charging a mobile: carrying an extra battery or carrying a power cable?
In any case, carrying a charging cable won't hurt. It came with your phone, so no extra cost. Would take 1/4 th the space of your phone. The only drawback is to be near a power source. If you travel a lot and couldn't find a power source, then extra battery or power bank is a good option, the drawback being you have to buy one.    Embed Quote
