★Do Apple's laptop power cables have a design flaw that allows them to easily fray?They frayed once got replaced, and then frayed again. First fraying was so bad computer no longer got power from cable.
I've had a MacbookPro for about four years now and I'm on my forth adapter, so I would say: yes, there is a design flaw. I'm not treating the adapters badly, but after a year or so they always fray. I do carry this thing around a lot, but since I own a laptop, which is designed for carrying around, I don't think that should be an issue.    Embed Quote
