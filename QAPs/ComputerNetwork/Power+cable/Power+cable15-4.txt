★Do Apple's laptop power cables have a design flaw that allows them to easily fray?They frayed once got replaced, and then frayed again. First fraying was so bad computer no longer got power from cable.
Depends Largely on the weather conditions according to me. If exposed to bad weather too much, the cables may fray.    Embed Quote
