★Why is it that when you lay two power cables or ropes or hoses together and leave them unobserved for a few weeks they get all twisted up in incredibly intricate and complex patterns? Is there some kind of law of math or physicsthat can explain this?
Yes, the science of topology explains it. It would take a long time to go through all the math, but suffice it to say, if you've got long, flexible cylinders, there are a vast number of ways for them to get tangled and knotted and twisted together, and only a couple of ways for them to stay separate and orderly. If they're jostled around at all, they move in random ways and the probability is hugely in favor of them getting twisted and knotted up.   It's possible for them to stay in orderly coils, or to un-knot themselves after being knotted up, but it's so unlikely you'll never see it.    Embed Quote
