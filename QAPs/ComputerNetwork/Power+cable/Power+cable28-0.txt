★Why did Apple change the Macbook Pro power cable from one which runs along the body to one that runs outward from the body?The newer cable detaches too easily (not good) when any vertical pressure is applied, like the pressure from your thigh when using your laptop on your lap.
Apple switched to the L shaped MagSafe adapter because it put less strain on the adapter and was less likely to fray. They switched back when they moved to MagSafe 2 and I can only assume that some component in MagSafe 2 needed that extra space. You'll also notice the plug is wider than the either old ones were. Hopefully they'll get that worked out and move back to the L shape.    Embed Quote
