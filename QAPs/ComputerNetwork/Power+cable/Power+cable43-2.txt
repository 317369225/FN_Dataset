★If I splice an 18' 10/3 power cable onto the existing 6' smaller gauge cable from a woodworking machine, is the voltage drop determined as a percentage of the lengths of the different gauges? Or does the section of smaller gauge produce a voltage drop as if the entire run were the smaller gauge?
If your main concern is voltage drop it appears to me voltage drop will not be an issue.  If you want to give me the number of phases, amperage and voltage I can give you a figure.    Embed Quote
