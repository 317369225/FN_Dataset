★How do you avoid tripping over laptop power cables?This has happened twice today and I'm pissed. Apple has a maglock so this wouldn't happen on their laptop. However I am using my Windows laptop nowadays and the cable somehow tangled round my foot or something else and the moment I stand up the whole laptop smashes on the ground. I have to use a Windows laptop for software and engineering purposes.
run an extension cord under your couch or where you normally sit. gaff tape the extension cord to ground. Or better yet, buy a flat extension cord. Run your power cable in whatever direction is least likely to trip you.    Embed Quote
