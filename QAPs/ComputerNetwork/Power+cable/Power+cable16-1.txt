★Will a bird sitting on a power cable get electrocuted if its body resistance is lesser than the power cable?
No, in all cases.  Ignoring the fact that it would have to be a bird made of Silver in order for this to be the case, power lines have a very low voltage gradient per unit distance.  The cables are sheathed in an insulating jacket which, while it wouldn't keep the high voltage from arcing to ground if the cable fell, certainly would create a barrier for the micro-volts across the two feet of the bird (assuming this is what you are thinking would cause the problem.) Now, if that bird, or any bird, simultaneously touched two different wires it would be very different.  It, like a normal bird would be toast, or in this case, splattered Silver, covered in bits of char and copper from the cables that it joined.    Embed Quote
