★We were trying to setup the Zeppelin Air by Bowers & Wilkins and the first instruction directs the user to make sure all wire connections from the back of the device are removed.Why not just unplug the power cable from the wall socket?I have come across the same instruction in few other cases, where the intention was to make sure there is no power supply to the device and its completely turned off. So why is it not enough to remove the power cable from the wall socket. Why must the other end of the power cable going into the device be physically disconnected?
Most likely this is because you might unplug another thing by mistake. Removing the wires from the back of the device makes it certain that you have disconnected the right thing. It's a simple precaution but effective.    Embed Quote
