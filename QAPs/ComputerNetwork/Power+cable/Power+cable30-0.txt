★What does 64/110 ÷115(123) kV mean in the context of power cables?
In context of power cables, these are the nominal voltage ratings[Uo/U] and maximum system voltage ratings[Um]. Uo/U = 64/110 = 64/(sqrt(3)*64) Where, Uo - Rated power-frequency voltage between conductor and earth or armour, metal sheath or screen for which the cable is suitable. U - Rated power-frequency voltage between phase conductors for which the cable is suitable. Um = 115(123) kV Um - Maximum value of the "highest system voltage" between phase conductors for which the cable is suitable. (Refer IEC 60038 and IEC 60502 :Not relevant for the voltages you have quoted but gives the definition) PS: I am unsure of the sign convention used in your question. Could you pls provide us the source or reference where it has been quoted?    Embed Quote
