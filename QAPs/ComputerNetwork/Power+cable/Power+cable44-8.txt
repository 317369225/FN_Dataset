★What purpose does the small cylindrical module near the end of my laptop charger cable serve?
As I understand it, any wire, such as a usb cable, acts as an antenna. It will pick up noise from the environment, such as 60 Hz noise from electric motors. The cylinder (sometimes a short coil is used instead) will help to block the induced current from the environmental noise, reducing the corruption of the real signal being carried by the wire. That's what I know. Considering the number of physics/electronics people on Quora, you should have a much better answer soon.    Embed Quote
