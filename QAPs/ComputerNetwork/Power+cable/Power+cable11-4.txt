★Is this distance away from high voltage power cables safe?
There is insufficient evidence to prove health hazards of electric and magnetic fields; however, with large enough electrical fields (which is alternating) the current induced in tissue may have adverse effects.   See sec 115 of a report by National Radiation Laboratory, New Zealand  (Page on www.who.int) for reference values set by International Commission on Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).   If you have a smartphone with magnetometer you can check the magnetic field density in that area to see if it exceeds the reference values.    Embed Quote
