★Will a USB power cable attached to my motorcycle battery constantly draw power and kill my battery?
The USB socket is 5V. Your cable converts the 12V vattery voltage to 5V and will consume power while it is connected. However, the amount of power is very small. You can measure it by testing the current drawn with an ordinary multimeter connected in series on a 12V wire. When there are no USB devices plugged in the power drawn will probably be so small that it will not be a problem if the motorcycle is in daily use. However, when a device (especially a GPS) is plugged in, the power consumption will increase. A cell phone probably will not run the motorcycle battery down too badly, but a GPS will. It is easy to forget to unplug a GPS and then the next morning the battery is so dead that it needs to be replaced. If you discover that your lead-acid battery has run flat overnight, it is very important to get some charge into it IMMEDIATELY. Sulphating begins as soon as the battery is flat and in a matter of hours there is measurable damage. A lead-acid battery shouldn't be allowed to discharge below about 30% if you want it to last. At least install an inline fuse in the 12V cable. When you store the motorcycle then remove the fuse or disconnect the battery. It is probably worthwhile installing a 4-port USB charger. You are likely to need power for more than one USB device.    Embed Quote
