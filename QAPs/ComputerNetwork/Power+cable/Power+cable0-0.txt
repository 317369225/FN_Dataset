★How are power cables installed?
Residential is usually NMD-90 in wooden framing... Commercial is more likely to use a combination of wire-in-conduit and armored cable. I think in non-combustible framing the cable needs to be either armored or FT-4 with grommets. I'm not 100% on that though -- I do industrial, not commercial Industrial applications are more likely to be run with Teck cable in ladder tray. The shots above are pulled from the net.
