★We were trying to setup the Zeppelin Air by Bowers & Wilkins and the first instruction directs the user to make sure all wire connections from the back of the device are removed.Why not just unplug the power cable from the wall socket?I have come across the same instruction in few other cases, where the intention was to make sure there is no power supply to the device and its completely turned off. So why is it not enough to remove the power cable from the wall socket. Why must the other end of the power cable going into the device be physically disconnected?
Not sure about that device, but it is possible that a device is storing energy inside it even if unplugged. TVs used to store a lot of high voltage electricity so you had to discharge that before working on them. Anything with large capacitors in it is something you should watch out for.    Embed Quote
