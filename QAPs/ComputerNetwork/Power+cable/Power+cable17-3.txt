★Is it recommended to unplug a MacBook laptop when it's fully charged?I have the latest unibody MacBook Pro. I always keep it unplugged when it still has some battery charge left. I only plug it in when it needs to be charged (less than 20% remaining) and unplug it when fully charged. Is this recommended? Will this extend battery life? See especially #7 on http://forum.xda-developers.com/...
It is always better to use your device on a charge - discharge cycle. This means that for best battery maintenance, you should plug in the device when it is powered down (say around 15%) and then unplug when it is 100% charged. This would be the ideal usage and will prolong battery life. If your device is under infrequent use (like you use it only a couple of times a month) then it is recommended to have it undergo at least one full charge to full discharge cycle once a month. Hope this helps!    Embed Quote
