★What does the transformer on my laptop power cable do?To be specific: does this convert the (presumably powerful) current from the wall socket into something less lethal to humans and electronics?
Your laptop is powered by it's internal battery, which is charged by a Direct Current Voltage. The wall socket supplies an Alternating Current at a much higher Voltage which is changed by the transformer and other electronics to a DC voltage for charging the battery.    Embed Quote
