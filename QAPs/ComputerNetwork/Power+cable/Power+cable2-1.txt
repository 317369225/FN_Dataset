★Why does Apple make such bad power cables for its products?I have few products from many generations from different categories (iPhone, iPad, Mac Book Pro). All of them suck at one thing — plastic on power cables is falling apart after 6-12 months.
Failure to realize that people treat even expensive stuff very badly. First, the MacBook power adapter is amazing. It has more design in it than the entire Dell Inspiron line put together. MagSafe is genius. Tiny transformer. Wall plug or extension cord option is elegant. Those little ears for wrapping up the cord. Even the charging status LED is a thing of beauty. It took them 10 years, and they are still non-standard, but they got the end of the mobile device charging cord that they control right. No one else has. I'm not generally one to drool over Apple design. But they got these very right. I've never damaged the charger for any of my Apple products. Never. But I've seen plenty of damaged units. The way to keep your MagSafe adapter factory fresh is simple - stop driving your fucking chair over it all the time, and stop stepping on it. For your iPhone/iPad, grab it by the part thats plugged into your device, and not the cord, when you unplug it.    Embed Quote
