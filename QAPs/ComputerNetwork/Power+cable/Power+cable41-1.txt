★A bronze clamp is used to connect ground to the shield of a 23kV power cable.  The shield is Aluminum. The clamp grabs the outer shield protected by shrink tube and then buried.   What would be the corrosion risk of these two metals in contact?Lifetime of the system should be longer than 30 years.
There would be a high risk of a detrimental galvanic couple, the aluminum would be fairly rapidly consumed to protect the bronze if the shrink sleeve allows any water intrusion in that 30-year time period.  A better choice would be an aluminum clamp and a liquid epoxy coating to prevent any water intrusion, or a magnesium cathodic protection anode to protect both the clamp and the shield.    Embed Quote
