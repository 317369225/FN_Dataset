★Which way is better for charging a mobile: carrying an extra battery or carrying a power cable?
Depends on what kind of place you're going. If you're going to a forest where you won't get any charging points/plugs it is useless to carry a charger and an extra battery will prove to be life-saving or at least relationship-saving. On the other hand, if you're going to a grand hotel and are sure of getting a charging point, then you should carry your charger. Tip: Even if you're carrying an extra battery with you,  always take your charger. Both the batteries won't last more than 2 days if you're using a smartphone.    Embed Quote
