★Is it recommended to unplug a MacBook laptop when it's fully charged?I have the latest unibody MacBook Pro. I always keep it unplugged when it still has some battery charge left. I only plug it in when it needs to be charged (less than 20% remaining) and unplug it when fully charged. Is this recommended? Will this extend battery life? See especially #7 on http://forum.xda-developers.com/...
There is nothing wrong with leaving it plugged in when it reaches fully charged status. The charger automatically stops serving a charge to the battery at that point, and your laptop runs primarily off the power supply's power and only taps the battery's power source if it needs a little extra juice (intensive work might cause this). It's good to discharge your batteries, but there's nothing wrong with leaving it plugged in. Normally what I do is plug it in for charging when I get home from work since it's been drained a bit since then, and then leave it plugged in until I leave for work the next morning. And on weekends I tend to leave it plugged in all weekend. Apple has designed the laptop chargers to not charge the batteries when they're plugged in unless the batteries are below a certain threshold, I think somewhere around 93% charged. This only applies if it wasn't already being charged up from a lower charged state.    Embed Quote
