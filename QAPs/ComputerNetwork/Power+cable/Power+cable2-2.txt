★Why does Apple make such bad power cables for its products?I have few products from many generations from different categories (iPhone, iPad, Mac Book Pro). All of them suck at one thing — plastic on power cables is falling apart after 6-12 months.
I would say the real reason for this is profit maximization. Apple cables should be authentic and when you use a fake, it tells you that it "may not work reliably in this ipad"   Apple company has a monopoly on its own cables and they are really expensive for the level of quality it offers. Now imagine how many more cables per apple user they are selling. I own two apple devices and I have to change the cable at least once or twice a year.    Embed Quote
