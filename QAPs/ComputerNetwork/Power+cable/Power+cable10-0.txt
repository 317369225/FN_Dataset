★How can I make a DIY power cable for my Nikon D90?They appear to cost something upwards of $120 on Amazon for the power adapter AND the connector, which appears ridiculous. Perhaps there is an alternative? When it comes to doing timelapses, I'm sure there is a demand to make this more accessible. Perhaps this is even possible to be powered via USB?
Once I could not find my power cord for my printer, I put an ad on Craigslist  that I needed it and someone contacted me.  Gave it to me for no cost.  Good luck.    Embed Quote
