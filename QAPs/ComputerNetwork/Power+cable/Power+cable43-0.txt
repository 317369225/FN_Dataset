★If I splice an 18' 10/3 power cable onto the existing 6' smaller gauge cable from a woodworking machine, is the voltage drop determined as a percentage of the lengths of the different gauges? Or does the section of smaller gauge produce a voltage drop as if the entire run were the smaller gauge?
Basically the resistance of each sublength is calculated separately. You  must determine the resistance of the 18' length (.018 ohms) and the 6 foot length (assume 16 ga., so .024 ohms), then sum them (.042 ohms). Note the higher resistance in the shorter cable due to the difference in wire gauge. You have to double that because you have one wire each way  but two way travel, so 0.088 ohms. Now you can calculate the voltage drop of the whole spliced power cable as I x .088 ohms.  Assuming I = 15A, then your voltage loss is 15 x .084 = 1.26 volts.  Not too bad for a power tool. For a 10 Ga extension cord, you'd typically use it for 50 or 100 feet. in which case you'd have  .2 ohms and lose 3V in 100 ft. Also depending upon your splice technique and the way the power connector is terminated you could easily have another 25 milliohms in each for another 100 milliohms which would more than double the loss.    Embed Quote
