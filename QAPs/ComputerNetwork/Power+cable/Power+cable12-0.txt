★Could Japan use HVDC submarine power cables to import electricity from other countries?Examples exist, for instance NorNed (connecting the electricity markets in Norway and Holland, total length 580 km, power rating 700 MW) and Basslink (connecting Victoria, on the Australian mainland, with the island State of Tasmania, total length 370 km, power rating 500 MW). South Korea, for example, is about 200 km away from the Southern Japanese State of Kyushu.
It could, but you must realize that South Korea might as well be an island too, its only neighbor being the DPRK. The biggest player in power in that region is China, and due to geo-politics and the history between the two nations, I doubt it will happen. The reasons for such a project not happening is more political than technical. See power is an essential resource, like food and fresh water. You cannot be dependent on potential rivals in the region to supply you with these resources while maintaining your sovereignty at the same time. The situation in Western Europe is quite different. All the nation states there are at relative peace with each other. Norway is not going to attack Holland any time soon. Also Norway is in this unique position to provide power to the Netherlands due to vast hydro resources, the same way Canada provides power to western United States in the summer. Australia has to support Tasmania as it is a smaller island and islands are usually power deficient. South Korea is not in the same position to supply Japan with excess power, as it is too an island for all intents and purposes. Any such power transfer project would have to originate in China, and maybe through the Korean peninsula and into Japan to keep the costs down. This would require cooperation between four countries, with the three of them distrusting Japan due to its actions in World War II. I am not saying that it is not possible, but the current geo-political situation in the Far East makes it difficult.    Embed Quote
