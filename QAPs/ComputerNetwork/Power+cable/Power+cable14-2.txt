★How do you avoid tripping over laptop power cables?This has happened twice today and I'm pissed. Apple has a maglock so this wouldn't happen on their laptop. However I am using my Windows laptop nowadays and the cable somehow tangled round my foot or something else and the moment I stand up the whole laptop smashes on the ground. I have to use a Windows laptop for software and engineering purposes.
dont walk near them. go over them [or under] move them somewhere safe.....    Embed Quote
