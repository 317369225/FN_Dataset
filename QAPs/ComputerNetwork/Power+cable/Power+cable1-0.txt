★How can I identify a power cable?I have an unidentified power cable and I don't know what it is designed to power. Is there a database that matches cables to electronic equipment?
A google search with the name Linak, which is embossed on the socket, led me to this image, which I find similar to the one you've posted: It looks a cord that goes into the blue pack shown in the picture. From what I've found on websites, it's a rechargeable battery pack. So the power cord is used to charge this pack. This rechargeable battery powers a 'patient lift bed'.    Embed Quote
