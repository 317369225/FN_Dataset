★If I splice an 18' 10/3 power cable onto the existing 6' smaller gauge cable from a woodworking machine, is the voltage drop determined as a percentage of the lengths of the different gauges? Or does the section of smaller gauge produce a voltage drop as if the entire run were the smaller gauge?
Such a splice would yield two different voltage drops, one for each size/length of cable. The 10/3 cable would yield a lower voltage drop (per foot) than the smaller cable, so they must be calcuated separately and added together. If, say, your 10/3 cable yielded a 2V drop at the machine's rated current draw and the smaller cable yielded another 3V drop at the machine's rated current draw, then your total drop would be 5V at the machine.    Embed Quote
