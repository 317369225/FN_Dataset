★Which way is better for charging a mobile: carrying an extra battery or carrying a power cable?
I would suggest you get a good Power bank if you have to have a second source of power that much. Getting an extra battery will also make you get a spare battery charger to charge the battery. And carrying around Charging cables won't do much good if you can't find a wall outlet. So, all in all, a PowerBank is the wisest choice to my thinking!!!    Embed Quote
