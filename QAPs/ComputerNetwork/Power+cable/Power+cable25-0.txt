★Can you use a regular power cable into the power supply of an Xbox 360 slim?
Yes , you can. As you can seen in the link at the bottom, a typical Xbox 360S console has a consumption of 135 watts, so if you use a regular power cable suitable to provide current to a PC's 400 watts power supply, the wire gauge is enough to handle almost 3 times the power of the Xbox.
