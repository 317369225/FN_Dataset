★If NFC payments do not take off in the next 12 months, what will be the primary use of NFC on smartphones?
NFC will be a hit or miss technology. If it takes off with mobile payments, that'll encourage it to be used to start a radio connection between other devices. However, mobile payments will have to be the driver. There's a limit amount of support for NFC payments today, but certainly not widespread. If NFC can't take over payments where it already has some inroads, then I can't imagine any other devices or applications using it because they all require hardware infrastructure.    Embed Quote
