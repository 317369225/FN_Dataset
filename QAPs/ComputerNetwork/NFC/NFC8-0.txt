★What is the future of NFC? Will it catch on?
Not clear.  It's really a question of crowd behavior and culture, not technology. Despite all the hype about 'disruption', NFC is a small convenience, it doesn't enable anything new.    So now your fone is your credit card.   Instead of swiping my card i smack something with my fone.   There is a long list of great technologies which offer incremental improvements in convenience, which just get ignored.   Roomba - it vacuums for you.   Works great!   Do you have one?  Do you know anyone that does ? Truth is, vacuuming's not that hard and it's kind of creepy having an autonomous hockey puck to trip over. Digital alternatives to business cards have existed for years now.   But yanno, cards aren't that cumbersome.   And we like the manual (literally) control of handing an object to someone. Read that last line again. Thought experiment : Take your wallet, and throw it across the room.   Hold just your fone. Do you feel empowered, or lost? Then there is the question of installing all the POS counterparts.   It's a tough sell to go up to Dunkin Donuts and convince them to invest millions in deploying technology that won't gain them a *single customer*, arguably.    Embed Quote
