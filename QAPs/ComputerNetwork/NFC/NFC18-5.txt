★What are some creative uses of NFC tags?
One of my favorite NFC use is to easily integrate the smartphone into the car’s navigation and entertainment system. As promised, in the future, you will be able to access all your smartphone’s features simply by dropping your phone into a carved-out spot near the dashboard. The phone will connect and sync data using NFC (near field communication) technology. With some clever display technology, it could show all relevant information while driving.    Embed Quote
