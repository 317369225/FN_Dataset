★Where can I buy NFC tags in India?By buying, I mean someone who ships it dirt cheap to India is also fine. These are mainly for development purposes and am looking at a lot of 50+ every order.
We at Airnfc (http://www.airnfc.com/) can provide any quantity of tags to India with express shipping starting at €12 and taking only 6-10 days. We recommend the NTAG203 NFC tag, they are the most up to date tags available and have significantly improved performance over previous tags and are perfect for development purposes. We can supply other tag types as well. You can have custom artwork printed the tags or our own standard NFC logo. If you order quantities above 50 they are ~€1/tag. You can order through our site or you can give me an email at team(at)airnfc(dot)com.    Embed Quote
