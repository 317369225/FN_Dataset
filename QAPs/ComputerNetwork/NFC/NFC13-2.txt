★Where can I buy NFC tags in India?By buying, I mean someone who ships it dirt cheap to India is also fine. These are mainly for development purposes and am looking at a lot of 50+ every order.
We've given NFC tags (stickers, cards, etc) to many people, students and companies for testing and projects. We sponsored DroidCon India and NFC enabled all the delegate badges and various sponsor booths/stalls too. Let me know what you need and we'll do a small qty order for you.    Embed Quote
