★Is NFC dead or is it just starting to get traction?
I think this is a classic example of a hype cycle. This Gartner Hype Cycle is from July 2013. As you can see, NFC has entered the 'Trough of Disillusionment' phase. In this phase, interest starts to wane as previous experiments don't live up to expectations or fail. When you compare it to the previous stage where expectations were at their peak and the innovators who walk among us couldn't help but to daydream about how these tiny little chips could change everything, it certainly feels like it is dead. However, I'd say its far from it. NFC will soon be entering the 'slope of enlightenment' where it's value starts to become more widely understood and start to gain more traction. When NFC reaches the 'plateau of productivity', you will see mainstream adoption and can expect to see it integrated deeper and deeper into our lives.    Embed Quote
