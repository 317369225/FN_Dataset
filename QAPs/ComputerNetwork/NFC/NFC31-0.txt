★What's the point of NFC for smartphones?
I'm sorry all of these answers are missing the real magic of NFC which is the 'context' of a payment. When was the last time your credit card gave you your account balance as you were using it? When was the last time a Point-of-Sale terminal at a retailer offered you a coupon for a discount as you paid? There are so many opportunities before, during and after a payment for messaging and improving your financial life that simply don't exist today. Let's say you go to buy a big flat screen TV and you're using your NFC credit card. A competing bank can jump in and offer you a better rate or 12 months interest free. If you are about to blow your spending limit on a big ticket item, say purchasing that flat screen TV and in doing so you won't have enough to make your mortgage payment in a couple of days, your bank can help you rethink the decision. Let's say you're at a auto dealer looking at cars and you decide you're going to buy one. You pull out your NFC debit card to pay (well you pull out your phone with an NFC debit card encoded in a wallet) and the bank recognizes your location and offers you a 2-year personal loan or leasing option instead. None of these types of interactions are possible with a credit card today.    Embed Quote
