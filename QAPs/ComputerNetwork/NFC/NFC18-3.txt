★What are some creative uses of NFC tags?
If you are looking to connect with people or advertise your company, you can also use NFC Tags to store your personal information/contact info to share with other people. For example, if you have a LinkedIn Account, you can get a LinkedIn NFC Card: http://www.buynfctags.com/nfc-li.... The card will have your name, picture, and title and the encoding will be a link to your LinkedIn account so you can have other people tap on your card and connect with you on LinkedIn. Alternatively, if you want to promote your business, you could get some printed stickers/cards/tokens with your company logo printed on them, and the encoding can link to your website.
