★What is the future of NFC? Will it catch on?
I don't believe it will. NFC is a solid short-term solution and can yield great results on engagement. However, companies are already working on image recognition software that doesn't require hardware installation, and can be much more ubiquitous with the internet and other forms of mobile scanning needs, such as QR codes and barcode scanning. It seems to be very popular right now, but I'm seeing image recognition as the overall approach down the road - probably sooner than we think.    Embed Quote
