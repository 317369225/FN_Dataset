★What is the internal structure of an NFC tag?What are the electronic parts of an NFC tag. Is there any circuit diagram available for that?
NFC tags consist of three elements. A chip, an antenna, and the inlay. The inlay is the plastic or paper backing, often adhesive, which supports the other two elements and allows you to stick the NFC Tag to a wall or poster. The inlay may also be embedded in some plastic coating to make a key fob etc. The antenna is made of copper or aluminium. Copper is more efficient per length, aluminium is cheaper. The NFC Tag chip has just two contact for the antenna. Some of the chips are Mifare Ultralight, Mifare Ultralight C, Topaz, NTAG203 to name just a few. The most detailed public information that you will find for these components will be the datasheet such as Topaz http://www.acs.com.hk/drivers/en... You will find a block diagram, memory map and instruction set but no deep down details on the chip design. I not sure that you can find such detailed information for the others, but you can always try.    Embed Quote
