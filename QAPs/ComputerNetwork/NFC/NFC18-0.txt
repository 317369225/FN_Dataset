★What are some creative uses of NFC tags?
I have 3 tags, created with NFC Task Launcher, that I use regularly. 1) Tap to show Wi-Fi password. I placed this over my Wi-Fi router and it allows any guest to quickly get the password without asking me. 2) Tap to decrease volume/lower brightness before going to bed (vice versa for waking up). I placed this on my nightstand next to my bed. 3) Tap to maximize brightness, volume and launch Google Maps Navigation (go back to original settings and home screen on subsequent tap). I placed this on my phone's car dock so that it launches every time I need it! NFC Task Launcher makes all 3 of these tasks easy to program. I bought my tags from Tagstand.    Embed Quote
