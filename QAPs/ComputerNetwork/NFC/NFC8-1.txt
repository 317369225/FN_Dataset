★What is the future of NFC? Will it catch on?
NFC is a game-changing technology. It has the potential to disrupt countless industries. Much noise has been focused on its ability to power mobile payments, but I believe NFC will be equally disruptive to location-based services, mobile couponing, and digital out-of-home media. NFC removes much of the heavy lifting that many current check-in and LBS applications require. The technology still places significant control in the hands of users.    Embed Quote
