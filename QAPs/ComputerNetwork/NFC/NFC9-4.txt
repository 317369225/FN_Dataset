★What are the best use cases of NFC?Which countries and which companies are most advanced?
I used this technology in one of the best malls in Cairo, Egypt to capture: 1. attendance of 600 guards in each shift - 3 shifts, 2. Proof of presence by supervisor tagging card of each guard posted on his specific post 3. Site inspection and tour by tagging fixed tags on various locations within a large building where no physical guard is there but a visit is required say every 1 hour. 4. Incident recording and alert at the control room in real time.    Embed Quote
