★Will Near Field Communication (NFC) be broadly embedded in smartphones in 2011?And if so, which mobile device companies will be the leading forces behind it? (This question is about the hardware. For NFC consumer adoption see: Will NFC become mainstream within the next 3-5 years?)
Google has included an NFC chip in the Nexus S, and Apple is rumored to be including an NFC chip int he iPhone 5: http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/25....  I would expect that these developments will lead other handset makers to include NFC chips to stay competitive with the iPhone and high-end Android devices and to take advantage of the software ecosystem likely to bloom around NFC technology in 2011    Embed Quote
