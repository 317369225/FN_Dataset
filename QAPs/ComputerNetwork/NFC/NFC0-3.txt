★What is NFC?
NFC will allow your cell phone to act like a contactless card, read a smart poster or RFID tag or interact directly with other cellphones or computers. Most importantly, your phone will need to be in close proximity with it's peer - need to be tapped or be within an inch or so.    Embed Quote
