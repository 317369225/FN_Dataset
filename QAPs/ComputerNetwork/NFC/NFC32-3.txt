★What are the key differences between QR codes, NFC, Bluetooth and RFID?and how it works nfc? (only handset with nfc enabled technology or with a OS enabled nfc?)
You can find the answers to all of these questions at www.buynfctags.com FAQ page. http://www.buynfctags.com/pages/... Here's a summary: NFC vs QR QR (Quick Response) codes are physical barcodes that, when scanned with a mobile application like Google Goggles, FlipFlop, or QR Code HD can connect users to digital content. If you want to “read” a QR Code, you first have to take a picture of it with your smartphone camera. How is NFC different? Unlike QR, NFC offers a seamless experience by quickly transferring information just by bringing an embedded chip and smartphone in close proximity to each other. NFC vs Bluetooth Both technologies allow a mobile device to communicate with other devices so what is the difference between NFC and Bluetooth?NFC is much simpler than Bluetooth With NFC, bluetooth pairing is instant. Instead of performing a manual configuration to identify a device, the connection between two devices is automatically established - in less than a tenth of a second - by touching the two devices to each other. NFC vs RFID NFC and RFID are both wireless technologies, which facilitate data transmission and receipt between two devices. The only difference is NFC is restricted to a short-range of 10 centimeters, whereas RFID is capable of accepting and transmitting beyond a few meters. NFC is really just a variation of RFID, which offers a simple and secure, touch-based solution for consumers to exchange information, access content and pay for services. NFC is compatible with existing RFID infrastructure and many NFC Tags work with RFID Tags.    Embed Quote
