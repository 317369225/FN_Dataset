★What are the key differences between QR codes, NFC, Bluetooth and RFID?and how it works nfc? (only handset with nfc enabled technology or with a OS enabled nfc?)
A QR code is a barcode that uses the camera. Think of a QR code as a URL. It's just a small amount of information that links to something bigger. NFC means Near Field Communication. It's a standard for transferring  a small amount of information between devices. Think of NFC like a credit card reader. NFC requires a power source at the start and finish. Bluetooth is a standard for transferring large amounts of information between devices. Think of Bluetooth like a wireless cable. RFID is similar to NFC, it's a standard for transferring a small amount of information between devices. RFID tags can be passive, and not require a power source. Think of RFID as a wireless magnetic stripe or a barcode.    Embed Quote
