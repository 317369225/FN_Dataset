★How much data can be stored on an NFC chip?There are supposedly going to be 40-50M NFC-enabled phones on the market in 2011. As a guide for app developers, how much data should they count on being able to store/access?
NFC tags can store upwards of 8kB of data depending on the IC, but the larger memory payloads can get expensive. More commonly you'll encounter the following sizes: 64 Bytes (NXP MiFare Ultralight) 168 Bytes (NXP NTAG 203) 512 Bytes (Innovision Topaz-512) 1 kB (MiFare Classic) Note: these values represent the full tag memory size - not all of which is user writable. For example, when you sub out the locked pages, NDEF formatting, and other meta information the 64 byte MiFare Ultralight can only store 46 bytes of user data.    Embed Quote
