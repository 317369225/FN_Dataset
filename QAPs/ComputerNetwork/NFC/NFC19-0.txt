★Will Near Field Communication (NFC) be broadly embedded in smartphones in 2011?And if so, which mobile device companies will be the leading forces behind it? (This question is about the hardware. For NFC consumer adoption see: Will NFC become mainstream within the next 3-5 years?)
The answer to your question depends on what you mean by "broadly embedded."  If you mean the majority of new phones that come out in 2011, then yes -- the iPhone 5 is expected to have NFC (that is huge), and Google Android already has launched support for NFC already -- I expect most Android phones launched in Q3 and Q4 2011 to have them.  I think the REAL metric though should be the number of phones on the market today.  And for that, it's going to be another 2-3 years until NFC has sufficiently permeated the mobile market to a point where stores start feeling the pressure to support it. People need to finish their two-year contracts for their RAZRs, iPhone 4s and DROIDs before they upgrade to an NFC-enabled phone.  So while NFC will be huge in 2011, it won't really get broad traction until 2012 or 2013.    Embed Quote
