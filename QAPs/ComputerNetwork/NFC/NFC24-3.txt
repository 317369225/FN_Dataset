★Who is building an NFC based mobile payments platform?Interested in learning about smartphone integration of NFC technology particularly for mobile wallet applications.
In France a pilot platform, called Cityzi, has been created by a consortium called the Association Française du Sans Contact Mobile (the French association for contactless mobile services). The consortium's members include local banks, local mobile operators, local transport operators plus the city council of the pilot region (which is the city of Nice). The structure behind this approach protects the role of banks in a way that the BlingNation service doesn't. (Bling is powered by PayPal, and PayPal encourages users to set-up PayPal value stores which potentially suck money out of the banks' checking accounts.)    Embed Quote
