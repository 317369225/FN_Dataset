★Is NFC dead or is it just starting to get traction?
I believe it will take off in the next 2-3 years, in combination with other technologies and potentially alternative payments on the back end, with V/MC's recent decision to support Host Card Emulation being a not-insignificant factor in this bullish view. (Without HCE, I fear NFC may have withered on the vine.) Even if there are cool new things like iBeacons popping up, the payments industry now supports NFC. It is a feature in most every payment card terminal shipped today. This is a huge thing for a slow moving and conservative industry, and I think it guarantees NFC at least a token role alongside other tech in contactless mobile payment and value added services.    Embed Quote
