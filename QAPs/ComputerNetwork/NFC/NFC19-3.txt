★Will Near Field Communication (NFC) be broadly embedded in smartphones in 2011?And if so, which mobile device companies will be the leading forces behind it? (This question is about the hardware. For NFC consumer adoption see: Will NFC become mainstream within the next 3-5 years?)
Apple are already behind on this with HTC, Samsung, Nokia and RIM already announcing NFC capability of some sort in new models of handset. However, what is becoming clear, with the Google Nexus S (see here)   What is needed to enable transmit support for NFC on the Nexus S? is that whilst the phones may be NFC enabled they are done so in a very limited way. For many people, they associate NFC with the ability to use the phone to pay and act as a replacement to the Contactless Debit and Credit card. This is only just starting to happen and deployment globally is some way off. Whist Apple may want to lead the way, my own feeling is that there will be a lot of rejection of what Apple want to do as they have never shown the ability to co-operate with Operators and Banks in the past and in order to really have the phone take off with NFC payment capability they will need to do so.    Embed Quote
