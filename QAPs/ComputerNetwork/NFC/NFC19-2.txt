★Will Near Field Communication (NFC) be broadly embedded in smartphones in 2011?And if so, which mobile device companies will be the leading forces behind it? (This question is about the hardware. For NFC consumer adoption see: Will NFC become mainstream within the next 3-5 years?)
Most replies here are focused on the smartphone transition which, whilst understandable neglects to look at where NFC is already succesful and how that can be adopted broadly. If we look at Japan, Hong Kong and London, NFC is already available in your Suica, Octopus and Oyster cards. There is already acceptance and adoption. Looking further into Japan, Suica is already embedded into many mobile phones. In Hong Kong, Octopus has already converged into watches, keyrings and other goods. The common trend for NFC in these 3 cases is public transport. They are the main and key methods for transactions. The US may struggle to find fast adoption outside of NY where public transport is a must, even in SV and Bay Area, public transport is poor compared to major global cities which means the cost of adoption for retailers is a hurdle. So whilst NFC may well be available in many smartphones, it needs the other side of the channel to also support it and public transport has historically been the key way for wider adoption. Furthermore, adding currency into your NFC device/medium is easily done at public transport hubs. There are many terminals in those areas and ATM's which allow for transfer of cash into NFC devices.    Embed Quote
