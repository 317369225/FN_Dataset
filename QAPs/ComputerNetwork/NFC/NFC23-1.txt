★What is NFC good for?
NFC is often mooted as not very useful, but in fact it does have many uses, especially on Android devices. It's a rapid way of pairing devices without going through Bluetooth authentication. It can be used to quickly initiate a transfer of files from one NFC device to another. It is also how wireless chargers register that a device is present to commence charging. You can also use NFC tags - which come in the form of stickers, key fobs, plastic discs etc, that can be quickly programmed to hold information that the NFC device responds to. For example it can be a trigger to perform a task on the device like turning off WiFi or muting the volume. Or it can hold a link to a website that once you pass the phone over the tag, the web page will open up on your device (similar to how  a QR code works) Finally you can use NFC to complete money transactions. This process works exactly the same as wireless payment debit/credit cards do. The small wireless logo on your visa card for example is essentially an NFC tag. The adoption of NFC payments has been slow but is now starting to pick up pace. The technology is improving and becoming more useful. It's security may be a concern for some but as with all new technology most of the paranoia about wireless payment security is simply that.    Embed Quote
