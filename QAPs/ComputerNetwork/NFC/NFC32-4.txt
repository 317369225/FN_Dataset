★What are the key differences between QR codes, NFC, Bluetooth and RFID?and how it works nfc? (only handset with nfc enabled technology or with a OS enabled nfc?)
There are a few key differences and definitely some pros and cons to each. QR codes use a specific open standard to contain specific data in the code itself - it can be used to execute a variety of commands - the most common of which being a mobile link. The upside to an open standard like QR is interoperability (multiple apps can interact with the codes), the downside is the physical real estate that is taken up by the code itself - which can be distracting and break the overall visual experience you're looking to create. NFC is a short range RFID technology that can be used as a launch/discovery mechanism for many of the same interactions as 2D barcodes or image recognition but because of the much higher capacity of the tags as compared to a 2D code or image recognition link - they can also create much more sophisticated interactions such as secure transactions, device pairing, wifi connections, etc. The big upside is that in most NFC implementations it's built into the hardware of the phone itself so it requires no additional app. The downside is that there's a much higher cost associated with NFC since there's a physical tag placed on the page itself. RF (ID) is a broader set of broadcast/connectivity technologies that contains NFC and other tags and readers. It's a highly complex ecosystem of devices with different applications and use cases. Bluetooth is an interdevice operability standard - one that likely won't survive too much longer.    Embed Quote
