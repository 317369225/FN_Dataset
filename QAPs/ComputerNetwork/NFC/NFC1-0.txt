★Is NFC a form of RFID?
Yes, we can say that NFC is a form/subset of RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) given that is uses radio waves for identification purposes. NFC is RF/wireless connectivity technology that enables simple and safe two-way data exchange between electronic devices: in fact, one difference between passive RFID and NFC is that a NFC device can work as a reader and a tag as well. NFC works at 13.56 MHz in accordance with inductive coupling principles and allows communications at very short ranges (a few cm). Nowadays NFC is based on ISO/IEC 18092 standard and is compatible with ISO 14443 and other passive RFID standards (see http://www.nfc-forum.org/resourc... ). See http://www.rfidjournal.com/blog/... for info about ability of NFC readers to read also ISO 15693 complaint RFID tags. See also DASH7 (www.dash7.org) as a possible complement of NFC for longer read ranges.    Embed Quote
