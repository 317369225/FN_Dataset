★Who is building an NFC based mobile payments platform?Interested in learning about smartphone integration of NFC technology particularly for mobile wallet applications.
This may be a semantic disagreement as someone with an NFC reader plugged into a power outlet may consider that reader "active", but NFC as a protocol is most definitely not active RFID.  NFC is basically the same as the 13.56 MHz ISO/IEC 14443 proximity cards you use to get into your office in the morning.  No battery required.  Ditto for the billions of smartcards like Mifare or Felica out there with no battery using basically the same technology.  Active RFID, like DASH7, is quite different and requires a battery/power source at both the reader and the tag/endpoint level. All RFID is not passive, but NFC is definitely passive RFID.    Embed Quote
