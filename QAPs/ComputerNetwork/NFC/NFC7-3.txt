★Is NFC dead or is it just starting to get traction?
Ben Brown is right on the timeline; and, NFC's not dead.  There will be 2 primary drivers for NFC's adoption on devices (not cards.) 1.) Payment industry specifications for NFC enabled cards and infrastructure. Standards will speed adoption. 2.) Contactless inertia driven by competitive protocols (BTLE) and; the use of NFC and BTLE in non-payments related capacities. 1 is mandate driven (look at Target's accelerated adoption); and,  2 is behavioral - as in - pulling your phone out to unlock a door; enabling BT to receive valuable offers; phone/app as payment (think SBUX)  Card swiping is so engrained for most of us that moving to contactless, or even Chip/PIN is a foreign as driving on the other side of the road.
