★Will NFC replace QR codes?
I agree with Cameron.  It's apples and oranges.  NFC will never replace QR Codes because they have a cost and QR Codes will never compete with NFC because it serves a greater purpose.  NFC is for identification, transferring information, and sooner than later, mobile payments.  This is a space that will need a few major retail brands to become early adopters.  Home Depot has been testing the mobile payment waters with PayPal in a small test with employees at a few stores.  Phones will have to start coming with native NFC.  QR Codes have not been integrated into most smartphones in the US yet.  This would help with mass adoption, but I still think crappy content is holding the QR Code back.    Embed Quote
