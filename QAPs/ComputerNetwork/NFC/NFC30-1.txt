★Are NFC chip readers standardized/universal?(i.e., if Apple or Google subsidized distribution of NFC chip readers to merchants for checkout, will those readers be able to read chips in any phone or only those from the distributor of the reader)
No, no, and no. Despite the hype, the technology barely functions as it currently stands. At a recent NFC-a-thon at a tech conference in San Francisco, a total of zero of the hardware USB NFC readers offered by the sponsors actually worked. Most of the programmers there were having some kind of trouble getting the Android function calls to work properly--no one I talked to actually had a demo up and running. I personally have an NFC reader that generates random numbers every time it does a scan. (Hours of fun in every box!) Admittedly, I did get one super-expensive smartphone that no one really has to scan a "tag" from another super-expensive smartphone that no one really has, but after it did that, some Android internal thing crashed and I had to restart the phone for NFC to continue working. It's a very fancy phone (T-Mobile HTC somethingorother), so this takes about five minutes. Even then, the official NFC reader provided would not scan the tag from Google's official NFC app. Also, there were no drivers available to turn NFC signals into keyboard input on Mac OS X for the reader, making it fairly useless to everyone except the small segment of the population that speaks C natively. For however many billions have been invested in this technology by Visa, MasterCard, Google, NXP, and all the rest, color me unimpressed.    Embed Quote
