★Will Near Field Communication (NFC) be broadly embedded in smartphones in 2011?And if so, which mobile device companies will be the leading forces behind it? (This question is about the hardware. For NFC consumer adoption see: Will NFC become mainstream within the next 3-5 years?)
In Japan, the "Saifu Keitai" (Wallet Mobile Phones) have been around for sometime and the tech is being introduced on a wide range of more modern smart phones now. According to this rumor, the iPhone 5 will be fully enabled with NFC, as will be many other Apple products. http://www.cultofmac.com/iphone-... As Apple has a full eco-system of devices to enable with NFC powered remote computing, and can therefore execute quickly and comprehensively, I think Apple will lead the way in the broad stroke application of this exciting new area of computing and communications.    Embed Quote
