★Is NFC a form of RFID?
It is true that from technical stand point NFC is based on an application of RFID technology (hardware and protocol stacks ) restricted to "centimetric" distance for security. But radio-communication technique is not all. In the same way that Apple did not invent the touch screen, nor did they invent mobile internet access, they built the iPhone that uses these technologies in a way that drives interest of all ecosystem actors from end user to telco operator. The same way NFC is actually a set of standards that package existing technologies in way that drives enough interest of the hole ecosystem to adopt it : - End user finds the "Tap" gesture "secure" and "natural" - Telco operator finds that using SIM as secure element a way to keep his business running where VoiP, WiFi and Email began to replace SIM based 3G, SMS and Voice calls . - Payment terminal builders find it cool because merchant will have to invest to upgrade their point of sale. - Banks and PsP think it a good new way to bring to bank people that have a phone but not a credit card - Marketers find it the next cool thing to distribute promotion and collect customer data And transportation operators, and , and ... I think thus that NFC is an interesting way to do business using RFID (and other technologies).    Embed Quote
