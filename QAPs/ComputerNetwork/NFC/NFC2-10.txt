★How is NFC better than Bluetooth?
The quick answer is that NFC isn't better, it's for different things. If both are options for whatever you are doing (highly unlikely) then Bluetooth is probably a better option because it works on more platforms. There is some misinformation in this thread about Bluetooth which can work in the exact way as NFC from up to 1000ft away. Bluetooth does not have to pair, and it does not require a "handoff". Checkout a company on Kickstarter called "Tile", they are using Bluetooth in this way. Pairing is when two devices need to send data back and forth. If this is not a requirement of your application, Bluetooth is capable of sending data in one direction.    Embed Quote
