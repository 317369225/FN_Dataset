★Who is building an NFC based mobile payments platform?Interested in learning about smartphone integration of NFC technology particularly for mobile wallet applications.
"~10-15% of merchants nationwide (read hundreds of thousands of locations), much higher % penetration is major urban markets like New York (eg. taxis).  ...PayWave (Visa), PayPass (Mastercard) and American Express (Express Pay) networks." This conversation is confusing NFC with RFID. There is very big difference.For one, RFID is passive. NFC is active. NFC done right, in handsets, will be able to read/be read by RFID the RFID terminals that are installed, but not capitalize on much of the functionality available in NFC.    Embed Quote
