★Who is building an NFC based mobile payments platform?Interested in learning about smartphone integration of NFC technology particularly for mobile wallet applications.
ISIS is the US carrier NFC effort which is ATT, Verizon, T-Mobile and Discover with Barclays Bank.  No comment on their odds of success, but it will drive interest in the US for NFC payments.  Google is working on this front too, but with their lack of physical payments experience that will take some real effort.  Not too that PayPal has partnered with Bling Nation, so that gives PayPal a toe in the water around NFC and Bling a very nice payments partner that needs to learn physical payments. Look for good traction in the US in the later half of 2011 as handset makers ship millions of NFC enabled phones.  Maybe payments is not the first use of NFC phones, maybe it is data transfer.  Build the rails for data, then use them for payments - Maybe ?    Embed Quote
