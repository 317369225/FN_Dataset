★What is the future of NFC? Will it catch on?
The way I see it, NFC has made big evolutions over the years in my country Malaysia. We clearly see a strong trend whereby banks and mobile companies are adopting this technology to assist users in their mobile payments. But, apart from the obvious payments fucntions for NFC, I'm positive there exists a strong market for NFC to be used as a marketing tool for corporations. NFC can be included in numerous products to give everyday normal things life through interaction. (eg: Scanning an NFC T-Shirt will pop up its history on your phone) They are little slender chips that are attached onto physical objects which are the keys to the digital world and our phones are the machines to activate it.    Embed Quote
