★What is the future of NFC? Will it catch on?
I read an article this morning about Google's new initiative to improve local search and encourage people to contribute reviews and recommendations of small businesses and restaurants.  Google has put "Recommended on Google" stickers on store windows that are embedded with NFC technology, allowing someone to access relevant information simply by holding their phone up to the sticker.  This is by no means a definitive answer to the question, but the article is definitely worth reading.  http://t.co/SdpgLQR    Embed Quote
