★Is NFC a form of RFID?
NFC is by definition RFID.  It employs radio waves (RF) and identification (ID) is at least part of the objective.  A more helpful distinction is the intent behind the communication.  RFID typically is employed for generating identification events which are then used for tracking, workflow initiation (start a process, create an alert, etc), data transfer or some other activity. When NFC is used for secure payment processing, it still fits this definition.  There is identification and workflow initiation going on in the background.  Far field RFID communications can also be used for these use cases. The merits of the various frequencies and time to market often determine which becomes dominant for different use cases.    Embed Quote
