★Where can I buy NFC tags in India?By buying, I mean someone who ships it dirt cheap to India is also fine. These are mainly for development purposes and am looking at a lot of 50+ every order.
You can purchase NFC tags from Tapwise (Cloud-Based Tag Management) on Amazon. 10 tags cost $8.80usd and the shipping will end up being from $17usd up to $40usd depending on how fast you would like to receive the tags. Amazon.com: 'TapWise' NFC nTag 10 Pack: Everything Else    Embed Quote
