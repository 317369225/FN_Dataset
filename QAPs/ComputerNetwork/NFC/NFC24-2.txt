★Who is building an NFC based mobile payments platform?Interested in learning about smartphone integration of NFC technology particularly for mobile wallet applications.
This question depends so much on where you are located. Each continent seems to have a different solution and whilst the likes of Bling Nation are indeed building an NFC platform is is a very closed solution. Much better to look places such as Singapore, France, Holland, UK and the US with the Discoverer project to see examples of open NFC projects that have a far greater level of collaboration with MNO's and Card Issuers working together to provide a multiplatform NFC and Contactless payment product. Bridging technologies are very short term and offer little in the way of longevity and security and whilst Micro SD cards seem to offer a solution in reality, they cannot succeed in the long term thanks to the way they are positioned in phones (the laws of physics have a large impact here). Mobile Wallets are starting to take off and many MNO's and some handset manufacturers have announced plans to develop them but at the moment there are few implementations that are being used by a significant number of users.    Embed Quote
