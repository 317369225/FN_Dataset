★What's the point of NFC for smartphones?
Also, NFC can connect the physical and digital world with just one tap - immediate. Example - You buy a new bed that arrives in a box not put together e.g. Ikea - you simply tap your NFC smartphone on a tag which is on the box - a video immediately plays and shows a video on how to put the bed together. Australian company Tapit Media is making this happen. Very exciting. http://tapit.com.au/    Embed Quote
