★Who is building an NFC based mobile payments platform?Interested in learning about smartphone integration of NFC technology particularly for mobile wallet applications.
So, there is already an NFC based "platform" that has been deployed in approximately ~10-15% of merchants nationwide (read hundreds of thousands of locations), much higher % penetration is major urban markets like New York (eg. taxis).  This NFC platform is currently accessible with contactless debit/credit cards using the PayWave (Visa), PayPass (Mastercard) and American Express (Express Pay) networks. The question is how to access this network using your mobile phone.   There will be two principal methods: (1) a bridging device like an iPhone sleeve (see eg. Device Fidelity http://devicefidelity.com/) or (2) an integrated NFC chip - many expect eg. Apple to embed an NFC chip in their next iPhone release. Companies like Bling Nation are trying to lay down their own "payment rails" effectively circumventing the Visa/MC/Amex oligopoly.   While I *love* the Bling Nation chutzpah and tenacity, it is unlikely to achieve national coverage in any reasonable time frame, but will likely serve an important role in payment geographies that are closed by nature (ie. small towns, communities, college campuses) - aka the "campus strategy".    Embed Quote
