★How is NFC better than Bluetooth?
Range and speed are the two areas in which Bluetooth is clearly superior.  That said, these two technologiesshould compliment each other. The range on NFC is limited to 20cm. And NFC is designed for limited data transfer (max of 424 Kb/s) and a quick handshake (0.1 sec). Bluetooth on the other hand is a WPAN has a range of 5 or more meters. In general, bluetooth operates at 2.1 Mb/s with a longer handshake time. Given that picture, it's pretty clear that NFC and Bluetooth are two very different technologies. Together NFC's provides security and low handshake/setup times, while bluetooth can provide greater range and bandwidth. There was a nice demo of the technologies working together in the Google I/O info session:    Embed Quote
