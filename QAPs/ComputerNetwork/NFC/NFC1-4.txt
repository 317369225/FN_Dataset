★Is NFC a form of RFID?
NFC is really just a variation of RFID, which restricts its reading range to 10 centimeters to make it more practical for everyday consumers and businesses. RFID works great for season passes, toll tags, MTA transit passes, casino chips, livestock and even your pet dog (RFID tags can be embedded in pets for trafficking and identification). But RFID’s not ideal when it comes to applications like mobile payment, which require a higher level of security. Paying for purchases with your mobile phone sounds like a great idea until someone else picks up your account info. This is where NFC comes in. NFC offers a simple and secure, touch-based solution for consumers to exchange information, access content and pay for services.  NFC is compatible with existing RFID infrastructure and many NFC Tags work with RFID Tags.
