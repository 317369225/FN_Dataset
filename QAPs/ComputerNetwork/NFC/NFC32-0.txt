★What are the key differences between QR codes, NFC, Bluetooth and RFID?and how it works nfc? (only handset with nfc enabled technology or with a OS enabled nfc?)
QR code: A QR code is a barcode and is often associated with a product or a website. QR codes are very popular in Japan but not so much in the US. The idea behind QR codes is that when a consumer snaps a picture of a QR code with their smartphone, often using a special app, he or she will encounter appropriate product information or a brand's promotion. NFC: NFC is, put simply, a means for two devices to interact wirelessly at a very short range, usually 4 to 10 centimeters. NFC can be used for a lot of things, although it is most often talked about in the context of mobile payments, as in a mobile phone wallet. There are rumors that the iPhone 5 will have NCF capabilities and that the owner of an iPhone 5 will be able to tap their phone at a store's checkout/cash-register/POS to make a payment. But NFC on a mobile phone has a lot of other potential uses, like getting into your hotel room; unlocking the door of your BMW car; swapping business cards with professional acquaintances, etc. To generalize, NFC is mostly used for pairing devices and, to a minor extent, can be used to transfer information. NFC is meant to be user-friendly. Bluetooth: Bluetooth is a mid-range wireless technology. Unlike NFC, most devices are already able to make use of bluetooth. Wireless headphones, keyboards, etc use bluetooth. RFID: RFID stands for Radio Frequency ID (ID = identification). RFID is often built into special stickers, sometimes called RFID tags, that are put on packages. Stores and delivery companies use RFID to keep track of inventory and transported goods.    Embed Quote
