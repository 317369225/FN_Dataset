★Is NFC a form of RFID?
Think of RFID as the umbrella technology. Within RFID, you have Active and Passive. Within Passive RFID, you have: 1) LF (low-frequency; 125 or 134 Khz) 2) HF (high-frequency; 13.56 Mhz) and 3) UHF (ultra high frequency; 865 to 915Mhz depending on geographic region) NFC is specifically RFID->Passive->HF All NFC readers and tags work at 13.56 Mhz (HF) Many of the common HF tags (Mifare) can be read using NFC readers (exceptions exist due to proprietry products) NFC is more of a specific application of HF RFID with specific goals and roles to fill. The same Mifare cards we have been selling as "HF" for years work with all NFC phones! Of course we can get a lot more technical if needed and correct what I said to no end.    Embed Quote
