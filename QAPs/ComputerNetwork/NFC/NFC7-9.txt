★Is NFC dead or is it just starting to get traction?
In the UK NFC has been used for contactless payments for 3 years (at least).  It's then been in Android phones for over 2 years, but for some reason companies are taking their time to get apps out there that can make use of this. With the US just catching up with the use of NFC for payments and Apple finally getting on board, I expect this is just starting to get traction.    Embed Quote
