★What is the future of NFC? Will it catch on?
In short, yes. NFC provides the means for intra-device communication for a very wide variety of applications and represents the removal of a gap between the user and the mobile device which has existed for a very long time. Particularly for payment applications, this relates to EMV and P2P payments, SVC and Loyalty in a way that has not been possible until now, the result being a new bubble in the progress of m-commerce. m-Advertising, MAR and LBS will all benefit from NFC communications and it has significant connotations for social media as well.    Embed Quote
