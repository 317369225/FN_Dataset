★What is the future of NFC? Will it catch on?
From a user experience, it's "not that big a deal". Similar to QR codes, where you have to download a special app, run the app, point the camera, futz with it to get it in focus, and finally get taken to a URL in your browser, NFC has high "star trek gee whiz" factor but low actual utility. I would never allow a simple swipe of my phone to pay for ANYTHING. Any NFC implementation is going to require a special app with at least a pin code. At that point, is it really any easier than just going through the paypal or square app? Nope. Just like QR codes, it's a technology invented before touchscreen, easy-to-use smartphones, and it's already been leapfrogged. The makers of NFC didn't envision 4g hi speed ubiquitous access to the Internet. I don't see how a short range connection is somehow better than just going through the 4g. In fact, the "bump" app on iPhone completely simulates an NFC experience via the Internet. if a technology is being promoted in the media before anyone you know uses it, that's generally a pretty good sign that it's not going anywhere. They were two years behind on twitter, why would they be ahead on NFC?    Embed Quote
