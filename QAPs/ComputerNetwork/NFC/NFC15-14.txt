Payment is only a small part of what NFC technology can accomplish.  They will also manage loyalty programs, provide location based special offers and coupons.  It could exchange business cards. Provide smart poster where you can tap a poster for a movie and watch a trailer on your mobile device. It can become a key to your car or hotel room.  It can exchange data in a read/write fashion between devices.
