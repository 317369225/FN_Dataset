★How much data can be stored on an NFC chip?There are supposedly going to be 40-50M NFC-enabled phones on the market in 2011. As a guide for app developers, how much data should they count on being able to store/access?
You are probably going to follow the NDEF(NFC Data Exchange Format) protocol. NDEF is a data formatting standard which is a way to put one or multiple records of data on a tag. It is the industry standard for formatting data on a tag but not everyone is going to use NDEF (for example credit cards have own encrypted data format). It all depends on your application. Here are a few examples of tag data capacities: MIFARE Ultralight has 512 bits of memory (64 bytes), which is enough to store basic information (a phone number, URL or basic text). MIFARE Ultralight C has 1536 bits of memory (192 bytes). MIFARE 1k has 1024 bytes and can store more data but still not enough to store an image. I have used BuyNFCTags for buying tags. Their team has been really helpful in getting me started: http://www.buynfctags.com    Embed Quote
