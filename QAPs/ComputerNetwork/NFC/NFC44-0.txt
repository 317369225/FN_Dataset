★If NFC payments do not take off in the next 12 months, what will be the primary use of NFC on smartphones?
I'm generally a skeptic about NFC, especially the mobile payments use case. It's trying to fix something that aint' broke (cards & cash) while demanding a very large infrastucture with collaboration between groups that distrust each other immensely. In particular, the mobile operators' dogged insistence on being involved in the NFC payments value chain - when they add very little value except perhaps subsidy of the handset - is a major sticking point. The insistence putting the 'secure element' on a SIM card is a good way to kill the technology before it's born. NFC is much more likely to be used for what I'd call 'interactions' rather than transactions - little taps of the phone on something based on the whims of an application developer or 3rd-party service provider. It could be clicking a phone on a Facebook logo at a restaurant to 'like' it, or getting the menu transferred to your phone. Maybe tapping on a museum display to get information about the item shown. These sort of things don't need a huge and complex security infrastructure - and, more importantly, have no financial value directly associated with them. That means that whatever platform is (ultimately, after all the delays) used for financial use cases of NFC will first have to have dealt with billions of 'free' ones - in other words, the successful early companies will be the ones that bear the cost of free interactions before hopefully benefiting from paid ones later. A complex, security-laden back end will make these free use-cases very expensive to serve.    Embed Quote
