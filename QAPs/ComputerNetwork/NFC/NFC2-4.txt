★How is NFC better than Bluetooth?
I think you are asking a Wrong Question. NFC is not better than Bluetooth neither is Bluetooth better than NFC. Both are quite different technology with some what similar functions. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages depending upon the implementation. For Example  to share a song I will prefer Bluetooth whereas for small link I will go for NFC. Once you have understand this, lets talk about the situation when NFC is better than Bluetooth. NFC require very less power then Bluetooth, so if you leave it ON it won't affect your battery. NFC file sharing don't require paring, which makes it faster. And since there is no paring there is no records again this makes NFC good for anonymous use. NFC can be use with NFC tags no similar option in Bluetooth. NFC can be used to make payment again sorry Bluetooth. But when it comes to data transfer speed, range, usability and acceptance then Bluetooth is our Rockstar. I have made a Infograph on this topic , which will make things clear.
