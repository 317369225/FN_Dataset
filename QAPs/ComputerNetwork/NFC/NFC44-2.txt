★If NFC payments do not take off in the next 12 months, what will be the primary use of NFC on smartphones?
In the US, NFC point of sale payments won't take off in the next 12 months due to lack of critical mass of both merchant terminals as well as handsets. That being said, here's what you'll see them used for (none of these is going to 'take off' but they will be out there and used): Check in services and applications. Whether it's Foursquare, Google, Yelp (product), or a host of others, tap to check in will be a big application. Groupon or LivingSocial could deploy it as a way to close the redemption loop for themselves and their merchants. Probably only a trial deployment in the next 12 months. Bump and QR type applications (information sharing, P2P payments, etc.). I have no idea what it will look like but someone will wrap game dynamics around NFC and bring gaming IRL, a la SCVNGR. I wouldn't be surprised if a 'killer app' came out of a political campaign given that 2012 is an election year. The lack of NFC enabled handsets as well as ready alternatives like GPS/Location-Based Services (LBS), inexpensive Square type card readers, no signature required for certain swiped payment card transactions, QR Codes and other picture matching services, etc. will hamper adoption of all of the above. NFC still feels like a solution in search of a good problem to solve.    Embed Quote
