★What's the point of NFC for smartphones?
I am going to say ease of use.  You tap and connect for information, payment or access.  As an example the other day i stepped out of my office to grab lunch and took my phone because i go nowhere without it.  I had $20 in my pocket, so far so good.  Ah, my badge to re-open the office door when i get back - not so much. A smartphone with NFC could have that access built in.  I also have a card that I tap to ride the train to SF every day, again this could be in my phone.  My credit card gets lost, I wait for a new one in the mail 3-5 days.  OR with NFC, it can be provisioned securely to my phone in minutes.  And before the haters, say no way.  Japan already has millions of people doing all of this and more every day.  And finally about the arguments that it has taken too long already.  I remember when Ethernet was vying to become the network standard versus IBM's Token Ring and lo and behold after about 10 years it was the standard because it was better.  So NFC has been trying for this for about 8 years, so 2012 seems ideal for it to become a part of our daily lives. We will have NFC in our phones for loyalty cards before payments due to the complexity around payments.  I personally can't wait, it is going to be great.    Embed Quote
