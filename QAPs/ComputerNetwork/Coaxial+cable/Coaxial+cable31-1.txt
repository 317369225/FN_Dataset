â˜…What are some examples of the application of reason?
Here is an example of how we demand reason even if unconscious of it. I don't know if this story is true or not, but knowing the philosophy professor involved, I believe it very well could be. The story was that a student in his philosophy class said one day, "You cannot prove to me that I need to accept reason." The professor concurred, and the student felt he had scored a victory. Later, when an essay exam was returned, the student found that he had failed, but everyone else had done well. The student compared his responses to the others and felt that he had explained things just as well as they had. He went to the professor and asked why he was given a failing grade, and the professor said, "No reason."
