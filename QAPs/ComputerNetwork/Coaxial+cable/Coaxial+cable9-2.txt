â˜…What is the best method for making a RG6 coaxial cable, crimp connections, screw on, or compression?
The main point is "provided they are done correctly". This means that you need the plug to match the type of cable; the die to match the plug; the tool to match the die and the expertise to use them! Get any of these wrong and you'll have a plug that comes loose or a crushed cable that loses some channels. Even with the twist-on type, the plug must be a very close match to the specific cable, otherwise it will be too loose or too tight. Another important point is that the bare copper wire oxidises quickly and should be coated with silicone grease to prevent this, (especially outdoors) otherwise in a year or two you'll be wondering why you get no signal. See http://www.satcure.co.uk/tech/fc... or How to fit F Connectors to coaxial cable for Sky and Freesat In the UK (and probably elsewhere), crimp connectors are disappearing in favour of compression connectors. Here the plug - cable - tool match is far less important but some are better than others from the aspect of ease of use. Twist-on (screw-on) plugs are extensively used - especially for DIY. They work perfectly well, if fitted correctly, but it is REALLY important to get the correct plug match for the cable. AFAIK SatCure is still the only UK company that even mentions this point. Another point to note is that, in the UK at least, cable sold as RG6 tends to have a copper-clad steel wire with aluminium shielding. Its resistance is too high for reliable use with satellite dish systems. To get copper-core cable you must ask for WF100 (Webro) or TX100 (Triax) cable. See Coaxial cable comparison
