â˜…Does electricity travel through a wire at less than the speed of light? If so, at what speed?
No, it travels with the same speed as that of light in that medium depending on its dielectric constant. But the speed depends on how you wish to define electricity. If defined as flow of electrons i.e drift velocity then it is very very slow, even centimetres per hour. Moreover, propagation speed is affected by insulation, such that in an unshielded copper conductor range 95 to 97% that of the speed of light in vacuum, while in a typical coaxial cable it is about 66% of the speed of light in vacuum.
