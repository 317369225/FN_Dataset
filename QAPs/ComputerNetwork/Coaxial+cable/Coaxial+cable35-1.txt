â˜…How do I hack my coax cable wire into a internet connection via ethernet?I am in a house upstairs and in my room I have a coax cable that goes to my tv. I also have a wifi but the signal to my room is only 1 bar and my xbox is having problems staying connected wirelessly. How can I turn hack my coax cable tv cord so I can let my xbox tap into the network? Thanks
There is an early ethernet spec called 10BASE2 which runs over coaxial cable, but you'll probably get far better performance with the weak-ass wireless link.
