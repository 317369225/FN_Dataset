â˜…What are some examples of the application of reason?
The TV turns on but you just see a blank screen. So you think about what could be causing the problem, and you realize there's a chain of devices, each of which could be at fault: the TV itself, the cable running from the set to the cable box, the cord running from the cable box to the outlet, the coaxial cable running from the wall to the box, and the remote control. You've accepted a heuristic that it's best to begin with the lowest-hanging fruit, so you examine the cable box and see that it's power light is glowing. Which means it's definitely receiving power. You also make sure the coaxial cable is tightly screwed into the box. (The problem still might be a bad signal, but there are other things you want to try before calling the cable company, realizing they'll keep you on hold for 20 minutes.) The next easiest thing to check is the remote. Are its batteries dead? You replace them but it doesn't solve the problem. So you dig out a universal remote you once bought and try it. Still nothing. You realize it's possible that both remotes are broken, but that's somewhat unlikely, so you shelve that idea for now. Could you have possible have put the TV in some mode that stops it from displaying anything? You find the manuals for the TV and the remote, check all the settings, and see that (as far as you can tell), there's no mode problem. That leaves the TV, the box, and the cable running between them--which is the easiest to check. (If it's a problem with one of the other two devices, you'll probably have call an electrician.) You dig in a closet and find another cable of the same type. You substitute it for the possibly-faulty one, and see the slanted face of Brian Williams pop onto your TV. Yay!
