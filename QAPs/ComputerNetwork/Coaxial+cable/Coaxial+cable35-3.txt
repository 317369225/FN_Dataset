★How do I hack my coax cable wire into a internet connection via ethernet?I am in a house upstairs and in my room I have a coax cable that goes to my tv. I also have a wifi but the signal to my room is only 1 bar and my xbox is having problems staying connected wirelessly. How can I turn hack my coax cable tv cord so I can let my xbox tap into the network? Thanks
You can also get a wifi repeater. But modern N wifi can cover most houses up to a far size pretty completely assuming you don't have metal between yo hand it. Make sure your wifi router is the latest greatest wifi (I think thats N but the may be something beyond that now) and try changing its location.  Note that many smart phones have wifi signal measurement apps you can get for a few bucks and then walk around your house and find the best reception points.
