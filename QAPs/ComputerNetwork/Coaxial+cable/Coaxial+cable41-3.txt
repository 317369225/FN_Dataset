★What is the bandwidth of a coaxial cable?I don't understand how the coaxial cable coming through my wall simultaneously carries the hundreds of channels received as part of a typical cable TV service.
Coaxial Cable is high-capacity cable widely used for high-frequency transmission of telephone, television, and digital audio signals. The cable is very effective at carrying many analog signals at high frequencies. Coaxial cables have become an essential component of our information superhighway. They are found in a wide variety of residential, commercial and industrial installations. From broadcast, community antenna television (CATV), local area network (LAN), closed circuit television (CCTV) to many other applications, coax has laid the foundation for a simple, cost effective communications infrastructure. Coaxial Cable is also widely used in the telecommunications industry, such as the telephone system where coax reaches the pole or drop nearest to the subscriber’s house, and a twisted-pair cable comes into the house and to the telephone. coaxial has the capacity to transmit information 80 times faster, has much higher bandwidth, offers greater protection from noise and interference and can support greater cable lengths between network devices. Coaxial cable also offers relatively high immunity to interference from noise sources, so it is often used in manufacturing environments. To know more about Coaxial cable: Click Here
