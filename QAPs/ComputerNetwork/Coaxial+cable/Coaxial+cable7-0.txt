★Electrical Wiring: How can you find a Coaxial cable outlet?
You can also short it at the hub then use the multimeter at each remote end until you find the one with continuity.  More legwork but you don't need a helper. Making a coax nub that shorts the core to the braid is an easy, cheap and handy helper for this kind of task.  I would use one of the friction fit connectors so you don't have to thread it on/off over and over.
