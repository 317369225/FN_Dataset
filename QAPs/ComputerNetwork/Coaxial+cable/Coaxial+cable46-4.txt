★Is the monitor on laptops hardwired to the CPU, or is it operated by wireless transmission?If one wanted to physically disconnect their laptop's monitor screen from the laptop CPU, would it be possible?  Are there electronic connections that could be lengthened, or a wireless or Bluetooth connection established to replace those connections?
A key thought in increasing the length of the ribbon or coaxial cables in laptop is that they will both generate and be sensitive to noise.  It is NOT practical to just make longer cables without taking all of the noise issues into account.
