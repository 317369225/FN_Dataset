★Is the monitor on laptops hardwired to the CPU, or is it operated by wireless transmission?If one wanted to physically disconnect their laptop's monitor screen from the laptop CPU, would it be possible?  Are there electronic connections that could be lengthened, or a wireless or Bluetooth connection established to replace those connections?
Yes, it's possible to physically disconnect that laptop monitor from the rest of the laptop.  It is electronically connected to the rest by a little cable that may be a mini-VGA or mini-DVI.  When you disassemble a laptop to remove and replace the motherboard, you will disconnect that little ribbon cable.  But you'll have to do a full disassembly to get it off. You can pull it out and refuse to replace it.  The hardware is designed to detect what monitors are available, and the operating system most likely can tell what monitors are connected.  Connecting by Bluetooth (Intel® WiDi and Intel® Pro Wireless Display) or some other wireless display adapter is possible -- you could have a computer on your lap with the screen being the big 60' in your living room if you wanted.  Here are a few non-Intel display adapters.
