â˜…Does electricity have momentum?(Edits to the phrasing of this question to foster better discussion are welcome.) Such as in hanging powerlines, with electricity bolting through the wires, is there any affect that momentum has as the electrical current travels across from the powerlines connected by sagging lines. Is there any momentum at a micro- scale?
That apparently depends on what 'your' definition of electricity is....
