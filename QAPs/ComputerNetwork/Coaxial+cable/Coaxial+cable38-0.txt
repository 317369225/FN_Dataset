â˜…If I use a 2-way coaxial cable splitter with a frequency range of 15 MHz to 2150 MHz with coaxial cables rated at 2200 MHz and 2300 MHz, will the splitter be a bottleneck to the quality of my CATV?
The splitter will have a known and predictable loss which should be available as a frequency plot from the manufacturer. The splitter will be rated at 2150MHz but will probably carry beyond that, much like the cable, so you need to look at the frequency range you want to carry and calculate the losses of all components in the system at those frequencies. In telecommunications and broadcasting this is part of the link budget. If you know the required receive signal strength and have subtracted the losses you will encounter, then you can work out the best transmit power. The biggest variable that you will have will be the connection losses due to the techniques used in attaching the connectors and how they interface with any other equipment. A poorly made connection at high frequencies can either introduce flat losses or worse introduce a filter characteristic such as a notch.
