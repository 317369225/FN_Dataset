★To what extent do different dielectrics and shielding methods affect the attenuation and/or fidelity of signal propagated over coaxial cable?E.g., RG-8, RG-11, RG-58, RG-59, etc. What advantages does each cable type carry over the other, and why?
The "RG" specifications are pretty vague.  There is good RG-6, and bad RG-6. Mostly, the different RG numbers specify different sized cable.  RG-59 is pretty small stuff, so attenuation is higher.  This means that less signal reaches the other end due to increased resistance.  If RG-59 isn't enough, move to RG-6. There are all kinds of RG specs.  For example, RG58 is 50 ohm, and RG59 is 75 ohm.  50 ohm stuff isn't really used anymore. Dielectrics and shielding vary widely by vendor, regardless of the RG type.  Obviously, better shielding will protect the signal better.
