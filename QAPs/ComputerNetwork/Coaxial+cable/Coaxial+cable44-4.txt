â˜…The Tamil Nadu government has announced that it is going to provide cheap broadband Internet via TV cable operations. Is it feasible? Has any other country already adapted this technology successfully?
I think this scheme is not a joke as siva mentioned. Because government already passed an announcement in the assembly, and i hope it will be a huge success. Let see..
