★Does electricity have momentum?(Edits to the phrasing of this question to foster better discussion are welcome.) Such as in hanging powerlines, with electricity bolting through the wires, is there any affect that momentum has as the electrical current travels across from the powerlines connected by sagging lines. Is there any momentum at a micro- scale?
Yes. The contribution of the electromagnetic fields to the energy flux density is called the Poynting vector, represented by . The momentum density of electromagnetic fields i.e. the mass flux density is times the energy flux density. It is In powerlines, the Poynting vector is parallel to the lines, pointing from the source to the load. For example,in a coaxial cable, between the conductors, the electric field is radial and the magnetic field is azimuthal, so their cross product is parallel to the cables. Both fields and the Poynting vector are zero outside the cable. The Poynting vector inside the conductors is negligible as the electric field is negligible.  Because of the factor of , the momentum carried by the fields is usually negligible.
