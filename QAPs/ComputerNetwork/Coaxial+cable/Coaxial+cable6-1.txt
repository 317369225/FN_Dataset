★Where could unlabeled Cat5e and Coaxial cables lead?Inside the media center panel where all the coaxial and cat5e cords throughout the home meet up there are 7 unlabeled Coaxial and 3 unlabeled Cat5e cords. Every other cord is numbered and accounted for every jack inside the home. Essentially these extra cords do not lead to any jack inside the home that I am aware of. Where else could they lead?
My current house has such cables.  The previous owner said that they were run behind the walls and coiled up for a future room that they never built.
