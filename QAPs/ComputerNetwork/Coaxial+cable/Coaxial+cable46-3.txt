★Is the monitor on laptops hardwired to the CPU, or is it operated by wireless transmission?If one wanted to physically disconnect their laptop's monitor screen from the laptop CPU, would it be possible?  Are there electronic connections that could be lengthened, or a wireless or Bluetooth connection established to replace those connections?
The connection is always through a thin coaxial cable or a thin flexible pc cable.   The bandwidth requirements are such that a wireless connection is very impractical, in the gigabits per second.   So they usually snake a thin cable up through one of the hinge covers.    You can make it wireless by using something like "Remote desktop", that does just what you want, although rather slowly.
