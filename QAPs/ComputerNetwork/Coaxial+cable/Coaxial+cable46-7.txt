★Is the monitor on laptops hardwired to the CPU, or is it operated by wireless transmission?If one wanted to physically disconnect their laptop's monitor screen from the laptop CPU, would it be possible?  Are there electronic connections that could be lengthened, or a wireless or Bluetooth connection established to replace those connections?
Barring specific laptops with special design, the monitors on all laptops that I have taken apart are connected to the motherboard via a special connector. This connector provides power and the display signal. To remove a laptop monitor, you have to disconnect this cable and disassemble the laptop hinges. For consumer class laptops, they were not designed to come apart easily and I wouldn’t recommend taking it on with or without a manual. Enterprise laptops where designed to be serviced and are much easier to disassemble but I still wouldn’t recommend it without a manual. As for lengthening the cable, I feel that you would run into some real issues due to signal degradation through the connectors you used to bridge the gap. I would recommend using the aux display port on your laptop or using a wireless display port.
