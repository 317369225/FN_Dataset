â˜…Does coaxial cable have an upper limit of speed?Fiber is ostensibly limited by the speed of light and the hardware switching the packets. But does a single coaxial cable have an upper bound of bandwidth speeds?
Yes, although 'it depends' DOCSIS 3 can achieve rates of 38Mbps dpwn & 27Mbps up in a channel (6MHz for US TV) The actual bandwidth of cable then depends on: The absolute maximum bandwidth (how many channels) The up / down allocation How many users (since cable is a shared media, the per user bandwidth depends on how spread out it is) The quality of cable (noise and hence SNR) Although older cable plant will have a bandwidth of 500MHz, and be in poor condition limitting SNR and data rate, more modern plant will have BW > 1GHz and have better shielding and SNR, allowing higher rates. So decent, modern cable plant would give perhaps 100 downlink channels & 50 uplink, and potential maximum total data rates of 4Gbps and 1.3Gbps shared http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOCSIS Common DOCSIS 3.0 speeds are listed in the table below.
