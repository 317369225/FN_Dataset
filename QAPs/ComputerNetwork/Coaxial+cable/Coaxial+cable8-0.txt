â˜…Is Google Loon a more cost-efficient way to deliver data access than coaxial cable, telephone line, etc., to the last mile?Are there costs that aren't obvious? Are there limitations which mitigate its value significantly?
The cost keeps changing and improving constantly, you can read more about it here: How much will each Google Loon balloon cost to produce? Even though the team has accomplished a lot already (more on that here: How is Project Loon doing?) there are still some things to learn. For example, we need to manage to have a permanent ring of balloons around the planet, but once fully ready Project Loon should be a more cost-efficient solution to deliver data access than traditional technologies for remote and rural areas and in special situations such as disaster recovery.
