★How can I make a quick indoor aerial?I have no metal coat hangers before anybody asks.
I'd say that it depends on the frequency range/spectrum that you intend to work with.  Aerials will typically be tuned.  Lower frequencies means longer/bigger aerials.  (Although, it is possible to tune antennae to some harmonic of a carrier wave and still receive an okay signal, depending on signal strength.) If you don't really care, and just want to get any kind of signal that you can get, I've made aerials out of aluminum foil pasted to cardboard and wire (e.g., coax, as another answer describes), or just use any wire at all.  Aluminum tends to work best, as it tends to have a positive ionic charge (i.e., lower aetheric pressure) and pull in the EMF vibrations better.  However, you really can use anything.  Even a bag of chips may be metalized and used as a kind of parabolic concentrator.  Grab a cheap voltmeter and play around with metal-to-ground reception.
