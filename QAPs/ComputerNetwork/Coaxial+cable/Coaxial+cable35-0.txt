★How do I hack my coax cable wire into a internet connection via ethernet?I am in a house upstairs and in my room I have a coax cable that goes to my tv. I also have a wifi but the signal to my room is only 1 bar and my xbox is having problems staying connected wirelessly. How can I turn hack my coax cable tv cord so I can let my xbox tap into the network? Thanks
You can't for a variety of reasons.  Consider using powerline Ethernet instead. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&...
