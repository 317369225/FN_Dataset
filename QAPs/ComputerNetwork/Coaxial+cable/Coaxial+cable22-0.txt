★Is it true that the resistance and other shielding properties (such as the copper braid) of the now less widely available RG59 coaxial cable is more beneficial for retaining HD-OTA signal quality from an antenna than RG6?
go to this site:  Coaxial Cable Attenuation Calculator and type in your coax length and read off the attenuation numbers.   Smaller is better. But even if your cable length is 100 feet, there is only going to be like 2 decibels of difference.  You lose more than that in the first splitter. What you need is a good amplifier, NOT a Radio-Shack $12.99 one, one that doesn't overload on strong signals. Or an even better way to do it is to have some tuned traps that you can tune to near the strong stations to suck out some of their strength.   If you want to buy these they're horribly expensive, but you can make your own very easily, a 1/4 wave length of coax cut for the frequency will considerably attenuate a signal.  Start with a length that is a few inches longer than calculated then watch the signal strength of the station as you snip off half an inch at a time.  Stop one snip before it starts getting stronger again.   Or an antenna rotator that you can use to aim your antenna at the weak stations or away from the strong ones.
