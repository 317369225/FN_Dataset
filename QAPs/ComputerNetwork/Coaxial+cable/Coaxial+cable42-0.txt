What is the technology behind antennas which can support multiple frequencies at the same time? Antennas are based upon resonant structures. A pair of wires, laid out as a pole and fed from the middle with a transmission line (like coaxial cable) will resonate at some frequency and multiples of that frequency. Antennas, such as log periodic spirals, are essentially a series of resonant structures that overlap in frequency. As a consequence, they have a very large bandwidth (number of frequencies) in which they are efficient at radiating electromagnetic energy. However, if you are happy with just a fundamental frequency and its harmonics, you can use something as simple as a pair of wires.
