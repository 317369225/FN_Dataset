★I have a cable connection through a coaxial cable in my apartment. The first 50 channels comes fine in my HDTV. But after the 50 channels the picture quality of the rest of the channels is not good. Any suggestion on what can I do?
Call your Cable company  ?  no one else should really touch it either
