★Will fiber optic cables replace coaxial cables?
Fiber optics cables have already replaced either coax or microwave transmission in many areas. For example trans oceanic telecommunications and most of the Internet uses fiber optics transmission. Cable companies have generally upgraded to fiber optic cables at the headend (Hybrid-CoAx), but still primarily use coax to the "last mile," given their large infrastructure investments and regulatory structure limiting competition. Telecommunication companies like Verizon and AT&T offer broadband fiber optic connections to the home (FTTH) replacing twisted pair connections of the past, especially in new housing developments, while Google is beginning to offer broadband fiber optic connections to consumers in selective cities.
