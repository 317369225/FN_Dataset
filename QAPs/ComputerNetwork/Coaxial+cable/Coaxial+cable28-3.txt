★Does electricity travel through a wire at less than the speed of light? If so, at what speed?
In a vacuum electricity and light travel at the same  speed.  It gets trickier if they are going through something. For electricity through wire the propogation wave travels at 95-99% the speed of light.  I asked my regional electricity company if they could narrow that number down or tell me what the major speed bumps were, but they have not responded other than to say electrity flows at nearly the speed of light through wires. That would be in a split wire situation like utility wires.  Twisted pairs, speed in circuits, or different types of wire would be slower.  For lightning to strike electricity must overcome huge resistance to spark through the air so my bet would be that the light from the lightning would be traveling faster than the electric current in the lightning bolt at that second.
