â˜…Does fiber optic cabling decrease the ping versus regular cabling?I've just always wondered as fiber optic uses traveling light as opposed to electrons. I would assume that the light travels a larger distance over all I've always thought that light travels faster than an electron. How does it stack up in short distance versus long distance?
Light and electricity travel at about the same speed in their respective media. Light travels at about 66% of c in glass fiber, the "speed" of electricity in a coaxial cable is similar. Optical fiber Speed of electricity
