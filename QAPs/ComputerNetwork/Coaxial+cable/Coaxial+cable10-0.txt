â˜…Every room of my new house is wired with a coaxial cable. Why?Most rooms have multiple outlets, far more than would be required for TV. One room has four outlets. The unfinished utility room is also is also wired.
So you can place a TV (or modem) on any wall the builder thought you might want to without running ugly cables around the room.
