â˜…Will fiber optic cables replace coaxial cables?
Fibre has replaced copper in many situations already, it remains in place mostly where legacy copper networks already exist and it isn't economical to replace them. I was told that Jersey Telecom (the Island of Jersey in Europe not the USA) actually swapped out copper for fibre because they could extract their legacy copper easily and selling the copper helped fund their super-fast broadband network. Copper is remaining for the last mile in many situations because laying new fibre cable to every household is expensive/difficult. But fibre is getting closer and closer to the consumer. Initially it was just used in long-haul networks and backbones, then it expanded within data centres and later on it started being used for distribution. It is now the main link to the street cabinets for cable and telco companies. The operator can improve the performance of their network by running fibre to the cabinets and making the cabinets more intelligent. Interestingly I have also extensively used fibre in satellite communications which surprises some people. You can now buy LNBs (the thing on the front of the satellite dish that actually does the RF receiving) which has a fibre output. It allows you to distribute the output from a satellite dish to hundreds of households without signal loss and expensive distribution switches/amplifiers. You can reach ~2km or >200 residences with a single LNB. The main reason people don't use it? Because most satellite installers aren't confident with the use of fibre instead of copper, which they trust.
