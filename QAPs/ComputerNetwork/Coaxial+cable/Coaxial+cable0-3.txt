â˜…Does coaxial cable have an upper limit of speed?Fiber is ostensibly limited by the speed of light and the hardware switching the packets. But does a single coaxial cable have an upper bound of bandwidth speeds?
DOCSIS 3.0 broke the 38.8Mbps second barrier by enabling channel bonding, 8 in the downstream and 4 in the upstream. DOCSIS 3.1 eliminates the 6MHz limitation per carrier and replaces it with a more robust (less sensitive to noise) OFDM technology capable of 1024 and maybe even 4096 QAM. The big issue facing the cable operators today is how to expand the upstream bandwidth from 42 MHz to 85MHz and beyond. In theory, then entire spectrum of 54-1000MHz could become one large carrier, capable of terabit speeds. But, practically, we'll see Gbps speeds available with DOCSIS 3.1. Synchronous connections a bit farther down the pike.
