★What are the advantages and disadvantages of a coaxial cable?
Compared with optical fiber, coaxial cable enjoys the advantages of relatively cheaper price and more convenient installment. As a result, in the monitor system within a small scope, as the transmission distance is very close, transmitting the monitoring image with coaxial cable can not distort the image so that it can meet actual requirement. Moreover, coaxial cable can compensate for different rate by doing balance adjustment in order to distort as less video signal from receiving terminal. Coaxial cable is still the most common means of data transmission over short distances. The advantages are: they are cheap to make cheap to install easy to modify good bandwidth great channel capacity noise immunity due to low error rate   Be Positive about everything, and its depends on your own selves that how you made it for.
