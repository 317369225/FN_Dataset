★What is the best method for making a RG6 coaxial cable, crimp connections, screw on, or compression?
It’s really personal preference.  Crimped connectors will be the most reliable (provided they are done correctly) and the strongest connector (vs. pull) but it requires specific tooling for crimping and stripping the cable and connector.  Compression connectors generally still require  stripping of the cable but the connector is held on by tightening a collar to make the connection rather than crimping it permanently in place.  Screw on works just like it sounds and generally requires the least amount of expertise and tooling.  I would, however, recommend crimping as it is the most reliable connection.
