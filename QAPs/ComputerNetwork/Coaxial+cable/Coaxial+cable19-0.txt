â˜…Why is coaxial cable capable of carrying data at speeds that are so much higher than those of copper cable?I.e., are there physical characteristics of cable networks that allow for higher data rates, vs. the copper cable that telcos have?
Firstly: coax is copper cable! We are really talking about coax vs twisted pair telephone cable. Cables get interference and the longer they are the more they are likely to encounter it. Coax has a nice earth shield around it to block much of that noise but copper pairs don't. Instead copper pairs try to balance out noise using some interesting techniques called common mode noise rejection and balanced line theory. But the cables themselves still get noise (it can just be cleaned a bit) and the cables weren't designed for the type of traffic they carry, so coax wins and copper pairs try to keep up!
