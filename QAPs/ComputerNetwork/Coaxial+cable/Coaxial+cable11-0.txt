★Do HDTVs require HDMI cables or can you just use a coaxial cable?We use AT&T Uverse and the tech said we needed both a coaxial cable and an HDMI cable. But the picture looks great without the HDMI cable and one of the AT&T boxes doesn't have an HDMI port anyway. What do you think?
If your TV has an RF input (for an antenna), then that input is indeed coax and can support HD content just fine.  If you never use a roof antenna, then you can certainly use that input for your set-top box. Make sure though that the set-top box transmits in HD over RF.  It may be simply there to support old TV sets without an HDMI input.
