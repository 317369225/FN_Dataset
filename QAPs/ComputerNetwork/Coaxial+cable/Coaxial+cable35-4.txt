â˜…How do I hack my coax cable wire into a internet connection via ethernet?I am in a house upstairs and in my room I have a coax cable that goes to my tv. I also have a wifi but the signal to my room is only 1 bar and my xbox is having problems staying connected wirelessly. How can I turn hack my coax cable tv cord so I can let my xbox tap into the network? Thanks
You could get 16 foot USB extension cable, hook your wireless adapter (from your xbox) to it, and position the adapter closer to the wifi router. I think you can do that with the xbox. I say 16 feet because that's the longest you can go with USB without losing the connection. Hope this helps. Justin Gilson Is your computer running slow again?! Speed Up Your Computer Yourself!
