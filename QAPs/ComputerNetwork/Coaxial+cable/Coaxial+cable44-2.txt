â˜…The Tamil Nadu government has announced that it is going to provide cheap broadband Internet via TV cable operations. Is it feasible? Has any other country already adapted this technology successfully?
Its a commendable effort of the state government as TV cable already has huge penetration in almost all parts of the state so using an existent network of both dealers/physical components etc , is a very good idea but I cannot comment on the technical aspect of the idea.
