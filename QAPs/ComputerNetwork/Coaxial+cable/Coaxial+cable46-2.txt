★Is the monitor on laptops hardwired to the CPU, or is it operated by wireless transmission?If one wanted to physically disconnect their laptop's monitor screen from the laptop CPU, would it be possible?  Are there electronic connections that could be lengthened, or a wireless or Bluetooth connection established to replace those connections?
The monitors built in to laptops are hard wired. The usually also have a socket which provides an alternative hid wired connection for an external monitor. It is possible to add external monitors over WiFi (Bluetooth has way too little bandwidth). Most of them work via a virtualised USB: you connect a Magic dongle to your USB port, and it transmits over WiFi to another device attached to your monitor. Such devices are usually only moderately acceptable. WiFi gives only about 30 MBit/sec usable bandwidth, and a good desktop experience needs about 200 MBit/sec of bandwidth. They work for "office" type applications but artefacts are visible. Higher bandwidth solutions are on the horizon, but not here yet.  Current solutions will work for some users, but not all. Be prepared for restrictions on performance. Disclosure: I work for a company that manufactures the USB to video chips used in many of the devices on the market.
