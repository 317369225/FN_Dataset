â˜…How do I hack my coax cable wire into a internet connection via ethernet?I am in a house upstairs and in my room I have a coax cable that goes to my tv. I also have a wifi but the signal to my room is only 1 bar and my xbox is having problems staying connected wirelessly. How can I turn hack my coax cable tv cord so I can let my xbox tap into the network? Thanks
You could use a MOCA adapter to run Ethernet frames over the coaxial cables, but 'try before you buy' - my experience has been that longer runs between a faraway room to the basement tap/splitter/amplifier and onward to a different faraway room may not support a connection. MOCA network performance can be hard to diagnose, since the splitter/amplifier might not have adequate power to propagate the signal, and older RG-x cable runs may not provide enough resistance (in Ohms) or the higher signal-to-noise ratio needed for DOCSIS 3.0. But if it works, you'd split the signal between coaxial cables terminating at the video receiver (set-top box) and at the Xbox with one MOCA adapter, and would split the cable-modem signal with a MOCA adapter in front of the cable modem. Another option would be to use powerline adapters if you have enough vacant electrical outlets (unclaimed by surge protectors, if possible), but these aren't guaranteed to work, either, so be sure you can return them to the retailer without an RMA or restocking fee. Powerline adapters send a signal between electrical sockets, and wouldn't use the coaxial cable runs.
