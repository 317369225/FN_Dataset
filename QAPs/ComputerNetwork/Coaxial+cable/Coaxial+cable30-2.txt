â˜…Why do we use Wave guides and Coaxial lines instead of using simple wires?In our home power lines (50 Hz AC) we simply use two conducting wires, and in TV lines too sometimes twisted cables are used. I am wondering why can't we use any of these for transmission of RF (for eg: 200MHz)
Twisted pairs are just copper enveloped materials as we know that copper can handle power up to some extent we use it for very low frequencies For ex:-we get 230V AC supply with 50hz frequency so it is a very low frequency where a copper wire can withstand without breakage so as we are getting our desired output with simple cables we use twisted pairs for general purpose.but at higher frequencies it is worthless... CO-AXIAL CABLE:- I can say it is a high efficient transmission media within a frequency range up to 2GHZ but after it undergoes skin effect with very high attenuation. Skin effect is a physical phenomenon that relates to the limited penetration into a conductor of an RadioFrequent signal according to its frequency. All electric currents generate magnetic fields that in turn can affect the current .In a direct current case everything is constant and so nothing seems to happen. With an alternating current, however, there is a delay in the magnetic field's response to the change in current and the 'old' magnetic field tends to push the current towards the outside of the conductor. As the frequency increases, so does the effect until at very high frequencies the entire current flows in a very narrow skin on the conductor--hence the name. An increase in frequency causes non-uniform current density and an increased AC resistance of the wire. Coax uses this effect to keep the RadioFrequent signal inside and any coupled outside interference on its shield's outside surface. So we cannot use this for higher frequencies so the choice is waveguide.
