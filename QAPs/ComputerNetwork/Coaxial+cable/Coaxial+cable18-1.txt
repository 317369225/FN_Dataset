â˜…To what extent do different dielectrics and shielding methods affect the attenuation and/or fidelity of signal propagated over coaxial cable?E.g., RG-8, RG-11, RG-58, RG-59, etc. What advantages does each cable type carry over the other, and why?
The American RG specifications are indeed vague and there's lots of "RG6 type" cable that's absolute rubbish. Also, technology moves on; it used to be that air-spaced dielectric was better than foam but modern foam is at least as efficient as air-spaced, if not better, and it's more robust. If you want a decent 75 Ohm coaxial cable, look no further than WF100 supplied by Webro or TX100 supplied by Triax. Both of these have a copper core of 1 square mm and a copper foil shield with braided copper wire on top. The use of copper, throughout, makes for an efficient cable - albeit expensive compared with those using aluminium and steel. But you get the performance that you pay for.
