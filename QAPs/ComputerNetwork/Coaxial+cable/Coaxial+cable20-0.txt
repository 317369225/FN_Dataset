â˜…I have a coaxial cable that feeds to my cable box. Is it possible to use the cable that exists there now to feed a new coaxial cable and Ethernet cable?
Connect the new coaxial and ethernet cable to old one and use it to pull new ones through. You will need to be careful with any tight holes or sharp corners you are pulling it through. Watch a YouTube video and get a few other peoples opinions.
