â˜…In which UK regulation is the coaxial cable type for a new house build specified?and what is the minimum specification?
To the best of my knowledge there is no UK legal standard. However the Confederation of Aerial Industries (CAI) has provided a brief recommendation for electricians, here: Aerial systems for a digital age There's also a good review of coaxial cable types, written by a time-served professional aerial and dish installer, here: Coaxial cable comparison Coaxial cable is best installed by a professional engineer who is familiar with TV signals and NOT by an electrician who isn't. There are many pitfalls of which a typical electrician would be unaware. You wouldn't expect a plumber to have the necessary knowledge so why expect an electrician to?
