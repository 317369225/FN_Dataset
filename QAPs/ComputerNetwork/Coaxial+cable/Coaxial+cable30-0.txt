★Why do we use Wave guides and Coaxial lines instead of using simple wires?In our home power lines (50 Hz AC) we simply use two conducting wires, and in TV lines too sometimes twisted cables are used. I am wondering why can't we use any of these for transmission of RF (for eg: 200MHz)
Twisted cables are not used for carrying power(AC).  House wiring has two wires, but they are not twisted.  Twisted-pair is used in networking to allow differential signalling that reduces noise over distance. Coaxial cable can be used in some networks(such as Ethernet, in the old days).  It has also been used in Cable TV, and is used also to reduce noise.  Coax has a number of characteristics intrinsically to allow relatively wideband signals so that many channels can be used, all multiplexed onto the one conductor. Waveguides are used at microwave frequencies, usually at high power levels.  A waveguide may be viewed as an infinite number of half wavelength stubs all piled next to each other in a long row.  Think of a u-shaped length of metal.  It turns out to have little effect if you take two of these u-shapes and weld them together into a rectangular pipe.  They may also be round in some applications. In a rectangular waveguide, the wide dimension determines the resonant frequency, and the narrow dimension is designed not to arc at the transmitted power, so one may think of the narrow dimension being the power limit. A waveguide for 200MHz would be fairly large and unwieldy.
