★The Tamil Nadu government has announced that it is going to provide cheap broadband Internet via TV cable operations. Is it feasible? Has any other country already adapted this technology successfully?
Yes. Quite a few countries over the world have deployed broadband over cable. There are some challenges based on the quality of the cables already laid for TV. But there are technologies that can give you as high as  50 MB/sec speeds. For cable operators it is a great way of utilizing the infrastructure they have already deployed for TV. In India, fiber rollout to the home has been very slow, and with all the action happening on the mobile front, telecom operators are reluctant to contemplate fixed line broadband in volume because of questionable returns and a much larger period for ROI. The only technology that is "future proof" for broadband to homes and businesses is Fiber-to-the-home FTTH, or Fiber-to-the-building FTTP. Unfortunately for India, the progress on that front has been very slow. We lag behind the developed world in this critical infrastructure that can dramatically improve the economy. Countries like Australia and Singapore have started and deployed an ambitious national broadband infrastructure that can be built once and used by multiple service providers. That is what we need. It requires vision and investment. Our politicians are still playing around with an infrastructure plan that primarily focuses on reaching cities and villages and not focused on the "last mile", the vital connection from local telecom infrastructure to the home or business. Also, the thrust into broadband is being led by BSNL, a public sector company that is well behind times in terms of organization and efficiency.
