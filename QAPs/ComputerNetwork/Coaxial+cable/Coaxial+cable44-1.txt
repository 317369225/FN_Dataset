â˜…The Tamil Nadu government has announced that it is going to provide cheap broadband Internet via TV cable operations. Is it feasible? Has any other country already adapted this technology successfully?
You can provide broadband, cable tv in one system. Feasibility? All depends on price and decent speed. I don't see any other reason why it won't work out. Have seen one at my aunt's place in singapore. the modem used is called a cable modem. Looks like this: You switch this on and all your cable tv and wifi run simultaneously.
