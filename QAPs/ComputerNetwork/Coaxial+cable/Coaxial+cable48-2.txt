â˜…What determines the bandwidth of optical fiber versus copper wire?
To elaborate a little further on Jacob VanWagoner's discussion of chromatic dispersion (CD) compensation it is worth looking further at dispersion shifted fiber and then at a newer method comprising directing the optical signal into and back out of a chirped fiber Bragg grating (FBG) Google. . The earliest dispersion shifted fiber was zero dispersion shifted fiber (ZDSF) with the minimum dispersion point at 1550nm coincident with the minimum loss wavelength for single mode fiber. As dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) pushed to more and narrower channels it was found that a phenomenon called 4-wave mixing caused cross-talk between channels and defeated the benefits of tighter DWDM channel spacing. The problem was addressed by using non-zero dispersion shifted fiber (NZDSF). However, this left some smaller dispersion effect to deal with. . Chromatic (think chroma = color) dispersion amounts to the effect of wavelength dependent index of refraction. Index of refraction is the measure of the reduction of the speed of light in a medium w.r.t. light in a vacuum. The effect of CD is that the longer wavelengths propagate slower and arrive later. In a chirped FBG (below), this effect can be reversed by providing the longer periods in the FBG nearer the circulator so that the shorter time of flight in and out of the FBG for longer wavelengths compensates the relative delay they have accumulated in the last transmission leg. This squares up a blurred or rounded square wave to look, ideally, like it did when sent. This in turn contributes to the very high bandwidths achieved today in DWDM optical fiber communication (over 100Tb/s as of 2011 in a lab setting - Ultrafast fibre optics set new speed record). Copper cannot duplicate this. Figure by Fredrik Sjostrom, Proximion Fiber Systems in Photonics Online 5-20-2009. Page on proximion.com
