★Does electricity travel through a wire at less than the speed of light? If so, at what speed?
The speed of light, often called "C", commonly refers to the speed of light in a vacuum, which is the fastest it will go. Its about 300 million meters per second. The propogation of electric field, or electrical signalling using electrical signals in a wire is a bit slower. It can be anywhere from about 50% of C to 99% of C, depending upon the wire and insulation composition and construction.  See the wiki article Velocity factor. There's another speed which is the drift velocity. This can be considered like tracking an individual electron and its very slow, on the order of fractions of meters per second. You can not picture electrical signal propagation as s single electron or a batch of electrons travelling in the wire from one end to the other at 75% of the speed of light... you must consider that the electrons bump into each other and trade places with a few holes to propagate the field, much as when you hear a sound at a distance of 1000 feet, the sound pressure on your ear is not the molecules of air originally moved a thousand feet away but a compression wave moving from molecule to molecule over that distance.  See wiki article Drift velocity
