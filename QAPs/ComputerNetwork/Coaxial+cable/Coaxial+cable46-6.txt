★Is the monitor on laptops hardwired to the CPU, or is it operated by wireless transmission?If one wanted to physically disconnect their laptop's monitor screen from the laptop CPU, would it be possible?  Are there electronic connections that could be lengthened, or a wireless or Bluetooth connection established to replace those connections?
there is usually a ribbon cable carrying power and signals to the screen half of a laptop. The cable is not user connectable or extendable in the usual sense.
