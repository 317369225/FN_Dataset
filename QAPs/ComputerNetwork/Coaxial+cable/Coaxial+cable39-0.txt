★What are the advantages and disadvantages of a coaxial cable?
The two major types of feedline for time-varying electrical signals are parallel conductors ("ladder line", "twin lead", or "twisted pair") and coaxial cable ("coax").  Each has its advantages and disadvantages. Coaxial has higher loss per unit distance than twisted pair, and when used with mismatched loads, will radiate signal from the shield.  However, when properly loaded with a matched signal, coax is much quieter than twisted pair and far more immune to noise.  Parallel conductor feedlines generally have much lower loss but are much less immune to noise and will readily couple to any conductive objects that are proximate to the cable.  Thus, much greater care is required when routing twin lead than when routing coax. Please note that I've addressed this question in the domain of RF/AF electronics.  If this is not the domain you had in mind, please reword your question.
