★Is the monitor on laptops hardwired to the CPU, or is it operated by wireless transmission?If one wanted to physically disconnect their laptop's monitor screen from the laptop CPU, would it be possible?  Are there electronic connections that could be lengthened, or a wireless or Bluetooth connection established to replace those connections?
Nothing is actually ever hardwired to a CPU, the CPU is soldered, or connected to the Motherboard/MainBoard, 90% of Laptops made these days are modular which allows for easy changes of components. To answer your question - a Laptop Monitor is connected to the Mainboard by means of a thin ribbon cable that runs directly from the monitor to the Board. The Ribbon can definetely be lenghtened assuming you have the expertise to recreate the connector on the end of either the monitor side, the board side - or both. In the the distant past, there were 2 seperate cables - one for Power and one for Data, these days - this has been merged to a single cable.
