★Why do we use Wave guides and Coaxial lines instead of using simple wires?In our home power lines (50 Hz AC) we simply use two conducting wires, and in TV lines too sometimes twisted cables are used. I am wondering why can't we use any of these for transmission of RF (for eg: 200MHz)
At 200MHz frequency, wavelength (abt 1.5 meter) becomes comparable to the length of wire and hence wire acts as an antenna. In case of power lines the wavelength is of the order of 1000s of KMs. So theres almost no radiation loss.   Outer copper mesh of coaxial cable helps in reducing the radiation losses hence coaxial cable is use at higher frequencies.
