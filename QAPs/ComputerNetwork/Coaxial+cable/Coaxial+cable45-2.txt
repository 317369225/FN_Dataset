★What is the difference between 100 MBPS on optic fiber and 100 MBPS on coaxial cable?
I'm not sure I understand the question.  The difference between 100 Mbps over copper or over fiber is nothing except for the physical media and connectors.  Data throughput is data put through a system, whether it travels over copper or glass is irrelevant.  In more general terms, fiber can push more data over longer distances faster than copper, see Cable Lengths and Transmission Speeds.
