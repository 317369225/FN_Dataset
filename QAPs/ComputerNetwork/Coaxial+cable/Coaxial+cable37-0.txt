★Do cable TV and Internet services via a coaxial connection work during a power outage?
This depends on the design of the hybrid fiber coax network.  If the nodes have battery back ups then the answer is yes.  Also, many embedded telephone adapters deployed by the operator will have a battery built into it, however it is common for those devices to be configured to turn off the ethernet port so that the voice service will last as long as possible.  If you want the data connectivity to keep working you'll definitely need to have it on a UPS. Generally the larger cable companies in the US are setup this way, but this is far universal since the large operators commonly purchase smaller ones and it can take a lot of time to get those acquisitions into shape.
