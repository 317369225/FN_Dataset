★Is the monitor on laptops hardwired to the CPU, or is it operated by wireless transmission?If one wanted to physically disconnect their laptop's monitor screen from the laptop CPU, would it be possible?  Are there electronic connections that could be lengthened, or a wireless or Bluetooth connection established to replace those connections?
There's a cable connecting the monitor to a video port (not the cpu itself) It's not hard wired in the sense that I think when I hear the word hard wired because it can be unplugged. I would suggest that if you're going to do this kind of experiment, be prepared for the only result is that you end up with a broken laptop.
