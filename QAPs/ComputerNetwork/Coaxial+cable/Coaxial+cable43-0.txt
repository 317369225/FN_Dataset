★I want to set up a private internet between 100 houses on a 1 hectare plot of land I own. I have unlimited coaxial cables and 100 cable modems. What else do I need in terms of hardware and software?Context: I just heard that in France internet service provider companies compete to access the physical cables laid out by cable companies (or something like that). This prompted me to wonder what it takes to setup a web from scratch, and furthermore, whether I can do it.
You'd need at least one and possibly several DOCSIS CMTS headends to terminate the other end of those cable modem connections.  Cable modem service is an asymmetric transport, and the bulk of the work is done by the CMTS headend.  Without a CMTS, the cable modems are basically useless. Beyond that, you'll probably also need a good number of repeaters to maintain adequate signal strength on the cable lines. Unless you are already planning to run coaxial cable to provide CATV service, it would make far more sense for you to use optical fiber.  And you can just as easily run CATV over optical fiber, so I'd use optical fiber instead.
