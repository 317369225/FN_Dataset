â˜…What are the advantages and disadvantages of a coaxial cable?
COAXIAL CABLE Advantages sufficient frequency range to support multiple channel, which allows for much greater throughput. lower error rates. because the inner conductor is in a Faraday shield, noise immunity is improved, and coax has a lower error rates and therefore slightly better performance than twisted pair. greater spacing between amplifiers coax's cable shielding reduces noise and crosstalk, which means amplifiers can be spaced farther apart than with twisted pair.Disadvantages more expensive to install compare to twisted pair cable. the thicker the cable, the more difficult to work with.
