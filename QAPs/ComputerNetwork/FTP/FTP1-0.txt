★What's the best FTP app for iPhone?
Gusto.  Not sure about iPhone, but I give one huge thumbs up to the iPad app "gusto" - I just picked it up for $6, logged into FTP with no problems & it's easy to download files, edit, and upload the revised version.  Of course, I wouldn't want to code an entire website on my tablet, but for quick fixes & tweaks, using "gusto" on the run is extremely gratifying. From looking at reviews of the other products, a key issue has been that certain programs don't work with SFTP.  If you need the "S" in FTP, then make sure the tool you're buying can handle it.  There are others out there, but from reading some reviews and the prices, this is the one I picked and I'm pleased with it.
