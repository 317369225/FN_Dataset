â˜…How are cloud computing and FTP different?
I work for ShareFile, a cloud computing company. Unlike FTP, ShareFile can be accessed using any web browser and does not require the opening of additional ports or the installation of special software to use it. FTP traffic travels over port 21, a special port that is often closed by firewalls at large corporations for security reasons. If your employees and clients can surf the internet, they can use ShareFile. ShareFile uses a completely different method of transferring files than FTP. Unlike FTP, which transfers files and passwords in clear text for anyone to see, ShareFile uses SSL encryption to protect the privacy of passwords and files.
