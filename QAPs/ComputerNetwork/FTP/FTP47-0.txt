â˜…What's the difference between FTP and Sftp?
SFTP is FTP over an SSH connection. Whereas files transferred via FTP are in cleartext, file transfers via SFTP benefit from end-to-end encryption. Someone snooping on any part of your connection could tell which files you were downloading by FTP, but they would not be able to if you were to use SFTP. One particular danger of FTP is that authentication, i.e. logging in with your username and password, is also not encrypted in any way, which means that a snooper on the network would see your username and password plain as day when you made the connection. But because SFTP uses SSH, and SSH sends your login credentials securely, this is not a danger with SFTP.
