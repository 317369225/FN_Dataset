â˜…What is the difference between HTTP and FTP?
They are different protocols designed for different purposes, first and foremost. FTP is significantly older, it is a protocol designed to enable the transfer of files over a long-running session. There are a wide array of commands and the intent is to allow you to navigate and browse a remote file system and retrieve files (originally over a separate data connection). HTTP was designed to retrieve a resource from a URL that may or may not match the remote file system (in many web apps, the structure of the URLs has very little to do with the file locations). There is often only a single request in a single http connection and the data uses the same connection as the request. There are definitely published web pages that answer this question I detail if you want more: http://daniel.haxx.se/docs/ftp-v... http://www.differencebetween.net... http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/F...
