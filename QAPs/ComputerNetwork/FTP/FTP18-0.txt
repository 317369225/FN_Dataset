â˜…Why is FTP called unsafe?File Transfer Protocol has been an old way of uploading and downloading files but very recently developers have been saying that is is not safe. Any reason for that. If that is not safe, then what would be the best alternative?
FTP sends in all your credentials and the data you transfer without encrypting(that is in plain text). So it is possible for someone to eavesdrop by capturing your packets.Especially when you use a public network. This is the prime reason for FTP being insecure. As Vinoth K.S said,SFTP is more secure because of its SSH usage along with FTP.
