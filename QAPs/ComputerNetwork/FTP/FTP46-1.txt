â˜…What are the drawbacks to distributing large files via anonymous FTP?I have a lot of large video files to share. People suggest various file hosting sites, but why wouldn't I just share the files via Anonymous FTP (read only for clients)?
Personally, I would look for alternatives for the following reasons: 1. It's kind of old school, and unfamiliar to most modern internet users, who started to use the internet regularly after ftp's golden age was waning. 2. There are various security vulnerabilities built straight in to the protocol. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fil... 3. You'll be paying for all bandwidth on large files. 4. Your computer would have to be on 24-7, and you would have to setup a static WAN IP address or domain in order to share online, assign your LAN IP static as well, and establish port forwarding, which is kind of a pain. 5. People generally do not prefer to download videos in their entirety to watch them once, and generally prefer streaming. Personally, I would just set up a YouTube or Vimeo account and embed them on your site. You can preserve the original definition, and I think in Vimeo you can make them downloadable somehow, but I can't remember. If you don't like that idea, you would be just as well to set up an http server at home which offers the files for download.
