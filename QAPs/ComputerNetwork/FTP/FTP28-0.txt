â˜…Which PHP photo gallery allows easy uploads via FTP?
A while ago I wrote a simple PHP gallery script called Dead Simple Gallery. The whole script is based on an idea that you can upload some images to a folder on your FTP, add one line of code to your site and get HTML list of cached thumbnails that link to big image versions on the output. Image file names turn into titles and alt attributes (e.g. cuteDog_photo.jpg -> Cute Dog Photo) and It can also be easily customized to adjust thumbnail sizes, source folder names, etc. The script costs around $12 at the moment, but I think it's really worth the price, especially if someone needs a solution that can be applied quickly and easily.
