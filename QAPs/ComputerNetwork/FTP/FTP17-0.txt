â˜…How can I upload to an FTP site via email?
Attachments are what are called MIME types. MIME specifies how the content is encoded and the headers that get wrapped around the content. For some content types like images, video, binary files, the MIME type requires an additional step called Base64 encoding which translates the file into a format that can be sent safely though email. What you will need to do is get the email and save the attachment: here is what I would do (assuming that you can't get a different camera, which would be best). Set-up an email account to receive the email from the camera this can be anywhere, who cares. Locate a library in your preferred programming language that can receive email and save MIME types. It depends on your chosen language, but I am sure that you can find one for your liking. Personally, I'd use perl or PHP for this, but I know them. PHP is really easy to use and the mail functions are built in (not not well documented). Perl is a bit more difficult, but cpan.org has a ton of libraries that makes this stuff a snap. Setup a script to check for new email via Pop3 or iMap. Doesn't matter which. if new email is found, download email. break email apart for the correct MIME type (attachment) save Attachment to where ever you want. If steps 1-6 are successful, delete email from mail server (if you want).
