â˜…During PayPal campus recruitment, the interviewer asked me to write code for an FTP server. Is it a typical question for tech interviews?He also told me that he wanted a working C/C++ code and went for a 15-minute break during the interview process. I wrote pseudocode because I didn't remember the syntax of all the API calls and he asked me to leave. I am sure I wrote the pseudocode correctly because I had already implemented a server. Is memorizing the API function calls and parameters worth it? I am a computer science undergraduate.
The Paypal guy is an idiot who has no sense of what skills are really relevant and he was probably doing you a favour by not hiring you if he was representative of the people you would be working with.
