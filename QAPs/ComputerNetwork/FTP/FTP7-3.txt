★How does FTP protocol work over the internet?I want to know how does FTP protocol work while transferring the files over internet.

One can use filezilla server and client(The free FTP solution) on thier local computer connected over LAN and capture packets via Wireshark(Wireshark · Go Deep.) to understand the below process in details.
