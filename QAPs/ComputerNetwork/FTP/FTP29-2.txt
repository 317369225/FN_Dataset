â˜…How do you setup an FTP server to do a custom action on file upload?
I suggest too the generic inotify solution for uploads in an specific directory (you monitor single directories, not trees, if users can create directories and upload files there it may not be a solution). Some ftp servers (at least pureftpd, not sure about vsftpd) let you execute an script on file upload. If will be more targetted than using inotify (i.e. won't execute an action if you fiddle around that directory using other protocols or shell), but that functionality must be builtin in the server. Another alternative (not great, but could work for you) is to have a cron job that with the find command checks for new files there since the last run (and maybe check with i.e. lsof that the ftp server is not still writting on that file)
