â˜…How do you setup an FTP server to do a custom action on file upload?
This is fairly straightforward to do with Apache Mina FtpServer (http://mina.apache.org/ftpserver/). They have very nice authentication and file system abstractions, and a great FtpLet API which allows you to create your own custom actions on upload start/completion, and a few other triggers. It supports FTP and FTPS, but doesn't support SFTP (which is over an unrelated SSH protocol). Mina SSHD supports SFTP, but it's a young project which (as of June 2010) doesn't have the authentication/virtual FS abstraction/custom trigger abstraction yet, but the project is moving in that direction. I ended up using Mina FtpServer, and will likely change SSHD enough (and contribute back) to do what I need as well.
