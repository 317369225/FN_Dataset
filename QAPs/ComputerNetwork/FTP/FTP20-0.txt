★How can I connect to an ftp server with Linux?i want to know how file tranfer by ftp server
Linux generally has built in command line utilities for performing ftp, sftp and scp.  The commands are ftp, sftp and scp respectively.  For information on these commands use the man command e.g. man ftp If you are looking for a GUI client I would like to recommend AnyClient.  This is a free platform independent file transfer client that supports all major file transfer protocols including Amazon S3, FTP, FTPS, SFTP and WebDAV. http://www.jscape.com/products/f...
