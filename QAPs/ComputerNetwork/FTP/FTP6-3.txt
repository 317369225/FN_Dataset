â˜…What is the easiest way to do an FTP to FTP transfer online?I mean transferring online, so I don't want to download then reupload. But I can't write code or find a tool, anyone will help me? Thanks
Text wrangler for Mac has built in support for FTP where you can download the files and save them easily. I recommend this. For web development FTP for the most part IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. It takes a lot longer to upload download files and then you have to wait while your browser refreshes. Try installing XAMPP instead and developing sites without the internet. This gives you tremendous advantages. Just google XAMPP and look for the download for whatever is you are running. XAMPP has support for all the major OSs
