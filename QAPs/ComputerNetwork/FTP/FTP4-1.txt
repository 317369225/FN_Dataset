â˜…What is the best FTP client for Windows and Mac OS?I have been introduced to some security issues with several FTP clients. I am looking for the most secure, feature-rich FTP client with versions for both Mac OS and Windows. According to me the most important features are good queue management, different connections in tabs, supporting SFTP, simple interface, handling large files elegantly and good UI responsiveness.
Total Commander is a great file manager that replicates the old Norton Commander under Windows. In Total Commander working with FTP is no different than working with your file system. You can copy, move, delete and edit files, create directories and assign UNIX permissions. Sample screenshots Total Commander uses two panels. You can copy from left to right, or right to left. In this screenshot my FTP is open on the left and my c:\temp is open on the right. Pressing F5, I am copying a file from right to left. I can change the file's permissions on the server if I need to.
