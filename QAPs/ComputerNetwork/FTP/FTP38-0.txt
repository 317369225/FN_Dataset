★FTP: What are the best providers for free FTP service and who also offer at least some free storage and bandwidth?I'm developing an FTP application and need a way to test its functionality during the core development phase.  I do not have an FTP server setup here and do not particularly want to undertake the process involved in doing so unless absolutely necessary.
Here's a French service that apparently offers 5GB of temporary free FTP space, 1GB of which is accessible via the web: http://downloadsquad.switched.co... I tried it once and found it a bit spotty, so proceed with caution. Also, this service will let you upload via FTP and distribute the files (up to 400mb) among various free file hosting services: http://www.gazup.com
