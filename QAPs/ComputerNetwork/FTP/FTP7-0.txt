★How does FTP protocol work over the internet?I want to know how does FTP protocol work while transferring the files over internet.
Great answers here, here is my take on how it works, since this was an A2A and I missed answering the question now I feel bad not answering. The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer computer files from one host to another host over a TCP-based network, such as the Internet FTP is built on a client-server architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server.[1] FTP users may authenticate themselves using a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but  can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. For  secure transmission that protects the username and password, and  encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS). SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is sometimes also used instead, but is technologically different. When ever you needed exact info check out it's RFC document: File Transfer Protocol Here are the return codes for FTP: List of FTP server return codes Here is a short video of how it works froma  random samrtian of internet:
