â˜…What is the best FTP client for Windows and Mac OS?I have been introduced to some security issues with several FTP clients. I am looking for the most secure, feature-rich FTP client with versions for both Mac OS and Windows. According to me the most important features are good queue management, different connections in tabs, supporting SFTP, simple interface, handling large files elegantly and good UI responsiveness.
If you are after an open source FTP client can I recommend Cyberduck (http://cyberduck.ch/). It is fully featured and while I have only used it on the Mac it also has a Windows version. The only thing on your list is that it uses different windows for different connections rather than tabs.
