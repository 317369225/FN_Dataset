â˜…Which FTP server could you recommend me?
FTP server? proftpd is my first choice. I have read some comments in the current answers and it seems like you want very low overhead and high performance for evaluating and optimizing network and disk performance. I don't think FTP is the best candidate for that, FTP is light but it has some overhead, as I said in a comment, I would go with netcat or developing my own application. (be aware that there are multiple versions of netcat) As you sair some of your tests will be on network performance, I would also consider testing transfering data between ramdisks (like linux /dev/shm) avoiding disk overheads.
