â˜…During PayPal campus recruitment, the interviewer asked me to write code for an FTP server. Is it a typical question for tech interviews?He also told me that he wanted a working C/C++ code and went for a 15-minute break during the interview process. I wrote pseudocode because I didn't remember the syntax of all the API calls and he asked me to leave. I am sure I wrote the pseudocode correctly because I had already implemented a server. Is memorizing the API function calls and parameters worth it? I am a computer science undergraduate.
As Lawrence says, I think the guy was an idiot and your best off not working there. Writing an FTP server is not a good interview question. However there are probably a couple of things you could have done better. 1. If he asked for C/C++ and you know it you should write C/C++ not pseudocode. You can put in placeholders or comments where you don't know the protocol exactly, but he was trying to test your knowledge of C syntax. 2. You had 10mins to write to code, try and make it reasonably complete. Try and get the syntax as accurate as you can. Try and make the code well structured, and the abstractions as clear as possible.
