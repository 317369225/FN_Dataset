â˜…What is the difference between HTTP and FTP?
The differences I'll be discussing here will be mostly from a user's standpoint. Both HTTP and FTP can be used for transferring files. One difference, from a user's standpoint is that HTTP uses port 80, while FTP uses port 21 for its command channel and port 20 or some random port for its data channel, which depends on the mode being used, i.e. active or passive (Active v.s. Passive FTP Simplified). For this reason, HTTP connections are much easier to configure on firewalls. Another difference is that, in order to use HTTP for transferring files, all you'll need is a Web browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari). FTP, on the other hand, requires relatively less-common clients (compared to browsers) like AnyClient (Free FTP Client | FTP Client | FTP Software | AnyClient) or Filezilla (The free FTP solution)
