â˜…For downloading, is HTTP or FTP better nowadays?FTP seems to have fallen behind both in terms of clients and servers, if these two protocols are to be compared by download capabilities, which will win, and why ? Are HTTP a better choice nowadays ?
With the ability to have multiple simultaneous connections to a single file using either protocol you can easily fill your bandwidth pipe and increase your download speeds to the point of not caring which one you use. There are current clients for both protocols that are cross platform (you can use them from any OS) Currently I use Download Them All (DTA) as a Firefox plugin and I am very happy with it (It uses HTTP)
