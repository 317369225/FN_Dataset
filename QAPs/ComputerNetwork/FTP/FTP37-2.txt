â˜…Is it possible to install and use FreeBSD without FTP support?I have been curious to know if FreeBSD can be installed on a system that is behind a proxy that does not allow FTP ( but allows HTTP/HTTPS). Is it possible to install FreeBSD and install packages ? If yes how ?
You can setup a local FTP server: http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handb...
