â˜…During PayPal campus recruitment, the interviewer asked me to write code for an FTP server. Is it a typical question for tech interviews?He also told me that he wanted a working C/C++ code and went for a 15-minute break during the interview process. I wrote pseudocode because I didn't remember the syntax of all the API calls and he asked me to leave. I am sure I wrote the pseudocode correctly because I had already implemented a server. Is memorizing the API function calls and parameters worth it? I am a computer science undergraduate.
I disagree with the interviewer being an idiot. In campus recruiting events, companies generally have to go through numerous applicants in shorter chunks of time than say an onsite interview. Yes, FTP is a legacy if not out-dated network service. But this contrived and maybe "older" question can reveal a lot as FTP is a rather simple ASCII based network protocol. Depending on the specific role of the position, the question's answer can highlight the candidate's understanding of the following areas: sockets/networking string parsing client/sever networking protocols threading/process model in multiple connection handling C/C++ syntax/semantics state-machines Object-oriented design patterns access privileges and security or lack there of One could readily write the skeleton/framework in C or C++ and glob over some detail with pseudo-code in under 10 minutes. Knowing the minute details of FTP or any specific API I think is largely irrelevant. You have to look at it is as a more open-ended question and a chance to show your breadth of domain knowledge.
