â˜…Is it possible to install and use FreeBSD without FTP support?I have been curious to know if FreeBSD can be installed on a system that is behind a proxy that does not allow FTP ( but allows HTTP/HTTPS). Is it possible to install FreeBSD and install packages ? If yes how ?
Yes, you can stop the default FTP service from running without an issue. Look at the following tutorial which explains on how to go about it: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/sta...
