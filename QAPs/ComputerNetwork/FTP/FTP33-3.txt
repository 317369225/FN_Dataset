★During PayPal campus recruitment, the interviewer asked me to write code for an FTP server. Is it a typical question for tech interviews?He also told me that he wanted a working C/C++ code and went for a 15-minute break during the interview process. I wrote pseudocode because I didn't remember the syntax of all the API calls and he asked me to leave. I am sure I wrote the pseudocode correctly because I had already implemented a server. Is memorizing the API function calls and parameters worth it? I am a computer science undergraduate.
You can argue both sides here, if a candidate has great experience, he wouldn't need to memorize the api's and parameters, he will already have them in his mind without the need to actually memorize them, it is like a pilot that doesn't need his huge manual book every time he or she needs to take off or land. On the other side of the argument, if the position is an entry level position, I would be looking more for talent, energy and smartness, since I am planning to keep the hire for as long as I can, and I need to make sure he or she has the  solid background needed.
