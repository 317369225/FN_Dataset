â˜…What is the best FTP client for Windows and Mac OS?I have been introduced to some security issues with several FTP clients. I am looking for the most secure, feature-rich FTP client with versions for both Mac OS and Windows. According to me the most important features are good queue management, different connections in tabs, supporting SFTP, simple interface, handling large files elegantly and good UI responsiveness.
I hassled with FTP clients on Windows XP for years. Many people have said they can't get to the site I provide the link and login details to. The UIs have been unfriendly. So I've given up on clients. Last year I discovered it's easy to use Windows Explorer for this purpose; you get most of the file management functionality of the WE utility at the FTP site that way, and can drag and drop back and forth between your hard disk and the site. The UI is very clean, and it seems to be easier to teach other users how to use WE for this than starting from scratch with a wholly different UI. Start by copying and pasting the URL into the Windows Explorer (the file utility with the folder icon, NOT the Internet Explorer browser with the circle "e" icon) address bar and pressing Enter. If you paste the string with the ID and password in it, it's even easier to get to the site.
