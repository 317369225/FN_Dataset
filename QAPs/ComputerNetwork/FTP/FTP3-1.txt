â˜…For downloading, is HTTP or FTP better nowadays?FTP seems to have fallen behind both in terms of clients and servers, if these two protocols are to be compared by download capabilities, which will win, and why ? Are HTTP a better choice nowadays ?
Naturally it depends on what's implemented by the software available on the server and on the client. Much downloading today isn't done over either raw HTTP or raw FTP, but managed by software like "download managers" or "update managers" that implement their own flow control, resumption, etc. They are on top of some underlying transport(s) like HTTP, FTP, UDP, or anything else; it's invisible to the user and doesn't matter to them.
