★If the speed of electromagnetic waves is the same as that of light, then why cannot we have the bit rate of 1.8x10^8 bits per second in computer communications?Assuming that we use an electromagnetic ray to transmit data from the WiFi router to the devices. And I assumed that each binary data is carried by each crest of the wave, if i'm not wrong.
EM Waves only travel at the speed of light in a vacuum, when propagating through a medium they are slowed according to the permeability and permitivity of the medium. In air, em waves nearly travel at the speed of light but the speed is limited because The channel used for transmission usually conducts energy at a maximum bandwidth. The bandwidth of the channel is the first limit in network speeds Improvements to the physical encoding of bits, higher-frequency carrier waves, frequency multiplexing, modulation and so on offer order of magnitude speedups, and will continue doing so for some time and hence limits the speeds. CPU Processing time..  Suppose you sent a couple of messages together in which each message is shorter than the bandwidth-delay product: this is a good model for random access to main memory, for instance, when the CPU has to wait for each read before it can issue the next one.
