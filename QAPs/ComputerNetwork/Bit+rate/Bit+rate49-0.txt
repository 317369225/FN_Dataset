â˜…How will the bit error rate change for a PN sequence with increasing length?if I increase the sequence length, would it affect the BER? IF So, how? Will it increase or decrease?
In general, if you change the length of the PN sequence in your BER test, the BER remains unaltered; the BER depends only upon the modulation you use and, as commented upon already, the energy per bit and how much higher it is than the noise spectral density. However, there could be special and rather contrived difficulties with using very short PN sequences. For example: your carrier recovery and timing recovery circuits may assume random sequences to obtain reliable sync. If the data signal used for testing is a short PN sequence, then this could lead to interesting failures, like pattern-dependent jitter in timing recovery and carrier sync, since the data spectrum is not continuous with such short sequences. Scrambling the data usually gets rid of these problems at the outset.
