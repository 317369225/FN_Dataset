★Why does low-bit rate audio sound tinny?Anything below 64kbps sounds tinny, but I'm not sure how that translates in terms of signal processing terminology.
Dom Kane gets it mostly right with one critical mistake. That is that bit-RATE is a much different animal than bit-DEPTH, especially in lossy formats (e.g. Mp3), which I assume the OP is talking about. Bit depth is indeed—in the original, non-lossy format (almost always .wav)—the "resolution" of amplitude/volume. Bit-RATE, however, is the multiplication of the bit depth by the sample rate. So, take for example, a traditional, CD quality wav file. It has a bit depth of 16 bits and a sample rate of 44.1 kHz. Thus, it has a bit-RATE of 705.6 kilobits per second (Kbps). To make matters confusing, though, the term "bit rate" gets used a little less clearly in lossy formats. Not all of the bits are used for volume and not every sample is given the same bit depth. Furthermore, other non-audio data is encoded into the file, also taking up bits. What all of this adds up to is that when the "bit rate" of an mp3 is reduced, it's not just amplitude that is affected, but also sample rate. Combine this reduced amplitude and frequency resolution with various digital rounding errors, and there are any number of unpleasant digital artifacts in the final sound, the most common of which is reduced quality in the high frequencies.
