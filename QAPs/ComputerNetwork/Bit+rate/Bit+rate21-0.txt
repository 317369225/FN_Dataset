★What bit rate, file type and buffering should a mobile radio app use on Android and iPhone?No terresttrial streaming - talking Pandora-ish app.  AAC supposedly sounds bad on Android.  What file types are suggested, at what bit rate, and how much buffering?  Examples of apps that use the suggested format would be very welcome.
Gingerbread supports AAC officialy.Its good to have a selection of bitrates. Most iRadio programs offer from 11k up to 128 k. And any good program would auto-detect what bitrate works best and stream at the max. Streaming is difficult. So honestly go with whatever is easiest to implement. AAC is much cheaper (re legal fees) than mp3 and ogg is completely free. Go with ogg if it does indeed support streaming. iphone doesnt support ogg. So probably AAC is the best bet for both iphone/droid. Sorry I can't provide any examples. But I am the author of HiFiCorder an ogg/wav recorder for Android (no streaming though)
