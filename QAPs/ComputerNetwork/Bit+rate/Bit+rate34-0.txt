â˜…Where can I download an actual high bit rate (320Kbps) of old Hindi songs, and not the ones which have been run through a software to bump up the bit rate?I am willing to pay for the songs.
Check on iTunes if they are available. You may also go through websites of T-Series, Tips or Saregama HMV. I am not sure about the availability but since these are the record companies, they might be selling their songs online.
