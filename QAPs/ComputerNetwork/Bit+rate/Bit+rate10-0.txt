â˜…What is the bit rate at which Curiosity sends data back to earth?I'm sure their data rate is slow compared to, say 3G internet but what is the actual bandwidth of the connection and the latency?
Here is the info from NASA Data Rates/Returns - Mars Science Laboratory The data rate direct-to-Earth varies from about 500 bits per second to 32,000 bits per second (roughly half as fast as a standard home modem). The data rate to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is selected automatically and continuously during communications and can be as high as 2 million bits per second. The data rate to the Odyssey orbiter is a selectable 128,000 or 256,000 bits per second (4-8 times faster than a home modem). Check also Mars Exploration Rover Mission: The Mission
