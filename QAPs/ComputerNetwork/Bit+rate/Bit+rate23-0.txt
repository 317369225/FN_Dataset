â˜…Audio: What does sound quality mean? How does it depend on bit rate?
Sound quality (or audio fidelity) on an objective level has to do with transparency - how and how significantly a particular process or device alters the input signal. This can be described using a number of measurable parameters. Perceptual codecs like mp3 discard information from the original audio depending on what we're least likely to miss (based on our hearing). The resultant 'bit rate' is an expression of how much data in the output is used to represent a unit time of information from the input. So a 320kbps CBR mp3 means that 320kb of information represents a second of audio. Typically the higher the bit rate for lossy compression, the closer it will be in sound to the source. Of course that's not the only variable - there are other codecs as well. AAC is considered to be more effectively transparent than mp3, for example.
