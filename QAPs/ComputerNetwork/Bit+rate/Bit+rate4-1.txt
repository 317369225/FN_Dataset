â˜…Digital Audio: What file type has the highest bit rate?
The bit rate depends on the number of channels (mono, stereo, quadraphonic, 5.1 etc), the sample size (8 bit, 16 bit, 24 bit) and the sample rate (22,000 Hz, 44,000 Hz, 48,000 Hz, 96,000 Hz etc). You just multiply these factors to get the bit rate: Bit rate = number of channels * sample size * sample rate Afterwards you can compress the data to reduce the file size. If you choose lossless compression you will get the original sound back when you decompress. FLAC is an example of lossless compression. If you choose lossy compression (mp3) you can not get the original sound back. The more you reduce the file size (bit rate) with a lossy algorithm, the more different it will sound from the original.
