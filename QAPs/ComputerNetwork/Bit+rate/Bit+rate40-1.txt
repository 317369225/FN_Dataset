★How much information is lost when converting the bit rate of an audio file (of a voice recording) from 256 kbit/s to 128/64/32 kbit/s?(for voice recordings)
Here's another example - comparing a single audio sample at different compression bit-rates: Pick any episode at this URL:  Security Now! Episode Archive For the same episode, download the 64kbps mono (same quality as 128kbps stereo) "high quality" audio file, as well as the "smaller" audio file, which is compressed to 16kbps mono (same quality as 32kbps stereo). Listen to both and decide where on the spectrum you need to be. For spoken word (podcasts, sermons, etc.) I've found 64kbps mono (128kbps stereo) to be acceptable. For archival quality or music, I'd bump it up a notch or two. If it's just one person talking, no background music, and you need to conserve bandwidth, then dropping down a notch or two may serve the purpose.
