â˜…Information Theory: How do you calculate the capacity of a channel at a new bit error rate, given its current capacity at a higher bit error rate?Lets say I currently have a channel with a capacity of 100 bits and a BER of 0.1. I wish to reduce the BER (i.e. using forward error correction) to 0.01. What is the theoretical capacity of the new channel?
I don't understand the question -- what do you mean that the channel has a "capacity of 100 bits"? Capacity is generally measured in bits per symbol (or bits per second), and is a function of the channel. For example, the binary symmetric channel has two input symbols and two output symbols, and one parameter p, which is the probability that the input symbol gets flipped. The capacity is 1 - H(p) bits per symbol. Let's say we had a binary symmetric channel with a 10% chance of flipping each bit. The capacity is about 0.53 bits per symbol. That means that we could surround the channel with an encoder/decoder pair to achieve an arbitrarily small probability of bit error at any rate less than 0.53 bits per symbol. You can surround the channel with as many encoder/decoder pairs as you want. If they are ideal, which generally means an infinite block length, they will not reduce the channel capacity by more than an arbitrarily small amount.
