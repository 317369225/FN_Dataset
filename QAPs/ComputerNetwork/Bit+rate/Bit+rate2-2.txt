★What is the quality of music streamed from Spotify and Rdio (bit rate)?Both over wi-fi and 3G.
This is from Spotify's FAQ (http://www.spotify.com/us/help/f...) We use the Ogg Vorbis format for streaming. There are three quality ratings that we use: q3 (~90 kbps) q5 (~160 kbps) q9 (~320 kbps) Desktop: Streams are q5 quality. Premium subscribers can enable higher bit rate streaming at q9 from the preferences menu. Mobile: A higher quality q5 is offered, along with a “low bandwidth” option of q3. You can choose separate qualities ratings for streaming and synching in the More tab of your Spotify mobile app. I am not sure why they denote the settings as "q3, q5, q9" on their website, when their applications use the "low, high, extreme" nomenclature. Do note that "high quality" on desktop refers to "q9" with a bitrate of ~320 kbps, while the "high quality" on mobile refers to "q5" with a bitrate of ~160 kbps. If you want ~320 kbps quality on your mobile, you need to select "Extreme"
