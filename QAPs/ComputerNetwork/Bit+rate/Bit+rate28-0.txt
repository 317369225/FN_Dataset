★When we will we see dramatically higher bit-rates out of video cameras that record to flash?It seems like even if individual flash cards don't have great bit-rates, flash is inexpensive enough to build into devices in a raid like fashion for at least a few minutes higher bitrate video recording that would then be copied to removable media.
I think your question needs to include at what price point because Red has been doing that for some time for $100k.  However, I have the new Blackmagic Design Cinema camera.  It records directly to an SSD hard drive attached to the camera.  It records 2.5K uncompressed CinemaDNG RAW 12-bit video (full 1080P HD @ 30fps)  My camera was $5k  fully configured.
