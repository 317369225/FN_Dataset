â˜…How much information is lost when converting the bit rate of an audio file (of a voice recording) from 256 kbit/s to 128/64/32 kbit/s?(for voice recordings)
Information can be measured in bits, so if you convert 256bit stream to 64bit stream you lost precisely 256 - 64 = 192 bits. If your question is on much does such change affects speech recognition accuracy, this is a complex question. The relation between bitrate and accuracy depends on codec, the better codec compress the audio the less bits are required. It also depends on the rate of the audio you compress, if you compress 44khz with 128bits/s it's not the same if you compress 16khz with 128bits/s. If you talk about mp3 44.1khz audio, 64bits/s usually doesn't degrade accuracy at all compared to raw data. 24kbit/s usually does degrade accuracy to about 10%.
