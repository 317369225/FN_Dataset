â˜…Why doesn't iTunes have the option to convert higher bit rate songs to 320 kbps?
There is possibility to convert higher bit rate songs to 320 kbps. You have to adjust Import settings in iTunes > Preferences > General > Import Settings There is possible to choose from few different formats AAC, Apple Lossless, AIFF, MP3 and adjust quality of songs by choosing Good, High, Higher quality, or choose Custom option, and adjust settings accoring to your requirements. http://support.apple.com/kb/PH12279 After changing of settings, it is possible to convert songs by choosing particular songs and then from the Right Click Menu choose for example "Create AAC version" http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1550
