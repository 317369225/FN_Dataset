★How do the effects of lowering the sample rate compare and contrast with the effects of lowering the bit rate of audio?
The Nyquist theorem dictates that for full digital reproduction the sampling rate needs to be at least twice the maximum frequency. So, for high-fidelity audio at about 20 KHz, the sampling rate is typically around 44 kHz. If you reduce the sampling rate, to avoid aliasing, you will need to filter your source.  For example, "toll-quality" (telephone) voice is only about 3 kHz wide in bandwidth. Then the sampling rate needs to be only about 6 kHz.  So, lowering the bit rate simply cuts-off high frequencies. Here is a nice demo. Assuming your sampling rate is high,  for lossless samples (say, raw PCM), bit rate controls your dynamic range - the more bits/sample, the higher your dynamic range. As you decrease the bit rate, you introduce noise. Here is  a nice demo of both changing the sampling rate and the bit rate. You will notice that the effects of changing the sampling rate are more audible than the effects of reducing bit rate.  If you can use lossy compression, (say AAC or MP3), then you can reduce the bit rate even more.
