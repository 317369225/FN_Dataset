â˜…Digital Audio: Does higher bit rate necessarily mean higher quality?
Just as HD movies are not better if they are blurred or pixelated similarly the better bit rate does not necessarily guarantee higher quality. But most of the times and thats 90%+ times higher bitrate means higher quality. For an ordinary music enthusiast 320kbps will suffice.But if you want the best digital music quality then you should try out FLAC format. It is almost similar to vinyl quality.
