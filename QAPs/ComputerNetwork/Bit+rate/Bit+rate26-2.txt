â˜…Digital Audio: What is the bit rate for an mp3 to produce a high quality sound from an ipod?I am trying to rip some music into my ipod and I find the standard bit rate I get post-ripping is anything fro 32k to 96k - is it right to assume more (higher) is better? If yes, how can I get the ripping to produce a higher bit rate?
BEST GENERAL SETTINGiTunes > Preferences > Import Settings Import Using: AAC Encoder Setting: iTunes Plus (128kbps (mono)/256kbps (stereo), 44.100kHz, VBR, optimized for MMX/SSE2) HIGHEST QUALITY (BUT MUCH LARGER FILES)iTunes > Preferences > Import Settings Import Using: Apple Lossless Encoder Seting: Automatic IN GENERAL Apple Lossless should sound exactly the same as the CD. No MP3 or AAC file is "CD quality" or "Better than CD quality," but depending on what you are playing it back on, you may not be able to hear the difference, and an MP3 or AAC file may sound acceptably good and take up much less space than a WAV or Apple Lossless file. MP3s are more universally playable on different devices and platforms. AAC encoding will sound better than MP3 at the same bit rate. If you are using Apple products exclusively, then it is fine to go with AAC or Apple Lossless formats for your devices. I wouldn't go below 160kbps when encoding music. 128kbps is noticeably inferior, even on average stereo equipment.
