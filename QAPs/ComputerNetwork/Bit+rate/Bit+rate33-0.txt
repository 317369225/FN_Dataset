â˜…What would be a good general bit-rate and other conversion settings for short 3-5 minute HTML5 streaming videos on a site not using bit-rate switching?
Some tips: 1. Frame rate: 15, 24, 30. 24 comes from TV specifications, however, 15 is sometimes good enough. If you are streaming HD content then probably 24 or 30 is better. 2. Key frames: streaming content over HTTP needs a key frame every few seconds. So choose an inter-refresh time. Ex. 2 to 5 to 10 seconds and multiply it with frame-rate. Keep in mind, this also depends on the video content (sports, movies, newsroom etc). If you have sports, you want more key frames as compared to a news room video. Alternatively, you could probably let ffmpeg figure this one out for you. 3. Bit rate: fixed bit rate might be better for your streaming costs. Then there is the option of using the 1-pass and 2-pass optimizations. 2-pass optimization takes more time and costs more CPU resources but you have a better quality file. Furthermore, FFmpeg has built in optimizations for iPod/iPhone (which you may use for streaming to smartphones)
