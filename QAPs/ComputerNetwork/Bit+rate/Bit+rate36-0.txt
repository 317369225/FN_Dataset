â˜…If the speed of electromagnetic waves is the same as that of light, then why cannot we have the bit rate of 1.8x10^8 bits per second in computer communications?Assuming that we use an electromagnetic ray to transmit data from the WiFi router to the devices. And I assumed that each binary data is carried by each crest of the wave, if i'm not wrong.
Ah, though I don't know about how the transfer of data works, 10^8 m/second does not essentially mean that for one meter, one byte is transferred. There's a different mechanism. Bytes is stored as 1s 0s. So nothing related to light
