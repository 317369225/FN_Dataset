â˜…Is there a higher bit-rate streaming music service alternative to Pandora?I just can't deal with how crappy Pandora sounds anymore (it's sampled too low).
Audiogalaxy. It's free and it streams FLAC. Fidelity over 3G even beats the pants off anything else. I can't believe it's free. You should check it out. I've been using it for almost a month now and it's easily the best service I've used on my iPhone. Best of all - my wife has access to my music on her EVO (Android) too.
