â˜…Is there a higher bit-rate streaming music service alternative to Pandora?I just can't deal with how crappy Pandora sounds anymore (it's sampled too low).
If you don't want to go the monthly or annual fee route but still want to stay away from ads, I like Radical streaming service. The sound quality competes with that of Pandora's paid version and it's free and ad-free. They just have an option to donate.
