â˜…Digital Audio: Does higher bit rate necessarily mean higher quality?
Maybe. For uncompressed audio, yes... a higher bitrate will pretty much always indicated a better potential sound than a lower bitrate. For example, regular CD audio, 44.1kHz at 16-bit in stereo is 1.4112 Mb/s. DAT was introduced as a slightly better format, 48kHz at 16-bit in stereo... 1.536Mb/s. When it's uncompressed, the bitrate is simply (sample_rate) * (sample_size) * (number_of_channels). So its easy to see that a higher bitrate could be a higher quality sound. Once you start compressing audio, there are more variables. The particular compression CODEC you're using makes a difference.... a 256kb/s AAC file will probably sound much better than a 368kb/s MPEG Layer 2 file, simply because AAC uses a more advanced psychoacoustic model and more advanced compression algorithms. Some of it's dependent on the content... a 160kb/s variable bitrate AAC file could potentially sound better than a 256kb/s fixed-bitrate AAC file. You'd expect a 256Mb/s MPEG Layer 3 file to sound better than a 160Mb/s MP3 file, and when using the same CODEC and the same settings, it will. But different encoders also produce better or worse compression... most of these algorithms, audio or video, specify the format, but not everything about how the format is created. So there's room for good and bad here... one example, the open source LAME encoder for MP3 has a reputation of producing noticeably better results than most commerically produced encoders. Similar claims are made of the x264 video encoder, versus many commercial AVC/H.264 encoders.
