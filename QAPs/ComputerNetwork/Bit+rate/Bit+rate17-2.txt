â˜…Is there a way to encode a MPEG2 video at a bit rate of over 40Mbps?
What is the source video that you would compress at that rate? I haven't tried it, but I'd be surprised if you couldn't use FFmpeg for this. Compressor probably maxes out at 40 Mbps because that's the maximum bit rate permitted by ATSC standards for digital cable television (actually, 38.8 Mbps, MPEG2/HL - broadcast TV is 1/2 that). Main profile MPEG2 can't exceed 80 Mbps (per the spec), so you must be talking 422/HL (which the spec permits to go up to 300 Mbps - a rate so high, you are essentially storing completely uncompressed 1080p video frames). The software that would handle such high bit rates would be fairly specialized since they're not typically used. However, it's not particularly relevant if the video is not visually any different. In that case, I'd export the highest quality of video and use something ffmpeg to transcode it to the higher bit rate just to meet their requirements.
