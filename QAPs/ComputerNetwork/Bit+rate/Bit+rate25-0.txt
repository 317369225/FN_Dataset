â˜…What have been the bit rates of the different communication media throughout history?E.g. the bit rate of the message that Pheidippides carried from Marathon to Athens, the bit rate of a letter of Elizabeth I of England to Philip II of Spain, the bit rate of a bonfire started at night as an alert measure, etc.
By human communication, I am assuming spoken communication or reading off of a book or hearing it. According to research, the average person communicates (speaks/comprehends) at 150-160 words per minute. With peak rates at 500 words per minute and Guinness world record setting rate at 637 words per minute held by Steve Woodmore (Source Wikipedia) For the sake out discussion, let's take a well known work of literature as a measuring standard. Let's say Shakespeare Macbeth. It has a total of 17,260 words with an average word length of 4.26 characters. Adding a space per word roughly brings up the total to approximately 90787 characters. A human would take roughly 111 minutes or 1.8 hours to recite it and about 59 minutes to silent read it. Since each character is about 8 bits in ASCII encoding, the total bits for uncompressed Shakespeare Macbeth is about 726296 bits or 0.69 Mega bits. Now let's just say human communicate wirelessly and in reasonably close proximation. Transferring 0.69 mega bits over an average wireless connection which is at least 20Mbps will be (1*0.69)/20 = 0.034 seconds By comparison it would take an average human 1.8 hours to recite it. So our effective communication speed is a measly 0.0001Mbps :)
