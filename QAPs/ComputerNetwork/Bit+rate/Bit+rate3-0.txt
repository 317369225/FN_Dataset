â˜…Is there a higher bit-rate streaming music service alternative to Pandora?I just can't deal with how crappy Pandora sounds anymore (it's sampled too low).
I paid the $30 annual fee and found that the sound quality improved. It was only noticeable on my home system, which has nice speakers. Not so much at work, where I use decent-but-not-great headphones.
