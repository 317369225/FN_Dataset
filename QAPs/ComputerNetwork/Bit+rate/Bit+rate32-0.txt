â˜…Is there a portable audio player (WAV, FLAC, MP3) that will play music at bit rates recorded higher than 1411 kbits/sec?
Might want to take a look at HiFiMan music players (HM-801, HM-602, HM-601). I don't have one but I believe they support 24bit/96kHz FLAC files. http://www.hifiman.us/products/?... http://www.head-direct.com/produ... http://www.amazon.com/HiFiMAN-HM...
