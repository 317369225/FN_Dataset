★How do the effects of lowering the sample rate compare and contrast with the effects of lowering the bit rate of audio?
First, the setup: any sound wave comprises of a frequency and an amplitude.  Sample rate is the metric associated with capturing the frequency of the sound, and bitrate is the metric associated with capturing the amplitude. In general, the bitrate corresponds to how "harsh" or "grainy" the sound feels, while the sample rate corresponds to which frequencies of the sound are captured. As a general rule, if you have to choose between increasing the bitrate and increasing the sample rate, you should do the latter as it affects the entire frequency spectrum. Moreover, in most digital processing, the amplitude of the sound is altered much more than its frequency (for example, fade in/out, mixing, echo/reverb/other effects, etc. are all operations on the amplitude dimension of the sound), and so to retain a high quality digital recording, you want to keep the quality of the frequently modified dimension high.
