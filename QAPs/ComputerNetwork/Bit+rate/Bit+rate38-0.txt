★Is there any relationship between audio file compression (i.e. bit-rate reduction, etc.) and DSP compression (i.e. dynamic operation often done to fatten sound, etc.)?
There is a relationship. Both seek to deliver a certain sort of sound by altering the waveforms. Compression for saving space sounds like it would be a simple thing, but it actually uses psychoacoustic analysis to determine what can be removed without affecting how we perceive the sound and then it uses typical mathematical techniques for compression on top of that. Dynamic range compression does a similar sort of thing but instead of removing unheard sounds, it boosts the amplitude of weak sounds and rolls off the amplitude of loud sounds so that we still can play back the sounds through devices without the ability to play back the entire dynamic range, or make them audible in environments where environmental noise would obscure the quiet sounds (in a car for example) So they are related in their technique, and their objective - deliver sound efficiently so we can perceive it - but beyond that there is not a huge amount of similarity. One can apply them together or independently. I think is is a mistake to refer to them interchangeably.
