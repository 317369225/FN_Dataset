★What is the difference between SNR & bit error rate?
SNR is Signal to Noise Ratio ie it shows the amount of noise(unwanted voltage levels) that have crept into the transmitted signal as it was being transmitted through the medium. Bit error rate on the other hand is the error which has turned up while interpreting the transmitted message. ie due to various reasons which include noisy reception and faulty decoding technique etc. some 0s my get interpreted as 1s and vice versa  (0 and 1 are basic elements ie bits in a digital transmission). Bit Error Rate is the rate at which the error is generated at the rxvr end. To identify the occurrence of Bit error parity bits,checksums,CRCs and other such methods are used. Once detected they are corrected(if possible) or a request to resend the initial message is sent. So basically SNR is a fundamental problem generated by noise; while Bit Error is generated due to encoding and decoding techniques.
