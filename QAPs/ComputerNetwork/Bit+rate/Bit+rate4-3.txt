â˜…Digital Audio: What file type has the highest bit rate?
That's kind of an open question. For any given set of parameters (eg, "48kHz, 16-bit audio", "720p24 4:2:2 video", "192kHz, 24-bit audio") the highest bitrate (and yeah, there will be a bitrate) is any kind of uncompressed format. For example, a 48kHz, 16-bit stereo audio format will have a raw, uncompressed bitrate of 1.536Mb/s. However, that's a stream. To make a file, you have to put that stream in some kind of container, like a WAV file for audio. That may increase the bitrate ever so slightly, though the overhead of the container is usually minimal. Uncompressed formats are fixed in size based only on the contents and that slight overhead. Compressed, lossless formats generally have a more or less fixed size/bitrate... it's not something you know precisely, but the algorithm is deterministic -- one specific WAV file fed to any FLAC compressor will produce the same result. Compressed formats can vary wildly. For one, you have your choice of how much compression to apply. There are often as well parts of the compression algorithm that are "means to an end" -- how the compression calculates things. For example, motion search algorithms in MPEG... a better motion search algorithm will produce better looking video, at the same or possibly lower bitrates, than a poor motion search algorithm. If you're just looking for the largest consumer format, that's Blu-ray. Blu-ray video can be encoded at up to 38Mb/s. Blu-ray audio can be stored uncompressed at 192kHz and 24-bit, 9.216Mb/s for a stereo channel.
