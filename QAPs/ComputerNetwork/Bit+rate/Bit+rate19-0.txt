â˜…At what bit rates are SiriusXM's channels broadcast, and how often do they change?They have clearly improved the sound quality of a small number of channels, and others continue to sound like AM radio. Howard Stern's channels are crystal clear. What am I getting?
The bitrate varies by channel - higher for music and more popular channels. Which channels are you listening to? Howard 100 is the best sounding channel on Sirius. It's in Howard's contract that that channel gets a set bitrate. Nothing is going to sound that good.
