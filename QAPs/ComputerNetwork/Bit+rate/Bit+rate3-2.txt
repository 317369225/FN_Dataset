â˜…Is there a higher bit-rate streaming music service alternative to Pandora?I just can't deal with how crappy Pandora sounds anymore (it's sampled too low).
Yes, the paid Pandora is higher quality. What we're all waiting for is the U.S. release of Spotify. The quality on Spotify is superb. If you're in the U.K., highly recommend it. Rumors have it hitting U.S. Q1 2011.
