â˜…What is the Bitly API rate limit?I am building an application that requires very frequent Bitly API requests. Does anyone know what the official rate limit is? This information is not disclosed on their website.
I was trying something on similar lines. I had a collection of ~3000 links that I wanted to shorten, I created a script and started requesting http://bit.ly ... it blocked me after 360 shortenings, unblocked after a while and when I ran the script again, it blocked me after another 180 links. I think that if I continue the number will go on reducing until my script is permanently blocked. Better have a script that shortens urls as and when required.
