â˜…Where can I download an actual high bit rate (320Kbps) of old Hindi songs, and not the ones which have been run through a software to bump up the bit rate?I am willing to pay for the songs.
Nowhere, I fear. Because old songs were born in the time when digital formats were absent. Though you can try getting LP and get perfect quality of sound.
