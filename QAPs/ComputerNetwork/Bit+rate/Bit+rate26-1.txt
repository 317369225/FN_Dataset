â˜…Digital Audio: What is the bit rate for an mp3 to produce a high quality sound from an ipod?I am trying to rip some music into my ipod and I find the standard bit rate I get post-ripping is anything fro 32k to 96k - is it right to assume more (higher) is better? If yes, how can I get the ripping to produce a higher bit rate?
The correct answer would be that you should find that out through trial and error because you might not hear much difference personally. This also depends on the type of music you're listening to, as well as on the quality of the original recording. But since you probably want to hear a straight answer, I think 160 kbps VBR AAC would be a safe bet.
