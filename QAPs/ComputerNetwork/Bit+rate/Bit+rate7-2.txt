★Digital Audio: Does higher bit rate necessarily mean higher quality?
Higher bit rate means more data per second, which doesn't necessarily mean higher quality. In audio, data can be uncompressed (e.g. PCM encodedWAV file) and yet  require a higher bit rate than the exact same data coming out of let's say a FLAC file once uncompressed. With lossy compression schemes  (e.g. MP3, AAC, APT-X), some will achieve the same perceived sound quality at a lower bit rate. Typically, 320kbps MP3 and 256kbps AAC produce near CD quality. Finally, higher (sound) quality with higher bit rate only happens if the audio encoded is made if high quality material: converting a vinyl to FLAC 24-bit 192kHz won't show audible improvements compared to a FLAC 16-bit 44.1kHz. I hope this will help.
