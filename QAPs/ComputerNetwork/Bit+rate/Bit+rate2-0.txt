â˜…What is the quality of music streamed from Spotify and Rdio (bit rate)?Both over wi-fi and 3G.
An answer from Rdio's forums ( Wilson Miner - Rdio Employee - Aug 12, 2011 ): "It's a tough question to answer because the simple answers can be misleading. If you see any streaming service advertise a blanket bitrate, you can be sure at this point that not all of their catalog is streaming at that rate. In some cases, it might be a lot less than you think. Rdio varies the streaming bitrate on the mobile clients depending on your connection. On the web and desktop, we stream up to 320kbps based on what is available to us. Bandwidth and storage aren't the material costs related to streaming, so there's no benefit for Rdio to scale back quality on our end." (http://help.rdio.com/customer/po...)
