★Audio: What does sound quality mean? How does it depend on bit rate?
An mp3 file compresses the audio of a song. it means it takes the sound during let's say a thousanth of a second, and takes the average of that time span. low bitrate mp3's take larger intervals, meaning they will be smaller in size, while high bitrates will have very small intervals (see image below) how much of a difference you will hear depends on your audio setup. low quality speakers, like the speakers on your phone, won't be able to make a difference, so there the low quality bitrates are good, since they save  memory space. HIgh quality bitrates are interesting on laptops or stereo systems, and if you really have a good sound system, you might consider lossless files, which means uncompressed audio files, like .wav files, or FLAC files. they will be quite a lot bigger though, so make sure you have enough space to store all this audio (see Size Comparison Chart of Various Formats DSD-WAV-FLAC-mp3) Thanks for the A2A, hope I answered your question
