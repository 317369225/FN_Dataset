â˜…When changing the quality of a youtube video to 1080p does it increase the bit rate of the audio too on the video file?
Yes, it does. Only the extent of this 'change' varies from video to video. For instance, take these two videos for example. 1) Linkin Park - What I've Done Bit rate corresponding to 360p video = 95 Kbps Bit rate corresponding to 1080p video = 191 Kbps 2) St. Maarten KLM Boeing 747 landing Bit rate corresponding to 360p video = 115 Kbps Bit rate corresponding to 1080p video = 125 Kbps Looks like there's greater disparity in bit rates of music videos and lesser in case of amateur video recordings. Disclaimer: I'm not a pro, so I can't guarantee the generality of the answer. This is just what I've found to be the case in these two videos, and some other videos in general. You can repeat the test for some other video samples to be sure.
