★Is there a way to encode a MPEG2 video at a bit rate of over 40Mbps?
Apple compressor is good for day-to-day. Most professional level data interchange for finalized video is today based on high quality prores files, and the client should then take care of any transcoding.  However there still are situations where clients do not do any transcoding. Unfortunately those are the same clients that cannot do any serious quality assessment and that do not even understand exactly what the meaning of the specifications they give you is and why they have those specs. Therefore there's no point in arguing with them. The worst case is when they have extremely strict technical requirements that go beyond the standards and they cannot satisfy them themselves, therefore the ask you to do the final encoding for them even when it means you have to adapt to a specification that is stricter than the standard itself and is therefore not available even in some high-end encoding tools. These are rare cases and it happened to me only once. A general purpose, professional level, software based, relatively affordable, quite flexible solution is offered by Telestream's Episode. Check the specs, of you need transport stream output I think you need the pro version (bonus is that you also get stuff like MXF containers and XDCAM codecs for the output, both likely to be requested by some clients and good-to-have on the list of formats you support, if you target professional clients). If you are in for much less affordable, super-high-end quality, you may want to check out Ateme which is offering mostly hardware based solutions (but also some software based ones).
