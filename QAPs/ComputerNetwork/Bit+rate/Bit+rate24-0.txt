â˜…What are the limits to communications bit rate as we shrink dimensions for a mobile device?
In principle, there is no relation between bit-rate & size (as Fabien says until you reach quantum scales). In practice, the size of phones has actually been increasing over recent years: - The desire for large screen for video. As data rates increase and streaming video becomes more popular this will continue. - User interface, wtyher touch-screen or physical qwerty. - We are using more frequency bands, and so phones have multiple radios (6 band radios are not unusual). Antennas have a certain size; while it possible to compress them, performance suffers. - Althoiugh a minor effect compared to the above, we are adding more functionality (more modes, faster processors, more memory, video accelerators, WiFi, FM radio) which all contribute to size. Dongles provide an example of how small you can make a mobile device: far, far smaller than a typical smartphone
