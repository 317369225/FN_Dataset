â˜…Is there a higher bit-rate streaming music service alternative to Pandora?I just can't deal with how crappy Pandora sounds anymore (it's sampled too low).
Try spotify, grooveshark, jango... There are a lot of them, but I like jango the most. If you want to download the songs as well, log on to these websites with torch browser, click the media button, and you're done.
