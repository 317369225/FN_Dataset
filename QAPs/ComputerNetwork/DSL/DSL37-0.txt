★DSL: What's the correct way to set up a network in a multistory building?
OK, the first thing to understand is that there is no single "right" way to do this.  You're buying a DSL connection from Verizon, not all home  or office connectivity.  Now, if I were the installer's boss I'd say he or she should have found out where you wanted the modem installed rather than simply plugging into an arbitrary location.  Since you have a patch panel the best place for the modem would be next to it so you can use the existing Cat5 to reach the other floors.  What you really need to figure out now is where do you need connectivity and of what kind(s).  It would also help to know how many Ethernet ports the modem has on it.  If you simply want to provide wireless to each of floors then you could use the existing Ethernet to run to APs (probably 1-2 per floor) and terminate the Ethernet directly on the modem IF it has enough Ethernet ports.  If its a single port unit or you need more ports than it has you can run those connections to an Ethernet switch (not a router) like this (there are several manufacturers that make equivilant gear and this is not an endorsement of D-Link, just an example) 24-Port PoE Fast Ethernet WebSmart Switch, including 2 Gigabit BASE-T and 2 Gigabit Combo BASE-T/SFP This also has the advantage of providing power for the APs over the Ethernet cabling so you don't have to have both a power jack and an Ethernet connection for each AP.  If you also need to provide Ethernet access as well as wireless this is a good solution since it can be used for both. You will probably have to have Verizon come back out to move the modem since trying to trace the DSL connection into the building may be challenging and it may not even be on one of the lines you see on the patch panel.
