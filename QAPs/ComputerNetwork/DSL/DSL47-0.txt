â˜…If the size of the repository containing the linux kernel is 135 MB how come the size of DSL is just 70 MB?linux
If you are referring to DSL - Damn Small Linux. Then the answer is simple. When you are compiling a source code to a binary, the size of the output binary will be significantly lesser compared to entire source code size. For eg: usually for mobile Linux kernels, the full kernel along with ramdisk will not be more than few Megabytes (1 MB ~ 5 or 6 MB - depending on the CONFIGs enabled and ramdisk size and features). So the size of linux kernel repository has no relation at all with the binary size. Hence you can pack a linux distribution within few megabytes itself.
