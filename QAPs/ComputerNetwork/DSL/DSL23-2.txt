â˜…How can I determine whether DSL will be fast at a certain location?I'm deciding between DSL and Cable at a new apartment. I know DSL is dependent on location and distance to a provider. So how can I determine which will be fastest?
Good answers so far, asking your neighbors is definitely a good start. I just want to clarify one aspect of DSL. If you live in an area where AT&T or Verizon offer their TV products (U-Verse and Fios respectively), they have worked out the kinks and you should be able to get a good Internet connection. In many of those neighborhoods you only have copper between the nearest junction box and your home. If you are in an apartment building, you only have copper from the building's basement to your apartment. Having said that, there are lots of variables involved and your experience may not be what you expected. I would recommend declining to sign a contract with whichever provider you choose. The pushier they are for you to commit to a full year of service, the likelier it is that you'll have unpleasant surprises down the road.
