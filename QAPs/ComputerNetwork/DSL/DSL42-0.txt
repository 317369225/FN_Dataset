â˜…What are alternatives for internet connectivity in a place where DSL is slow?
Nothing exists meeting your requirements; anything with 4G will be too expensive* for you; 3G too slow, depending on which 3G provider you use and what your reception is like. *Though if you buy a 4G cellphone and offer it as a hotspot when you are at home, the value is increased because you will also have 4G when out and about in town etc. You could trial a 4G or 3G dongle if you can find a deal like that, to identify the rates (speeds) it can achieve. Then its a trivial cost vs speed calculation!
