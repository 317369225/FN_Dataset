★Is ATT DSL going away? And, Att U-Verse only option?I keep getting emails saying I need to get new equipment because my ATT Dsl is going away and I need to get U-Verse service. Is this correct? What are my other options?
Eventually it will go away.  Once you switch to U-Verse from DSL, you can NEVER go back to DSL.  If you buy a house that was U-Verse, you have to get U-verse, you can't get plain DSL or telephone...has to be digital.  The emails are just trying to hook you into TV service with AT&T but you can get internet only U-Verse.  Don't let them tell you that you HAVE to get a certain bundle.  Also, you can stay DSL as long as you want.  They're not going to force you off of it so do whatever is cheapest.  Oh and don't forget to call them every 3-6 months saying you want to switch to Cable.  They will lower your bill each time you do that.
