â˜…Why aren't cellular data technologies (3G, 4G LTE, etc) truly unlimited like Broadband and DSL are?Wouldn't broadband/DSL cost more since they typically reach faster speeds? Why can't there be unlimited Internet for cellphones like wifi hotspots offer? I know Sprint is unlimited but the speeds do not match Broadband/DSL?
Broadband leverages existing cable and telephone infrastructure - every home has a phone line or a TV cable going to it. Cellular technology is limited by the number of cell towers and total available RF bandwidth. Wireless will always be slower than wired networking purely based on physics. That said, the wireless carriers could conceivably offer unlimited plans, but consumers seem willing to pay for limited ones, so there's no real incentive to tax their networks with unlimited customers.
