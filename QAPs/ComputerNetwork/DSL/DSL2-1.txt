â˜…When do you need a DSL?
I would say it is language dependent. It is much easier to create a dsl in a lisp language than probably any other language due to its code-as-data and macros. Therefore it becomes worth it earlier with a lisp language. I would say start making a dsl in clojure when you find yourself repeating yourself in code a lot but there is no way to move the repeated code into a fn, or it would be more clearly expressed as a language feature. The great thing about clojure (and all lisps) is it's not all or nothing; you can use the dsl seamlessly alongside regular clojure code.
