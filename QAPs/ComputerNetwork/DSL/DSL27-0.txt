★Is cable faster than Verizon DSL?
That's not a question that can be answered; it's a lot like asking "Are Toyotas faster than Hondas?"  It's possible for cable to be faster than DSL, and for DSL to be faster than cable.  Depending on where you are, what service you're paying for, and how the company happens to be running its network in your area, different providers can be faster, slower, more reliable, or more prone to outages.  If you specify plans and a specific area, I'm sure people would be able to provide useful information.
