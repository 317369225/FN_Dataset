â˜…Why aren't cellular data technologies (3G, 4G LTE, etc) truly unlimited like Broadband and DSL are?Wouldn't broadband/DSL cost more since they typically reach faster speeds? Why can't there be unlimited Internet for cellphones like wifi hotspots offer? I know Sprint is unlimited but the speeds do not match Broadband/DSL?
While I disagree with the unlimited part as there are "unlimited" wireless and wired services, and usually there is still a limit in the contract. But addressing why wireless plans are usually worse, its because the air is a shared media, meaning only one user can use it at a time (a little more as there is a broad spectrum, but then the spectrum for each user is reduced), while wires are exclusive media, meaning you have the whole wire for you, its much easier to achieve faster speeds there, and wires are much less subject to noises then air
