â˜…Is a (Python) template engine like Mako or Chameleon internal DSL or external DSL?See this for background: Page on pycon.org
I believe they are both external. An "internal DSL" is a fancy way of characterizing a library for doing something in some language that is using the metaprogramming-type syntactic constructs of the language in which it is written in such a deep way that code that uses the library appears to be written in another language. An "external DSL" is a fancy way of referring to the contents of a text file that some program reads and parses that is complex enough in what it specifies to be characterized as a language. As far as I can tell from 5 minutes of research, Mako and Chameleon templates are not Python code. They are files that some python library reads. They are therefore external DSLs. (For what it is worth, I think all of this talk about domain specific languages lately is something of a fad. I am not sure the terminology is useful and don't understand why young people in particular seem to be intereseted in DSLs in the abstract rather than in what a particular library gives them the power to do. This question for example amuses me: What's a good DSL for a beginner? A DSL to do what? etc.)
