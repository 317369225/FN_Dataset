â˜…How do I contact AT&T's DSL department by email?
If you're having a problem with the DSL at your home, go on LinkedIn and look for AT&T employees in your area. Field technicians (called Station Techs and Field Techs) and their direct managers are the best place to start. If you have more general issues, I'd start by posting on AT&T's Facebook page. If you tell me exactly what rhe issue is, I can give more targeted advice.
