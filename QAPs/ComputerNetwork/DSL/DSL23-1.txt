★How can I determine whether DSL will be fast at a certain location?I'm deciding between DSL and Cable at a new apartment. I know DSL is dependent on location and distance to a provider. So how can I determine which will be fastest?
Unless you are in a new, leafy suburb, where the wires from the central office were put in recently, you may not be able to find out, or get a good answer. When ADSL was a new technology, there were a number of tests run in Palo Alto.  Palo Alto has had phones since the Alexander Graham Bell days.  Amati Corp found that the connections ran all over, some in loops, some with dead-end Ts a half mile long (this causes reflections and other bad things).  Average wire distance was > 3 X the straight line distance, with a some more that 5 x. No way of matching wire distance to your number, either. Cable TV has the advantage of being a 20th Century technology instead of 19th, with better records. There will be some places where you could get a very good DSL connection to the central office, and places where cable is not good. But the odds generally favor cable over DSL by about 4:1. Ask your neighbors, and see if you can get the DSL person to provide a good link - there is some money being spent to upgrade. In some cases, the phone company will run fiber to a neighborhood box, then run the DSL from that box. Once you get to the central office, the phone company infrastructure tends to be somewhat better than cable. So ask your neighbors, just like Jason Kane said. I am in Mountain View, and I am happy with Comcast. Used to have DSL years ago, it was okay...
