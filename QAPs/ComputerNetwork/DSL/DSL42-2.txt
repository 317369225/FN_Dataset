★What are alternatives for internet connectivity in a place where DSL is slow?
I'm investigating freedompop.  They have 1GB 4G with unlimited 3G after that for $19.95 month.  It's not a sim card but a small hotspot device.  The other day they had the 3G device for $19.95 and the 4G/3G device for (I believe) $79.95.  I don't know anyone using the service, so I can't tell you how well it works,  I plan to search for more user reviews before going with it.
