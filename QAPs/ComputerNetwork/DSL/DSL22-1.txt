★Is fixed line wireless a good alternative to DSL?Surprisingly, traditional DSL providers, for whatever reason (e.g. distance), won't install DSL in many places around the Bay Area for homes and small businesses.  What is the best alternative to DSL?  Is fixed-line wireless a good option?  Have you found fixed-line wireless to be stable or spotty?  T-1 lines simply aren't an option due to cost.
It's really difficult to say which are the best DSL alternatives, as everyone has their own opinion, even the experts!

Knowing your area as well as you do, you can then make a determination as to which type of connection would be most stable.
