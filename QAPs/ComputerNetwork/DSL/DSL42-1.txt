★What are alternatives for internet connectivity in a place where DSL is slow?
I don't think you can link a mobile phone to a residential router, however you might be able to tether your mobile to act as a portable WiFi hotspot so that other devices can use it. Not all mobile operators will allow phones to be used in this way, especially if they supply locked phones, but I've got no knowledge of what network operators there are in the US, nor what their restrictions are.  You'll need to check whether you can do this with your phone/SIM combination. The only thing you need to be aware of if you do use a phone as a portable WiFi hotspot is that it can drain the battery quite quickly, so if you're using it round the house, I'd keep it plugged in to a charger.
