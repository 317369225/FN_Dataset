â˜…I have RJ45 cable connection from my ISP, but I have router with DSL (means RJ11) port. Can I connect it?
Yes,, it's possible... there are convertors available for it... but i recommend to change the router if possible... because the convertor will cost either more price or the same price that of a new router...
