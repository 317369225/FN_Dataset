★What is the best Netflix streaming device for a slow DSL connection?I have an old Wii and it streams Netflix MUCH better than my iPad. I want to add Netflix to another TV but don't really need another Wii machine. So Chromecast, Roku 3,  Apple TV, or something else?
If all you want is Netflix, any of those choices should be good.  You don't say the speed of your DSL, but Netflix worked fine for me on 3MB DSL on both a Roku and an android box (I've used both the G-box Midnight and MX2, however the MX2 was not used on the slower service).   An android box can fun a fully capable web browser, so it can do more than the Chromecast without requiring going through another device or PC.  The other devices depend on if there's an addon that will get the content you want.
