★How fast can you get working DSL in your office?Please name your city (even district, if you're in a large city), state, country. If necessary please provide extra data. I'm studying the friction involved in running any technology start-up and I see fast access to DSL as a big source of (potential) friction. EDIT: In the context "friction" was meant to say "(unnecessary) difficulties and costs" (triggered by Jay Best). Sorry for not being clear.
Can you elaborate on what you mean by friction with respect to DSL? If you are asking what is xDSL top speed then  ADSL1   - 7Mbps  ADSL2+ - 24Mbps  VDSL     - 50Mbps (and some 100Mbps but VDSL is a short distance technology) If you are asking what top speeds the office network can be  10Mbps Etch  100Mbps Eth  1Gig Eth Or you may be using wireless in which case that can vary Or if you are asking what actual speed throughput is possible, then this can range based on may different factors, but the International average is 10Mbps Sources: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eth...
