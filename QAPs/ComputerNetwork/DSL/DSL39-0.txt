â˜…Which brands of wireless routers and DSL modems care about security?Which vendors have established a strong security process during development where they educate firmware developers about security issues, arrange security engineers to review the code, accept vulnerability reports, fix any vulnerabilities found and issue timely firmware updates and advisories?
not the answer you want.. but most people serious about security would probably load the router with a custom firmware like openwrt its open source, you can't really trust the major router manufacturers firmware anymore since its believed by many people they have been co-opted by the NSA the key with security is TNO Trust No One
