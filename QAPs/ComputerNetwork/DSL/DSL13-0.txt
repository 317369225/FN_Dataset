★DSL: What's the difference between a DSLAM, and an IP DSLAM?
You guys have it pretty much dead on.  The only thing I'd say is different is that in North America (I can't speak for the rest of the world but I suspect its the same) the DSLAM really never does any routing and restricts its operations to layer 2 Ethernet, ie trunking, VLANs, etc.  This is because in many cases the operator is running PPPoE/A and their is a termination device somewhere upstream (called a BRAS http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAS) to manage AAA and any router between the DSL modem and the BRAS will cause problems.  Even those networks that aren't using PPPoX usually keep the layer 3 pieces to their core since the subscriber/port isolation can be done more cheaply and easily at layer 2.  The term IP DSLAM is actually a marketing screw up.  When the telco world was just beginning to realize that ATM wasn't going to be the winner in networking they saw the competition as IP when what really beat ATM was Ethernet and it would be much more technically correct to call these devices Ethernet DSLAMs but its too late at this point. On ATM still being around, that's absolutely true for any ADSL or ADSL2+ device.  The underlying layer 2 connection from the modem to the DSLAM will be ATM on any standards based device.  This isn't that big of a deal, since the silicon to do SAR (Segmentation And Reassembly http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seg...) is cheap the overhead isn't a killer but it is there.
