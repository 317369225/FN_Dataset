★Who are the broadband (Cable, DSL, etc.) providers in the Bay Area?
Sorry for the repeat of my reply. I am looking to get off of Comcast completely.  I am so over their customer service being vindictive and messing with my set-up.  If you even think about hosting something even for in-house testing they will demand you stop and upgrade to Business Class.  Once they know you are a power user.. Look out, they will be watching and throttling your bandwidth because you are running a TOR relay.  Its just messed up.  Sick of these corporate idiots running my life as if they know what I need, or what I want to do.  For the most part.. its people like me that are the reason why they even have a JOB in the first place.  Ugh, all I want is bandwidth and freedom.  Leave me alone.  I don't want you bundles, I don't want your package.  I just want bandwidth and a static IP or two.
