★Broadband: What is faster. Cable or phone line via DSL?
The short answer is it depends.  You have to understand that there are lots of types of DSL and that the data rates range from 1.5 mbps up to >50mpbs. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig... To further complicate matters both DOCSIS cable modem and DSL systems have bonding technologies which allow the provider to combine more than one channel (cable) or line (DSL) into a single larger connection for the subscriber. In practical terms the operator providing the service is much more important than the technology being used.
