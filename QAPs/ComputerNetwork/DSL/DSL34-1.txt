â˜…I have RJ45 cable connection from my ISP, but I have router with DSL (means RJ11) port. Can I connect it?
Nobody yet answered the core question - why do you have a RJ45 cable from the ISP? Are you sure you don't have any box after the RJ45 cable and before the ISP? Are you sure you have a telefone line with a RJ45 terminator? Isn't the RJ45 a proper ethernet connection already, with the DSL or cable or whatever modem somewhere else? If it's a telefone cable, it doesn't make any sense for the ISP to terminate with an RJ45 instead of the proper RJ11. My DSL line has an ethernet alike cable (too many cables inside), but it still terminates correctly on a RJ11.
