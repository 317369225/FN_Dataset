★What are some causes for unsteady DSL speed?
Since DSL uses unshielded copper lines, I would say the root cause is usually interference generated by current going through a nearby line. If something has worn away insulation that line may also be shorting out. And the longer the longer the line, the higher the possibility of these issues, the slower the speed,  and the higher the latency as well.
