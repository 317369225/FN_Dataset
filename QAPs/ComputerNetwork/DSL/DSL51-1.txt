★Are there any alternative technologies to wired broadband services through DSL or cable TV?
Yes, there are alternatives.  But first think about how does a signal get from the Internet to you - it has to travel over something.  What are two somethings most homes have?  Phone lines and Cable TV lines.  Therefore, they're the two most prevalent. Alternatives would be some other kind of line - like fiber which Lee Nelson mentioned.  This is being deployed to some municipalities, but it's very hit or miss.  I live in a large metropolitan area - we don't have fiber.  Lee is a "rural telco" and they are deploying fiber.  Fiber Optic cable is capable of "tremendous" amounts of bandwidth as he mentioned but is expensive to deploy - so providers would have to lose a lot of money to put it in, or charge a lot of money to its users - which is why it's pretty uncommon. Other alternatives would be wireless.  Wireless signals will be some spectrum of electro magnetic radio waves - microwave, infrared, radio, etc.  Radio is more commonly known in their marketing terms "wifi" and "wimax".  However, terrestrial radio (land based) is limited by signal strength, with line of site being preferred.  Other radio connections would require a satellite to bounce the signal off of. Hope this helps.
