★Are there any alternative technologies to wired broadband services through DSL or cable TV?
I take some exception to the comment "cable TV and line phone companies will continue to interfere with the development of video streaming services".  I work at a rural telco that is also an IPTV service provider.  We offer DSL speeds up to 26Mbps (downstream to the user) with 6Mbps being our most common offering.  Additionally, we offer Fiber to the Prem.  I live in a community in rural Montana with less than 700 residents, but we all have fiber to our homes running at GigE (1000Mbps) speeds. On Fiber, we offer the same Internet speeds that we offer on DSL, in addition to bandwidth for IPTV and VoIP.  A typical IPTV subscriber is getting around 18Mbps of service from us.  This is becoming common in rural and independent telco markets.  If 2Mbps seems like a dream to you, then that is a problem with your service provider and the technology they are using, not a problem with the phone company industry as a whole or with available technology.
