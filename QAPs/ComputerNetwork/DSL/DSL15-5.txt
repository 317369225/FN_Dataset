★Why aren't cellular data technologies (3G, 4G LTE, etc) truly unlimited like Broadband and DSL are?Wouldn't broadband/DSL cost more since they typically reach faster speeds? Why can't there be unlimited Internet for cellphones like wifi hotspots offer? I know Sprint is unlimited but the speeds do not match Broadband/DSL?
Nothing is unlimited and nothing is free. Even your advertised "unlimited broadband DSL" has limits. When you take an unlimited plan, there is always a rider called the "Fair usage policy". This means that - 1 ..  you will get high data-rates for an X GB of download and after that the data-rate will be cut-down. and / or 2 .. your data-rate will be cut-down if you do a large volume of download within a day.
