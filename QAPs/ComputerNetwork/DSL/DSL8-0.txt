★How does DSL bonding work?This apparently doubles your available bandwidth by combining two separate copper lines into one connection.
I am not sure how technical you expect this answer to be, so I am giving a very high level overview. Think of Bonding as having 2 separate phone lines connected via 2 separate modems, but both in a single box, "joined at the hip". So, in effect, you combine 2 receivers, getting bits from both in the Physical layer and reassembling them higher up in the ATM or EFM layer.   Since each ADSL2+ line is capable of upto 28Mbps, you effectively double the available bandwidth, by combining the two lines. These can then be configured for a specific QoS, e.g. you can assign a dedicated bandwidth for your regular data and the rest for streaming a HD movie. Once you are done with the movie, bandwidth can be released for other applications, e.g. double browsing, VoIP, etc.   The limitations, noise conditions and impulse noise are all expected to stay the same for both these lines considering that the copper goes through similar environmental conditions. But you now have more flexibility and room to adapt the frequencies or even the channel in which data is sent. Hope this helps. Feel free to follow up.
