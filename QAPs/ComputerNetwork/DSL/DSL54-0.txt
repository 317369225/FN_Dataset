★Why is DSL (digital subscriber loop) called so? Why is it called a loop?
Prior to advent of DSL technology, only dial up access was available for internet access where in modem is used to convert the signal s into tone (frequency) and send as anolog signals with  a maximum possible speed of 32Kbps only. In DSL technology, there is no modem to convert the signals into tone for transmission on telephone line. Further, the speed of DSL can go up to 8Mbps. The word loop is typically used in telecom as two wires are to be connected to complete the loop for stabling speech. Even in wireless technology, the phrase WLL (Wireless Local loop) is used. Nowadays, the word Digital Subscriber Line is colloquially used instead of Digital subscriber Loop. Both these are abbreviated as DSL and interchangeably used.
