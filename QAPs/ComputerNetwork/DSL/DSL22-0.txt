★Is fixed line wireless a good alternative to DSL?Surprisingly, traditional DSL providers, for whatever reason (e.g. distance), won't install DSL in many places around the Bay Area for homes and small businesses.  What is the best alternative to DSL?  Is fixed-line wireless a good option?  Have you found fixed-line wireless to be stable or spotty?  T-1 lines simply aren't an option due to cost.
My opinion about wireless vs. DSL is that wireless is far more impacted by environmental issues and can have a much higher packetloss and as a technology is significantly easier to hack than DSL. Also playing devils advocate fibre is even less impacted by environmental issues than DSL is, because it is not impacted by the same electrical interference that copper can be. Sometimes wireless can be cheaper? But my bet is on DSL (But I am biased!)
