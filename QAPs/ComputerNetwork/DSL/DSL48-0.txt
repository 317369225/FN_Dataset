â˜…What's the cheapest way to get in-line DSL filters?I'm setting up a DSL connection for my parents, who have several phones in their home, and need another five filters or so. CenturyLink wants to ding them five bucks a filter plus five dollars shipping; I hit Amazon, but I'm getting rung up for shipping per filter. I know people have these things sitting around from DSL installs - what's the cheapest way to get a handful of these things?
If your outcome is where can you get cheap filters then eBay would be the cheapest option I would think. But a couple of warnings on that approach: Quality of filters can have a large impact on speed: I have tested and seen up to 5Mbps drops based on different filters used. RAL Resistance Across Line in New Zealand, we have a sticker on put phone which lists the resistance across the line that each telepermitted device gives you. (resistance decreases the quality of the signal, so that can be an impact to speed and reliability). So if you have more RAL than 5, then that is Eg standard phone -1 cordless or fax -2 -3 Alarm -1 -2 Etc So possibly that many phones will be degrading the signal even with filters Full install These are called different things in different countries but a master jackpoint installed by your Telco, can cost $60- $100 but in my mind would be the cleanest and best quality option. All that said if price is most important factor then see how it goes with the cheap filters If you have problems my troubleshooter here might be a help: www.adslgeek.com/troubleshooter And also just message me if you have any other questions / problems :)
