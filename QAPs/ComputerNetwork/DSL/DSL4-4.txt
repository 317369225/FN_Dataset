★Who are the broadband (Cable, DSL, etc.) providers in the Bay Area?
AT&T and Comcast both provide high-speed broadband in San Francisco.  I had a terrible experience with AT&T broadband (as did others I know); it frequently crawled to a hault to the point that I could barely use the internet. Others I know had similar experiences. Comcast has subpar customer service, but I was at least able to get reliable high-speed internet from them.
