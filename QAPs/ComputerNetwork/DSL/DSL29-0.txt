★What is the difference between good and poor quality DSL modems?Do better quality modems have better throughput or is a modem a modem? What makes a modem better quality?
"Good" depends on who you ask, though throughput is something that can be measured easily and does vary some between systems.  Having said that, its highly unusual today to see any differences in theoretical max throughput and much more common to see modems have differing actual throughput.  The second is sometimes caused by one of the modems being compared having slightly better receive signal sensitivity, error correction, or both (there are other technical reasons why one can be faster, but these are common in my experience).  These lead to the device having better RF transmission on the ADSL side which leads to a "faster" and more stable connection. Good can also refer to stability, something that modems should have but don't always.  A really fast modem that crashes every 2 1/2 hours won't be considered "good" by most users.  "Good" can also include factors like price and whether or not the modem can be managed via TR-069.
