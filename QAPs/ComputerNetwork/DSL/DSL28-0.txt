â˜…Is there any tutorial or resource that can explain the DSL pattern in ElasticSearch, so that I can understand it better.
I believe I can help for your first example. I ran into the same problem of wanting to return multiple types from multiple queries, and I came up with two solutions. You could join the individualized type queries in a bool query as 'should' clauses. bool query documentation:http://www.elasticsearch.org/gui... Design your queries as if you were only querying one item type each to come up with a "user query" and an "object query". Then, embed them as should clauses in a boolean query with a type filter. Gist of the json:https://gist.github.com/1386569 However, this has the problem of comparing different item types and scoring schemes, meaning that it is possible for the results of the query to be all one type or all the other type. For me, this was undesirable, so I ended up issuing both queries asynchronously and joining the results myself, giving me more control over how many of each type of result. Hope this helps!
