â˜…If the size of the repository containing the linux kernel is 135 MB how come the size of DSL is just 70 MB?linux
A2A. Linux kernel is open source. Its source is free for anyone to read, edit and compile appropriately based on its license. To facilitate this process, linux shares its code in a repository. This code is ever increasing, and is continuously being modified as new versions get released. A compressed version of this code's current snapshot, (tarball) is 70 something MB and can be accessed from The Linux Kernel Archives. The git repository of this is even bigger as it stores all the edits ever committed into this code right since its inception. Now, when we install linux, we use a compiled version of this source code. Here we firstly strip off code for hardware and features we do not require. So we could safely eliminate a huge percentage of device driver source code, and other unrelated features, unwanted CPU architectures. This trims a lot of size. After this,when the kernel is actually compiled, the text based source is converted into machine optimized binary. This is where another huge file size is cut. The final size, will vary based on the configurations of features you have opted for.You can go for a minimalist configuration, or be very liberal, and make a bloated config. But even in that scenario, the binary shouldnt be more than 25-ish MB. Once this stage is done, you can just point your bootloader to the compiled binary, and boot into linux and use it.
