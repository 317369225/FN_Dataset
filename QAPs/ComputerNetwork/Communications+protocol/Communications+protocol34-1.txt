â˜…What are the roadblocks to rapid knowledge acquisition like in The Matrix?
I actually think the "roadblock" is fundamental and is not just about technology advancement. We may develop some techniques to "burn" information (not knowledge!) into one's brain. It may even work somehow reliably. For example, as proven by people "remembering" long sequences of digits/words or poetry or some technologically important stuff. Think technicians always knowing nuclear power plant specifications or spacemen understanding every single detail of how their ship operates. The above would not be knowledge. Learning and gaining knowledge is a complex thoughtful process, the main aim of which is not to mechanically memorize things but to fit them into the bigger, higher-order picture of the world that already exists in one's mind. That is why I always vote for allowing students to use any written materials during tests and exams. Discipline that is largely about memorizing facts is next to worthless today. Deep knowledge has little to do with remembering details, it is all about the big picture. I have composed a similar reply two weeks ago: Dima Korolev's answer to What is the benefit of knowing things that are not going to affect us in any way?
