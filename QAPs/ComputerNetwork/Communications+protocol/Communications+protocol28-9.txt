★What are the best IIT jokes?
Once a plane was about to take off and there was announcement,' Ladies and gentlemen, the plane you people are on, is build by engineers from IITs and its first of its kind. So please be seated and enjoy the flight.'  Because of obvious reputation of IITs, everyone panicked and rushed towards the hatch to open the door and screaming 'this thing is gonna crash during flight',  An old man was still sitting and he was pretty calm. Staff then helped everyone to get out then asked that man for being so calm. He replied, 'I was prof @IIT for many years and as far as I know, this plane ain't gonna fly in first place.'
