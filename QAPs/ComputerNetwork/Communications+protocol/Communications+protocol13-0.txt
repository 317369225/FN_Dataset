â˜…What would it take to create an open communications protocol for exercise equipment?At least in my fitness center, there seems to be some restrictions with using wearables to communicate data to fitness machines. For example, Polar and iFit monitors only work on certain machines that support its communications. I'm wondering what it would take to create an open protocol that any fitness manufacturer can use to communicate to mobile and wearable devices?
Interesting question! To answer rather mundanely, you'd need to agree on a means of communication (wired, radio, infrared...), define the protocol at each OSI layer and come up with an extensible data model so that the devices know what to say to each other. Fortunately, ANT+ already exists, so the technical part is done. The really interesting part is how to get it widely adopted. Looking at other industries, I'd say there are three drivers for open standards: government regulatory mandate; a player with massive market share adopts it, and everyone joins in so that their equipment is compatible; or a player with massive market share does something proprietary, and the smaller competitors join up to push a rival technology. I don't see the government getting involved in this, but Polar and Life Fitness seem to be taking a big chunk of the market, so I think it would be possible to come up with a compelling case for a consortium of manufacturers of wearable devices, gym equipment, smartphones, etc to put their combined weight behind an open protocol in order to avoid being frozen out. It'll be interesting to see what Apple does with the Watch...
