★Is the banter between the astronauts and Houston at the beginning of Gravity true to life?Would Mission Control be chatting with the astronauts continuously? Would there be casual banter as well as mission-related discussion?
No, especially not during an EVA. This is something the filmmakers admitted to.  They originally scripted the scene using the standard communication protocols but felt it hurt the pacing too much.
