â˜…How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
I think it largely depends upon context for me as well as the following questions: is there a problem trying to be solved? is it a debate/argument? is it of an academic nature/scenario or casual? who are the parties involved (e.g. close friend, distant friends, associates, colleagues, enemies, douchbags, etc)? what is the allotted time available to pursue the discussion? otherwise i might tend to spend all day correcting grammar, verbal punctuation, definitions/synonyms, usage + so forth till the flowers bloom. given the above questions, i have found that it is useful to pick one's battles when not engaged in conversations of a precise nature. common scenarios where precision may be critical include: philosophical/scientific matters technical matters (e.g. programming, projects, etc) legal matters some quora threads (otherwise one will be called out for sure) if a common framework for terminology has not been adopted (implicitly or explicitly), then perhaps it may be most fruitful to point one out or even create one (perhaps even reify it in a concept model for sharing).
