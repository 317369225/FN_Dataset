★How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
Consider a basic philosophical perspective on language: Words don't have meanings - people have meanings. People use language in an attempt to communicate something important, something that matters to them.  They can't be "corrected" on the basis of an ideal of what a word "means".  Nor is it really helpful (or well accepted) to try that, as one may easily discover in practice.  They can, however, be helped to communicate, to get across what matters, what is behind their act of speaking.  That is mainly done by good listening and by conjecturing what they are "up to".
