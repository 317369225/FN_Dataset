â˜…What are the differences between RPC, RMI and SOAP?These technologies are used in what place respectively? As i know web service which is based soap/XML. We had SOAP already why still use RPC ? And what are their respective advantages?
While these three things are related, they aren't directly comparable. RPC is a general concept - Remote Procedure Call - literally, the invocation of a procedure in an application on a remote server. RPC can be performed in many ways, and the concept of RPC does not specify a communication protocol. RMI is a specific implementation of RPC - it stands for Remote Method Invocation, and is a Java-specific implementation that typically uses IIOP - a communication protocol borrowed from CORBA (it stands for Internet Inter-ORB Protocol). When it does, it's technically referred to as RMI-IIOP. SOAP is a communication protocol (so somewhat comparable to IIOP). While it is the successor to XML-RPC, and usually used over HTTP (this over TCP/IP), it is actually transport-neutral, and can be done over other transports, such as SMTP. SOAP supports RPC, and indeed, early on, most SOAP-based services were RPC. Later, most of the industry switched to Document-based SOAP, where documents are transferred back and forth, rather than RPC. And, while there are still a lot of SOAP services out there, and I'm sure that many people are still writing them, XML (SOAP uses XML) is somewhat less popular than it was - the currently fashionable thing to do is to write HTTP-based web services that communicate via either JSON or Protocol Buffers.
