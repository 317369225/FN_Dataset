★Is the brain a meat computer?Can human tissue possibly generate electricity or electrical activity?  Is there any evidence of such?  Or is it all just source projecting physicality as expression?
Yes, the brain is an organic tridimensional electric matrix containing his own particular architecture. This design can be (according to Turing laws) emulated in any other computer with enough processing power. This means that in the near future we will be able to put a human mind in a computer and then nothing will be like before
