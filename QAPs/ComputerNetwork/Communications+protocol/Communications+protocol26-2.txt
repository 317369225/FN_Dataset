★I've started an internet project, where other parties participate to. And I'm looking for an efficient way to keep track (protocol) everything and create tasks just so we can collect all the data in one place and stay focused on our goal.  I've researched this and I only found approaches to this idea which weren't convincing, I can't believe there's not one go to solution, since it's something essential IMO, after all an internet company needs to handle its data and have a protocolled communication when working over a distance in a team. Do you guys have any recommendations?
Part of my team works remotely from the other coast. So we were also looking for a pm tool that'd let us communicate and manage projects as if we were all in the same room. I personally have to handle several tasks at the same time and also monitor the project’s progress. We tried couple of other options, but Wrike (https://www.wrike.com/)  appeared to be the best one. I like it as it has a simple and clear dashboard view (with my current and overdue tasks, tasks assigned to others, etc.), Activity Stream where I can leave comments and discuss any coming issue with my team in real-time and, of course, e-mail integration. It’s my personal favorite. Basically, it converts my e-mails into tasks, I just need to add Wrike into the e-mail’s CC and it will be transferred into the app. We also have a couple of freelancers working with us on several projects. And with Wrike we can choose whether to share with them the whole project’s data or just relevant to them tasks. Thanks to Outlook add-in and Google docs integration we keep all our data in one app and avoid losing it. So Wrike has actually become the “all-in-one” tool we’ve been searching for.   Hope, you’ll find it helpful too. Tell me how it went afterwards.
