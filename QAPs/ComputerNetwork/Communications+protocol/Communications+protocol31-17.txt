â˜…How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
I am the same way. Exactly the same way. Generally, I acknowledge the misstep, clarify the point s/he is trying to make if it's important enough, and avoid an argument unless the person is adequately receptive to the correction of his or her speech/text to be more precise. Many times, it doesn't matter if you are right or not, but how much damage could be done by the argument it may take to prove your correctness. It helps to realize this, and mete your actions appropriately. People don't like to be told they are wrong, even if it will clarify or improve their point, so it is up to you to decide whether that clarification is important enough.
