â˜…Why can no PC laptop match the touchpad of a Mac?Out of all the laptops I've tried, I end up getting disappointed with their touchpad: it's close to useless. I find this rather peculiar, since MacBook touchpads seem decent. Why isn't there any other (to my knowledge) laptops that have implemented a quality touchpad? It can't be that hard to make, can it?
I usually stay away from loaded questions but you successfully baited me here. Most touchpads are awful, apparently designed as afterthoughts. After a company decides to put some thought into the design of their touchpad, there are still many approaches they can take. For a look inside this process, I suggest you to read http://www.lenovoblogs.com/desig... by David Hill, the head honcho of Thinkpad (Lenovo) design. The Macbook's touchpad uses a glass surface for a completely smooth tactile feel, which is the opposite of what Lenovo attempted with their new design. Personal preference will determine which you enjoy using most. The glass touchpads are certainly more durable than the textured ones, which tend to get polished down by our rough fingertips with use.
