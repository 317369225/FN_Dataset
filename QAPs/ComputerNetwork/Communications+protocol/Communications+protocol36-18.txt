â˜…What are some real life good habits that programming gives people?Inspired by What are some real-life bad habits that programming gives people?
I don't know if it's already been said, but ever since I've gotten into coding in general I've become a better typist. Prior to learning how to code typing was pretty tedious. I always had to look at the keyboard to type something. Now I can type looking straight at the screen, and sometimes while looking away. It's not a perfext performance but it's better than what I was doing before.
