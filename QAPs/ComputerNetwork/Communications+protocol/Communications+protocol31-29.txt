★How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
Why would you want to avoid it, if it helps others improve on their English (I presume it is). Unless you feel it a waste of energy to do so, esp. if you know the other person won't take it in, and to their advantage. Best is to set an example; so, you can simply repeat the phrase correctly. You could turn the phrase into a joke that points to the error, in such a way to help the other to remember not to say it that way again...to help them understand that they may be ridiculed, not by you but, by others. Only help when you feel that that person will benefit.  Hope this helps.
