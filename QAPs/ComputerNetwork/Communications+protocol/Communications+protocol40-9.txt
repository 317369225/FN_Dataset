â˜…What else is a finite state machine used for except language parsing?
I used one recently to implement the various states of a point of sale system for customizing and ordering salads and pizzas. Each state represents a phase in the order making process, like loading the screen, loading the ingredients, displaying the food, customers building their pizza, setting how many they want, completing the order, and finally unloading. Without the state machine it was a jumbled mess of events that had to call at the exact right time, and also didn't allow for a back button like a state machine does naturally.
