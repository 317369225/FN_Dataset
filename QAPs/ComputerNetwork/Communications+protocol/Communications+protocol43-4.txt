â˜…Why can no PC laptop match the touchpad of a Mac?Out of all the laptops I've tried, I end up getting disappointed with their touchpad: it's close to useless. I find this rather peculiar, since MacBook touchpads seem decent. Why isn't there any other (to my knowledge) laptops that have implemented a quality touchpad? It can't be that hard to make, can it?
Because no one actually *designs* PC.
