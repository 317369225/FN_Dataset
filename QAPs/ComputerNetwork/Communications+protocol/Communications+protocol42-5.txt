â˜…Which are the frequently asked interview questions for Java Engineers ?
Well, the level of difficulty for the questions depends on the level of engineer the position requires. For junior engineers, "How would you use Java interfaces?" , "What is the difference between & and &&?" or "How do you serialize a Java object?" For mid-level engineers, "how can you make one thread wait on another thread?", "How do you create a singleton and why?", "How do you implement a RESTful service?" For senior engineers, "What design patterns do you use most often?", "How do you design for scalability?", or "What are some best practices for unit testing?" Best wishes!
