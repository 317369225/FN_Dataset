★Is the brain a meat computer?Can human tissue possibly generate electricity or electrical activity?  Is there any evidence of such?  Or is it all just source projecting physicality as expression?
The brain is a living organic (that is the meat part) entity that is capable of computation.  It is also capable of functions that no non-organic computer can do.
