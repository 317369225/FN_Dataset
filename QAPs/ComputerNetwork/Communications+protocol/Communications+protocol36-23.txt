Programming has helped me in many ways of my life...to be a good programmer, your brain has to operate just like the CPU operates... logical thinking...I believe programming helps me in multitasking...I can be debugging a troublesome module, at the same designing a banner with Photoshop, at the same searching for a better module on the internet, at the same modifying the source code of another....all at the same time...and all a non-programmer would see is me switching between windows at a rapid speed on my gnome desktop manager....its so fun and challenging... phew!...but at times I get headache from doing this... Again programmers always want to conquer that challenge... that bug..we spend the whole night trying to fix this and that.... Programming makes you smart...not in the emotional and relationship world...
