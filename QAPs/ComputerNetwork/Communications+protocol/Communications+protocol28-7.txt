â˜…What are the best IIT jokes?
Disclaimer : If you don't get this joke, see the text just below 'Suggest Edits'. No pun intended. An IITian goes to a roadside astrologer and shows his palm. Soon after looking at his palm... Astrologer : Are you single? Guy (Surprised) : How do you know? You didn't even see my hand properly !! Astrologer : What should I see, dude? There are hardly any lines on your palm.
