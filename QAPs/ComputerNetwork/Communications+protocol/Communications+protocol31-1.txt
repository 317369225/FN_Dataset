★How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
I was always taught that the main purpose of language was to be understood, and as long as that is achieved the rest is just nit picking and snobbery. That said, I'm an Oxford educated English as a Second Language teacher and  bad grammar irks me, but not as much as pretentiousness, so I shut up!
