★How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
Many of these answers here are from people who share your desire for precise language. But I would instead ask if your desire for language correctness is worth starting an argument. Maybe your friends are used to this behavior from you and are willing to be challenged. But I think strangers or coworkers will see it as annoying or if you are attacking or insulting them.   So, the question is whether your desire to be right is more important to you than the desire not to alienate or offend other people. That's a question only you can answer.
