â˜…How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
I liked the way Christopher Rubin says is all within the context. 1. The Audience itself. If you are talking to a little kid you need to use the words that the little kid understand, which may sound incorrect to a rocket scientist but very precise and clear to the kid. 2. The Precision. Now, there are some situations where you really want to be precise. In which case I recommend you to use the simplest tool: a Dictionary, even better if it has Etymology, origin explanation of the word or the stems.. I usually use Wiktionary as it is quite simple and fast, I check the Latin, Greek, or Indoeuropean stems to verify that I am using the precise meaning that I look for. 3. The Audience Culture. Is not the same for an English speaker to talk to a USA citizen than talking to a British, as is not the same for a Latinamerican Spanish speaker to talk to a Spanish speaker from Spain. In the end, if you misspelled a word or two or if you use more or less words is not as meaningful as if you "hit the nail" with your audience.
