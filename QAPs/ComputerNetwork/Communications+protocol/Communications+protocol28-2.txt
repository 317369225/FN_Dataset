â˜…What are the best IIT jokes?
A girl was tending to the family goat in the courtyard outside her house. Through the window of the kitchen, her mother spots three boys walking down the road to her house. Mother :Come inside. There is a group of boys walking towards you. Daughter: Don't worry mother. They are just three students from IIT. The mother panics and yells: Are you crazy? Get the goat inside now!
