â˜…What are the best IIT jokes?
Once three old buddies met. One of them was an IIM graduate earning millions and figuratively printing dollars, second was a doctor from AIIMS married to a hottie, having a luxurious bunglow in posh area of Delhi and the third was a meagre IIT Engineer. They meet at a bar, have a couple of drinks and after a while, they feel they need to relieve themselves. They go to the gents room, do their business. Following takes place: IIM Guy: (Washes his hand with minimum amount of water, and then uses a single piece of tissue to dry his hand off, using each millimeter square of the poor piece of fiber until there is no dry area on it) We guys at IIMs are taught to be efficient. AIIMS Guy: (Washes his hand with loads of water, soap and uses a half of tissues from tissue dispenser to dry them off) We docs at AIIMS are taught about hygiene. IIT Guy: (Finishes his business, zips his fly, puts his hands in pockets and strolls out. The other two stare at him in disgust. After stepping out of the washroom, he says:) We at IITs are taught not to piss on ourselves. Source: Old joke, forgot the source.
