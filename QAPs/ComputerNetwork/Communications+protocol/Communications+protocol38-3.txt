â˜…What protocol does HomeKit use to communicate with its devices?I know that HomeKit uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. I'd like to know more about how does it discover the devices over WiFi and what protocol does it use to communicate to them.
The protocols used are Bonjour, HTTP, and standard bluetooth profiles.
