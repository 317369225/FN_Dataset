★What is the maximum number of slave that can be connected to the Master  in SPI(Serial Communication Protocol) Interface?
I assume that by "SPI" you mean "Serial Peripheral Interface" That depends. Partly, you need to keep track of fan-out of the master, though that could likely be dealt with by buffers. Secondly, are you using standard SPI or mSPI? The standard would (if you want the slaves to be independent) need one SlaveSelect output for each slave - how many pins do you have on the master? If your slave supports daisy-chaining, that could help with pin-restriction. mSPI uses addressing of the slaves, and assuming that the address is 8 bits, that would mean a limit of 256 slaves unless you combine this with daisy-chaining. So the short answer is that the protocol does not restrict it, your hardware does.
