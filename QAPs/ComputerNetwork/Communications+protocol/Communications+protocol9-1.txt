★Which wireless communication protocol is used in wireless keyboards and mice?
Not necessarily Bluetooth. In fact, Logitech makes only a few Bluetooth models for users who prefer to pair with the built-in feature of modern laptop PCs. Over the years, Logitech has used Logitech's various wireless frequencies and protocols for keyboards and mice. Currently, their products run on one of four wireless protocols: Proprietary 27 MHz “FastRF” protocol Proprietary 2.4 GHz wireless protocol (mostly mice, very few keyboards) The standard 2.4 GHz Bluetooth protocol. It does not require a proprietary dongle at the PC, but it exhibits has a delay when initiating key-clicks or mouse movement after a the devices have powered down. Proprietary 2.4 GHz “Unifying” wireless protocol (not compatible with any of the above). It is Logitech’s grand scheme to expand their own ecosystem by promoting a single dongle. In effect, it does what Bluetooth does, but optimized for small serial-mode accessories. Credit for above list: überOptions (Dec 2010). The Unifying protocol is still current as of early 2015.
