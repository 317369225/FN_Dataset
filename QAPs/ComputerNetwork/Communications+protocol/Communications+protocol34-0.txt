â˜…What are the roadblocks to rapid knowledge acquisition like in The Matrix?
The following three issues come up to mind: 1. Inability to make large scale non-destructive physical connections to the nervous system and/or brain. Accessing the spine, brain, or optical nerve is extremely hard to do in a non-destructive manner in a living person. We have no way of directly making electrochemical contact to the millions of nerves in the spine, much less directly to neurons lodged inside the brain. 2. Lack of understanding of nervous communication protocols. Even if we were able to make electrochemical connections to nerves, we currently do not understand the communication protocol used by the nervous system sufficiently to artificially generate signals that the brain would interpret correctly. 3. Inability to access internal memory. Even if we could connect to the brain through the spine and/or other nerves, this would likely not afford us direct access to the brain's internal memory, where knowledge is stored. We would still be relegated to going through the normal learning channels, i.e., producing stimuli that leads the person's brain to learn, not very differently from the way knowledge is currently transmitted. In sum, until technology advances to the point where we can make a map of the billions or so of internal connections in a human brain, of the state of all neurons at a given time, and to the point where we can create, edit, and remove connections non-destructively and dynamically; it is unlikely we will be able to achieve rapid knowledge acquisition.
