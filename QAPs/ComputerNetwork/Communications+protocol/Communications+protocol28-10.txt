★What are the best IIT jokes?
Some of these are specific to IIT Bombay: What does an old tum-tum ask a new tum-tum during an intro session? "Oye, teri frequency kitni hai?" Rajnikanth takes an auto from his hostel to his destination. No autowallah says 'main gate tak!' to Rajnikanth. When Rajnikanth was in college, he was SoDA- Student of Dean Affairs. You think getting into IIT is tough? Try saying 'student' at the main gate. A thirdie walking into the campus was stopped by the security guards. Upon being asked who he was, he replied, "Student!" When they demanded I-Card, the thirdie flared up, "Daya... Kya fart hai!!" And the security guards let him in. “Try saying that to your wife.” - Dr Santhakumar, HoD (Aerospace) to a group of students who, as an ID110 assignment, submitted an odometer that didn’t work when tested. Their excuse was: “couldn’t perform since it was the first time”. From : The Fifth Fourth Estate, IITM newsletter. This one was pretty popular way back when Arjun Singh died: Arjun Singh, 80, has passed away after prolonged illness. He is survived by a dozen of IITs and IIMs.
