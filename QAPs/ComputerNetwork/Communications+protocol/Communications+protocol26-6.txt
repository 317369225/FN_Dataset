★I've started an internet project, where other parties participate to. And I'm looking for an efficient way to keep track (protocol) everything and create tasks just so we can collect all the data in one place and stay focused on our goal.  I've researched this and I only found approaches to this idea which weren't convincing, I can't believe there's not one go to solution, since it's something essential IMO, after all an internet company needs to handle its data and have a protocolled communication when working over a distance in a team. Do you guys have any recommendations?
I'd recommend you to go for proofhub. It is an online collaboration and project management software. You can create tasks-sub tasks, assign them to people, track the record. It has chat, discussions and file sharing making this tool one of the best collaboration tool. You can have a look : https://www.proofhub.com
