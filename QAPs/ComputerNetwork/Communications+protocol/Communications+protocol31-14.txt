â˜…How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
Well, just imagine what would it be like if your habit of nitpicking others' incorrect use of words led to an allergy, as illustrated in the comic strip below. The chap here is allergic to grammatical errors, which I guess is not too different from your own condition.
