â˜…How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
Enlighten yourself by reading The Language Log (Language Log) as frequently as possible. Join the language hippies! You will come to revel in the plurality of possible expressions for a given (approximate?) meaning, and marvel at the verbal creativity of your "linguistically naive" peers.
