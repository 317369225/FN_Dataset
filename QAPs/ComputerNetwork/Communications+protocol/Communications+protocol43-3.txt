â˜…Why can no PC laptop match the touchpad of a Mac?Out of all the laptops I've tried, I end up getting disappointed with their touchpad: it's close to useless. I find this rather peculiar, since MacBook touchpads seem decent. Why isn't there any other (to my knowledge) laptops that have implemented a quality touchpad? It can't be that hard to make, can it?
Actually i am very happy w/ the touchpad on my HP Pavilion dv7t Quad Laptop. My dad owns a Macbook Pro so i know what u're talking abt, they are exceptionally responsive, but i don't like the fact that they don't have discrete buttons, you can't just tap the pad to click on sth !! u gotta go click clicketty click all the time! Also it's not always the hardware that's the problem, if your touchpad is not as responsive as you'd like it to be there may be a software fix for it. You just gotta find one that's right for your pad. My laptop has a synaptics touchpad and i improved it's performance greatly by going here: http://www.ibm.com/developerwork...
