â˜…How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
You can start by realizing that NOBODY LIKES HAVING THIS DONE TO THEM. Nobody. It likely costs you more than you might realize. If you are having issues understanding someone and truly want to understand them, you can try politely repeating back to them (mirror them) what you've heard, followed by, "I want to make sure I've understood you correctly. Is that what you mean?" Avoid actually COMMENTING on the fact that you misunderstand them because they've "not used the correct words." It's rude, condescending and nobody likes it. Ain't nobody got time for that. If you really DO want to stop nitpicking, you can try the "mirror" technique above and when you catch yourself pointing out their (in your mind) mistakes, CHEW HARD on your inner cheek. Relationships, all of them, are primarily what life is about. And relationships, all of them, are primarily based on communication, good or bad. Make communication your ally instead of your weapon and you'll do just fine.
