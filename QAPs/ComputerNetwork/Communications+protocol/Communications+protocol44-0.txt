★What is the difference between TLS, SSL, and HTTPS?
SSL - a way of encrypting information sent over the Internet. TLS - the new name for SSL. TLS 1.0 might have, in a different world, been called SSL 4.0 HTTPS - using the SSL/TLS "system" to transfer data using the http protocol... HTTP - the hypertext protocol, the communications protocol used for servers to send hypertext (html) messages back and forth. A stretched analogy - HTML is the letter - it's what the recipient wants to read -  http is the envelope - it's something the letter goes in, SSL/TLS is the courier who delivers the envelope.
