â˜…What are the best IIT jokes?
While travelling one guy asked me "what do you do?" I said "I study aerospace engineering". "From where ?" He said. "IIT Bombay" After some time he again asked "is that college AICTE approved? " I was speechless. I said I'll get it checked! That guy was a civil engineer in Rajkot.
