â˜…What are the best IIT jokes?
I remember this particular time when a prof walks in to class, struggles to turn on the projector, sheepishly looks at the first year class of 100 odd students, and asks them with "Do you know the full-form of IIT?" "Umm... Indian Institute of Technology?" "No. It stands for Institute of Indian Technology"
