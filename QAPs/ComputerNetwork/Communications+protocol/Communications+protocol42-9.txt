â˜…Which are the frequently asked interview questions for Java Engineers ?
Are you asking in order to create a crib sheet as an interviewer or in order to bone up before an interview? If the former: Don't. They are a waste of time as people can just memorize the answers to common questions. Instead for the technical competence test use a programming test. Either an at-home style test which requires 1-2 hours to complete or some to do in the office. Then quiz the interviewee on the day (why did you do X this way, how would you add this feature). You can also quickly reject people who something stupid (like no tests or no separation of concerns). Then in the interview ask open ended questions that can easily lead to a discussion based on the content of their CV and the processes and practices important to you. A common example of this is "what is your favourite design pattern". If the latter - How senior are you? Junior - The expect you to get some of the boilerplate questions wrong. Don't just parrot the answers, use the questions as jumping off points for conversations. Med level (or above) - You should be getting this largely right by default. Again use the questions as jumping off points for conversations.
