★Which communication protocols must a EE grad student understand to work be able to work on ASIC/FPGA Design?
Usually  you use a separate chip or a prebuilt logic block if you need a serial port or a ethernet port.    You could build those up by yourself right on the ASIC but that is rather difficult and hard to debug. You also have to communicate with memory, so you should look up how to talk to static and DDR memory.  It's not as simple as it looks, especially for dynamic memory.  Most of the chips you talk to will either use a serial SPI interface, or maybe a parallel one.  SPI is not too hard, and parallel is dead easy.
