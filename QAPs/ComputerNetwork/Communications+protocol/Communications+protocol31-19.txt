â˜…How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
Some old dude said that one should worry about the plank in your own eye before one nitpicking others about the splinter in theirs. "This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people" is likely redundant. Choose "often" or " numerous" but likely you don't need to have both.
