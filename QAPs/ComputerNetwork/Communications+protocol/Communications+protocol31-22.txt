★How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
I, too, share this impulse. You may be associating with the wrong people.  Find ways to hang out with, communicate with, and befriend people who share your mastery of the language and your precision in its use.  (Let us welcome you to Quora.) Consider the axiom that a friend is someone whose faults one overlooks, as they overlook ours. Before seeking to clarify or make an issue of imprecision, consider whether or not having precision really matters.  Are you being compulsive?  Are you wasting everyone's time?
