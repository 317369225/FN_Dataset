â˜…What would it take to create an open communications protocol for exercise equipment?At least in my fitness center, there seems to be some restrictions with using wearables to communicate data to fitness machines. For example, Polar and iFit monitors only work on certain machines that support its communications. I'm wondering what it would take to create an open protocol that any fitness manufacturer can use to communicate to mobile and wearable devices?
First you'd have to convince all (or most) of the manufacturers of fitness machines and wearables that it's in their best interest to adopt an open standard. At the moment all of them seem to be trying to lock their customers into their proprietary ecosystem. Since fitness machines, and wearable fitness trackers, are pricey custom items that strategy makes sense. Also, it helps to try googling a bit.
