Reading between the lines:  Documentation is often incomplete, rushed by someone who hated writing, and sanitized to hide any dissent in the group.  Specifications are about what people thought they wanted when they were talking about it off the tops of their heads, processed through an intermediary and sanitized of any disparaging things one might say about a competing product or a potential customer.  Code rarely explains why it's there, just what it does.  To survive, you learn to look at what is not being said and what therefore needs to be questioned.
