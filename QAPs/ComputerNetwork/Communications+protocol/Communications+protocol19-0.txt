â˜…What is the difference between RS 232 and RS 485 communication protocol?
In general, the RS-232 is best for short-distance low-speed requirements. It is simple and low cost, and plenty of components like line drivers and receivers, UARTs, and connectors are available to build the interface. Some drivers permit data rates to 2 or 3 Mbits/s for short lines. Most interface chips include a charge pump dc-dc converter that supplies the positive and negative supply voltages allowing the IC to operate from a single 3.3- or 5-V supply. The RS-485 is for higher speeds over longer ranges or if duplex networking capability is required. Again, many standard parts are available to create the interface. ICs have drivers and receivers that can permit more than 32 drops, and data rates can be as high as 40 Mbits/s. Some ICs also include dc-dc converters to furnish dual supply voltages
