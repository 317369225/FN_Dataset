â˜…How is Stellar different from PayPal?
PayPal is HTTP. Stellar is TCP/IP. Edit: clarification. PayPal is HTTP in the sense that it's the application layer. It provides an abstraction above the channels that move money around and control the user's identity and connection to their funding source (ACH, Credit Card). Stellar is TCP/IP - the communication protocol that underlies and enables transmission between end points. In that sense, Stellar replaces the infrastructure - the clearing house, identity management, etc - not PayPal's application layer. PayPal can use Stellar. Hence the HTTP:TCP/IP analogy.
