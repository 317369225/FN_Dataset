★What are some examples of communication protocols appropriate for message-passing concurrency?Specifically, I’m looking for protocols for cooperation between processes/threads in one “program,” rather than the sort of thing that is necessarily serialized as a wire protocol
Let me recommend Akka actors.  It's a way to pass messages between threads within a program and avoid a lot of issues typical with multi-threaded programming.  Also very efficient and best yet, SIMPLE.  You can learn and start using it within minutes.  Available for the JVM as both Java and Scala.  You might have to look elsewhere if you're talking about non-JVM tech tho.
