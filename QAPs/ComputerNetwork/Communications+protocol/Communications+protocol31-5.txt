â˜…How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
Is this in a business sense? During the commission of your profession as an English language teacher? Please don't tell me it is during social or intimate encounters over casual matters. If it's the first, you must always ask yourself 'How important is it that I prove myself right and the other person wrong? Do I value my relationship with this person? Does this person have something I want?' Because Business 101 will tell you, don't piss people off unless you have to. Especially don't piss people off just so that you can look cleverer than them. If it's the second case, then you shouldn't be arguing with someone you are employed to educate anyhow. You don't educate anyone by arguing with them. All you will do is prove yourself an ineffective educator. If it's in a social or an intimate situation, you can stop yourself by remembering that you will die a lonely old man or woman if you don't stop this obnoxious habit. If you should ever get a mate and manage to produce children, those children will be likely to shun you as soon as they old enough because kids tend to not like to be endlessly humiliated by a parent who can't stop pointing out where they are imprecise in their use of language. Language is for communicating. Half of communication is listening, not judging whether the other person is 'using words correctly'. Also, I think there is a good case for the pot trying to avoid calling the kettle black. From the way you have used language in your question, you are an adequate communicator - but I certainly wouldn't think one who is such a shining example that the world is a better place when you go about casting aspersions on the abilities of others.
