â˜…How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
Yeah, I kinda tend in that direction myself. In a purely social setting, if you are really unsure what the person meant, it is always OK to ask non-snarky clarifying questions, or to ask permission to restate it to make sure you understood. If the meaning was obvious, even if the words were ambiguous, then I think you have to just take a deep breath and let it go. I know that's really hard. But any other way lies madness.
