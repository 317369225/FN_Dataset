★What else is a finite state machine used for except language parsing?
Besides the answers that say "everything", drilling down on workflow, BPML is fun times. Here's an easy intro: Business Process Modeling Language I tend to use it a lot for async stuff because it drives me crazy to wait for a file to load or a query to complete. A really cool/neat thing is that if you have any sort of state-machine definition language, you can compile them straight to code.
