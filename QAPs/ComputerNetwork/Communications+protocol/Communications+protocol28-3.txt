â˜…What are the best IIT jokes?
Once there were 2 IIT engineers, let's call them A and B(or K, Kgp, D, M & so on). They were wandering through a forest when they came across a wide river. They decided to use their own skills and intelligence to cross the river. A looked around and noticed a bridge made of stones some distance downstream from where they they stood. He calmly went there and safely crossed the river by walking across the bridge. Meanwhile, B, a man who would start running before the race started just to get a healthy lead, quickly jumped into the river and began swimming across in eager anticipation. when he reached the other bank, he was soaking wet and shivering. When people at their hometowns heard their story, they were all in praise of B. Why? . . . . . . . ...Because B had a higher G.P.A.
