- Always expect the unexpected. There are countless things that could simply go overlooked. - Make sure that you see things the way they are and not the way you believe/want them to be. - When you find trouble taking decisions in life take a piece of paper and pen and note down the facts. Think only in terms of those facts and not let emotions kick in. It works most of the time. - Confusion is caused when a situation is not understood properly. The above mentioned pen and paper trick works always. - You always tend to think a a little deep. You see things that your friends can't. You even come up with good assumptions regarding why things are the way they are. - You think twice before taking a decision and you become really good in analyzing the situation. - You know what is important and what is not. - You know it is always better to pause and think before you jump right into something. - Never promise something that you don't understand. - Broken things in the life are after all not that hard to fix. It is always not as complex and difficult as it may seem. - At the end of the day it is the sense of accomplishment and not the paycheck that makes you happy. And here is the most important of all. You become really good in recognizing bullshit and people who bullshit.
