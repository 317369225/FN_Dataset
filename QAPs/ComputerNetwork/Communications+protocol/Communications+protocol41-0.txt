★What happened to the after-midnight flashing yellow lights in downtown Palo Alto?My 3/4 mile commute home now takes twice as long :(
The traffic signals in Downtown Palo Alto typically go into a Flash mode in the late evening.  The City's central server that manages the Flash mode implementation failed about two weeks ago (it was just an old computer) and we are in the process of having it replaced.  The server uses a proprietary communications protocols to link with traffic signals in the field requiring the old server to be repaired first so that files can be transferred onto the new one.  We should have a replacement schedule next week after we receive bids from the system vendor.
