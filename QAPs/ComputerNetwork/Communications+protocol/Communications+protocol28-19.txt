★What are the best IIT jokes?
There was this news sometime back that students are now preparing for IIT from class VI. My take on it was- 1.Heard that students these days are preparing  for IIT from Class 6...When I was in class 6 I thought IIT was so  respectable that it was always addressed with a JEE. 2.Preparation from Class 6 might help you to get  into IIT.... But if you drink enough Vodka you might write a book like  Irodov which can help others to get into IIT.   I don't know if they are profound.
