â˜…How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
if If you are in US, watch "The Big Bang Theory" - it's a wonderful sitcom about scientists (your character would be named Dr Sheldon Cooper, who, like you, is struggling to adapt to coexisting with these average to below average humans).. this This character is very precise, always chooses his words carefully, watches his demeanor and at times intrigued by the petty things that people are thinking about.. two Two comments for you: do Do not pick each and every fight that comes your way fights . Fights are usually initiated by people who are absolutely certain that it's either their way or no way at all these . These people also pick fights because they know that they can win: and some of these fights (if not all of them) are just not worth it keep . Keep in mind: during a fight, beware of your opponents since idiots can drag you down to their level and beat you with their experience. iI've always been fascinated and held in high regard people who take an effort to carefully craft their thoughts and pick just the necessary words to convey their feelings; i I am constantly seeking out ways to improve myself in this area, and if some people do not appreciate/do not understand/want to argue with me, well, i I just use some sarcasm on them, and it works like a charm since most of the time they won't even notice it it. ;)
