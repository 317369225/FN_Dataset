â˜…How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
Rather than try NOT to do something, consider trying to displace the undesired activity with another activity. 1. Instead of correcting other people (which will not get you anywhere) you could slipping horrible puns into conversation... Like the Ventures were instrumental in popularizing Surf Music. The 1812 Overture is the canonical example of the use of artillery in music. 2. Or you could just concentrate on the emotional messages that underlie the words, and listening and responding to those messages. Caution: may lead to emotional involvement.
