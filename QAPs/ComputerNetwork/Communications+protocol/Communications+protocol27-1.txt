★Is the banter between the astronauts and Houston at the beginning of Gravity true to life?Would Mission Control be chatting with the astronauts continuously? Would there be casual banter as well as mission-related discussion?
Having watched a lot of actual EVAs on NASA TV, I found the banter to be one aspect of the movie that did not ring true at all.  While you might hear a few little jokes and colloquialisms, actual exchanges between mission control and Shuttle astronauts on EVA are (sigh, were) much more down-to-business and technical than anything you hear in the film. Additionally, the Texas-laconic "Mission Control Voice" accent and rhythm is way overdone and stagey on the part of the (usually much better) Ed Harris.
