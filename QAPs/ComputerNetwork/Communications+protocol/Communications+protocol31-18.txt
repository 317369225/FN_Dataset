â˜…How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
Do you like making people feel uncomfortable and insecure when they talk to you? That's what happens when you nitpick. Think about this: I majored in professional writing and I feel pretty confident in my writing skills. However, when I had to email a very critical editor-in-chief I felt terrified that he would tear my email apart. It's not fun talking to people who correct you all the time. Most people will end up avoiding you if you continue judging them over pedantic little issues like spelling "your" wrong.
