★How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
I have a similar affliction when it comes to people misusing certain words, but the thing to remember is that it's fine for YOU to choose to be precise in how you use language.  That just means you're someone who likes language and precision. Demanding the same level of precision from others, and then arguing with them about it, just makes you a jerk (and by you, I don't mean you personally - I mean all of us who tend to do this sometimes). The problem is that what you're doing is going to come across as arrogant and obnoxious, even if you have the best of intentions.  No one likes a pedant (and I say this as a semi-reformed pedant). People deal with ambiguity in language everyday, and unless you're in the act of splitting the atom or doing a heart transplant, I think you need to just accept that.
