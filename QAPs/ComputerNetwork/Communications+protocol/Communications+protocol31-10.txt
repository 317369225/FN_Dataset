â˜…How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
Apply a generous portion of Luntz's "Words That Work" rule #1 - It's not what you say, it's what they hear. People misuse words and communications all the time. The best I can suggest when you sense a word as being misused just ask, "What do you mean by ______?" Rather than debate the word, just get them to communicate with another word that more appropriate and less ambigious.
