★How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
A wise person once said to me, "You can be right, or you can be happy." Let's suppose the italicized portion below entailed the whole of my answer: How could a word snob throw up such a poorly worded question?  Do you need to be "very" precise?  (Is the word "precise" not precise enough?)  You've used "often" twice.  "Numerous" is a verbal speed bump that holds up the sentence in the middle; you'd have been better off without it.  In fact, there is a build-up of verbiage in your question that climaxes at the self-impressive "casually ambiguous."  Finally, you don't need to "get yourself" to avoid anything; you just need to avoid it. Here is how a precise version of your question should read:  "I like to be precise when I use language.  This often causes me to get into arguments with people when trying to clarify the meanings of the words they choose.  How can I avoid this?" Reading that, you might think, "Wow, what a b*tch." Indeed.
