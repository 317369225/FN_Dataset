★How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
Why not use simple words? When it comes to words, Less if Definitely More :-) "We all know the scene. Dorothy closes her eyes and repeats Good Witch's Mantra, " No coordinates exist like one's domicile, No coordinates exist like one's domicile, No coordinates exist like one's domicile". Only Dorothy doesn't say that. She says five one-syllable words, "There's no place like home". Each a word you've probably learned in your first year of speaking". "  - The Power of Simple Words.
