★I've started an internet project, where other parties participate to. And I'm looking for an efficient way to keep track (protocol) everything and create tasks just so we can collect all the data in one place and stay focused on our goal.  I've researched this and I only found approaches to this idea which weren't convincing, I can't believe there's not one go to solution, since it's something essential IMO, after all an internet company needs to handle its data and have a protocolled communication when working over a distance in a team. Do you guys have any recommendations?
I would advise you to opt for Microsoft Project Standard 2010 which gives you a new and easier way to manage projects. The software helps organizations reduce cost and drive efficiency through unified project and portfolio management. Microsoft Project Standard 2010 works more efficiently with the simple and intuitive Microsoft Fluent user interface—new graphical menus and a familiar experience provide the tools you need to plan and manage your project. http://www.microsoft.com/project...
