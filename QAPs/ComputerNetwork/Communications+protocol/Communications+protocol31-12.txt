â˜…How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
This doesn't strike me as a language problem so much as a personality problem. Why must you assume the role of word authority? Usage determines what words mean, and dictionaries catch up to usage soon afterwards.Let them be the authorities. Do your conversational partners appreciate your arguing with them about what they mean? I suspect not. Language is inherently ambiguous but people are usually not ambiguous without intent; they usually know what they mean and when people don't understand them they ask for clarification -- sometimes this devolves to talking about what individual words mean, but not usually. Why not just chill, observe a little, and see how other people deal with what they perceive as a lack of clarity? Ordinary conversation doesn't aspire to be precise; it's supposed to be fun.
