★How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
It's ok to remember and honor the past.  It usually does no harm to speak precisely and correctly.  And yopu should always write correctly.  But it's also important to embrace the future.  See Nick Andregg's linguistic take.  If you understand what the speaker means (because you're paying attention  to context & not getting stuck on individual words), then the usage  was not wrong.  Keep the conversation going.  Resist the urge to tangent  off to a new topic that no one else in the room cares about.
