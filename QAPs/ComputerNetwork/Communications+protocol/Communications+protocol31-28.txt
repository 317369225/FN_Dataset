★How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
My answer to this question is really a case of "Do as I say and not as I do".  Perhaps you need to pick your fights more carefully.  When you detect your intention to argue with someone ask yourself if it is really worth it.  Some times it is and some times it isn't.  It is impossible to agree with everyone all the time.  To do so you would have to contradict your own beliefs on a regular basis.  It is equally impossible to expect others to agree with you all the time. If you feel arguing over word or language choices is not worth the trouble then just don't do it.  On the other hand, if you feel a statement is too easy to misinterpret and the issue is important enough to warrant addressing then go ahead and get it on.  The problem here is deciding what is worth it.  If all that is at stake is a difference of opinion then it probably is better left alone.  If there is bodily injury in the mix then it is certainly worth attention.  Consider the question of driving through an intersection and hearing there are no cars coming from the right seat passenger who further goes on there is just a greyhound.  Well, is it a dog or a bus? I wish I was able to follow my own advice here.  I am always too ready to get into an argument.  I would prefer it if this were not the case.  I do much better in a written environment such as Quora than I do in person.  The written medium gives me time to reconsider my comments before transmitting them.
