★I've started an internet project, where other parties participate to. And I'm looking for an efficient way to keep track (protocol) everything and create tasks just so we can collect all the data in one place and stay focused on our goal.  I've researched this and I only found approaches to this idea which weren't convincing, I can't believe there's not one go to solution, since it's something essential IMO, after all an internet company needs to handle its data and have a protocolled communication when working over a distance in a team. Do you guys have any recommendations?
Figure out your process first, using basic office tools.  Then find a tool to digitize this for you. People who dive into a tool without understanding the underlying process often run into trouble because they don't understand their own hidden assumptions, and the tool doesn't understand them either.
