Programmer by profession since 1992. I'm so mentally tired after a 7-8 shift in front of a computer that I can't stand sitting on front of one when I get home. Therefore I do other activities to let my brain relax - whether consciously or unconsciously forcing my mind to relax and chill and keep computer-time to a minimum at home. I kind of like that.
