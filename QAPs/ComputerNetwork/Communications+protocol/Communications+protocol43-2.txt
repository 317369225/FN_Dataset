â˜…Why can no PC laptop match the touchpad of a Mac?Out of all the laptops I've tried, I end up getting disappointed with their touchpad: it's close to useless. I find this rather peculiar, since MacBook touchpads seem decent. Why isn't there any other (to my knowledge) laptops that have implemented a quality touchpad? It can't be that hard to make, can it?
Apple spent years developing the multitouch technology (both the hardware and software) for their trackpads before they released them, and patented a lot of the technologies which they developed, which they will not license as it obviously gives them a competitive advantage. There are lots of things they researched - the materials (type of glass and its thickness for the 'bendability' and 'give' for clicking whilst still remaining durable), texture, coatings, how and where the capacitative sensor grids are positioned, etc. to get exactly the right coefficient of friction and feel of the surface. They also charge more for their products to cover the higher materials and R&D costs, which most PC manufacturers are loathe to do - they have a different business model.
