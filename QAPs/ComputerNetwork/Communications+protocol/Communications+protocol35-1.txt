â˜…How is Stellar different from PayPal?
First, a couple similarities: Application: They are both digital wallets, i.e. they appear to be substitutive. But there is a difference - see the next section. Target market: They both target end-users (consumers, businesses) who want to send and receive payments.Some differences: Resources & experience: Stellar does not offer any of the technical infrastructure or human resources necessary to support a global payment service. PayPal employs about 15,000 people to manage all aspects of its technology and business operators concerning risk, fraud, compliance, payment processing, treasury, etc. Stellar is a foundation operated (today) by 12 people with limited payment experience. Market offering: PayPal offers consumers access to millions of PayPal-enabled and -verified merchants, and merchants access to hundreds of millions of PayPal-enabled and -verified consumers. Stellar offers some Facebook-verified individuals access to a digital wallet. Application: Stellar does not own any of its customers - it is just a catch-all wallet that nobody owns. In this respect, Stellar is not a valuable acquisition target since it has no real marketable assets.If I were PayPal, I would consider Stellar directly competitive, i.e. Stellar succeeds if PayPal customers switch away from PayPal to Stellar. That said, Stellar is as threatening to PayPal as any payments company started by people with limited payments experience.
