★Is the brain a meat computer?Can human tissue possibly generate electricity or electrical activity?  Is there any evidence of such?  Or is it all just source projecting physicality as expression?
Respectively: "Is the brain a meat computer?" Depends on your definition of "computer," I suppose. It's certainly not a Von Neumann architecture. "Can human tissue possibly generate electricity or electrical activity?" Yes. Brain tissue, for one, can. "Is there any evidence of such?" Well, Electroencephalography is a thing which works, so yes. "Or is it all just source projecting physicality as expression?" ...OK, you lost me here. I mean, I know what all these words mean individually, but all together it doesn't seem to make a coherent question.
