â˜…What protocol does HomeKit use to communicate with its devices?I know that HomeKit uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. I'd like to know more about how does it discover the devices over WiFi and what protocol does it use to communicate to them.
Apple has defined the HomeKit protocol. I feel even though it is proprietary and closed (access only available if you are part of their program) - it will do well given the opportunity it presents in terms of UX/UI integration. I am stating the obvious - control or monitoring of all things connected is through Smartphones and Tablets (not Web Pages). And HomeKit will enable that transition. In terms of protocol itself - it is their protocol mapped over HTTP/S with discovery leveraging Bonjour. The protocol messages between IOS and the HomeKit compliant devices use JSON (and hence JSON parsing would be required). Brad Nicholas below has defined the stack well. Harald Naumann Minor tweak - Philips Hue supports the HomeKit protocol. IP Devices or Bluetooth devices can support Apple HomeKit as you point out by adopting MFi. Most Wi-Fi chipsets are going to support compatibility with HomeKit. Their firmware will include it for product designers to use it directly. Miguel Ripoll Apple HomeKit uses Bonjour/mDNS for discovery of HomeKit devices and services similar to AirPlay. You could potentially use WireShark to snoop traffic especially the discovery service. For more experimentation you could get XCode running with HomeKit simulator and test it out. Ultimately to really understand it you will have to sign an NDA and be part of the MFi program.
