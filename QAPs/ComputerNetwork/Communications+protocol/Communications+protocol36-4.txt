â˜…What are some real life good habits that programming gives people?Inspired by What are some real-life bad habits that programming gives people?
Here is my small example. I got into the habit of breaking my code when I had to leave it. For example, when leaving work, I would just write a short comment, but not an actual programming comment, in the code I was working on. I mean, I would write something like 'starting kdtree implementation' but without the '//'. Then, when I came back to the project, even after a long time, I would try to compile and the IDE would take me directly to the error and I would remember where I was and what I was doing. Anyway, I started using the technique in daily life. I am nototriously absent minded, so I would do things like putting my keys in my shoes so as not to forget them (my keys, not my shoes), turning my watch upside down to remind me to remember something, laying hastily scrawled notes on my keyboard, etc.
