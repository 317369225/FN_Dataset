â˜…What's the communication protocol used by Slack?Is it XMPP? Or something else?
Connecting to Slack over IRC and XMPP "Slack offers an IRC and XMPP gateway for users who prefer to use a third-party messaging client." Note - while it offers these gateways, it's not clear that Slack itself uses this as the core protocol. I would assume it's proprietary, but I've never actually used Slack.
