★How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
Lawyers deal with this problem by asking the definition prior to engaging in a substantive argument.  So if someone says, "that man is evil," instead of arguing about the definition of "evil," a lawyer will ask, how do you define "evil," and then will argue whether the man fits the given definition.
