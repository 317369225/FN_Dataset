â˜…Can Bluetooth be applied for communication protocol between mobile and square like hardware card payment device?Will there be any security concern?
It depends what you're trying to achieve - NFC may be more appropriate: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nea... Consider in particular the range and communication setup time. If you're wanting a device to be within a few metres of your phone, and always connected (as opposed to connecting for each transaction), then Bluetooth may be the way to go. If you want to connect "instantly", and only when you're almost touching the device, then NFC will be better. That said, more devices have BlueTooth than NFC at present. Regarding security, it depends what you're trying to do. NFC often has a Secure Element associated with it, which can raise security by a few notches. But either way, you'll need to think about how the devices will initiated connection, what data is being transferred, and whether you trust the other software on the device (don't forget that mobile phones can install apps these days).
