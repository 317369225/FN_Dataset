★How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
I tend to be precise in my language and word choice, but I learned pretty early that getting into fights over words is usually fruitless... or worse, counterproductive. If someone I care about, to whatever degree, makes an error that is likely to cause them embarrassment in the future, I will privately offer a correction. If it's a common error, then I let it go: It's not my job to hold the ramparts against language change. Sometimes, my rule of thumb doesn't work. I had a boss at one point who frequently -- waay to frequently -- peppered his conversation with French phrases like "coup de grâce". Unfortunately, he mispronounced it: "coup de gras". Rather than the 'mercy strike' he intended, he ended up with 'hit with fat'. The problem was he was mispronouncing the phrase in front of very sophisticated, very prickly and precise people, including senior members of the British gov't and Foreign Office. They noticed and their surprise was followed by smirks. You could just hear, "Typical colonial rube" in their expressions. My quandary was to find a way to help him save face without losing face. I quietly, in his office, corrected him by using the correct pronunciation. I did this several times before realizing that it wasn't taking. I then, more bluntly, told him that he was a bit off on the pronunciation and what it should be. He thanked me. But then, he went along using his own pronunciation, the one he'd always used. What I earned for my efforts was nothing but a bunch of anxiety on my part. And you know what? The world didn't end; US-UK relations didn't falter.
