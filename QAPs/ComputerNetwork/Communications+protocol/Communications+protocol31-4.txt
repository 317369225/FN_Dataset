â˜…How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
Alert: Question has been edited post my answer. I used to be like you. Presumptuously(?) precise . I would ruthlessly point out the mistakes of others. For instance, my former self would have pointed out that in the phrasing of your sentence, you do not maintain tense continuity, jumping as you do, from the simple present to the continuous at "often trying to" as opposed to "causes me to get into". "I find myself often trying to" or "often try to" would have been more "precise". These kind of silly, base and fundamental grammatical errors really used to irk "non-native" me, especially when they come from someone who is ostensibly a native speaker. My consternation would know no bounds, my castigation, no bars. Somewhere along the line in my relatively short life of but 23 years, I have realized that that godforsaken, rather simplistic maxim is actually true: "If you can't beat em, join em", proviso I could append my own addendum to it, "and then beat em". Instead of arguing, be friendly, difficult as it may well be. Work from within and demolish those misconstrued shibboleths the laity erect in their use of the language. Apart from fostering a general bonhomie and pleasantry with "them", it also has the added teeny weeny bonus effect of making your own existence more peaceful. Hope this helps!
