â˜…How can I avoid nitpicking others' incorrect use of words?I like to be precise about the way I use language. This often causes me to get into numerous arguments with people about the meaning of the words they use and trying to clarify the casually ambiguous language they speak. How can I get myself to avoid this?
Take a job as an editor. First, you'll get paid to make people crazy. That's a huge win right there. But the real benefit is that your clients will exhaust you, and you won't have any energy left for these arguments in your social life. It worked for me.
