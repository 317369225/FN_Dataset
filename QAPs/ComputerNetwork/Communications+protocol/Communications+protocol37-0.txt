★Is the brain a meat computer?Can human tissue possibly generate electricity or electrical activity?  Is there any evidence of such?  Or is it all just source projecting physicality as expression?
Yes, it is. And we know it is, because we have already developed computer interfaces that can connect to a human brain. Some day, communication between a computer and a human brain will be as easy as communication between Windows and Mac.
