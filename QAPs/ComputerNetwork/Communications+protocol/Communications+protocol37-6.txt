★Is the brain a meat computer?Can human tissue possibly generate electricity or electrical activity?  Is there any evidence of such?  Or is it all just source projecting physicality as expression?
It has some simili es to a computer, but it's far more complicated and advanced than any computer we can build. So...I dunno... It might be a nerve tissue computer.
