Inspired from Rob Pike, Sometimes it takes no more than a few sentences, followed by an embarrassed "Never mind, I see what's wrong. Sorry to bother you." Such is modern computing: everything simple is made too complicated because it's easy to fiddle with; everything complicated stays complicated because it's hard to fix. Less is exponentially More. Break up the function. Use the language. Don't fight it. There is too much configuration. There is too much state. There are too many options. There are too many dot files. Stuff should just work.
