★I've started an internet project, where other parties participate to. And I'm looking for an efficient way to keep track (protocol) everything and create tasks just so we can collect all the data in one place and stay focused on our goal.  I've researched this and I only found approaches to this idea which weren't convincing, I can't believe there's not one go to solution, since it's something essential IMO, after all an internet company needs to handle its data and have a protocolled communication when working over a distance in a team. Do you guys have any recommendations?
Try Comindware Project (Comindware: Project Management Software) as it has the in-bulit socialnetworking feature where you can talk and all your conversations are stored and you can return to them any moment you wish. Besides, you can create, delegate and track tasks, deadlines etc.
