★Is it possible to build a radio frequency receiver for a specific band completely on an FPGA?For example the RTL2832 stick, is it possible to implement something similar using an FPGA? Which components the FPGA will not be able to accomplish their jobs? for example the ADC circuit will be on an external PCB, what else and why can't the FPGA implement it?
There is a project called XRadio, described in Xilinx Xcell Journal, Issue #84 http://www.xilinx.com/publicatio... ,   pages 29..33 The idea is that FPGA speeds are much faster than most of the FM or AM modulated signals. Therefore, it's possible just to connect antenna to FPGA pin, directly sample and subsequently process the signal. The article describes how to couple the antenna to FPGA pin.    Embed Quote
