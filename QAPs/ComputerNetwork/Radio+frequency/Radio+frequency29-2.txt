★Is it possible to build a radio frequency receiver for a specific band completely on an FPGA?For example the RTL2832 stick, is it possible to implement something similar using an FPGA? Which components the FPGA will not be able to accomplish their jobs? for example the ADC circuit will be on an external PCB, what else and why can't the FPGA implement it?
It depends on the kind of receiver performance required - noise figure, dynamic range, etc.  In general no, a single chip solution won't do it.  All of the analog front-end (AFE) section of the receiver is at least another chip.  In high performance applications, the low noise amp, mix down, analog conversion, filtering, and so on are discrete components.    Embed Quote
