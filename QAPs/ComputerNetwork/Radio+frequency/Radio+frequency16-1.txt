★Why do audio cables pick up radio frequencies when plugged into electric guitars?
Here's something I totally just copy/pasted from "BMGFan" elsewhere online (http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/f... /\/\/\/\WARNING SIMPLIFIED SCIENCE CONTENT!!!!/\/\/\/\ \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ *puts on his ham radio geek hat* An antenna is a piece of wire which receives the entire radio spectrum (from am radio all the way up to cellphone frequencies and beyond) it works best when for receiving when it is at a "resonant length" (although it can be close and still work) the lower the frequency the longer the antenna wire has to be.... (and vice versa) the LOOOOOOOOOONG wrapped wire of your pickups are probably pretty close to the resonant length of an am radio antenna, (your pickups have a lot in common with the am antenna in your pocket radio/clock radio/car stereo). that fact combined with poor shielding and the fact that you might live close to the transmitter means that you might hear the station coming through your amp in a very "muddy" fashion with the amp turned WAY up... /\/\/\/\END SCIENCE CONTENT/\/\/\/\ \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/    Embed Quote
