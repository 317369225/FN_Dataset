★In RFID technology, can receiver and transmitter work together to estimate the distance between them? If not what type of similar technology using Radio frequencies can enable this?
You can use RSSI.  Check your transponder datasheet to see if it supports RSSI.  In particular, I know that TI PaLFI devices (134 kHz ISO 18000-2) support RSSI, as do other devices in the 125 and 134 kHz bands.  I have to imagine that there are examples of HF (13.56 MHz) and UHF (~900 MHz) devices that support RSSI detection as well.  Many LF applications already use RSSI as means to approximate distance.    Embed Quote
