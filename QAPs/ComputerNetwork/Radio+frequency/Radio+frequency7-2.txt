★What bacteria, if any, produce radio frequency broadcasts? What research is being done in this area?I'm interested to know if people are researching either naturally occuring bio-radio transmission or involved in genetically engineering it.
I have no answer to this but I find it a very interesting question for my own reasons.  Why would there be a conspiracy involved?  It could be the source of some white noise.  If so it will be a very important consideration to the people at the square kilometre array going up in Western Australia. I would really like to know if there are any natural frequencies, other than basic black body emmisions, produced by bacteria in genersl    Embed Quote
