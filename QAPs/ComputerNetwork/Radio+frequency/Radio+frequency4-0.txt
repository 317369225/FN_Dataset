★Will quantum communication render radio frequencies obsolete as a means of communication?
Definitely not. A quantum communication channel is only required when you need to transfer quantum information, that is, the state of a quantum system -- with the simplest example being a qubit. Virtually all of the information we normally exchange, such as text, images, audio and video, is classical information, made of classical bits. This information is transferred over classical communication channels such as radio waves, phone lines, cable television, and of course the Internet. It is impractical to transmit classical information on quantum channels, and even if it were practical, there is absolutely no need to do so. One example where quantum communication is necessary is quantum key distribution, which is used in order to establish a shared encryption key between two parties. However, even in this case, once a key has been established, the two participating parties proceed to use a classical communication channel in order to transmit the actual encrypted information.    Embed Quote
