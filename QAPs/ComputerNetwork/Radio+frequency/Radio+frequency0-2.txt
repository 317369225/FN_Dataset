★Can lenses be built for radio frequency waves?Everyone is very familiar with the concept of a lens for visible light. What would the analogue be for radio waves? Besides satellite dishes, what objects are designed to manipulate radio waves the same way lenses manipulate light?
Yes, and there have been since about the 1940s and the growth of radar. Various plastics can be used to make the lenses, the plastics are transparent to the radio waves, but have a different index of refraction than air. This works the same way as optical lenses.  They are called microwave lenses. There are Fresnell lenses also. Lenses are most often used at microwave and radar frequencies in the GHz range. In the lower frequencies, the sizes become very large and impractical.http://www.rozendalassociates.co... Metal plate lenses -http://www.qsl.net/n1bwt/chap3.pdf    Embed Quote
