★What do you have to do to start broadcasting on a FM radio frequency in United Arab Emirates?Things like, bandwitdth charges, licencing and permits. How much does a basic system to take in calls cost. I think I will do the rest using software.
UAE is a federation, hence every emirate has their own regulations. In case of Dubai your best option is to set up in Dubai Media City necause they have broadcasting segment within their licensing framework. Set up is pretty easy, all u need is to pay licensing fees, activity fees, and required minimum capital to start up your business. In terms of frequency i would assume you need to contact the Ministry of Information and seek to obtain a frequency permit. Since all media is always monitored by government ypu must abide by sensoring rules.    Embed Quote
