★Who are the best speakers and/or experts on Near Field Communication (NFC) and/or Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)?
I would endorse Doug Yeager, and Tim Baker and since I know most of the others on this list, I guess, none of them would begrudge me citing Dave Holmes as really the best. David Holmes | LinkedIn Though there are many people out there who are pretty good too - if you'd have been at WIMA NFC USA 2012 : Welcome  lastweek you'd have met a bunch of them.
