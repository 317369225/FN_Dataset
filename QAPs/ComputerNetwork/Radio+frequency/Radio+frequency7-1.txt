★What bacteria, if any, produce radio frequency broadcasts? What research is being done in this area?I'm interested to know if people are researching either naturally occuring bio-radio transmission or involved in genetically engineering it.
I don't know of the exact nature of the electromagnetic spectrum, but certain fish have cells and organ tissues that generate and sense electromagnetic fields. How far is this type of energy from radio waves on the EM spectrum?    Embed Quote
