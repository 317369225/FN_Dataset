★Is it possible to mimic RFID (radio frequency identification) on a cellphone?Without including any extra chips and assuming there is not an RFID chip already present.  Could an iPhone replicate/replace an RFID chip just by using software? Even by just recording the frequency which the RFID chip "responds" with and replaying that.
If the phone supports NFC, then it can. One of the three modes of NFC is card emulation.    Embed Quote
