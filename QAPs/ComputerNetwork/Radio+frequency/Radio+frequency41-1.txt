★How hazardous is it if I live 10 feet from a radio frequency fields sign?
No hazard exists from the sign. The hazard is from the transmitter and that is only relational to the amount of EMF being generated. Do you have a meter to measure how much EMF is around you? The basic ones don't cost much.    Embed Quote
