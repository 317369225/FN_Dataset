★Can a radio frequency or an ultra high frequency travel in a vacuum?
When we refer to a 'Radio Frequency' we are actually referring to a Radio wave of a given frequency and wavelength. - Radio waves are Electromagnetic waves. - Electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum at the speed of light. The frequency of the wave times it's wavelength will equal a constant, that constant being the speed of light. Ultra high frequency Electromagnetic waves will also be able to travel through a vacuum however they will have shorter wavelengths when compared to Radio waves.    Embed Quote
