★What is the best resource/book/course to learn about RF (radio frequency) internals, details, and circuit design?
I recommend the Radio Amateur's Handbook from the ARRL.  It is carried by Fry's as well as Amazon. It has a lot of basic circuit theory, such as Ohm's Law, etc.  It has a wealth of RF related information, and further along in the book, many radio schematics, with parts lists and theory of operation.  It references many online sources as well.  I am a Ham radio operator, and not affiliated with the publisher of the book.  I buy one every other years, though.    Embed Quote
