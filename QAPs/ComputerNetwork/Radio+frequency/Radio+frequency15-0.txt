★How does a radio frequency keep the signals of a broadcast coherent?With the mind-bending amount of daily broadcasts from around the world, what stops them from becoming garbled?
Once upon a time (100ish years ago) with morse code that was a problem. But then they invented "frequencies" - each radio station sends its signal only on a different frequency, a different wavelength. That is done with tuning & filters (antennas of particulasr lengths, resonant circuits that amplify one frequency). The receiver then tunes to the frequency it wants (again, filters & resonant circuits) and filters out the others. When you car radio listens to 1100KHz or to 90.5MHz or ATT uses 1900MHz for a cellphone radio then the "Hz" is the frequency, that you are tuned to and the tuning filters out all the others (there arte lots of frequencies, but you only hear a narrow selection) There are a huge number of subtleties and cleverness added over the last 100 years but that fundamental basis is a constant:   Radios work on a unique frequency. (OK, smart alecs there is UWB but lets ignore that. The world has done)    Embed Quote
