★Is it possible to mimic RFID (radio frequency identification) on a cellphone?Without including any extra chips and assuming there is not an RFID chip already present.  Could an iPhone replicate/replace an RFID chip just by using software? Even by just recording the frequency which the RFID chip "responds" with and replaying that.
There are no antennas or radios in the iPhone capable of standard RFID communication.  (There are no iPhones with NFC at time of answering. Original questions asked specifically about iPhone.)    Embed Quote
