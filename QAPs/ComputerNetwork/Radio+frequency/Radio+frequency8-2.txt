★Can a radio frequency or an ultra high frequency travel in a vacuum?
Yes. Radio and UHF are terms we use to label bands of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation travels through space without the need for any medium. This means that it can, and does, travel in a vacuum. The light from the sun is an example. This is not intuitive, based on our observations of all other waves. For example, sound waves are pressure waves travelling through a medium, usually air. We used to think there was such a medium for EM waves, called the ether, but that was proven wrong by Michelson and Morley in the late 1800's using interferometry. Now we use that word to refer to a mysterious, physically inaccessible place. I'm sending this answer out into the ether.    Embed Quote
