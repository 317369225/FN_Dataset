★Can lenses be built for radio frequency waves?Everyone is very familiar with the concept of a lens for visible light. What would the analogue be for radio waves? Besides satellite dishes, what objects are designed to manipulate radio waves the same way lenses manipulate light?
There are other less exotic ways of doing this, but one interesting way to make a lens is to use metamaterials with a negative index of refraction. Here's a review article on the subject: http://hexagon.physics.wisc.edu/... I believe such metamaterials have been constructed for frequencies from MHz (sorry, can't find a citation) to visible frequencies (http://www.sciencemag.org/conten... ) with applications in making better antenna and improving resolution of MRI.    Embed Quote
