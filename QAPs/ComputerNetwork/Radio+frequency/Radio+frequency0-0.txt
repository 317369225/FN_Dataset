★Can lenses be built for radio frequency waves?Everyone is very familiar with the concept of a lens for visible light. What would the analogue be for radio waves? Besides satellite dishes, what objects are designed to manipulate radio waves the same way lenses manipulate light?
You can focus radio waves in your kitchen by making a Fresnel zone plate (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zon... ), at least for shorter wavelengths.  You just need to cut out concentric rings of aluminum foil with the right dimensions.  The spacing between rings is on the order of the wavelength of light, so obviously wavelengths in the mm to m range would be pretty easy, but km wavelengths would require a lot of foil.    Embed Quote
