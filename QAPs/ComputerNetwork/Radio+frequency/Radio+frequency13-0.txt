★What are easy radio frequency control projects with no programming or microcontrollers involved?Using easily available home items and a few inevitable IC's. I have an L293D, a few motors, HT12D/E( name not sure, it's IC for receiver and emitter of radio freq) And RF module of course... Not sure whether I should try a copter or a car. Minimum budget here and if possible with only these items :)
You could build a differential drive car with it. The L293D can be configured to make two H-bridges, so you can control two motors with it. Wire the motors observing the same polarity on the H-bridge. The HT12D/E is the encoder decoder module for the 433MHz radio  transeceivers and with the module itself you can send 4 bits of  information (the 4 LED's corresponding to the four buttons). These 4 bits have to be wired up to the H-bridge pins marked INPUT. After that, when you press the 4 buttons on the encoder-decoder module you can send the corresponding logic signal to the H-bridge via the receiver encoder-decoder module. Warning: if the H-bridge and the HT12D/E Receiver module don't share the same GND point, the logic signalling will not work. On the H-bridge (0,1) logic state on the input pin would mean one direction and (1,0) would mean the opposite direction. So if you want the motor to move forward, both H-bridges should receive on their inpits (0,1) (0,1) and to move backwards (1,0) (1,0). To turn requires changing the speed of one motor with respect to the other. If the right wheel spins faster (or left spins slower), the car will turn left and therefore the reverse case is also true. You don't have to change speeds, just stop pressing down on the buttons in the encode corresponding to one motor and the car will turn in the direction of that motor. A helicopter would be hard, and a helicopter without a gyroscope is almost a pain to fly. I would stick with the differential drive robot.    Embed Quote
