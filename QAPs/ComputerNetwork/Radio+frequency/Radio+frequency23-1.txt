★Given the issues surrounding net neutrality, can FM or AM radio frequencies be utilized to wirelessly transmit the Internet?
Any portion of the electromagnetic spectrum could technically be used for data transmission. In fact, some amateur radio enthusiasts have actually set up packet data networks in the shortwave band between the frequencies used for what we think of as AM and FM radio. A few of these networks can even be used to send email, chat, and other similar Internet functionality. The issue with these lower frequencies is that there is a technical limit to how fast you can send data over any particular frequency. The frequencies normally used for Internet are higher and can handle high speed connections while using less power. The lower frequencies can only support low speed connections. Additionally, the various worldwide governments have divided up, or allocated, the various parts of the spectrum to specific purposes. In order to transmit any radio frequency outside of the public ISM bands (such as WiFi uses), you must have a license. Some portions are free to use with the proper license, others are leased by the FCC or similar government entity. Leases for highly desirable portions of the spectrum are even auctioned by the government for very high prices.    Embed Quote
