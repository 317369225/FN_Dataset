★Is it possible to mimic RFID (radio frequency identification) on a cellphone?Without including any extra chips and assuming there is not an RFID chip already present.  Could an iPhone replicate/replace an RFID chip just by using software? Even by just recording the frequency which the RFID chip "responds" with and replaying that.
Nope - no RFID antenna / radio on any smartphone I know of. You can buy RFID devices that integrate with smartphone apps via their usb connector or bluetooth.    Embed Quote
