★Is there a device that can convert my computer audio (Mac iTunes) to radio frequency?
If it's truly a 1930s radio, it won't even HAVE FM reception, which didn't become common until almost 20 years later - you'll need an AM modulator, which is even more unusual these days. Don't waste more time on a technology which isn't usable to you (I just put era-appropriate cassettes in a replica radio that had a cassette slot. Wouldn't old radios be much more interesting if they played old radio programs?)    Embed Quote
