★What is the most commonly available tool that can measure & characterize the noise floor of the 2.4 GHz radio frequency band?
Connect an antenna that is operable at 2.4GHz to a spectrum analyzer and then time average a number of spectrum readings in your desired frequency band. This is what I would do for an engineering test. However, spectrum and network analyzers cost thousand of dollars. I am not familiar with wifi-related software tools, such as iStumbler, however, they may suffice if wifi is your main concern and you do not need a high degree of precision. Spectrum Analyzer: As others have already pointed out, this may be another cheaper (although not cheap) possible solution: Amazon.com: USB 2.4/5G Spectrum Analyzer with External Antenna By Metageek: Electronics    Embed Quote
