You'll find a lot of information, even a free low power fm radio frequency search and initial consultation at http://lpfmradio.org - There is a filing window slated for Spring/Summer 2013 - so you've picked the perfect time to get started.  The previous filing window was over ten years ago.    Embed Quote
