★Why do audio cables pick up radio frequencies when plugged into electric guitars?
It's probably a grounding problem with the cable OR the guitar. If the ground wire in an electric guitar isn't grounded properly (ie it came loose) it can cause the pickups to act like am radio receivers. If you still think it's the cable, take the ends off and check the soldering on the "ring" to see if you have a good ground connection.   I've also seen tube amps pick up radio frequencies and play the radio through themselves--without a guitar attached! Although this is rarer than it being a guitar, it's still a possibility.    Embed Quote
