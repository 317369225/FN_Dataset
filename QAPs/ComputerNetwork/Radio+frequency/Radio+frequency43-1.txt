★In RFID technology, can receiver and transmitter work together to estimate the distance between them? If not what type of similar technology using Radio frequencies can enable this?
Passive RFID tags can only be detected in a range of 2 metres. Active RFID tags can be detected from a bigger range but they need to be battery powered. In the world of football this technology is already applied while you need to know the distance to track football players on the field. Otherwise the whole application is useless.
