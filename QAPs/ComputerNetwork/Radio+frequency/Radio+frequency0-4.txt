★Can lenses be built for radio frequency waves?Everyone is very familiar with the concept of a lens for visible light. What would the analogue be for radio waves? Besides satellite dishes, what objects are designed to manipulate radio waves the same way lenses manipulate light?
In the usual sense, no you cannot "lense" radio waves.  Radio stations used for long-range high frequency communications use directional antennas.  This is done with directional or  "beam" antennas. See Wikipedia "Directional antenna" for more information. At microwave frequencies, different types of antennas are used, including "Horn" and "Dish" antennas, which focus a beam almost like a flashlight.    Embed Quote
