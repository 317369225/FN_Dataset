★What radio frequencies and forms of communication do modern day pirates use?
The Somali piracy thing is just about over. There have been no ships seized by Somali pirates in 2014. There are still pirates operating off of West Africa and the Singapore Straits, they tend to be pretty low tech, mostly smash and grab type of operations rather than holding ships for ransom. The communications equipment is pretty simple, VHF radios for most non-pirate type communications and cell phones when they want a little more privacy.    Embed Quote
