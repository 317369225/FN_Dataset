★Is it possible to build a radio frequency receiver for a specific band completely on an FPGA?For example the RTL2832 stick, is it possible to implement something similar using an FPGA? Which components the FPGA will not be able to accomplish their jobs? for example the ADC circuit will be on an external PCB, what else and why can't the FPGA implement it?
A lot depends on what specific band you're talking about and what kind of signals.  Generally, you'll need an ADC (or at least a thresholder.. many GPS receivers use just a single bit). So you'll need some sort of circuitry between the antenna and the FPGA.  But after that, sure, you can probably do anything you want entirely in FPGA.  It might not be the fastest, or lowest power, or smallest.    Embed Quote
