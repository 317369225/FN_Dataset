★Is IR the radio frequency ? Define.
IR (assuming you mean Infra Red) isn't normally thought of as 'Radio Frequency'. Of course you could contrive a 'radio' that works with IR - you can receive and transmit on it (as we see with IR control for toys and entertainment equipment). Radio Frequency (RF) is normally defined as being from about single digits of Hz to 300GHz. From there you have IR up to the visible light spectrum, then on to UV and beyond. Of course all of this is on the electromagnet spectrum, so it's essentially the same stuff, it's just the frequency and wavelength that have changed.    Embed Quote
