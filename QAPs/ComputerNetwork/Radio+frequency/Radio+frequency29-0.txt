★Is it possible to build a radio frequency receiver for a specific band completely on an FPGA?For example the RTL2832 stick, is it possible to implement something similar using an FPGA? Which components the FPGA will not be able to accomplish their jobs? for example the ADC circuit will be on an external PCB, what else and why can't the FPGA implement it?
I have seen very complex FPGA DVB-T2 decoders built to process everything on-board but the dev board cost $20k. I've also seen an $6 ASIC with 2x2GHz 10bit ADCs and multiple large DSPs for cable TV decoding. The biggest question really comes to which frequency you want, if you want all bands then the practicalities will necessitate more analogue components. At different bands you need different amplification and impedance matching. So while the radio itself and the ADC might be the same the input stages for each band will need to be customised. If you don't have extra compensation then you compromise the quality of reception, especially at HF and lower frequencies. in some circumstances you'll need more sample bits than others, so while you can get away with 8bits in some places you'll overall need high resolution ADCs. Perhaps with more bits and more ADCs you can apply software gain to pick out the signals but you are spending big money on ADCs when a carefully designed analogue circuit would do. Once in the FPGA the fact that you haven't specified an additional CPU core means some functions might be heavier on FPGA resources than they need be. I would suggest this is the strength of the Zynq FPGA with dual ARM cores on board. So, aside from some analogue equalisation, and LNAs, just an ADC and FPGA can do the job.    Embed Quote
