★How we can use radio frequency for distance measurement?
I think it's called radar. Or is it GPS.   ;-)) Seriously though that is one of the main purposes of radar systems, to give the military and commercial flight controllers information about where aircraft are. Using radio to measure distances in cluttered areas such as cities is very difficult since radio waves interact strongly with buildings, trees, cable etc, radio waves have quite a long wavelength so accurate measurement using radio reflections is impossible. The GPS system has its stations in orbit so interference due to buildings is minimised also GPS doesn't rely on the wavelength of the radio wave. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/G...    Embed Quote
