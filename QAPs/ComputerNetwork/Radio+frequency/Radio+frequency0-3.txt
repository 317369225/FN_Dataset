★Can lenses be built for radio frequency waves?Everyone is very familiar with the concept of a lens for visible light. What would the analogue be for radio waves? Besides satellite dishes, what objects are designed to manipulate radio waves the same way lenses manipulate light?
Shortwave radio uses the Earth's ionosphere to refract the signal, for what is called "skywave propagation".  This is what allows shortwave signals to exceed line-of-site.  In some cases the signal can "hop" several times, allowing reception of the signal on the opposite side of the globe.    Embed Quote
