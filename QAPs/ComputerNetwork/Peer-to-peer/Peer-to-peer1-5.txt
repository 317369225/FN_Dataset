★Is peer to peer insurance feasible?
The answer is yes, but not that easy. In today's peer-to-peer models, insurance policyholders form small groups online. A part of the insurance premiums paid flow into a group fund, the other part to the insurer. Minor damages to the insured policyholder are firstly paid out of this group fund. A group can be set up by the policyholders according to the Facebook principle. The only requirement is that all group members must have the same type of insurance. The peer-to-peer insurance concept carries no costs other than the special insurance.    Embed Quote
