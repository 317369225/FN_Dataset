★How big is the peer-to-peer office sharing market?Basically, how big is the market for Loosecubes? The company takes 10% of each transaction for creating a marketplace for renting out office space. I'd love to understand the size of the market. Thanks!
I'm going to quote an answer i gave in an interview ( Startup of the Week – Sharedesk the "Airbnb for workspaces"): The market potential is pretty huge. Look at Airbnb's success and try to imagine the total square meters of unused space that coworking spaces, private offices, SMEs and large corporations could potentially rent out. Then consider the constantly growing number of solo professionals and startups that need flexible office space. If you connect the two and add the “trust and community effect” that like-minded professionals could establish, you get the market potential of ShareDesk. Notice that i'm talking about "SMEs and large corporations" because that is what actually makes everybody see the actual market potential. This last part (SMEs and corporations entering the market) could be considered like some sort of "spinoff" of what loosecube's market looked like, but that is why new softwares are being built and how new market requests are being answered (see: ShareDesk Optix).    Embed Quote
