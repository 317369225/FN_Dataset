★How should peer-to-peer marketplaces deal with trust and safety issues?Here's an article about what various startups are doing to ensure safety for their users: http://t.co/HYmRnup5
This is a really great question, and the previous answerers have all provided excellent information. I tend to agree with Lauren Sherman’s response. Trust and safety procedures really depend on the marketplace. Not trying to advertise (too much), but over the past year, WePay has been beta-testing a ‘risk API’ where selected partners can send us information to be analyzed as risk signals by Veda, WePay’s risk engine. One of the hardest parts of this process has been standardizing (normalizing) the information that very different partners have sent. Some marketplaces weed out their bad apples with review systems, while some rely on a given user’s Facebook information. A marketplace’s ‘risk footprint’ is pretty unique. That being said, there is one relatively universal risk/fraud signal: the chargeback. Chargebacks can stand for a lot of things (good not received, service not rendered, fraudulent buyer, fraudulent seller, other buyer/seller dispute), but as they say, “where there’s smoke, there’s fire,” and chargebacks = smoke. Chargeback analysis won’t protect against all the black-swan-level safety events that marketplaces face, but to keep abreast of general trust issues, a marketplace needs to have insight into chargebacks. Things like the Airbnb vandalism might generate headlines, but problems like this can be much more deadly to a marketplace. Here, assuming only 50% of people charge back their original purchase, Kickstarter (or their payment processor, Amazon) stand to lose almost $100,000. That’s 2x Airbnb’s proposed insurance policy for its users.    Embed Quote
