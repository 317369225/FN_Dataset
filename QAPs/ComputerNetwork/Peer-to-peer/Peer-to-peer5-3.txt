★How do peer-to-peer money transfers work?I am curious about how Square, Venmo, PayPal etc. handle peer-to-peer payments. Do they transfer the money through their own merchant account? Or can they give order to make direct transfers (ACH for ex.) between two accounts on behalf of their owners?
In a peer-to-peer model like TransferWise, money a user is sending from their own country is rather swapped with money someone else in the same country is receiving, therefore saving money on the commission fees and rates. In practice, it is my understanding that this model is never fully 'peer to peer', as they need to make regular 'vertical' transfers between their own accounts to adjust for the currency needs.    Embed Quote
