★What are your experiences investing on the peer-to-peer lending site Prosper?Would be interested in getting a general understanding of your experiences and perhaps sharing your perception of the risk/reward trade off.
I currently hand pick loans from the high yield high risk categories where I believe there are some inefficiencies. I started investing in the beginning of 2011 (7 months ago) and am earning 21% y/y. Including currently late notes assuming they default I'm on track for roughly 18% y/y, which I suspect will fall further, but given that many of my loans are 5-7 months old, I believe I'm on track for at least 10-15% y/y returns. I have a bit over 160 loans in my portfolio, and am slowly building that up.    Embed Quote
