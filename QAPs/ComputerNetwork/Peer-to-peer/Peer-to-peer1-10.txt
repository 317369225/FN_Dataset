★Is peer to peer insurance feasible?
Yes, insurance in the peer to peer market place is possible, however it is also extremely difficult to obtain. A few of the major insurance carriers are watching the p2p space closely. The two companies who I feel broke ground for insurance in this space are RelayRides.com and Getaround.com.  It took our team about a year to secure an insurance partnership for Fun2Rent.com, and many times we wondered if it would ever be possible. If your business model anchors on insurance, the best advice I can give is research,  and learn how to manage all possible risks. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
