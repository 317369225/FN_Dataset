★How do you build a peer-to-peer payments system?Let's say you were building an app to help user groups collect dues payments. So you wanted the ability to let each group member put a card on file that would be charged monthly. Then the collected dues would be transferred into the treasurer's account, let's say. How do you do this on a technical level, a legal level, and an anti-fraud/money-laundering level? Is this even doable for a smaller application?
The compliance issues can be blockers. 1. Money Transmitter Licensing - Expensive to get and maintain 2. Money Laundering Prevention - Solution costs are manageable (OFAC/CIP), but sorting out what this means and your responsibilities is not trivial Technical aspects of collecting money, storing it, and moving it among users can be overcome with a variety of solutions. So, this may sound like a non-starter for a pre-funded startup or small application, but there are solutions out there.
