★Which insurance broker can help me insure a peer to peer online rental business?If I am connecting people to rent from each other. How can I buy an insurance policy to make sure the person renting out the equipment is protected? The equipment that would be rented would be home and garden products. A lawn mower, power tools, tables, power washers etc.
Well, for starters, I recommend learning from those who have successfully done it before**, and keeping your ear to the ground for new insurance-focused companies in the p2p space. Any insurance -- whether it is simple fraud protection, or collecting a premium to hedge against the downside risk of a complicated transaction -- requires the law of large numbers. As more and more similar cases happen, the data that determines the nature of the risk becomes more robust. This is basic actuarial science. It means that for an insurer, it's something of a race to the bottom (to the benefit of the consumer). Take car insurance. The leading insurers offer highly competitive insurance that is largely indistinguishable, one from the other. With the introduction of sensors and usage-based-insurance (UBI) the data is going to get better, led first by a few pioneers, and soon there will be a new norm. Over the course of this process, the cost of insurance for the consumer goes down. This will happen with p2p insurance as well. Follow the leaders. As I said in the beginning - there are p2p marketplaces that have comprehensive insurance today. And there will be more. This is a great personal and professional interest of mine. I'd love to connect with entrepreneurs who face these challenges, and underwriters who are interested in the type of risk! **Lyft, RelayRides, Scoot Networks, Getaround, AirbnB, to name a few.    Embed Quote
