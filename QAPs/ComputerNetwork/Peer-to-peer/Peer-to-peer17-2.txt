★What are the best simulators for a peer-to-peer system or distributed system?I'm trying to test the performance of a distributed protocol. So it would be better to if the simulator can focus on the processing of single nodes and hide the detail of node to node communication. Another way to put this is that I want to run the protocol in a simulated platform and collect the log. And then do performance analysis based on these log.
A2A If you want to measure performance, you need control of the network parameters. So I can see two main choices: Use a full-blown simulator like ns-2 or ns-3. I have only used the former (not much), and this will require you to write some C++ and some TCL. I think you can use Python with ns-3 instead of TCL. Run a bunch of Linux VMs with a virtual Ethernet network between them and use netem to simulate different networks. If you are in an academic setting it is probably better to go with the first solution. However if the implementation behind your protocol is complex the second solution may be better.    Embed Quote
