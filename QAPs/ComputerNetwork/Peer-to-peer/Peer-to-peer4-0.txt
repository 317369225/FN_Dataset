★What are your experiences investing on the peer-to-peer lending site Prosper?Would be interested in getting a general understanding of your experiences and perhaps sharing your perception of the risk/reward trade off.
I've worked at Prosper since early 2010, and I'd recommend that anyone looking for return information check out this page: http://www.prosper.com/welcome/m.... We update it quarterly, and it includes lots of stats about aggregate returns.* Lastly, all Prosper Notes are offered by Prospectus, which contains lots of interesting detail both about the Notes and the company and can be found here: http://www.prosper.com/prospectus/ * This answer is just my opinion. I don't speak for the company in any capacity. /////// Update (12/5/2012): It looks like http://Lendstats.com has stopped making lender-level statistics available, but http://Prosper-Stats.com looks to have started doing so. I'm not familiar with their methodology but didn't want to leave a dead link in my original answer. Also, we've just released a pretty cool new data file available here: Download Analysis Data - Prosper, some context for which we published on our blog: New Data Enhancements for Investors. Any returns through Prosper will come down to performance of the loans underlying the Notes in your portfolio - I'm hopeful that this new data format will help investors continue to make good decisions when investing.    Embed Quote
