Faircent is a pioneer in the field of Peer to peer lending in India. It aggregates borrowers and lenders on the site and let them transact directly.  It does not collect any money from either the borrower or the lenders. Contracts are directly signed between the borrower and lender and in turn Borrowers pay the money back directly into Lenders account.    Embed Quote
