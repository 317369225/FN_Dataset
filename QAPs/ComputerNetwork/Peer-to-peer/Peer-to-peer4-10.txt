★What are your experiences investing on the peer-to-peer lending site Prosper?Would be interested in getting a general understanding of your experiences and perhaps sharing your perception of the risk/reward trade off.
I started as an investor in 2006. I invested until the quiet period. After Prosper re-emerged, I continued to invest. To date, my return has only been 0.22%. If I had kept my money in a savings account all this time.... 1) I would have made more money, 2) my money would have been liquid, 3) I would have taken zero risk. So far, Prosper has been a dud, but I hope future returns will perform better than the past.    Embed Quote
