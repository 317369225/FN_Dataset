★What is the best payment solution for a peer-to-peer online marketplace?
I came across PoundPay (which seems to be Balanced Payments now) and BancBox. They look very promising, however, they don't seem to support either payouts to non-US individuals OR collect funds from non-US parties. A merchant account that allows you to collect the funds, cut off your commission and distribute the remainder through a payment gateway, either via international wire, check etc., seems to be the way to go for me (at least, for now). If you only collect money by using credit cards and only deposit money to US citizens, you could also look into Stripe Connect. You might also want to look into BancBox.    Embed Quote
