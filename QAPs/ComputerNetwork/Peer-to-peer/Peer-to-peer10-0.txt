★What is the best peer-to-peer desktop sync software?Like DropBox, but not cloud-based. It's okay if traffic goes through the internet, but I don't want my files ending up on a server somewhere. More importantly, I'm fine with paying for the software, but I don't want to pay for a service.
Unison is like a better version of rsync. It can handle potentially concurrent updates to the same file or directory, and is naturally cross-platform (with rsync you'll have to hunt around for a windows-only version, or get cygwin as well, or something similar): http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpier...    Embed Quote
