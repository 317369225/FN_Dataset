★What are your experiences investing on the peer-to-peer lending site Prosper?Would be interested in getting a general understanding of your experiences and perhaps sharing your perception of the risk/reward trade off.
Being from UK I have the least experience lending and sharing through Prosper. However, I would love to share certain thoughts on the concept of P2P lending. A shoot in the P2P lending has been a marked revolution of 2011. The year experienced evolution of many other P2P lending platforms both in USA and UK, out of which some had a bad fall and ended the service soon like Quakle. But there are certain P2P lending sites like Ratesetter, Yes-secure.com that have emerged over the year and is proudly serving its customers. I would appreciate if people here can share their experiences on the different P2P lending platform that will help us gather more knowledge on which platform to choose from while lending.    Embed Quote
