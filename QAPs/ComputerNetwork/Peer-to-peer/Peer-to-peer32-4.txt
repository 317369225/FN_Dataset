★What are the risks of investing in peer to peer lending sites like Lending Club or Prosper.com?
Lending Club and Prosper both have analyst that does risk management. If you blindly invest and be well diversified, the returns will beat any money market/CD today. The biggest risk in my opinion is the change in underwriting/model that Lending club or Prosper do to increase their volume and adjust to compete. The second biggest risk is the economy. A good proxy is the credit card charge off rates. When they spike, LC defaults will most likely spike as well.

Yes, liquidity is a risk if you need to pull your capital in a short time frame, but you already know the term before you invest... so arguably it is not a risk.
