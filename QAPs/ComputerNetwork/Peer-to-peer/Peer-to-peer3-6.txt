★What is the best payment solution for a peer-to-peer online marketplace?
The BancBox platform would allow you to build this flow. I see the funds moving in a few easy steps, something like this: Create a client (user) for User A - Use CreateClient API Create a client (user) for User B, create a bancbox account for that user (Settlement Account B) - Use CreateClient and OpenAccount API Use a collect funds API call to get payment from User A via ACH or Credit Card - Use CollectFunds(credit card or ACH) API Calculate the 10% and either use fee collect or book transfer from Settlement Account B to your fee and revenue account (which could be your local bank account or another bancbox account) Use SendFunds(Book Transfer) or CollectFee API Either allow User B to redeem funds from his/her Settlement Account B, or schedule an automated disbursement of funds (Payment Collected - (Payment Collected X .10)) using send funds API - Use SendFunds API So, 4 or 5 of the bancbox APIs would give you the funds flow you need, plus all of the ledger data so you can track payments (use GetAccountActivity) and serve them up in either your own reports or display to User B in your UI. CollectFunds supports ACH or Credit card to charge User A, SendFunds supports ACH, Paypal, Physical Check or Wire for disbursements to User B. You can collect your fees through any method, including book transfer. Hope this is helpful. You can check out the BancBox payment APIs at www.bancbox.com.    Embed Quote
