★Why does WhatsApp use a Client Server architecture instead of peer to peer?
It's actually fairly simple. There are a lot more reasons. But I can point out the main one: "Bob" can send "Alice" a message on Whatsapp, even though Alice is currently in a no reception area (an Elevator etc.) while Bob is. If you would do the same thing with skype, you would need both users to be connected at the same time or the message would never have been transferred or received. Unlike computers, Cellphones go in and out of reception areas (surprisingly) and sometimes disconnect or turn off.    Embed Quote
