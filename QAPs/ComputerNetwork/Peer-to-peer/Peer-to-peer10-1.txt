★What is the best peer-to-peer desktop sync software?Like DropBox, but not cloud-based. It's okay if traffic goes through the internet, but I don't want my files ending up on a server somewhere. More importantly, I'm fine with paying for the software, but I don't want to pay for a service.
The best at the moment (very new) is probably Bittorrent Sync. It works in every device you can imagine, is very very easy to setup, and is free.    Embed Quote
