★Where can we find international peer to peer lending sites?Recently, I have explored some options when it comes to investing money online. One that I've come across as holding plenty of promise and potential is peer to peer lending. However, sites like Prosper and Lending Club are exclusive to the US market. Where can I find similar services that offer the same attractive portfolio Internationally?
I've been trying https//btcjam.com for some months. It's a bitcoin based P2P lending site and seems to be working for me!    Embed Quote
