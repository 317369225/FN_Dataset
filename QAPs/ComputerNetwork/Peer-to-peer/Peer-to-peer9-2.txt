★How do you build a peer-to-peer payments system?Let's say you were building an app to help user groups collect dues payments. So you wanted the ability to let each group member put a card on file that would be charged monthly. Then the collected dues would be transferred into the treasurer's account, let's say. How do you do this on a technical level, a legal level, and an anti-fraud/money-laundering level? Is this even doable for a smaller application?
Though the question is very deep, here is a brief answer: On a legal level, this would constitute as a money transmitter business, so hence you would need a money transmitter license in 44 states (so far) that require you to be licensed for money transmitter services. You can see a list for example by PayPal here: https://www.paypal-media.com/sta... Here is a blog that I usually follow with regards to the legal aspects of money transmission business - http://www.perkinscoie.com/news/... (also view their publications list). Here is a good question that was asked on Quora on How hard is it to get a money transmitter license? You also want to pay attention to the FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Unit) - http://www.fincen.gov/financial_... - you will have to do checks/reporting like: SAR, CTR, AML, KYC, OFAC, etc. From a monetary processing angle, you would need a merchant account to process the card related transactions, especially cash advance transactions Depending on your model, you might also want ACH processing You also need to be careful not to be 'holding' money into any escrow account, as that would require a banking license if you are holding on to the deposits. On a Technical level, it is so nascent to describe, without having some detailed information about your payment processing (paying/receiving processes) and how you have modeled them.    Embed Quote
