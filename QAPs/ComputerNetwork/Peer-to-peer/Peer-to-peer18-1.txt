★What are the best peer-to-peer Q&A sites, and why?
Thanks for the point, Nemo. I'd also throw in there that the best answers typically come from the walled gardens. I'm a member of TeachingSells.com, ThirdTribeMarketing.com (former member) and SEOBook.com. There's something about knowing the others there are paying to be there ... establishes a level of trust. We add a layer of "experts" to the mix to guarantee some of the answers will be qualified, too. For free and public, though? I like Quora, Business.com and LinkedIn Answers. They all seem to work for me.    Embed Quote
