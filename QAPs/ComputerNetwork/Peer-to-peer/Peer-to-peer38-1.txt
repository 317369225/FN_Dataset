★Online Gambling: Is peer to peer betting legal in the United States?In particular, if you created a site that allowed for users to fund an account and then make wagers against their peers. Assuming the website takes no position or cut of the bet, is it illegal to facilitate this?
Although Governor-to-Governor betting is done openly, the peer-to-peer sites have been shut down. There was one from Canada, and more recently there was a kid in an entrepreneurship program that tried to start one up. At first it looked like no laws were being violated so his professors let him go ahead. Then the University's legal team got a whiff of it and advised the University to nix the project. Sorry I can't find a link to this story, which is from about three years ago. This is one of those cases where, in the U.S., the laws may not prohibit it, but the DOJ will not recognize any fine distinctions between gambling enterprises. In the higher circles of gambling bettors are often charged as bookmakers because when the Feds see lots of money involved they just assume it's within their right to crash into a gambling business--even if the principals are betting (not illegal except in I believe four states), not booking. I believe technically speaking, what they'd get you for is something like conspiracy to promote gambling. It would be the act of debiting Joe's account to credit Hal's that would be illegal.    Embed Quote
