★What are the best peer-to-peer learning sites?Pros, cons, etc.
A similar site to Quora, with more constrains on what sort of questions you can ask (and heavier moderation) is ask.metafilter.com. I've been a member for years and have gotten a lot out of the community. It's actually nice being a member there and here, as the missies overlap but aren't exactly the same. Questions asked on askme, as the site is known by members, lean a bit more towards the practical and definitely answerable than they do here (that's not a criticism of Quora). For instance, you could ask "How does it feel" questions here, but you probably couldn't get it away with it there. AskMe is better for "What's the best way to peel onions?" and "What's a good book on early Roman history?" questions. The site costs $5 -- a single-time fee -- to join (it's free to read, but you can't post without paying the fee), which is meant to be a hurdle to trolls. http://ask.metafilter.com/    Embed Quote
