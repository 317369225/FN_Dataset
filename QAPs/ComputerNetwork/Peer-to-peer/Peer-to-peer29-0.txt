★Singapore: Are there any peer-to-peer lending companies in Singapore?According to this article (Crowdlending service to match small firms with lenders), there is sort of one in Singapore: Moolahsense. However, it is set up for crowdlending to small firms. I am more interested in knowing about which lending and borrowing between individuals, like in the US where firms like Prosper and Lending Tree have long provided such services to consumers.
There are a couple of other P2P lending platforms in Singapore, but none that lend to individuals due to strict moneylending laws. 1. Capital Match - loans to Singapore SMEs - website: Capital Match - SME Loans - Peer-to-peer lending 2.
