Every P2P marketplace deals with trust and safety issues differently. At TaskRabbit trust and safety are our number one priority. Each TaskRabbit goes through our four step application process, which includes a video screening and a multi-step national background check. We're all about transparency. TaskRabbits and TaskPosters use their real identities online, so everyone knows who they're dealing with. TaskRabbits are also reviewed and rated on the Tasks they complete.    Embed Quote
