★Is there a peer to peer lending ETF?
Not at the moment, or least not that I could find on my trading platform. Funding Circle (a peer-to-small-business focused lending platform) compares it's APY rates to the following, Dow Jones Corporate Bond Index (INDEXDJX:DJCBP, Dow Jones Equal Weight U.S. Issued Corporate Bond Index) Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (NYSEARCA:BND, Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF) Vanguard Corporate Short Term Bond ETF (NASDAQ:VCSH, Vanguard Short Term Corporate Bond ETF) Vanguard Short Term Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:BSV, Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF)    Embed Quote
