★Are there disruptive peer to peer payment services like Dwolla in China?This question is in regards to the Chinese market and looking for alternatives to AliPay etc.
There is a global payment network to keep an eye on.  Bitcoins are an online digital currency that operates globally, even within China. Bitcoins can be sent peer-to-peer using a mobile, tablet, or from Windows/Mac/Linux and there funds can even be sent with third party services, such as through Twitter ( http://BTCTip.com ) and Facebook ( https://blockchain.info/wallet/s... ).  Because Bitcoin is just software (and technically, just a protocol), there is no limitation as to how it can be used.  There likely will be a wallet service that allows bitcoin payments through QQ even. It takes just seconds to set up and use Bitcoin thanks to their party, hosted services.  Here's a guide that gives instruction how to set up a Bitcoin wallet, how to receive a tiny sample of bitcoins and using that sample, how to transact on the Bitcoin network.  - http://www.bitcoinmoney.com/post...    Embed Quote
