★What is peer-to-peer lending?
Peer to peer lending is, at its most basic level, pooling investments from individuals (or entities) and lending it out to other individuals (or entities). The scope of peer to peer lending is growing quickly over time. Companies with new approaches and value propositions have flooded the market as the industry has gathered steam. The earliest (and largest) peer to peer lenders have the simple value proposition: pooling resources from individual investors, who weren't getting a good return on their bank deposits, and lending them out to borrowers, who faced steep credit card APRs. Examples include Lending Club (http://www.lendingclub.com) and Prosper (http://www.prosper.com) Of course, now these services lend to and raise capital from entities as well, and their loans cover a much broader range of uses. The next wave of innovation in the space focused on loans to businesses (sometimes called peer to business loans.) Funding Circle (http://www.fundingcircle.com) was the earliest company to develop this lending model. This model has also expanded to other products such as commercial real estate loans. Now, emerging and incumbent companies have developed a variety of peer to peer models: Real estate lending is very popular (see Fundrise http://www.fundrise.com, Money360 http://www.money360.com, or Realty Mogul http://www.realtymogul.com) There are peer to peer lenders for solar installations (Mosaic https://joinmosaic.com) Education peer lenders (SoFi http://www.sofi.com and CommonBond https://commonbond.co) Healthcare loans (PeerForm https://www.peerform.com and Springstone, acquired by Lending Club https://secure.springstoneplan.com)There are now a number of servicers, software providers, white-label platforms, secondary markets, and other players who are approaching the market from new angles. Expect to see this space continue to evolve quickly over time.    Embed Quote
