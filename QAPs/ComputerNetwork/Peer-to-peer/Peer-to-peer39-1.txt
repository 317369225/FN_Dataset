★Are there any big peer to peer or collaborative consumption marketplaces in China?
answer is from http://www.chinatech.us/are-ther... here’s a list of chinese  p2p or collaborative consumption marketplace web sites,first 3 are all craiglist style sites: 1. http://www.ganji.com 2. http://www.baixing.com 3. http://www.58.com 4. http://www.douban.com/location overall, i do not think this p2p market in china is big so far; there’re many small markets in this category, 1. say, in big universities’ bbs, there’s usually a board named 2nd market, where students will exchange textbooks and other things; 2. in many local community sites, there are also such board that will facilitate the p2p market; but maybe now (2011) it’s going to be big soon.    Embed Quote
