★Is peer to peer insurance feasible?
Peer-to-peer was the original model of the insurance world. Mutuals were formed by firefighters, farmers and other to share in their losses and gains. Its almost a peer-with-peer model since you are joining together to insurance against a risk and diversify that risk amongst a group, rather than having one person transfer the risk to another. The peer-to-peer model that is successfully disrupting lending led by Lending Club and others is more difficult to apply to insurance. The problem the assymetry of insurance payoffs. In a loan the lending party can only lose the amount they've loaned, and can get a reasonable rate of return. This isn't possible in insurance. As an example, for life insurance, a healthy 40 year old might pay $30 a month for a policy with $500,000. This means the individual issuing the insurance earns less than .1% of their potential losses. This model only works when you have a huge pool of lifes you are insuring so that you can make money on average and be insulated against outliers.    Embed Quote
