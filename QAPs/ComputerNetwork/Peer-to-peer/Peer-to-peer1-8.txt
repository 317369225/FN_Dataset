★Is peer to peer insurance feasible?
P2P insurance works best when the group of peers align on certain concepts or worldviews. For example while I am not a Christian, I know several P2P Christian insurance groups that have done extremely well in this space. They have found a group of like minded individuals whose ethical worldview compels them to be honest, loving, and care about the group. P2P insurance would never work IMO for a large group of divirse folks. Some would naturally exploit the system more and some less based on their worldview and how they view sickness and healthy living. Just think about this, some religious groups don't even believe in going to the doctor unless it's live of death. You think the instance of using over the counter RX drugs is higher or lower than norm in Buddhists?    Embed Quote
