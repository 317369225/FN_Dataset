★What are the best simulators for a peer-to-peer system or distributed system?I'm trying to test the performance of a distributed protocol. So it would be better to if the simulator can focus on the processing of single nodes and hide the detail of node to node communication. Another way to put this is that I want to run the protocol in a simulated platform and collect the log. And then do performance analysis based on these log.
It sounds like you want performance data. That implies to me that you really just want to run the system, not simulate much of anything. If there are particular aspects of the networking or the computer you want to control, I'd look at setting up a framework with KVM and software routers. That's the solution I last saw in use for simulation of a full system, rather than just testing some algorithm.    Embed Quote
