GetMyBoat Who We Are: GetMyBoat is the world’s largest peer-to-peer and boat charter rental platform.  As one of the new entrants to the sharing economy, and a startup, GetMyBoat connects boats with people that want to rent them. With 9,600 boats in over 750+ global locations, GetMyBoat is getting enormously positive reception. What We Do: Similar to Uber for cars or VRBO for houses, GetMyBoat connects boat owners who want to make greater use of their [little used] boat and renters who don’t want the cost or headache of owning their own by providing an easy to use, safe, online marketplace to rent their dream watercraft. Our team is small, but our vision is big. We want to bring boating to more people while creating a way for boat owners to make rental income on their unused assets. Check us out!    Embed Quote
