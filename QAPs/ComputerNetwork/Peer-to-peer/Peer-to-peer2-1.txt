★What are the best peer-to-peer learning sites?Pros, cons, etc.
Peer to Peer U (http://p2pu.org/en/groups/html-i...) seems sort of like a wiki plus learning tasks on a given subject. Skill Share (http://www.skillshare.com) is trying to get regular people to setup classes on topics they know about. For example, if you know about cooking you could teach a class on it and use skillshare to organize. Betterfly (http://betterfly.com) is trying to setup a craigslist-style marketplace of amateur/pro teachers.    Embed Quote
