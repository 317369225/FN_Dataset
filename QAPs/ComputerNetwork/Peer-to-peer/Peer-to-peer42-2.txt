★Which insurance broker can help me insure a peer to peer online rental business?If I am connecting people to rent from each other. How can I buy an insurance policy to make sure the person renting out the equipment is protected? The equipment that would be rented would be home and garden products. A lawn mower, power tools, tables, power washers etc.
The answer depends on what type of equipment you're looking to rent. There are companies specializing in construction equipment, camera and film equipment, medical equipment, etc. The question you *should* be asking is if it's possible to find coverage based on your business model. Knowing names of carriers doesn't help you much because many of them don't sell to insureds directly. You'd be best served by enlisting the help of an experienced independent broker who knows what questions to ask and how to help guide you towards the most appropriate coverage. As far as expediting peer-to-peer rentals, that's a different story. While I imagine that's possible to insure, the concern would be the number of separate parties involved, managing care, custody, and control over said equipment, and valuation should something be lost or damaged.    Embed Quote
