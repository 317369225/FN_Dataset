★What are the risks of investing in peer to peer lending sites like Lending Club or Prosper.com?
The biggest risk with both Lending Club and Prosper is borrower defaults. These loans are unsecured so if a borrower declares bankruptcy then you will most likely lose whatever money you invested with that borrower. Or the borrower may simply stop paying back the loan for any number of reasons. Having said that, you can mitigate this risk by spreading your investments over a large number of borrowers. I try to keep my investments in each loan to the $25 minimum, so this way if any loan defaults you will only lose a small amount. There is a secondary risk that needs mentioning. Both Lending Club and Prosper are relatively new companies and they are not turning a profit yet. It is unclear what the ramifications would be if one of them went out of business. Having said all that, I have been a p2p lending investor for over 18 months now and I am delighted with the returns. I have made some mistakes but I have learned a great deal and I now expect returns north of 10% going forward.    Embed Quote
