★Which are some successful peer to peer lending business models in India and how do they work?I want to know what are some startups working in the peer to peer lending area in which people can get loans without going through an intermediary or the bank.How do they work and what are the challenges here ?
You can find a comprehensive list of peer-to-peer startups for different countries in a publication called "The Future of Peer-to-Peer Finance" - it's available online for free on SSRN or Google. Hope this helps. Here's the link: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_d...    Embed Quote
