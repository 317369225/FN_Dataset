★Will W3C's initiative "RTCWEB" encourage peer-to-peer services on the browser?W3C is currently chartering Real-time Communication using the WEB (http://www.w3.org/2010/12/webrtc...). The charter hopes to define the uses of <device> tag (new in HTML5) for enabling webcams, mics etc but also recommends peer-to-peer capability to make real-time communication easier.
The RTCWeb draft explicitly mentions API functions for establishing direct peer-to-peer connections between Web browsers, including firewall/NAT traversal. This would in principle enable peer-to-peer services on the browser. For many P2P applications (e.g. file sharing, p2p search, p2p telephony) there remains a problem though, that a Web browser is not permanently running in the background, thus limiting the average uptime of a peer. This increases the required redundancy and decreases the efficiency of a p2p network. This could also decrease the availability / completeness of results or the  reachability of communication partners.   An integration of a P2P layer into the OS or network stack would be a more universal solution.    Embed Quote
