★Is peer to peer insurance feasible?
It does exist -- see Peer-to-peer insurance. In the example given (as of 16-Feb-15), the regular insurer actually acts as a re-insurer with a per-risk excess-loss treaty. As Mike Paulus wrote in his answer, "peer-to-peer" insurance reminds of the model of Mutuals. Originally (see History of insurance), traders -- especially by sea -- shared the risk of seeing their wares stolen or lost. Actually, the modern incorporation of companies and the trading of shares comes from a similar idea: split the value of 10 ships (incl. wares) into 10 shares each -- it is less risky to have one share of each rather the full 10 shares of one single ship. IIRC, it dates from the Italian and Flemish renaissances. The farmers fire and crop insurance -- as well as the firefighters mutuals -- are the first mutuals in the USA.    Embed Quote
