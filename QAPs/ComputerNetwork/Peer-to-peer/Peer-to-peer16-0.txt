★Where can we find international peer to peer lending sites?Recently, I have explored some options when it comes to investing money online. One that I've come across as holding plenty of promise and potential is peer to peer lending. However, sites like Prosper and Lending Club are exclusive to the US market. Where can I find similar services that offer the same attractive portfolio Internationally?
At your fellow Quoran Mark Harrison for example. He runs technology for Peer to Business lending company FundingKnight in the UK.    Embed Quote
