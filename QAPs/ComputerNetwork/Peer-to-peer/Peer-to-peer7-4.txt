★Is the peer-to-peer lending category worth investing in?
Peer to Peer Lending is the 800 pound gorilla in the room. When consumers realize they can bypass banks, which offer terrible service, and instead get loans funded directly from others at lower interest rates, they will flee traditional banking. And, there will be no short-term solutions for banks, who won't be able to shed their high cost structure and respond without decimating profits. P2P Lending is a great opportunity for investors as well, who can diversify assets from the market and invest directly in others at high rates of interest. Liquidity is better than many other bonds.    Embed Quote
