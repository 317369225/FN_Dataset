★Is the peer-to-peer lending category worth investing in?
Why not? It's just a new investment vehicle based on CrowdFunding. You can do your own due diligence and manage your own portfolio risk. Furthermore, after a bumpy start, Peer-to-peer lending companies are implementing policies to reduce default rate. Prosper (P2P lending) has improved their default rate immensely since its years from 2006-2008.    Embed Quote
