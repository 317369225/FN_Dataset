★What are some of the peer-to-peer consumer startups?This is a follow-up to a TechCrunch article "The P2P Evolution" to try and crowdsource all P2P startups: tcrn.ch/lV9Hiz
I have just launched Wishcan (http://www.wishcan.com). Wishcan is a C2C, P2P marketplace where you could ask for help and advice on anything: goods, services, or information. You just need to say what you want, what you will pay or trade, and when you want it by. You can then use your social network to broadcast your request. Any user can bid on your open requests. In fact, we hope to extend the concept of Quora into everyday requests for goods, services, or information.    Embed Quote
