★What are the best simulators for a peer-to-peer system or distributed system?I'm trying to test the performance of a distributed protocol. So it would be better to if the simulator can focus on the processing of single nodes and hide the detail of node to node communication. Another way to put this is that I want to run the protocol in a simulated platform and collect the log. And then do performance analysis based on these log.
If you are measuring performance the best would be to do a real analysis rather a simulation. Anyway, it'd be helpful if you could elaborate a bit on your question as to what's the protocol and what you meant by "processing of single nodes"    Embed Quote
