★Is the peer-to-peer lending category worth investing in?
P2P lending is, in my view, a fantastic innovation. It is giving borrowers better borrowing rates with funds more accesible and faster to obtain. Also, it is giving savers better savings rates and something to do with their spare time. The real danger though is that in the UK none of these companies are regulated. Whilst all of the current market participants seem to be fairly sound, it will only be a matter of time before a 'Madeoff' type manager sees an opportunity to accumulate investors money and use it for their own purposes. One thing the traditional banks do have is centuries of experience in ensuring that bank employees and owners are not syphoning off savers money into their own pockets. I hope that the goverment see this risk and move to regulate before it is too late. In the case of funding circle, they are filling a gap in vital capital to SMEs in the UK that the banks are simply not providing.    Embed Quote
