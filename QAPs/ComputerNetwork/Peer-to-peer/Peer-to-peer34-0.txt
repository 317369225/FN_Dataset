★Will W3C's initiative "RTCWEB" encourage peer-to-peer services on the browser?W3C is currently chartering Real-time Communication using the WEB (http://www.w3.org/2010/12/webrtc...). The charter hopes to define the uses of <device> tag (new in HTML5) for enabling webcams, mics etc but also recommends peer-to-peer capability to make real-time communication easier.
It sure would be nice to have direct peer connections within the web browser, the problem is designing a protocol which only lets web browsers behind a firewall speak to other web browsers coming from the same service. A properly designed minimal layer on top of the TCP/UDP could make this happen, but I haven't seen any serious proposals along those lines.    Embed Quote
