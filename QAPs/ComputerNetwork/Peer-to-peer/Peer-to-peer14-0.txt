★How can I make a peer to peer file sharing program?
Even though question is a little broad I will try to give you a path so that you can accomplish your goal. Context information First of all you have to know how peer-to-peer connection works. I think this is the most crucial part of the design process. Know how tcp and udp works and their differences. What are the gotchas of connectionless protocol? How messaging works between clients, ACK's ? Pick up some computer network book most of them touch these subjects broadly. [1] Language Now you have the context information about what you are building. Most of the programming languages have broad networking libraries builtin. So considering you are using java you dont need any extra libraries other than jdk to built entire p2p program. [2] Design Start program with the simplest features. What are the minimum requirements that your program need ? Keep the gui away from program until you succesfully distribute one file to peers. You can add gui later cause it may bloat your code for a while at first. Testing One thing I learned while developing network programs that you absolutely do your test on different machines. Do not just run mutliple instances of your code to mimic the clients or client/server. You may never know what you will hit even in the smallest home network.
