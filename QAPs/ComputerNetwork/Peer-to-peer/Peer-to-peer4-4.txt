★What are your experiences investing on the peer-to-peer lending site Prosper?Would be interested in getting a general understanding of your experiences and perhaps sharing your perception of the risk/reward trade off.
The experiences of investing on Prosper Marketplace vary depending on the years of participation. From 2006 to 2008, many investors lost money due to a high borrower default rate. According to Prospers.org users, the risk evaluation model was not accurate: they had an auction model where investors bid down the interest rate they were willing to pay. However, the casual investor might have often bid down the interest rate to misrepresent the risk. Many "A-grade" and "B-grade" loans surprisingly defaulted. I hear they are doing much better now. Some investors, such as KenL, assesses that he has over 20% ROR on Prosper.org. Here is a link to his blog article http://lendstats.com/wordpress/?...
