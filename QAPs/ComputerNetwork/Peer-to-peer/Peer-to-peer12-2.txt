★What is peer-to-peer lending?
From wikipedia, peer-to-peer lending "is the practice of lending money to unrelated individuals, or "peers", without going through a traditional financial intermediary such as a bank or other traditional financial institution." It has become increasing popular in the past five or so years since borrowers can get access to loans that either (1) are less expensive or (2) would be otherwise impossible to obtain from large financial instructions. The SEC still regulates Peer-to-Peer lending intuitions (summary of such regulations, THE REGULATION OF PEER-TO-PEER LENDING, Manbeck and Hu on aba.com) Lending Club and Prosper are two major peer-to-peer platforms.    Embed Quote
