★How do you build a peer-to-peer payments system?Let's say you were building an app to help user groups collect dues payments. So you wanted the ability to let each group member put a card on file that would be charged monthly. Then the collected dues would be transferred into the treasurer's account, let's say. How do you do this on a technical level, a legal level, and an anti-fraud/money-laundering level? Is this even doable for a smaller application?
WePay.com lets you do most of what you want to do quickly and easily. They are PCI compliant etc. I dont work for them put I did review them for my application. The only downside is that they require the payee to be in the US. Give them a call - I found them to be very responsive.    Embed Quote
