★Why does WhatsApp use a Client Server architecture instead of peer to peer?
Theres a nice thread on Hacker News that explains why most apps don't use peer to peer architecture. Ask HN: Why don't more apps use peer to peer networking? Secondly, apart from whatever we know about WhatsApp architecture I feel that in some scenarios they might be using peer to peer architecture. For ex: when you are communicating one on one with your contact and both of you are online. Theres no reason to send a message to server and then to pass it to other client when sending client knows that other is online and actively participating. With this little trick they can get a major cut in delivery time plus at whatsApp scale a reduced server load.    Embed Quote
