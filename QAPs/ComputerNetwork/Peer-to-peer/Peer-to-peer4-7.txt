★What are your experiences investing on the peer-to-peer lending site Prosper?Would be interested in getting a general understanding of your experiences and perhaps sharing your perception of the risk/reward trade off.
I am a former Prosper employee so I have insider facts and my opinion is completely independent.  I would absolutely invest in the Prosper platform and I do.  For the last 20 months I have been averaging about an 18% annual return. (I like the "E" rated loans.) Prosper had lots of problems pre-2008.  Returns were not good.  Fortunately, I was not an investor.  In July 2009, they got approved by the SEC, came out of the quiet-period, and hired Jim Catlin, who is their EVP of Risk Management.  He has helped to turn the company around in terms of investor returns.  Since then they have averaged a bit over 10% annual returns for investors. The key to the business is risk analysis and Prosper seems to have that down pat. Banks have been successfully making unsecured loans for many years.  They cover two sides of the equation, underwriting (risk analysis) and supplying the funds.  Prosper is doing the underwriting but letting people like you and me supply the funds, take the risk and get the returns.  It works.
