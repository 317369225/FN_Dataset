★What are the best (free) Peer to Peer lending scripts / software?
There are a few technology providers who build and sell open-source peer to peer lending software. This software can be used to replicate the basic structure of a peer to peer lending platform. However, a major caveat is that peer to peer lending requires much more than just the script on which the marketplace is built: depending on context, there are a host of financial, regulatory, and operational hurdles that are much more important to the viability of a peer to peer lending platform than the "script" or "software" it's built on. Zidisha, a peer to peer microfinance website, recently released all their code in an effort to become open source and provide more transparency and insight to their partners. (Zidisha is now open source) Cloud Lending Solutions (Peer to Peer Lending Software | Marketplace Lending Software | Cloud Lending) offers a marketplace lending software solution (albeit not a free one - it's rather expensive) for parties looking to build their own platform. Some companies in the space also license their own software, as noted by P2P-Banking.com (P2P Lending Software) This is an often expensive solution, as mentioned in the article, with pricing running in the $100,000's. A few companies have recently emerged in the space with "white label" solutions to help companies and banks quickly launch their own peer to peer lending platforms, such as Mirador Financial (Mirador Financial) or Insikt (Insikt Introduces Lending As A Service For Brands) Again, though, this technology is relatively new and can come at a steep price.    Embed Quote
