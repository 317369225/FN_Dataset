★Why doesn't Valve adopt a Peer-to-Peer method of distributing Steam games?
They have the server capacity to handle serving games. This also makes it so that users are more likely to purchase games, due to not having to worry about upload bandwidth caps or P2P distribution blocking. In short, it is easier to run their own content servers rather than also code in P2P functionality, which still would require them to run some content servers. In addition, any P2P functionality would have to be turned off once the content has finished downloading, as games may require access to edit their own files, which would make them not match up with the source content. It would take a lot of effort to code something like that, especially when compared to simply using your CDNs to distribute content rather than rely on end users' piddly upload bandwidth.    Embed Quote
