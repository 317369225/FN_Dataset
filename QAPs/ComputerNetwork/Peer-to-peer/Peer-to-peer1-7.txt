★Is peer to peer insurance feasible?
Actually I think peer to peer insurance may face a significant barrier that could prevent it from being a success even within the deductible. That is that the anonymity in the process provided by larger insurance firms is valuable. Valuable for the claimant in that their privacy is retained. You can imagine a degree of privacy is possible amongst a group of peers if the process is well-managed but ultimately a large claim would go noticed and people would talk. The anonymity is also essential to the value of the policy to the insured. If you know that your claim will reduce your friends' capital, you may be reluctant to claim even when you have a valid reason, and the value of the policy is eroded as a result. I'm not 100pc familiar with the peer to peer models and wonder if this can be easily overcome?    Embed Quote
