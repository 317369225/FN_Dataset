★What are the best peer-to-peer learning sites?Pros, cons, etc.
At the risk of stating the obvious and appearing obsequious to the team in Palo Alto, I'd say Quora is one of the best peer-to-peer learning sites. It's a place where learning starts with questions, but the learning on Quora doesn't just end with answers, because answers on the site often lead me to probe deeper or inspire me to search for or write new questions I'd never thought of. There are some topics or questions for which I feel I have a unique perspective, and it's nice to share what I know with others. Sensing the limits of what I know on many other topics, I am constantly searching the site to benefit from the wisdom of the Quora crowd. I see other users as peers, in spite of our varying experiences and degrees of expertise, because we share a thirst for knowledge and want to be a part of a community that values collaborative learning. I think that as time goes on, as the number of users on the site increases, and as the body of knowledge on the site expands, the benefits of participating on Quora will grow and become more apparent than they already are today.    Embed Quote
