★What are your experiences investing on the peer-to-peer lending site Prosper?Would be interested in getting a general understanding of your experiences and perhaps sharing your perception of the risk/reward trade off.
I've been with Prosper since I first heard about it in 2006. I don't think that anyone disputes that the first couple of years were rocky. I very much liked the idea of lending to people based on their stories, so I ended up doing a lot of high risk loans (D, E, HR), but I knew that going in, so my results didn't upset me as much as those who were investing in only AA/A/B loans. I freely admit that I don't know all that much about finance so as far as I'm concerned, I don't judge how any given year was until all the notes are either charged off or repaid. In 2006, I invested ~$2000 over 25 loans. I ended up coming out ahead by $27. In 2007, I invested ~$1,200 over 20 loans and ended up losing $99. In 2008, I came out even (I made 33 cents). However, those were from before and right after the quiet period. By 2009, Prosper had changed a lot of things, including the fact that you could bid a minimum of $25 per loan instead of $50. I ended up investing about $2,300 spread out over 80 loans and even though 20 loans are still active, I am already ahead by >$300. I have to wait for results for 2010 and 2011 of course, but they are looking good and I am confident that I made the right decision by sticking by them. A good place to play around with the stats there are at www.ericscc.com.    Embed Quote
