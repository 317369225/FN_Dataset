★Are there any big peer to peer or collaborative consumption marketplaces in China?
The P2P online sharing phenomenon is generally sweeping the western world and that maybe be partly down to contemporary cultural issues.  The last 50 years (post war period) has been all about hyper consumption i.e. that people were encouraged to consume in order to grow the economies primarily of Europe and the USA.  This individualism has led to a fracture in communities which has left a social vacum.  People are now reclaiming this space and returning to 'traditional' values and hark for the 'good old days' where people relied on other people. In countries such as India and China there is still a clear and strong social dynamic that does not itself to online P2P.  I suppose the question is wheather emerging countries are embracing hyper consumption that will lead to a breakdown in community values over time. Only time will tell but right now I don't believe there is a domestic market.    Embed Quote
