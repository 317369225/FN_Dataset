★What is the best peer-to-peer desktop sync software?Like DropBox, but not cloud-based. It's okay if traffic goes through the internet, but I don't want my files ending up on a server somewhere. More importantly, I'm fine with paying for the software, but I don't want to pay for a service.
Infinit : you choose what devices composed your network. It could be yours but also those of your community (friends, family, etc). It's directly integrated into your file system. All data are replicated and, of course, encrypted..;) It's in Alpha version right now http://infinit.io/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inf...    Embed Quote
