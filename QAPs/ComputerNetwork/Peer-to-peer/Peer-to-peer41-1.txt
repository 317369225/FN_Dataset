★Are there any platforms that facilitate peer to peer mortgage transactions?Person A has money they would like to lock in a 4% annual return over 30 years for and person B needs to borrow money to fund a home purchase and is willing to pay 4% interest. I am curious to see what is out there?
Crowd Funding for real estate is growing in popularity. There are a few start ups in the market but I am not aware of any working on Mortgages. You would have to assume LendingClub and Prosper have looked into this.   Perhaps there is legal issues to be ironed out, or perhaps the yields are to low to be interesting.   Here is a copy/paste from an email sent to investors. "Here is one example of many improvements which could be accomplished once  an official digital infrastructure is built for the real estate industry. Peer2Peer mortgages could improve mortgage risk/reward profiles in the  following way. If you tiered the risks on a LTV (loan to value) basis;  the traditional banks can do all the underwriting to ensure a high  quality loan. Once the borrower is approved the bank funds a 1st  mortgage up to 60% LTV and uses a 2nd mortgage funded by Peer2Peer  lending for the next 20% (totaling 80% Conventional LTV). The servicing rights for the two  mortgages are tied together so the borrower makes one monthly payment. This would result in the bank having a high quality (low LTV) loan for  their balance sheet and diversifies the exposure of the riskiest portion  of the mortgage debt across the group of Peer2Peer investors. This would also reduce the balance sheet risk exposure Fannie/Freddie and investment banks who securitize mortgage pools expose themselves to during the months it takes to get through the securitization process.  Institutional money is already flowing into LendingClub.com and Prosper.com"    Embed Quote
