★What are the risks of investing in peer to peer lending sites like Lending Club or Prosper.com?
Here's a review I prepared earlier: http://peertopeerlending.knoji.c... The key risk, as mentioned above is the borrower default rate, but cautious lenders can set the category they choose to invest in, thus eliminating most - if not all - of the risk. With the state of the banks (certainly in the UK at the moment at any rate) it makes you wonder if Peer to Peer Lending may become the banks of the future. Trying to get money out of the UK banks at present is virtually impossible!    Embed Quote
