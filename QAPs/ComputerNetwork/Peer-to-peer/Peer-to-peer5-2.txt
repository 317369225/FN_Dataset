★How do peer-to-peer money transfers work?I am curious about how Square, Venmo, PayPal etc. handle peer-to-peer payments. Do they transfer the money through their own merchant account? Or can they give order to make direct transfers (ACH for ex.) between two accounts on behalf of their owners?
Separate the process in three stages 1) funds upload: means the funds are being uploaded in your paypal, square, etc. This can be by any method they would accept as viable source. Credit Cards, Ach, Echeck, etc 2) Transfer to another account: select the account to transfer, amount and verification procedures 3) withdrawals: depending on the system you may have different methods, wire to your bank account, use a debit card etc    Embed Quote
