★How big is the peer-to-peer money transfer market?Specifically looking at reliable sources which can provide peer-to-peer money transfer numbers between various countries.
No one knows for sure. There are estimates and then there are estimates. For example, most of the folks who are into the cross-border peer to peer money transfer use the figures from the remittance industry and cite those as a benchmark for market size. The current remittance industry market size is about $500-$600 Billion per year. How much of this is actually P2P money transfer is highly debatable and speculative at best. Hardly any country's financial regulator publishes numbers that would provide a breakdown of the remittance corridors by agent and that too, by the method in which the transaction was done (was it P2P? Agent Transfer? Bank to Bank?, etc.)    Embed Quote
