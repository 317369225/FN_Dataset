★How should peer-to-peer marketplaces deal with trust and safety issues?Here's an article about what various startups are doing to ensure safety for their users: http://t.co/HYmRnup5
Having written my thesis about building trust in peer-to-peer marketplaces and as community manager at TrustCloud, I think that in addition to the already mentioned ways for marketplaces to build trust (such as rating systems, reviews, background checks and social media connect options), a third party aggregation of the "reputation trail" we create on the Web has a lot of value. Even though different types of platforms surely require different dimensions of trust (for instance not all marketplaces need to do background checks like Taskrabbit), there are universal characteristics of trustworthy behavior that are valid and useful across multiple marketplaces. I believe that having the ability to take your data, which is a reflection of how trustworthy you are, with you all over the Web, is a huge advantage to facilitating p2p transactions, since users do not have to start from zero in building their reputation when they join a new platform. The classic example of this is that even if you have hundreds of great ratings on eBay, as soon as you go to another platform, nobody will trust you. Having a type of portable reputation will therefore lower the entrance barrier for new people looking to engage on p2p marketplaces.
