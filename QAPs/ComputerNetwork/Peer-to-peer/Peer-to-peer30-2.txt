★Is peer-to-peer car-sharing a big market opportunity? If so, which company will win: RelayRides, Getaround, Wheelz or Upshift?Or none of the above. Can car-sharing become a big business like Airbnb or are the differences too fundamental to be mainstream!
I like to think that my company, Upshift, will win. Check out upshiftcars.com to sign up or contact me to learn more. Ultimately, I think there will be niches for multiple models. Zipcar is like a pay-as-you-go phone plan- good for emergencies but not regular use. It may still find a niche with extremely car-light urbanites. P2P carshare is like a rent-a-wreck Zipcar, not "airbnb for cars". It may find a niche with extremely price sensitive, car-light urbanites, particularly for weekend outings. Both compete primarily with car rental more than car ownership. Airbnb will never have a car variant: trust, perceived costs, reservations/planning and access issues are totally different between apartments and cars. Here are the challenges with P2P carshare: Insurance is too expensive Rental rates are too high to be competitive with Zipcar and too low to be profitable for the company. An exception is the day rates, which tend to be more competitive than the hourly rates for users, but are still too low to be profitable for the company. Hourly rentals are too much hassle and not profitable enough to be compelling for owners Trust is a huge barrier for sharing. This may be streamlined with some of the new startups entering the mix but is still a big barrier. Assuring proper maintenance and cleanliness of vehicles is difficult and non-trivial. Getting tech into the cars is difficult as the transaction rates are not high enough to justify the tech costs. Some people also don't want hardware installed in their vehicles. Car quality is low: most cars are 5-10+ years old Demand for pay-per-use cars is low (see above)    Embed Quote
