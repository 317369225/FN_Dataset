★How large is the peer-to-peer lending market?
In Germany the 2 p2p lending services add about 2.5 million EUR per month in newly originated loans. Together they have facilitated about 100 million EUR since spring 2007 (Smava's launch). In the UK, the biggest European market, Zopa, FundingCircle, Ratesetter, ThinCats, Squirrl and a few others add about 15 to 17 million GBP per month in newly originated loans. The all time p2p lending loan amount since 2005 (Zopa's start) in the UK was about 300 million GBP.  In most other markets p2p lending is still at considerably low volumes with the possible exception of China, Korea and Japan. However it is hard to verify any figures for the chinese market through independent sources. More figures / data on my blog.    Embed Quote
