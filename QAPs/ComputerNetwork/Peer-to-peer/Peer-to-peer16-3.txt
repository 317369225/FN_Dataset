★Where can we find international peer to peer lending sites?Recently, I have explored some options when it comes to investing money online. One that I've come across as holding plenty of promise and potential is peer to peer lending. However, sites like Prosper and Lending Club are exclusive to the US market. Where can I find similar services that offer the same attractive portfolio Internationally?
There are a few peer to peer lending platforms that operate across international borders, for global investors looking to put their finances to work: Funding Circle (http://www.FundingCircle.com) offers peer to peer small business loans as low a $7,500 and as high as $1,500,000 in both the US and UK, and is expanding to other geographies soon. Lendico (https://www.lendico.com/), run by Rocket Internet, offers peer to peer loans to individuals in Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Austria, Poland, and South Africa. Ratesetter (http://www.ratesetter.com/), a British peer-to-peer lender recently expanded from the UK to Australia. Bondora / isePankur (https://www.bondora.ee/en/home) offers peer to peer loans to central Europe - including Estonia and the Netherlands. The number of international peer to peer lenders is growing daily - with the number of international companies in the space well into the 1,000's (China alone has 1,000+ peer to peer lenders.) As these numbers grow, you can expect to see more and more cross-border platforms emerge.
