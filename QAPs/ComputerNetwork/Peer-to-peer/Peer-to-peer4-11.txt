★What are your experiences investing on the peer-to-peer lending site Prosper?Would be interested in getting a general understanding of your experiences and perhaps sharing your perception of the risk/reward trade off.
I have been through several "tranches" in my Prosper lending experience. I started lending in spring of 2007 until the site stopped originating new loans sometime in 2008. My results during that initial period were disastrous and my net ROI was about -20%. I experienced a rash of defaults including a loss of 90% principal on my first two loans. I began lending again in 2009 and experienced much better results. I did another "tranche" of about 20 loans over a 10 month period. I diversified across all risk levels while maintaining certain lending standards such as zero current delinquincies, an emphasis on small loan amounts (>10,000) and a verifiable record of stable employment and only lending to people who put a reasonable effort into their loan descriptions. During this period (2009-2011) I achieved ~11% annualized ROI and a default rate under 10%. My experiences (and returns) have been more positive in the last three years than the first two. I'm actively lending again at this time and continue to re-invest proceeds from previous loans. Most importantly, you are doing UNSECURED lending. I think everyone needs to know that collection rates on defaults have been close to zero. Of the approximately 10 loans that have defaulted I have received less than 5% of the principal in collections. Some of these defaulted over three years ago. That said, I will continue to invest in Prosper because the returns are still relatively asymetric for investors that adhere to strict rules and a reasonable expectation of potential returns.    Embed Quote
