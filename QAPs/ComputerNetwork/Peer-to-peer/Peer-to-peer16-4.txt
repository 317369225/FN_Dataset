★Where can we find international peer to peer lending sites?Recently, I have explored some options when it comes to investing money online. One that I've come across as holding plenty of promise and potential is peer to peer lending. However, sites like Prosper and Lending Club are exclusive to the US market. Where can I find similar services that offer the same attractive portfolio Internationally?
Bitbond is a global peer-to-peer lending platform based on bitcoin technology. Therefore Bitbond is accessible to everyone who has an internet connection. In order to enable cross-border lending we use bitcoin as a technology and payment network. Most loans on our platform are denominated in US dollars (see Exchange rate pegged loans). That way borrowers and lenders can mitigate bitcoin price fluctuations. Bitbond functions much like the established platforms. We do a credit check on every borrower. Only those borrowers who get verified by us can publish loan listings on Bitbond. As a lender this allows you to build a globally diversified loan portfolio. Nominal interest rates on Bitbond start at ~8% and go up to around 30%. In order to become active on Bitbond you need to obtain bitcoins first. There are multiple exchanges and online brokers where this is possible in a fairly easy way. Note that when you have US dollar denominated loans in your portfolio you are holding the loan as an asset (which is a fixed income asset class) and not bitcoin (which is a highly volatile asset, comparable to commodities).    Embed Quote
