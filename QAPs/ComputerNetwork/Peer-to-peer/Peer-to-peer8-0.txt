★How large is the peer-to-peer lending market?
In the United States the market is growing rapidly so it is tough to nail down an exact size. We can say that between them Lending Club and Prosper, the two leading players in this country, issued $75 million in new loans last month. But this month that number will be well over $80 million. This year the total market for p2p loans will come in somewhere around $800 million up from $333 million in 2011. These numbers pale in comparison to the total outstanding revolving consumer debt which is around $800 billion. So there is plenty of room for p2p lending to continue growing.    Embed Quote
