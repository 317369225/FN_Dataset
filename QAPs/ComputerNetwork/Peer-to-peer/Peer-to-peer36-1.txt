★Is there any payment solution for peer-to-peer online marketplaces in Europe?Such as Balanced in U.S
Luckily I was asked to answer this question so perhaps my shameless plug won't seem so shameless? Peer-2-Peer marketplaces have two basic elements to me. Sellers who do not have a merchant account and realistically can't get one and those that do. I think you need to support both scenarios if you want to have an effective marketplace. For those that can't/don't want a merchant account GoCardless and PayPal are the obvious choices for Europe it would seem. GoCardless is UK only but I hear grumblings that they'll be European wide sometime in the New Year. Paypal is.....well Paypal but it is a viable global option. For your sellers who want to accept other payment types beyond CC's like Dankort or ACH/Direct Deposit in Germany etc then that will dictated they get a merchant account/gateway that can facilitate that. (Plug paragraph) Our service SpreedlyCore is supposed to tie all that together for you. Support all the gateways, support the payment types, vault the cards and reduce PCI compliance scope (via a single API.)    Embed Quote
