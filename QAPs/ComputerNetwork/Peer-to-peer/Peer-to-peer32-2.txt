★What are the risks of investing in peer to peer lending sites like Lending Club or Prosper.com?
In general there are the following risks for lenders investing on peer to peer lending sites: borrower fails to repay the loan (identity) fraud by borrowers p2p lending company fails and ceases to service loans (there are several international examples Boober, Fairrates, Monetto) unreliable forecasts of ROI and default rates; this did apply to Prosper lenders in the past. If you did lend in 2006/2007 and believed the forecasts you might be hard hit; actual default rates for loans were as high as >30% on some services: open/undefined tax and legal issues on some microfinance services: currency exchange risks on some microfinance services: risk of MFI failure Not exactly a risk, but a lender's money might be tied up for the loan term. While Prosper and Lending Club do have secondary markets there is no guarantee that lenders can sell loans early. If interest rates rise overall, than older loans might not be able to sell (at least not without a discount)    Embed Quote
