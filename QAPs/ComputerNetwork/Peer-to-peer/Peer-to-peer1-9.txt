★Is peer to peer insurance feasible?
In an ideal world it is feasible and probably the best way at the moment to bring down insurance premiums. Insurance companies ideally should agree with this model as allows them to reduce their claim ratios, process costs - which they crib about. However it has not taken off very well as most insurance companies are yet to support. It can be very popular if a lot of people support it, rather than wait for it to become popular as its in their best interests as premiums would be greatly reduced.    Embed Quote
