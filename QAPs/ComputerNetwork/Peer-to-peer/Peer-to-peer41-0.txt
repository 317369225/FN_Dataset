★Are there any platforms that facilitate peer to peer mortgage transactions?Person A has money they would like to lock in a 4% annual return over 30 years for and person B needs to borrow money to fund a home purchase and is willing to pay 4% interest. I am curious to see what is out there?
I'm not aware of any P2P lending platforms that are actually closing any significant volume of mortgage loans.  There is start-up, Equidy, claiming to be building such a platform listed on CrunchBase.  Doesn't look like there's much going on there visting the site: http://equidy.co.  Weemba http://www.weemba.com is perhaps actually closing loans but acts more of a connection service for lenders and borrowers. Not sure if the economics of P2P mortgage lending are right at this time.  Unlike personal loans, you'd need a massive pool of willing investors in order to support a large scale mortgage P2P platform.  Margins in the prime mortgage business are really too slim to support a platform and still generate an adequate return to satisfy investors.  You'd probably have to focus on satisfying the currently unserviced niches that could support higher rates and fees, such as sub-prime borrowers. One interesting aspect however from building a P2P network would perhaps be that you should be able to avoid much of the onerous regulation that goes along with originating mortgages in today. I doubt borrower's would pay a significant premium over market interest rates to make the process more efficient. If there is a business plan out there I'd be happy to provide feedback.    Embed Quote
