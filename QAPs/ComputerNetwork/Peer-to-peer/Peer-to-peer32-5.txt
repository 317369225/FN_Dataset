â˜…What are the risks of investing in peer to peer lending sites like Lending Club or Prosper.com?
Both Prosper and Lending Club are reputable sites for Peer to Peer Lending. We've invested money on both platforms for both ourselves and our clients, and have earned returns in the 10-16% range. There are a few risks. First, there's the possibility of default. We apply rigorous underwriting models before selecting loans and have not had a problem with defaults. Second, there's liquidity risk. Money is tied up for 3 years in each loan. However, there is a secondary market where you can sell loans and get cash - (there's a 1% fee). For us, the benefits have far outweighed the risks. I'd recommend starting to make low dollar amount loans now to get used to the platform, and start ramping up once you getget comfortable.
