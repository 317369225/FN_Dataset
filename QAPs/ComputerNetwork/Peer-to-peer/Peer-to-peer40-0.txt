★Which are some successful peer to peer lending business models in India and how do they work?I want to know what are some startups working in the peer to peer lending area in which people can get loans without going through an intermediary or the bank.How do they work and what are the challenges here ?
Firstly P2P does NOT mean no intermediary. The P2P agency in true sense is an intermediary - or in today's modern e-commerce parlance "marketplace" where lenders and borrowers meet (e-commerce equivalent of buyers and sellers meeting). In the global P2P model the player gives a platform for the lenders and borrowers to meet. They (lenders and borrowers) are able to negotiate the terms between themselves and the player (P2P portal) gets a fee for this. A borrower can decide from whom to borrow; and likewise a lender can decide who gets his/her money. Thus, P2P players are indeed very different from MFI's (Micro Finance Institutions). MFI's do NOT create a marketplace; they borrow and they lend. The borrowers typically do not have any control over whom to lend. I thus assume "without going through an intermediary" you mean not going through a traditional loan broker. Very few true P2P businesses exist in India today. Milaap is reallt an NGO which does not offer returns to lenders. Players like Kiva have adopted yet another different model whereby it has allowed its lenders to lend to Indian borrowers through a tie-up with 2/3 MFIs. Rangde, ilend.in are some of the other players in the P2P space in India. The challenges for the P2P players is two-fold. First is lack of legal clarity and (2) creating an effective marketplace which is based on "trust", for both the borrower and the lender.    Embed Quote
