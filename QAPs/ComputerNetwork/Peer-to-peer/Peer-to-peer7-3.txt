★Is the peer-to-peer lending category worth investing in?
It's actually an excellent category: this is proven by Prosper and LendingClub. Many other players in this space in different categories - for example realtymogul, fundrise are in the real estate crowdfunding category. Point is P2P lending is very efficient, cuts out middle man (bank) and gets investors high returns and borrowers low cost of money. Stable returns mean this could be a great source of passive income stream. Disclosure: I am CTO of Reamerge.com - a peer to business lending platform where investors can invest in established cash flowing businesses secured by their real estate. We believe there are only a couple or no other portal in this category which minimizes risk (good cashflow business + real estate security).    Embed Quote
