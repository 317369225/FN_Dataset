★Why is the logo hyperlink disabled on checkout pages for many e-commerce sites ?I have seen this on many e-commerce sites. The link to homepage on logo is disabled at checkout pages. The obvious reason I can think of is to increase the conversion rate and encourage user to complete the purchase. Is there any other particular reason for this ?
I am no e-commerce professional, but I think that the it is explained by two reasons : 1) You don't want people to interrupt the payment process. If they get billed but don't complete the online order processing (and therefore don't receive their purchase), that's a big deal 2) It also as you say increases the conversion rate Those two reasons, though simple enough, seem to explain it perfectly to me. I'm curious as to if there is a more complex answer still though.    Embed Quote
