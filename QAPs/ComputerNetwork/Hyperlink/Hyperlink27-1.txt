★Why can't we hyperlink from a radio program to the Web?here is an example of how a commercial might sound which had an embedded hyperlink to the web ... http://www.speaktomecatalog.com/...
The reason is that this type of functionality is not currently part of any Internet standard that I'm aware of. If you literally mean linking from radio audio (as in AM/FM), this would require an app that can recognize an ad (like Shazam) or other method and send you to a URL. The reason this currently requires a new app or other additional tools is that it's not a feature built into any Web Standard like HTTP or HTML.  I do think a standard way of encoding URLs in audio streams would be a great addition to web standards, with accessibility uses and many more.
