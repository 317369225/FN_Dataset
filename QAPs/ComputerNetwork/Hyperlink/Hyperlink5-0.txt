★How do I preserve hyperlinks when I save PowerPoint files as PDFs?I'm running PowerPoint 2011 for Mac. For some reason neither Printing or Saving As PDF works.
If you have Apple's Keynote you can use it to open your PowerPoint file and then generate a PDF. It should preserve your embedded links just fine. Otherwise Mark Goldenson's answer (How do I preserve hyperlinks when I save PowerPoint files as PDFs?) is good.    Embed Quote
