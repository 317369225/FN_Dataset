★How do I preserve hyperlinks when I save PowerPoint files as PDFs?I'm running PowerPoint 2011 for Mac. For some reason neither Printing or Saving As PDF works.
I've found that saving from MS PPT 2010 to Adobe PDF saves my embedded text links, but not image links. This forces me to go into Acrobat Pro and generate new links for images and buttons, which I think we can all agree is a ridiculous waste of time. It would be better if the two programs played nicely together.    Embed Quote
