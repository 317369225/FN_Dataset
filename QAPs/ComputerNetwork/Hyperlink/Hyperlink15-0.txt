★Is it ok if I use hyperlinks in my resume?For example hyperlinks to the companies that I worked at (and are not that well known outside my country), the idea being that this way the recruiter can learn more about the company, and may not find it by searching on the internet, or hyperlinks to my projects, etc. I am thinking about this as strategy to make life easier for the people that look over my resume.
I write my resumes in MS Word and convert them to a PDF for distribution.  I do include hyperlinks for a few items such as my email address (mailto:) and my LinkedIn profile. I do not leave the format of the links in the default format though, I reformat the links to match the rest of the text.  This way, a professional appearance on-screen and in print is maintained.  If the reader moves their mouse over the links, something they would do  if they intended to copy my email address or link to LinkedIn, hyperlinks are obvious and easily accessed. Personally, I do not include hidden links to past employers since most of my career has been with huge multinationals.  Linking to their home page is kind of useless and reorganizations make links to divisions or business units  short lived or impossible.    Embed Quote
