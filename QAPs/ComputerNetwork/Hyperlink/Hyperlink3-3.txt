★Why is the logo hyperlink disabled on checkout pages for many e-commerce sites ?I have seen this on many e-commerce sites. The link to homepage on logo is disabled at checkout pages. The obvious reason I can think of is to increase the conversion rate and encourage user to complete the purchase. Is there any other particular reason for this ?
This is simply to give the user less of an opportunity to leave the page and an attempt to increase the the chance they will complete their checkout. If you've shopped on Amazon you'll notice that, short of closing your browser or clicking at the nearly imperceptible "Amazon Homepage" link at the bottom of the page, it is quite difficult to exit the checkout process. Right or wrong, it would appear that this strategy works (for Amazon at least), but I'd be curious to see some statistics on it. As Frank mentioned above A/B tests for this would be crucial in defining if such a flow would work with your customers.    Embed Quote
