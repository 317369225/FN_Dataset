★How long before a hyperlink to a website is de-valued by Googlebot?
Forgive me for my ignorance but how many people actually search for Small Business Supercharged? It does not matter what your rank is if the keyword is not being searched enough. You might want to consider the following questions before you start promoting your book. 1. Who is your target audience? Who should buy this book? 2. What are the considerable benefits that people will get after purchasing this book? ( Double their sales, save on their taxes, become more effective leaders etc) 3. Then identify keywords basis those benefits such as - leadership books, sales ebooks, books on selling, books on taxing etc. One you are done with the basics than move forward with SEO. If want to discuss this further, you can send me a private message. Regards, Hardik Shah DigitalUpshot.com    Embed Quote
