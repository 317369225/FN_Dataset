★Why is the logo hyperlink disabled on checkout pages for many e-commerce sites ?I have seen this on many e-commerce sites. The link to homepage on logo is disabled at checkout pages. The obvious reason I can think of is to increase the conversion rate and encourage user to complete the purchase. Is there any other particular reason for this ?
Simple answer - To prevent you from moving on without checking out. Honest answer - Instead of educating/engaging the customers the e-commerce companies thought of this quick-fix. I am amazed how this would help, when the user can simply close his browser! One more thought - Is it not unethical? Suppose you walk into a grocery store, and at the last minute (while you have picked up some stuff in the cart) you decide not to purchase things and exit the store. Should you not be allowed to walk-away from the store without any questions asked? Additional Information added from discussions with some of the e-Commerce guys - This step was once done by amazon, and then almost all the e-Commerce companies wanted to implement it, even without considering the fact that there is a huge difference between them and Amazon. Moreover, Amazon does a lot of A/B Testing, and they keep adding/removing stuff after their experiment is over. Such is not the case with Indian e-Commerce companies - They keep copying everything from Amazon and other Big names......Indian e-Commerce's strategy is simple - Keep copying the successful models!    Embed Quote
