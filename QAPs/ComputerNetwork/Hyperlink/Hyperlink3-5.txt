★Why is the logo hyperlink disabled on checkout pages for many e-commerce sites ?I have seen this on many e-commerce sites. The link to homepage on logo is disabled at checkout pages. The obvious reason I can think of is to increase the conversion rate and encourage user to complete the purchase. Is there any other particular reason for this ?
The general logic while building any sort of 'transaction page' (this also includes registration pages, in addition to a checkout page) is to avoid giving the user any gateways by which they abandon the action. This is from a conventional business approach wherein you want to ensure that you give your user very few choices and thereby minimize their cognitive overload too. However, there are cases where users may want to go back and forth while they are at the cart checkout stage which is why most e-commerce websites now include some links (e.g. product name linked back to the product page), and ensure they maintain the cart information to aid the process. Linking the logo to the homepage, however, is an action that you'd want to avoid since it leads the user into starting over vs merely reconsidering product A and replacing it with product B instead.    Embed Quote
