★Why can't we hyperlink from a radio program to the Web?here is an example of how a commercial might sound which had an embedded hyperlink to the web ... http://www.speaktomecatalog.com/...
It's an interesting question.  Obviously we have QR Codes for visual hyperlinking, and some people have made apps which interact with audio cues in specific TV shows (http://hacktext.com/2011/06/is-s...), but there doesn't seem to be any standard currently where a small burst of audio could be picked up by a computer/tablet/phone mic and be handled as a link.  You're quite right that there should be, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if someone is working on it right now. EDIT: 23/07/2012.  Just saw an article on the BBC about this new app: http://chirp.io/faq/ "Chirp is a way to share links using sound."    Embed Quote
