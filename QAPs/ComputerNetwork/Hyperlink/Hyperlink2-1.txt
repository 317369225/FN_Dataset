★Is there any way to make internal hyperlinks in Evernote?I would like to be able insert a link in one note that takes you to another note. You can do this in Tiddlywiki and it is a very useful feature.
The facility to link notes together is excellent, but what I would really like to do is to be able to create internal links, within a note. So if I have a long-ish document I may want to create a table of contents at the top of the note and then be able to go directly to each section. I also want to be able to create references to notes or citations at the end of the note. Another item on my wish list is to have a highlighter tool which will change the background of selected text to yellow or pale blue or green, etc. While on the subject of links, I also like Evernote's ability to link to external files on your hard drive. (I've only tried it on a Windows system, but I assume it will work equally well with other OSs.) I often do this to link the transcript of a video - usually a lecture or debate - to the video file itself. To do this, I select the name of the video in the text of my note, and press Ctrl-K to bring up the hyperlink box which is helpfully prepopulated with 'http://'. I delete the 'http' and replace it with 'file', so it reads 'file://' and then carry on and enter the full path to the video file, e.g. 'c:\lectures\chemistry101.flv', so the complete links reads 'file://c:\lectures\chemistry101 - 001.flv'. Ok, I feel a lot better now that I've got these off my chest ... ;-)    Embed Quote
