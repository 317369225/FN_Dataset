★What database is good to store hyperlinks?What database can be used store hyperlinks with keywords/ tags? I want to fetch data from internet on regular basis and update db. Also I want to query database regularly. Is multiple layered approach (sql + nosql) be efficient way to do this?
It depends on what kind of scale you're talking about. Until you get to a sufficiently large scale, a (C)OTS database like Postgres or MySQL with an appropriate configuration will do you just fine. If you want to do more than just store/retrieve hyperlinks, e.g., "find all the links from http://quora.com", you could either pre-process links for everything you care about and store it in the row, or write a custom data type in Postgres to support operators you care about.    Embed Quote
