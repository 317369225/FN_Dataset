★Why is the logo hyperlink disabled on checkout pages for many e-commerce sites ?I have seen this on many e-commerce sites. The link to homepage on logo is disabled at checkout pages. The obvious reason I can think of is to increase the conversion rate and encourage user to complete the purchase. Is there any other particular reason for this ?
It is indeed done under the logic of treating your check-out chute like the Hotel California: the customer can check out but can never leave. OK -- so that was lame, but makes the point. Some retailers seem to think if it's not possible to easily leave the cart, then you will just resign yourself to handing over your money. For many of reasons, this is misguided: What if the visitor wants to add additional items to her cart? Making it harder to increase your AOV is clearly shortsighted. What if the visitor wants to double check something about a product. Did I select right color? Is this the one I meant to get? etc. Anyone disabling the logo probably doesn't have items in the cart linked back to their product pages. Generally you want to decrease user nervousness about buying. Preventing them from doing so will hurt conversion, not help it. Customers often put items in the cart to check shipping costs, to confirm a promotion will apply, to check delivery time lines, etc. Treating your cart like the Hotel California prevents them from doing this efficiently without doing anything for cart abandonment. Study after study shows causing user frustration is a great way to drive abandonment. Since users are trained to use the logo as the path to the home page, disabling it is unlikely to generate long term benefit. Jon from Bonobos further supports this. Making life harder for your visitors is a counter intuitive way to win their business...    Embed Quote
