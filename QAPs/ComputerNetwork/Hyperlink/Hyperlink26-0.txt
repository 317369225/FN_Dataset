★How long before a hyperlink to a website is de-valued by Googlebot?
Generally speaking, a good link will never be devalued by Google. Although there is entropy caused by links getting dropped, competitors getting more links, etc. You appear to have gotten a lot of incorrect SEO knowledge from somewhere... "I imagine the decline in relevancy as time progresses will hit both pages" There is no such thing as an automatic decline in relevancy. (There are a few queries where Google tried to rank more recent content (QDF) but I doubt that's the case for this keyword.) The only way the relevancy of the page will decline is if you change the page and make it less relevant to the keyword. "my goal should be to build more keyword-specific inbound links to my website" That is almost certainly going to get you penalized. Almost without exception, any link that you can control and make a specific keyword is a link that Google is likely to deem manipulative. "does Googlebot weigh older inbound hyperlinks less heavily when calculating SERP?" No, but some SEOs think older links are *more* valuable. Before you proceed, I would recommend reading up a lot on white-hat SEO best practices.
