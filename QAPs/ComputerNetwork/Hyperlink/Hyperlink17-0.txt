★Do hyperlinks help SEO? How?
Links and shares help SEO because of the relationships your page may have to other relevant information. It is important to not "link stuff" (linking to tons of their content) your page however, because search engines will lower your rank in an effort to discourage the practice -- especially when links go to irrelevant pages. There is a wealth of information on the subject already existing on wikipedia and other internet sources.    Embed Quote
