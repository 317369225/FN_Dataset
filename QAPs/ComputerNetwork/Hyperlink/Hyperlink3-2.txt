★Why is the logo hyperlink disabled on checkout pages for many e-commerce sites ?I have seen this on many e-commerce sites. The link to homepage on logo is disabled at checkout pages. The obvious reason I can think of is to increase the conversion rate and encourage user to complete the purchase. Is there any other particular reason for this ?
Regardless of theories, the answer is to always TEST TEST TEST! Run an a/b split test, or better yet, a multivariate test where you have page variations with and without a clickable logo, with and without a navigation menu, and so on. Different things work for different sites and different industries so there is no "right" or "wrong" answer to the question. It's a matter of testing - EVERYTHING!
