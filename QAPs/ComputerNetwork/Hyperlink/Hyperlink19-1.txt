★How do I preserve hyperlinks when converting webpages to pdf?I typically print to pdf in Windows 7 and "save as pdf" in Mac OS X.
Try wkhtmltopdf(http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmlt...) Convert web pages into PDF documents using webkit Adding headers and footers (static version only) TOC generation (static version only) Batch mode conversions (Linux) No longer requires an XServer to be running (however the X11 client libs must be installed) Support Linux, Windows and Mac OSX btw, you can also have a try http://witwall.com/html2pdf/ and http://witwall.com/html2pdf/Xhtm..., they are based on wkhtmltox library.    Embed Quote
