★How do I preserve hyperlinks when converting webpages to pdf?I typically print to pdf in Windows 7 and "save as pdf" in Mac OS X.
I have Acrobat 9 Standard on my Windows 7 workstation.  Adobe doesn't have a  "Convert to PDF" button for Chrome and I won't use Firefox or Internet Explorer.  To preserve links I have to copy/paste the URL into Acrobat via File - Create PDF from webpage.  At 4-5 steps that process is far too inefficient. What is the most efficient (fewest steps to complete) product for converting webpages (HTTPS:// too) , in Chrome, to PDFs with hyperlinks in tact on both Mac OS X and Windows 7?  I'm open to Adobe or 3rd party solutions. The "Save As PDF" extension by pdfcrowd is very good, but it can't convert any password protected webpages.    Embed Quote
