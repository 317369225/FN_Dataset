★What is the most hyperlinked Wikipedia article?For example, Barack Obama's and Richard Daley will both have a hyperlink to the article "Chicago" somewhere in their own article. Which article has the most going to it?
I don't have exact numbers at hand, but when I last investigates this, the most boring and basic articles had the highes number of links, e.g. pages about years or units of measurement. These are linked a *lot*.    Embed Quote
