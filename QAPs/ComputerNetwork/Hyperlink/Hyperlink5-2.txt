★How do I preserve hyperlinks when I save PowerPoint files as PDFs?I'm running PowerPoint 2011 for Mac. For some reason neither Printing or Saving As PDF works.
I ran into this problem, too, and searched for answers. Unfortunately, the only workaround I found is typing out the entire URL, creating a hyperlink for it, then saving as PDF. That did preserve the link for me, though looks uglier. You can use a URL shortener like Bitly to save space. FYI, opening a PDF in Mac Preview (at least one converted this way) does not let you click on a link by hovering your mouse over it. You have to right-click the link and select "Open". :/ Sources: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-... http://forums.adobe.com/thread/7...    Embed Quote
