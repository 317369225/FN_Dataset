★Is there any way to make internal hyperlinks in Evernote?I would like to be able insert a link in one note that takes you to another note. You can do this in Tiddlywiki and it is a very useful feature.
That's the best feature in Evernote!! There's a world of possibilities once you get into Copy Note Linking - such as creating a travel itinerary for your travels and then creating a copy note link to the agenda for each item on the itinerary! I do that every time I travel and it's amazing how fast and efficient it is - especially when you're on the iPad and in a customer meeting!    Embed Quote
