★How do I preserve hyperlinks when I save PowerPoint files as PDFs?I'm running PowerPoint 2011 for Mac. For some reason neither Printing or Saving As PDF works.
I ran into this problem today. There are two quick solutions: 1. use a Windows version of powerpoint to save as PDF which will conserve the links. But, you do want to doublecheck as it may look different when the same PPT file opened in a different version of OS/MS Office. The second way, which is one I used, is to use Adobe Acrobat Pro links tool to manually create those links. This method is very tedious if you have too many links (especially icon links). And the resultant PDF file is much bigger.    Embed Quote
