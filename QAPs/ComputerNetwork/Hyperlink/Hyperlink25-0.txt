★Why does Upworthy use Facebook link posts instead of larger pictures posts with hyperlink in text?
Are you on the new News Feed or the old News Feed? I'm not sure what percentage of Facebook users are on the new version, but I don't think it's a significant percentage yet. Facebook tells me only 6% of my friends are on it, and those are mostly Upworthy colleagues. Facebook News Feed (scroll to the bottom) We've tested link posts vs. photo posts on the old News Feed, and link posts yield significantly more clickthroughs to the content than photo posts. Photo posts do get more engagement in terms of likes and shares, but it's not enough to make up for the lower percentage on clickthroughs. Keep in mind, those are our findings, which are a few months old and will be outdated when most users are on the new News Feed. So I encourage you to test it for your audience.    Embed Quote
