★Why is the logo hyperlink disabled on checkout pages for many e-commerce sites ?I have seen this on many e-commerce sites. The link to homepage on logo is disabled at checkout pages. The obvious reason I can think of is to increase the conversion rate and encourage user to complete the purchase. Is there any other particular reason for this ?
I would like to suggest: 1.  It happened originally because it struck someone as a good idea (perhaps for the reason you mention), or.. 2. A separate team built the checkout and it was missed as a requirement. 3. Everyone copied that company. 4. Now people assume it's best practice. FWIW, I work at AMZN.    Embed Quote
