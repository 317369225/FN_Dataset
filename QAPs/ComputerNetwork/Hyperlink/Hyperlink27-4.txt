Internet radio stations that use the Backbone Radio (backbone.com) service, such as the 50-station IBS Student Radio Network, the largest true network of college and high school Internet radio stations, do get images and clickable URLs streamed along with their audio content. Backbone simultaneously supports several types of players (QuickTime, Shoutcast and HTTP Live).  With embedded QT players, the listener clicks on the streaming image (or Q if no image present) and the browser takes the listener to the corresponding URL, which usually is the iTunes Store purchase URL for that song.  The song continues playing while the listener takes the journey.  This feature is not compatible with Shoutcast streams.    Embed Quote
