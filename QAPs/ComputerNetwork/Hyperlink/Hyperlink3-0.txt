★Why is the logo hyperlink disabled on checkout pages for many e-commerce sites ?I have seen this on many e-commerce sites. The link to homepage on logo is disabled at checkout pages. The obvious reason I can think of is to increase the conversion rate and encourage user to complete the purchase. Is there any other particular reason for this ?
Generally speaking, reducing the number of ways a user can exit your flow will increase the likelihood that they finish it. But this isn't always a good thing. Checkout is a very ubiquitous and important flow, so it should come as no surprise that many ecommerce companies have painstakingly optimized their checkout process and eliminated exit points. Since users are very used to a site's logo taking them to the homepage, it's often the first exit point they attempt to use and   subsequently the first exit companies will  remove. But I must caution against removing exits without measuring the impact. Every site is different. For Bonobos, unlinking the logo in checkout actually significantly reduced our average order value while producing no impact to conversion.    Embed Quote
