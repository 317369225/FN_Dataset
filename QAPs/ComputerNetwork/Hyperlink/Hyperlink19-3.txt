★How do I preserve hyperlinks when converting webpages to pdf?I typically print to pdf in Windows 7 and "save as pdf" in Mac OS X.
The easiest and most quick way is to use some free online converting service, and here is a website I alway use to convert webpages to pdf format. What you need to do is just input your wanted URL in the box and click "Convert", then the converted pdf files would be sent to your Email. And the best news is that the converted files could retain the Hyperlinks in the original webpages. Convert webpages to PDF: http://www.web2pdfconvert.com/    Embed Quote
