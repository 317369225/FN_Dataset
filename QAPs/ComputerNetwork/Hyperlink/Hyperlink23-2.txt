★How do you change the default hyperlink colour in HTML?I would like to make all links the following color: <font color="#339933"> by default (so I don't need to edit the HTML every time I add a link). How can I do this? Thanks
<a class = "anc_col" href="#">Link</a> In style sheet, use like this a.anc_col{color : #000;} a:hover{color : #00f;}    Embed Quote
