★Is it ok if I use hyperlinks in my resume?For example hyperlinks to the companies that I worked at (and are not that well known outside my country), the idea being that this way the recruiter can learn more about the company, and may not find it by searching on the internet, or hyperlinks to my projects, etc. I am thinking about this as strategy to make life easier for the people that look over my resume.
You can, but they become useless once you print it off. Best to use footnotes.    Embed Quote
