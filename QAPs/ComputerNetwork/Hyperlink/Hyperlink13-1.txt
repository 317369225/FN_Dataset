★Why aren't almost all words on Wikipedia hyperlinked on every page?On a typical Wikipedia page, you'd see ~20% of the words are hyperlinked to some other Wikipedia page. Why aren't more words hyperlinked? Is it because it causes annoyance to the user, or not enough people have done it yet. I like the idea of having every word on Wikipedia as a hyperlink to it's Wikipedia Topic Page.
IMO wikipedia should keep the current look and only have blue links to things that are very relevant to the article. But why not make the black words clickable if somebody really wants to? Just don't make them stand out, not to distract, but allow user to click them as it can seriously speed up your concept exploration. But more importantly, I think rather than tweaking wikipedia we should explore new more intuitive and faster to use knowledge representations.    Embed Quote
