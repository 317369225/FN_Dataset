★Is it ok if I use hyperlinks in my resume?For example hyperlinks to the companies that I worked at (and are not that well known outside my country), the idea being that this way the recruiter can learn more about the company, and may not find it by searching on the internet, or hyperlinks to my projects, etc. I am thinking about this as strategy to make life easier for the people that look over my resume.
Yes, it makes the resume more professional! If the Interviewer/HR need to know information about something, it will be easy for him/her to find the info through hyperlink. It will make your register in their minds, there by making your chances increase.    Embed Quote
