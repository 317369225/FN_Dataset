★How do you change the default hyperlink colour in HTML?I would like to make all links the following color: <font color="#339933"> by default (so I don't need to edit the HTML every time I add a link). How can I do this? Thanks
[code html] <style typestyle type="text/csscss">     a {color:#339933;} </style> [/code]
