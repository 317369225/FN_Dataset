★Is it ok if I use hyperlinks in my resume?For example hyperlinks to the companies that I worked at (and are not that well known outside my country), the idea being that this way the recruiter can learn more about the company, and may not find it by searching on the internet, or hyperlinks to my projects, etc. I am thinking about this as strategy to make life easier for the people that look over my resume.
I always leave hyperlinks for websites of projects I worked on and organizations that previously employed me. For me, it's important to make it as easy as possible for the employer to check my background. It's true they won't spend too much time on your CV, but if you're the right fit for the position, then they will want to know more about you. That's when this feature of your CV can be really useful.    Embed Quote
