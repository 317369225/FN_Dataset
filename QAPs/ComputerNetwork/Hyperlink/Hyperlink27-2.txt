Radio Tag is coming! This will provide the ability to press a button which will tag what you are listening to - the station, date and time. It is implemented under the Radio DNS architecture, a joint development by the BBC and UK commercial radio. There are many ideas about what you might do with the tags; you might see them on your PC when you got home so you could find out more about the thing you were listening to when you pressed the tag button. Or the tag could be used to instantly share the precise thing you were listening to on your social networks. Or perhaps your PC could automaticly download the podcast of any programme you tagged.
