★Hyperlink in jpeg for an html email?I want to send a newsletter with hyperlinks in the jpeg banner. the banner can be html as well
If the jpeg has one link, just use the href code, if it has more than one link, google imagemaps. I see a few programs/websites that offer that. But a better way is to slice the image. Feel free to contact me if you want to hire out the project.    Embed Quote
