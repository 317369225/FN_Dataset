★Why aren't almost all words on Wikipedia hyperlinked on every page?On a typical Wikipedia page, you'd see ~20% of the words are hyperlinked to some other Wikipedia page. Why aren't more words hyperlinked? Is it because it causes annoyance to the user, or not enough people have done it yet. I like the idea of having every word on Wikipedia as a hyperlink to it's Wikipedia Topic Page.
It was proposed several times, but overwhelmingly rejected by the editors community. The main reason for the rejection is: "This would create an unsightly sea of blue links, making articles  unnecessarily difficult to read, as well as distracting readers from the  links that might actually be of value to them."
