★How can I add a hyperlink in CSL?
The citation processor running in Mendeley has the capability to do this (as of June this year), but the application needs to be set up to support it. The technical nitty-gritty is here: http://citationstylist.org/2014/... If you are comfortable working in JavaScript, and if Mendeley can export in the CSL JSON format, you could write a small program in node.js to process exported data into a finished bibliography. That would give you full control over the links and the logic for generating them. The processor source archive contains a demo node.js app that you could use as a starting point for coding. https://bitbucket.org/fbennett/c...    Embed Quote
