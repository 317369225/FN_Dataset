★What are the telecommunication options in Tunisia?Sorry for my ignorance, but this is the very first time I travel to Tunisia (actually, to Africa at all). I would like to know if there are any operators offering pre-paid cards, what are the prices and so on. I will be there fo rtwo weeks. Also, what are the options for tourist like me regarding mobile internet.
The SIM cards from Orange at the gate upon arrival are free.  I paid 30 td/month for 7.5 G data with Ooreedo and the capital has good 3G access.    Embed Quote
