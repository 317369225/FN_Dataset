★What are the job opportunities available for electronics and communication engineer? Telecommunication field in particular.I am about to complete my UG and interested to work in Telecom industry,please suggest me some job opportunities ,skills required for those jobs or share any info related to Telecom industry.
If you are interested in traditional telecommunication, life is tough as BTS engineer in different organizations like RCom, Airtel, etc. You can look for career in as a Software designer, tester or integrator in Unified Communications where you will come across different telecom products like EPABX, Media gateways, ATA's, etc. VoIP and IMS have an amazing future, if networks and protocols attract you, go for VoIP or IMS. :-)    Embed Quote
