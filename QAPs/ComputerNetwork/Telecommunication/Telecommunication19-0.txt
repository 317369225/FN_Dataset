★What are the telecommunication options in Tunisia?Sorry for my ignorance, but this is the very first time I travel to Tunisia (actually, to Africa at all). I would like to know if there are any operators offering pre-paid cards, what are the prices and so on. I will be there fo rtwo weeks. Also, what are the options for tourist like me regarding mobile internet.
First of all, thank you for visiting our country. We are pleased to welcome you. There are 3 operators in tunisia: - Tunisie Telecom - Ooredoo - Orange All these operators offer pre-paid cards. Regarding the prices of mobile internet and communications, I was there for the entire month of august and this is what I did: - Bought a Simm Card of the operator Orange in the airport. Cost: 5 dinars (2,86 dollars). - Bought 3 pre-paid cards, the cost of each one is 10 dinars (5,72 dollars). Cost of the 3 cards: 30 dinars (17,16 dollars). Even if I use the 3g all day long, it was enough for all the month. I advise you to choose this option.    Embed Quote
