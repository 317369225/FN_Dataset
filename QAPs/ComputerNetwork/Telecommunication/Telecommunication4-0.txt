★What are things that electronics and telecommunication engineers (ECE) know while other engineers don't?
iPhone 5 is an Apple product.  Well , everyone knows that.  What many of us don't know is that, an iPhone 5 uses 4G chip from Qualcomm, Flash memory chips from Hynix Semiconductors (Korea), audio chip from Cirrus Logic, Wi- Fi chip from Murata and Touch screen controller chip from Texas Instruments! Also, complex chips used in your mobile phones can have transistors exceeding 1 billion but its size would be 3oo square millimeter or (1.8cmx 1.8cm). For example, Intel i7 processor has 731 million transistors and its size is 263 square millimeter. From this it is evident that the transistors are really very small. Comparing transistor size to the diameter of a human hair(100um), one can say that in the 28 nm technology, one can place about 3500 transistors along the diameter of a human hair. That's how small a transistor is !!   According to International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) we reached the 14 nm technology in 2014 and will work with 10 nm by 2016.    Embed Quote
