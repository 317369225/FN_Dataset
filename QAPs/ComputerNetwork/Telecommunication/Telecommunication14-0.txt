★Why is 1550 nm used in telecommunication?
1550 nm is the wavelength at which you get minimum loss through the fiber. Image from Cisco Legacy fiber used to run on 1330 nm instead of 1550, because 1330 nm is the wavelength at which there is zero chromatic dispersion, which would enable optimum bandwidths, but since then we redesigned the fiber core to shift the zero-dispersion point to 1550 nm.
