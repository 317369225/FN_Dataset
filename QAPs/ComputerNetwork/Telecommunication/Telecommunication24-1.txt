★Telecommunications: What does the arrival of high throughput satellites mean for the future of telecommunications?
Interestingly I was asked about doing some consultation on this a little while back... HTS or Ka Band and above satellites dramatically enhance the available bandwidth. The higher up in the spectrum you go the more effective bandwidth you get is a very simple way to look at things. One of the trade offs as you go higher in frequency is that you tend to get/need narrower beams. In response to this we see a rise in cellular beams which deliver tight coverage. This is cost but also can be a strength giving you a tighter focus and even more bandwidth due to spatial interleaving.    Embed Quote
