★What does a telecommunication job include?Someone told me, it includes manipulation and segregation of voluminous data of companies on Excel sheets using their pre-defined functions.
It might. Telecommunications is a massive industry responsible for trillions of dollars in spending. There will be 10's of thousands of different jobs. Some people will be analysts and look at data. Others work with customers, market products and services, sell things or design products and services. The list is almost endless. It would not be outrageous to say that virtually any graduate of any school could find a job in telecommunications. My first offer from a "telco" was for a quality control job in a Chrysler factory, inspecting new service trucks! Since then I've been in sales, service, design, product management and several other jobs in 4 different countries. And I've had a fairly narrow focus! Telecom is wide and deep. Growth in telecom is slowing so jobs are not as easy to get as years ago but the variety is certainly there.    Embed Quote
