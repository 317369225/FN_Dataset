★Is the telecommunications industry sustainable?ICT Sector Accounts for 2 Percent of Global Carbon Emissions.
Is the water supply industry sustainable? Of course it is, but what shape will the individual players have in the future? Will all the incumbents survive? These are the big questions. The same question applies to such a generalisation about the entire telecommunications industry. The concept of an industry around telecommunications is of course necessary, but there are players who will evolve with the market, there will be new players entering the market, there will be consolidation and there will be failures. Decline of some players or their sectors might be gradual or might be sudden but no one should say the entire industry is unsustainable.    Embed Quote
