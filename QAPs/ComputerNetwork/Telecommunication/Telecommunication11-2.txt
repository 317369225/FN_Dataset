★Is there any difference between telecommunication engineering and electronics & telecommunication engineering? Or its one and the same?if there is any difference please specify
Electronics and Communication Engineering(ECE) branch is specifically related with transmission of electrics signals. It deals with analog and digital transmission & reception of data, networking,voice and video, solid state devices, microprocessors, digital and analog communication, satellite communication, antennae and wave progression. It also deals with the manufacturing of electronic devices, circuits, and communications equipment like transmitter, receiver, integrated circuits, microwaves, and fiber among others. Telecommunication Engineering is a major field that falls under Electronics Engineering.Basically telecommunication is aimed to exchange information over a significant distance using electronic means. Apart from this, it also combines various aspects of electrical, structural and civil engineering as well. Telecommunications engineers handle different types of technology that help us to communicate. They research, design and develop satellite and cable systems, mobile phones, radio waves, the internet and e-mail. So ECE has a wider perspective,covering all types of data communication while telecommunication,as the name suggest,is concerned with telephony/wired communication/satellite communication. Though in undergrads the syllabus for both is moreover same.    Embed Quote
