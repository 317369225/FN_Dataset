★Why are IT companies filled with Electronics and Telecommunication engineers rather than IT Engineers?
Please note that this is my personal opinion and may not even reflect the truth... and that you won't like it. Most "ECE engineers" pumped out from engineering colleges today are not on par with what the core electronic industry demands. I come from ECE-NITW, and in final year, more than half of my class believed that a DFF is made of nand gates. If that is how the level of our current crop of electronic engineers are, how can one expect core companies to take us seriously? Nonetheless, as they are still mentally capable of higher order thinking and quite adept at basic problem solving (Come on, they made it through aieee, give them some credit)... they can still employ themselves in IT companies and contribute to society. It's not that I am belittling software jobs, nor am I saying that ece is superior/hard. Rather, it's easier to build an aptitude towards software than hardware as it's more tangible. Nevertheless, I don't think these electronic engineers could match up with true CS engineers. So, basically they lose at all spheres... and end up at IIPM (just kidding :P ) PS: I work as an ASIC Physical Design Engineer at Nvidia... and I have seen the hiring policy.    Embed Quote
