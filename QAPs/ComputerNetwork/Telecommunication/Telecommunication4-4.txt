★What are things that electronics and telecommunication engineers (ECE) know while other engineers don't?
You can increase(over clocking) as well as decrease(under clocking) the clock frequency of any system more than factory default. When your system hangs, most of the time it's not  because of hardware, it's a software one. In a 64 bit processor if you install 32 bit-OS, it can access utmost 4GB of RAM, while in a 64-bit processor with 64-bit OS, it can access more than 4GB of RAM. When you hear a hissing sound while using a laptop, it means actuator head is writing files onto your disk which can rotate at a speed ranging from 4200rpm to 15000rpm. If you drop your laptop from a height of 4-5ft on the hard disk side, the actuator can detach resulting in damage of your hard disk. If your pen drive uses FAT32 file system you cannot transfer a single file of size 4GB at a time,however you can convert the file system to NTFS and transfer a file of any size. Update: There's no electronic device which doesn't have a transistor in it's core circuit. There's a thing called "chip art" where a microscopic artwork is built into integrated circuits Ever wondered how your mobile vibrates? It's because of small dc motor. Why a camera can capture infra-red light from a tv remote, but not human eye? It's because the sensor element in cameras is a silicon detector and silicon has a peak response of 900 nm and Infra-red ranges from 700nm to 1mm.    Embed Quote
