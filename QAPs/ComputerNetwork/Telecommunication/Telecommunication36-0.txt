★Is CCNA Voice certification useful for Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering Student?
Yes, it can be useful if you want to move or are already working in a telecom company. But be mindful of the fact that this certification is going to be retired by 15 Aug this year. So you would be better off going for the CCNA collaboration certificate. But overall if you are from a reputed institute then you dont need to worry too much about certifications as a fresher for finding jobs.    Embed Quote
