★How far behind are Singapore telecommunication system compare to other countries with better telecommunication system?
SingTel has one of the highest quality networks in the world. During my time in Singapore they were consistently among the 5 best globally. I suggest a trip to Europe to try the mobile networks here to put things in perspective. I miss the incredibly good mobile coverage and quality in Singapore.    Embed Quote
