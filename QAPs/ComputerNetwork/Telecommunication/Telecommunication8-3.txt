★Is telecommunication also part of ICT?
As Tarek pointed out C in ICT is for Communications .. If you are extending Telecom to VAS ( Value added services  ) which is more of an individual accessing services ( and not communicating with friends or network) then in that part I believe Telecom has a span more than Communications . The VAS services of Telecom which would be like one interacting with systems and not communicating to person would be - browsing news, sports alerts, watching movies using data network etc ..    Embed Quote
