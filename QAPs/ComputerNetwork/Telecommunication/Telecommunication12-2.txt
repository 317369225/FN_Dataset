★How far behind are Singapore telecommunication system compare to other countries with better telecommunication system?
I work in the telecom sector and Singapore has one of the best infrastructures in the world I'll have to say. I feel one of the reasons why Singaporeans may feel that the service is below par is caused by congestion. Nonetheless, given the restrictions that the telcos face (and trust me, they are some pretty stupid restrictions not known to most people), the telcos are doing a pretty darn good good job at providing coverage. However, in terms of pricing, services, and content offered I'll have to say Singapore is less developed as compared to the more developed nations such as America, UK, Japan, and Korea.    Embed Quote
