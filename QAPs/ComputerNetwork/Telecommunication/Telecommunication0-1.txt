★What is the future of telecommunication?
For voice I would say the following: 2-5 years - VoIP, meaning a voice application accessed over a broadband connection, provided by companies that we know as telcos today, e.g., Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, etc. will become the dominant way of getting service, mobile and wireline. 4-8 years - VoIP given away as an app by companies I'll call Internet companies, e.g., Google, Microsoft, etc., will become commonplace 5-12 years - webRTC, meaning the ability to simply click and talk thru your browser, e.g., no telephone numbers, no telco, etc. will become commonplace.  If you want to talk to a friend you'll click on Facebook, a business colleague click on LinkedIn, a retail establishment - go to Google, etc.    Embed Quote
