★What are the telecommunication options in Tunisia?Sorry for my ignorance, but this is the very first time I travel to Tunisia (actually, to Africa at all). I would like to know if there are any operators offering pre-paid cards, what are the prices and so on. I will be there fo rtwo weeks. Also, what are the options for tourist like me regarding mobile internet.
If you're landing at Tunis-Carthage airport, there's a small team of Orange (France Telecom group),right after the customs, that does pretty good offers for prepaid. It might be your best option if you stay in big cities. However, if you plan to go to the desert or any remote/non-conventional touristic place, I'd advise you to go to Tunisie Telecom. They should have a small office in every airport. The other operator is Ooredoo, a Qatari operator. Their coverage is good but the service is usually bad and arrogant.    Embed Quote
