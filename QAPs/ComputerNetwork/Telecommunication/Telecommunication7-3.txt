★Is redundancy that important on a telecommunications network?
At the BBC I was always told 'we don't have redundancy on critical systems, we have a resilient design'. Their logic was that 'redundancy' implies surplus or substandard equipment as the secondary source. 2n or better is real resilience, n+1 is less so. Resilience is required to meet service level agreements (SLA) and if you fail to maintain the service as sold you will loose business. I have previously bought and sold non-resilient services and the customer has to know they are buying something substandard and that it could be lost.    Embed Quote
