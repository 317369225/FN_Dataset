★What is the future of telecommunication?
How far into the future?  Michio Kaku makes his business in future prediction.  His books The Future of the Mind and Physics of the Future take a shot at telecommunications. An excerpt from Michio Kaku's "The Future of the Mind" suggests that mind-to-mind communication can be a legitimate possibility. In a shorter horizon, TeleHaptics (the manipulation of touch at a distance) will likely become more commonplace. Shorter still, low-tech telemmerty (aka the Internet of Things) combined with gigantic storage and computer farms tethered togetehr with high bandwidth connections and clever "Big Data" algorithms will be able to consolidate previously impenetrable gobs of data and offer new insights, whether for good (curing diseases) or ill (planning crimes). Your unwavering taskmaster is the Speed of Light, which makes things like collaborative musical performances over a network difficult to impossible.  However, any digital exchange that can suffer a few hundred milliseconds of delay is fair game.  The question is: What things can you model digitally and properly interpret and recreate at a distant site.  In general, if you can make a digital model of it, you can move it over a telecommunications network. The future is limited by your imagination and your capacity to model a message digitally.    Embed Quote
