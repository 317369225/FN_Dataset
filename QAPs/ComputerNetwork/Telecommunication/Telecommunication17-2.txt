★What is the difference between Electronics & Communication Engineering and Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering?
Based on the titles alone, the "electronics and telecommunication" course will put more or exclusive emphasis on video. I would encourage you to get a breakdown of the syllabus of each to see which fits you best. Don't worry about it too much as electronics is electronics. I have worked on a lot of different things in the last 37 years, and understanding fundamental concepts is the most important thing. You could train in communications and go to work on lab equipment and figure it out pretty quickly.    Embed Quote
