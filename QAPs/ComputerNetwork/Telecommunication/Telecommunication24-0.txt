★Telecommunications: What does the arrival of high throughput satellites mean for the future of telecommunications?
Echoing Bob Hannent These new satellites (AVANTI, Inmarsat) deliver broadband to relatively small areas ("small" = thousands of square miles, instead of "most of a continent" !) They are also surprisingly cost effective It won't affect metro areas, but it will mean rural broadband gets a boost (sparsely populated areas like Scotland, mid-West USA, etc)  and broadband for remote regions (west china, sub-saharan africa etc) gets DRAMATICALLY better A village with WiFi and a 3G small cell base station, backhauled over satellite and you have decent connectivity at a price those villagers can afford. (Decent = good for web, email, voice. Rubbish for games as the ping time is too long, and you wouldn't do Netflix as it is too expensive) It won't affect things in areas that have alternatives: fibre, DSL, LTE are faster / better / cheaper where they exist. But in places they do not exist and probably will get years / forver before they do exist then this is going to be bloody marvellous. Satellite Data Communications | Avanti PLC    Embed Quote
