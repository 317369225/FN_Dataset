★Why are IT companies filled with Electronics and Telecommunication engineers rather than IT Engineers?
TL;DR as the general gist of the other replies state the number of jobs is indeed a crucial factor when it comes to eventual employment for a typical EnT grad. I'll like to add a different side. Most of the current crop took up this field fresh after their entrance exam prep thinking they really had a knack for physics (because lets be honest who likes chemistry in this country? Pre-breaking bad strictly speaking. And math? Come-on its Engineering, I mean come-on). And physics, truth be told, does not pay in this country. Hey, electronics look likes a good place for a 'billionaire, playboy, genius, philanthropist'. Then,you know, some grew up, some realised it was not their cup of tea, some deluded themselves...and against all odds some were actually good at this. But I digress, we here in India take our undergrad education way too seriously. Most of us are not making great decisions when we are 20-21, we chase after fickle things like money and that 'phorein' job, not to say the jobs themselves are fickle. Some will fit right away, some will take their time and some will not. But it is an inconvenient albeit necessary part of growing up.    Embed Quote
