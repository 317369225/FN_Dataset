★What is the difference between medium and channel in telecommunication?
I think Paul Patras's answer definitely covers the technical aspect of the question. I would like to add the linguistic differences in the telecom or general communications domain. When considering a general Communications Model, the medium & channel can be interchangeably used linguistically to mean the same thing. The reason here is that usually in any communication model, the information flow is shown from a source to an intended recipient. For that recipient the channel & the medium are interchangeable but when  talking about technologies using FDM, then the term channel is a specific technological term.    Embed Quote
