★Is redundancy that important on a telecommunications network?
Short Answer: Yes. Long Answer: Equipment fails over time. Equipment also needs to be updated and replaced over time. Imagine a telecommunications network with no redundancy. Every time equipment needed to be replaced customers would have to go down. Having at least N+1 redundancy is widely considered a best practice for production telecommunications networks. This is not mention just plain old equipment failures, which also occur from time to time.
