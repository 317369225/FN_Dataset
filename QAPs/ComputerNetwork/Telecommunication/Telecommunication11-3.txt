★Is there any difference between telecommunication engineering and electronics & telecommunication engineering? Or its one and the same?if there is any difference please specify
Going by the name of the stream, there is a difference as pointed out by Kush Tripathi. But with respect to the content of the courses, it depends a lot on the University you are studying at. If you look at Visvesvaraya Technological University, there is not much difference between Electronics & Communications Engineering and Telecommunication Engineering. 6th semester onwards, 1-2 courses are different in the curriculum and even these courses are offered in the other stream as electives. It is a similar story at other Universities too.    Embed Quote
