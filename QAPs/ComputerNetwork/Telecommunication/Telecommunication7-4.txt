★Is redundancy that important on a telecommunications network?
Traditionally the answer is yes however its impossible to answer the question without taking into account service offerings,telecommunications networks are vast in scope and requirements and not all pitch reliability as a leading factor. The business aspects are often the driving force, cost may be the underlining requirement,then reliability is undercut.   In short...it depends...its all about the business and inherently service requirements of the the network.    Embed Quote
