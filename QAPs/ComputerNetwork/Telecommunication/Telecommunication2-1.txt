★Is the telecommunications industry sustainable?ICT Sector Accounts for 2 Percent of Global Carbon Emissions.
No, it isn't. Just as any fossil-fueled industries. Unless we're able to shrink the data and the traffic to an unprecedented level to minimize the natural resource consumption. Then would be some hope, considering the increasingly high demands and negative effects. The consequences of industrialization: Low wasteful energy efficiency; High risk of accident in work and transport; Pollution and global warming; Resource depletion; Economic recession and collapse; Terrorism and war; Greater natural/artificial catastrophe. How do I stop global warming? 2013 study: ICT Sector Accounts for 2 Percent of Global Carbon Emissions. A new study reveals that the information, communication and technology (ICT) industry contributes to about 2 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, the same amount that the aviation industry produces. Researchers involved in the new study have projected that the emission of carbon by the ICT sector is likely to double by the year 2020. How can telcos reduce their network costs? I'm making my efforts of smaller and smarter data: Atrig brochure 2015 My approach for secure communication: Are random numbers truly random if generated from algorithms? My roadmap: Using symmetric key chain (fast, invisible) vs. public key (slow, visible); Improving router's predictivity of chaotic signals to optimize the transmission; Implementing cheap and efficient municipal wireless networks; Cutting down telecom and industrial infrastructure, as well as the stressful commuting; Decentralizing the economy to small household and workshop networks of producing intelligent gadgets; Approaching sustainability. The final frontier, in 1 more century hopefully: Is Strong AI really achievable?    Embed Quote
