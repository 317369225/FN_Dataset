★What are things that electronics and telecommunication engineers (ECE) know while other engineers don't?
Ah ! This is my favorite: 1. The radio. the AM Radio. The tuning circuit, the IF section. It is a wonder of wonder and only E&C people understand and enjoy this work of nature and technology. 2. The telephone - the silent unsung hero with glorious past. 3. The DTMF on any mobile and the design of their frequencies. 4. The pleasure of designing your own circuits ( Analog/ Digital) and seeing it work perfectly as intended. -unparallelled. 5. The miracle called oscillators. How they start oscillating and how they maintain perfect sine waves - never stops to delight me.    Embed Quote
