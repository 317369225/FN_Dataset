★What is the difference between Electronics & Communication Engineering and Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering?
From a job perspective, there is no difference. Also, from a subjects perspective, telecommunications is a specialization as far as communication is concerned. So, while choosing courses, esp in India, I would not be too concerned either ways. Hope that helps. Thanks for A2A.    Embed Quote
