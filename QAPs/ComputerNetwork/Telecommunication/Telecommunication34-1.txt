★Why are IT companies filled with Electronics and Telecommunication engineers rather than IT Engineers?
While Sonal Pinto has nailed it superbly I would just add that IT has a lot of jobs to offer as compared to Electronics/Telecommunications. Just compare the biggest IT companies in all these sectors. Some of the biggest companies of the world Apple, Google, Microsoft, Oracle and numerous others are all IT/Software. Then there are hundreds of startups in Silicon Valley and all over the world building software. Hundreds of thousands of people are employed by consulting companies like Accenture, Infosys, Tata, Capgemini etc. and they are top of the line companies with multi billion dollars of market cap each offering excellent career opportunities. Now compare that with some telecom and electronics engineering companies. An ECE graduate can target INTEL which is 100B company, much smaller than several IT companies. I will not talk about telecommunications because we all know what is happening with that and where all those jobs are going. Then comes the urge to build something. Everyone at some point in his career wants to build something of his own and prove his worth. This is the ultimate satisfying experience and IT makes it possible to do just that from your own bedroom. All you need is a PC and an idea to code. The point is IT market is much bigger than other markets and its manpower cannot satisfy its hunger alone. We have not counted many other industries yet like Finance which employs heaps of graduates and pay them very well for designing some of the most robust applications in the world.    Embed Quote
