★Why are telecommunication companies highly leveraged?
Telcos have to make massive capital investments in infrastructure but the returns on that investment are reasonably certain, especially over long periods of time. Almost everything the telco world is carefully planned and executed, technology is rarely applied before it is well understood and the capital expense of projects is usually managed. But the large cap ex of building infrastructure to serve millions of people is heavy on the books. Roll out of technology that only serves a small portion of the population and takes a long period to return isn't effective but a large investment with a multi-year return is good for investors to buy into. Also telcos have regular investment needs as a result of upgrading their networks, so they will have various debts of different maturity.    Embed Quote
