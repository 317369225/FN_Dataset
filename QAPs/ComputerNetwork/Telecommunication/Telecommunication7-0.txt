★Is redundancy that important on a telecommunications network?
The importance and value of redundancy in a telecommunications network is entirely dependent on the use case you have in mind.  This is really no different than building any kind of infrastructure (telco, internet, intranet, web et cetera).  You consider your use case and user expectations to determine the level of availability and, thus, redundancy that is required. If you are building a system that will be used by consumers, they might have lower tolerances that could reduce some of the cost and redundancy.  However, "carrier-grade" systems always rely on at least N+1 physical redundancy at every layer of the stack in order to achieve at least 99.999% (five 9's) of availability.  This level of redundancy enables you to continue serving your customers even if any element has been removed from any layer of your infrastructure. So, the question really isn't whether redundancy is that important on a telecommunications network but whether it's that important on your network.  If your users expect you to provide a high level of availability, then you should be building your infrastructure using best practices for redundancy.  If your users have minimal up-time expectations, then you can skip some of the redundancy and focus on the bottom line.    Embed Quote
