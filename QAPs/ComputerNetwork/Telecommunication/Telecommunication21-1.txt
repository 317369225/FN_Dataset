★What is the future of pricing strategies for telecommunication companies?
I would suggest that mobile and fixed have very different kinds of cost structures and will evolve in different ways. Fixed has almost zero incremental cost for usage and therefore can move to the "all you can eat" model. Mobile has real cost for usage and therefore must maintain some kind of usage based pricing. Here I think that the underlying asset costing will be commoditized and additional services will be overlaid on the top. Some services are more likely to be offered by external parties but there are some that will be better for the mobile network provider to offer either because they have a customer information advantage or can control the user experience. Interestingly most communication services benefit from network effect and will be better with external parties. Of course all of this changes in a world of convergence, which will be different market to market.    Embed Quote
