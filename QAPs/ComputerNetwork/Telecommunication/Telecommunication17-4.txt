★What is the difference between Electronics & Communication Engineering and Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering?
If your intention is to compare the courses being taught under the two names in different indian universities then it is safe to consider them same. The syllabus of both the courses are same. (There may be exceptions but I am not aware of any in indian context) However having majored in Electronics and Communication Engineering I can state that the difference in nomenclature does imply some technical differences. You can consider Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (ETE) as a subset of Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE). The later cover all kinds of electronics based communication but the former limits to only telephony based communication. My typing of this answer, its being transmitted to you and your reading of this answer on your computer/smart phone comes under the umbrella of ECE but not ETE. An ETE course must cover Semiconductors, various devices based on them and their abstractions (courses on Analog Electronic Circuits,Digital & Switching Circuits and Systems, Microprocessor, Linear IC Systems, Embedded System, Power Electronics etc) as an introduction to Electronics. Courses dealing with Signals & Systems, Electromagnetic Waves, Antennas, Analog Communication, Microwave Engineering, Digital Signal Processing, Digital Communication etc are taught to introduce the Communication Engineering. Advanced Mathematics are also integral to the ETE. In addition to above,  courses on computer communication, networking , Data communication etc are part of ECE. But, to iterate what I wrote in beginning, in the context of indian universities they are one and same.    Embed Quote
