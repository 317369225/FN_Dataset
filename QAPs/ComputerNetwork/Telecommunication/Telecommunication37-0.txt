★Which is the next major upcoming technology in mobile telecommunication after 4G?
Your smart phone today is the evolution of a phone and a computer, so speed of communication and computing power and capability are the driving forces behind its future change ( yes, I'm stating the obvious ). The software - hardware development cycle is likely to bring in the quickest changes. Advances in MEMS technologies could bring longer battery life and other capabilities to your smart phone and the software apps making use of such could make your smart phone rival your laptop, tablet or Desktop. The biggest current issue being the limitation of your Smartphone's screen. If a suitable projection technology surfaces, Your smartphone will likely replace all of your other devices. So in my opinion, advances in display technology (holographic, resolution, etc.) are likely to be the next disruptive innovation in the mobile space. Prior to that, it's going to be all about apps. In the menwhile, here's a sneak peek at a concept in the making :-    Embed Quote
