★What is the difference between medium and channel in telecommunication?
The terms medium and channel are often used interchangeably in the technical literature when referring to wireless communications, but for accuracy a few things are worth noting. The transmission medium is literally the material that allows the propagation of an electromagnetic signal. This can be twisted copper, coaxial cable or air in the case of radio wave transmissions. The wireless medium is viewed as a collection of radio frequency bands whose propagation characteristics depend on their frequency range. Frequency bands are often channelised, i.e. they are divided into units of fixed bandwidth --think of 20MHz Wi-Fi channels, 6MHz analogue TV channels, or the different physical channels used in UMTS (3G cellular). Further, to maximise the capacity of the system and allow several users to share the wireless medium, multiple access protocols are employed. These protocol allow users to communicate simultaneously over logical channels, that can correspond to e.g. different time slots in the case of TDMA systems or different set of sub-carriers in the case of newer OFDMA architectures.    Embed Quote
