★What is the difference between Electronics & Communication Engineering and Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering?
I would suggest that, you must get a copy of the syllabus for both courses, so that you can compare them directly. I would speculate that 'Electronics & Communication is a more general course ('Communication'  covers a wide range of possible applications) whereas the other option (Telecommunications) suggests it may specialise in a narrower area, ie. what it says, Telecommunications.   (So, 'phone systems).    Embed Quote
