★What are things that electronics and telecommunication engineers (ECE) know while other engineers don't?
These people tend to be the real geeks in reality, 1. ECE people know how their day to day gadgets work. Let's take mobile as an example. No other engineer would know that within a single frequency for a unit time of a second , 8 subscribers can be made to use the channel. No one else would know that due to code division multiplexed access (CDMA) mobile phone speech clarity would be lesser than that of conventional landline phone that operates at 4khz bandwidth of continuous signal . 2. A normal engineer wouldn't even know what happens within a satellite. What transponders are. How attitude control and antenna gain affects the quality of it. 3. Only ECE folks would appreciate the fact about GPS that offers atomic clock precision to our local clock and does triangulation by complicated algorithm just by using four satellites at any point of Time. 4. Only a ece student could realize what a single clock pulse could do and what does a 2.8ghz processor with four cores and hyper threading do in a second. 5. Programmers from computer based streams knows the value of programs they write but couldn't even possibly know how their compiled machine code of 1's and 0's gets their job done.. Ece people knows that from the level of flip flops , gates , transistors up to the elevated level of micro controllers and processors. 6. Only a electronics student would appreciate how cool it is to get our voice transmitted wireless through FM/AM 7. Only these people would find joy in making electro & electromechanical stuff like servos , actuators , LCDs , gps and gsm perform the way they wish . Even though some (just some) of these things might be known to other branch of people. But none knows all of these except a ECE guy/girl. -A proud ECEian B)    Embed Quote
