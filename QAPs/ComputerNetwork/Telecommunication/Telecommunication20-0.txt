★What is the scope for an electronics and telecommunication engineer?How can he enhance his knowledge?
When I was in telecomm, the engineers I knew were often designing and configuring large phone systems (branch exchanges), land line infrastructure, email systems, and fax networks. To give you an idea of how long ago that was, the largest line we put in was a T1 and Group 3 fax was considered fast. We're several generations beyond that now. Electronics and telecommunications are intricately bound up in data transfer, computing, and streaming. You could range from combining your background with Security and being on the cutting edge of information security, or looking at portable cellular technology and join a start up building adhoc private cell systems to serve events. I think there's a ton of opportunity out there. Good luck!    Embed Quote
