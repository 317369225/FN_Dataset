★What are the reasons for the scarcity of jobs in the Electronics and Telecommunication field?I mean back few years there was a trend of joining this field but there are no jobs.
According to me every ece graduates just think that the competition is high within these limited core companies which is actually to a great extent is correct but give up just by thinking this way is not the solution. From the thinking of being in the safe side and additional family pressure let them join any of IT companies and at last we complaining with ourselves that there are scarcity of job in the field of so called 'ECE'.    Embed Quote
