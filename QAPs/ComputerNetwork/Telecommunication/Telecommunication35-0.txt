★What are paper presentation topics for electronics and telecommunication?
If you are a rookie, give a presentation on whatever topic you lay your eyes upon. Pic up any subject from third/ final year and do it. If you are in final year, you may tell them about latest ARM architectures, Intel Haswell/ Sandy Bridge/ Ivy Bridge/ Tik Tok. You may also explore nanotechnology topics like CMOS 12 nm fabrication process.    Embed Quote
