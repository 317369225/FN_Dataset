★Why are IT companies filled with Electronics and Telecommunication engineers rather than IT Engineers?
There are number of reasons for this.   1. I feel that there are numerous IT companies and very few Electronics companies across the world. ( Though I do think Electronics work is more tangible and can be seen everywhere.)   2. IT companies are like the refuge centers (only pun intended). Those who cannot get into the "Core" companies, finally get refuge in IT companies, primarily becuase they dont require many skills other than analytical thinking and communication skills.   3. Particularly, the mindset of people in India has shifted drastically from the day when IT evolved. I hear this quite often - "My child/I took Electronics, as it is more of a safe bet." All is well if he is employed in electronics company other wise we always a have a plan B, by getting into IT industry.   4. Electronics companies have high standards and thus dont welcome undergraduates. We see many post graduades and geeks in this industry.     PS: Working in a IT company, I can definetely say that Computer science and IT graduates are more than Electronics graduates in this industry.    Embed Quote
