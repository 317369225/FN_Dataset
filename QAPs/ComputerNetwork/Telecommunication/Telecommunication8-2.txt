★Is telecommunication also part of ICT?
This term is trying to define the converging reality of network communications that is seeing the separate role of Telecommunications fade, but, unfortunately, IP telephony is only suitable for intra-office for the most part still today, except where it is integrated into the local packet-switched network at the demarcation point. The local carriers pretty much have a monopoly on this capability, and they are attempting to use is to punch back the entrance of competitors.  But, in the end, this is a lost battle, thought it may be years still before telecom and data can run on the same circuits across the country or around the world reliably (without pipelining and cut-outs.) Still, the introduction of this term just is an affectation to me.  It adds nothing unique or valuable to the issue.   The integration of these streams is just coming under IT as it is IT.    Embed Quote
