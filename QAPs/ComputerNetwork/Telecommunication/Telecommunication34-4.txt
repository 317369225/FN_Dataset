★Why are IT companies filled with Electronics and Telecommunication engineers rather than IT Engineers?
It has many reasons * Number of IT companies has grown at much faster rate than the Electronics companies. So IT companies has more vacancies. * Salary :  If you are getting more in IT company then EC company why won't u choose IT. As most of us study to get good job. * Passion: Many students try to get CS branch at the starting of their Btech but they don't because of their rank , their interest  makes them to go for IT * It companies doesn't need hard coder what they want is smart guys who can learn very fast and who has basic knowledge about coding. *And I personally feel that in IT companies IT engineers are more . EC guys seems to be more because because of their huge strength    Embed Quote
