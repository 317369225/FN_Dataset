â˜…Skyfall (2012 movie): Why would Q attach the computer of a known cyberterrorist to the MI6 computer network?Is he the worst digital forensics investigator in history?
In reality there are a great many ways such a situation could have been prevented and worse still, there are plenty of ways that this plot element could have happened without going this highly unlikely route. In any normal situation a computer would only be attached to another computer running dedicated VM's (Virtual Machines) and also the computer used would likely be isolated from the main network. The virtual machines would allow any data that is going in or out to be assessed in real time to look for any security exploits being used. A virtual machine allows you to say have Windows 7 installed on your computer but then for example boot up a fully functional Linux OS inside of Windows. Any compatible OS will work. The virtual machine then runs as if it was its own computer and cannot generally touch any of the resources of the host machine that are used by the core OS. A popular example of this kind of software would be VirtualBox but certainly Q would have his own VM software that could actually audit the traffic and watch what it is doing for unusual data calls and such that might indicate a virus. Mcafee, Norton (symantec) and other virus companies use methods like this so you would think it would be a no brainer for Q. For those that have never used a VM this might give you an idea of how it works. Keep in mind the virtual system you create is completely separate from the installed os on the computer and theoretically they never touch each other.
