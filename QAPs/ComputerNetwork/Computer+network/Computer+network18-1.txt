â˜…Skyfall (2012 movie): Why would Q attach the computer of a known cyberterrorist to the MI6 computer network?Is he the worst digital forensics investigator in history?
Because he's young, smart and arrogant. The movie (Silva) also mock him for his arrogance by taunting him: not so smart boy (or something like that). I think it is natural or cliche for characters like this to make mistakes and grow from it. I think that's also why I like Skyfall very much, every character has a bit of a humanity in them. They're still very much the stock characters as before, but just a bit more flaws to make them interesting.
