â˜…Is computer networks a boring area?
Wow. Where to start. First of all, network engineers do not generally review any code. Personally, I'm different, but for the most part, certified network engineers are not programmers. Second of all, network speeds have increased quite a bit. Unshielded Twisted Pair for instance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IE... 1990: 10Base-T 1995: 100Base-TX 1999: 1000Base-T 2006: 10GBase-T Each increment here is a 10x increase, or between 3 (4.5 years) & 4 (6 years) cycles of Moore's law. It's clearly doing a pretty good job of keeping up despite real practical limitations. Backwards compatibility has a lot to do with that. I'm using UTP Ethernet as an example, but other protocols could also be examined. I am very passionate about this field, I assure you. Security, Reliability, Redundancy, & Flexibility are all a big deal, subject to immediate reality tests. Between liability and reputation damage they can bring a company to its knees. I'm sorry you haven't met anyone like me before, but I can assure you we do exist. At the end of the day, practicing Network Engineers are more on the applied side. A lot of programmers are also on the applied side, but they generally do not risk reputation like the network people. The tests offered to us are often much more immediate and the stakes are often a lot higher than meeting a development deadline that can be extended. We're kind of like the Coast Guard; no one appreciates us until they need us.
