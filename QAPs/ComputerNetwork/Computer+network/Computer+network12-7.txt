★What are the best undergraduate textbooks on computer networks?This is for someone with a computer/electrical engineering background
"Communication Networks: Fundamental Concepts and Key Architecture" by Prof. Leon Garcia from University of Toronto is one the amazing book on Computer Networks I've come across, It's concise and covers broad range of topic to some details while just scratching the irrelevant (outdated)  topics on surface. It's very easy to understand and that's where it sometimes get boring (too much of story wrting!) However you can be sure of understanding a topic fully by reading a chapter fully, almost no point is left unclear. You can say it's a good encyclopaedia for this fields. Computer Networks: A Systems Approach and Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet while introducing networking from different perspectives, are equally amazing!
