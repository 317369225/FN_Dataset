â˜…What is the difference between client socket and server socket (in computer networking)?
To give emphasis, in TCP, both client and server can send and receive. So the distinction is not in the sending and receiving. It is in how the connection is created. Server Socket - is created to bind() to a port and listen() for a connect() from a client. So a server just waits for a conversation and doesn't start one. Client Socket - is created to connect() to a listen() server. The client initiates the connection. Think of an inbound call center as an example. These services are servers. They don't initiate a call but wait for a call to come in from clients. Once the calls are in, they can engage in a two way conversation.
