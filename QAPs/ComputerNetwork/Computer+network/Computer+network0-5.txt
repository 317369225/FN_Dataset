★Is computer networks a boring area?
One fun fact / story about networking.  A former student of ours was a HVAC professional.  (heating and cooling)  He ended up taking a few courses in networking to get up to speed on all the smart thermostats and the networking between thermostats, cooling systems for server rooms etc..  Here is a guy that found a way to connect hvac and networking. the point i am making here is that networking is involved in everything we do and will continue to do so.  Boring in some areas?  Unlimited potential?  i think so,  you could do your statement on the future integrations between networking and other areas that may or may not be as obvious as HVAC.
