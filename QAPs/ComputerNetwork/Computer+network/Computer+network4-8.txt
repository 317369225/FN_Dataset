★What is the most important computer networking protocol?
If you understand what protocols are , and if you are aware of the TCP/IP model , it totally depends on the application that you are developing as long as you have a protocol for all the layers. If you do not have basic understanding of what protocols are , first read the obsolete ISO OSI model , then TCP/IP model.  Andrew S. Tanenbaum , in his book Distributed Systems , Principles and paradigms , in the chapter named Communication, under the heading Layered Protocols, (and I am purposely referring to this book and not his Computer Networks book since this one contains brief summary of what protocols are , omitting the details) , describes what protocols are . ( http://net.pku.edu.cn/~course/cs... )  As  I said earlier , the importance of protocols are determined by the requirement of your application . for eg :  video streaming uses UDP while TCP can be used in communication between two applications where message losses are not acceptable , both belong to the same layer.
