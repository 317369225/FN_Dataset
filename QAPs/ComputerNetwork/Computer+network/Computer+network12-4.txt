â˜…What are the best undergraduate textbooks on computer networks?This is for someone with a computer/electrical engineering background
I would second Computer Networks: A Systems Approach. Slightly outdated but equally good (with emphasis on engineering challenges) is An Engineering Approach to Computer Networking.
