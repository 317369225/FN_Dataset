★What are the best undergraduate textbooks on computer networks?This is for someone with a computer/electrical engineering background
"Computer networking: A top-down approach" by professor James Kurose at UMass Amherst and professor Keith Ross at Polytechnic Institute of New York University. Believe me, it is the best computer networking book. It is comprehensive book with a great pedagogical method. Instead of describing from physical layers to the higher layers as the others do which is somewhat tedious and hard to understand, this book uses top-down approach so it is easier to follow and makes  us curious enough to turn a new page :). It also has a large number of reference materials for any topic it mentions.
