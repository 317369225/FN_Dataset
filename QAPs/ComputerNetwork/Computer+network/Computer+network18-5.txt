★Skyfall (2012 movie): Why would Q attach the computer of a known cyberterrorist to the MI6 computer network?Is he the worst digital forensics investigator in history?
This one's been bugging me since I saw the movie on Saturday. Ultimately, I was thinking it was simply because the plot required it, much like the non-hex password sitting right there in hex code. Then I realized it's actually more subtle than that, and there is a storyline-logic reason for it.  The only reason that fits that I could come up with is that Q is used to the high-tech, fully-secured environment in the new MI6 headquarters.  When they move to the warrens, and set up a secondary network, something gets overlooked - but Q never double-checks it.  He just assumes that the network there must be as secure as he's used to, because he's never had to question security.  This is why it takes him a second or two to even realize that he's the one who "cocked it up".
