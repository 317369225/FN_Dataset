★What are the seminal papers and RFCs in computer networking?
Here are five papers I can think of: D. Clark, The design philosophy of the DARPA internet protocols, SIGCOMM 1988.  It explains why the Internet is designed the way it is. J. H. Saltzer, D. P. Reed, and D. D. Clark, End-to-end arguments in system design, ACM TOCS 2(4), November 1984.  This paper presents a basic design principle for computer systems, which is widely application to networking systems. V. Jacobson, Congestion avoidance and control, SIGCOMM 1988.  This paper documents major and important changes in TCP mechanisms, in particular, the introduction of congestion windows, slow start, and a better retransmission timer. Vern Paxson, End-to-end Internet packet dynamics, IEEE/ACM TON, 7(3), June 1999.  Paxson pioneered a large-scale measurement study that gives insights into pathological network behaviour, packet losses, bandwidth, and delay of the Internet at the time. Robert M. Metcalfe and David R. Boggs. Ethernet: distributed packet switching for local computer networks. CACM, 19(7), July 1976. The original Ethernet paper.
