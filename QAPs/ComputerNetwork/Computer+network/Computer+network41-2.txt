â˜…What is the significance of 127.0.0.1 in computer networks?
127.0.0.1 is a reserved IP address conventionally used as a computer's loopback address. The applications running on localhost generally use this loopback mechanism. Network software and utilities can use 127.0.0.1 to access a local computer's TCP/IP network resources. Messages sent to loopback address do not reach outside the LAN and are automatically re-routed by the computer's own network adapter back to the receiving end of the TCP/IP stack. Its like saying Hello to yourself to check if you can "speak" (sending the message) and "hear" (Receiving the message) properly. Establishing a network connection to the 127.0.0.1 loopback address is accomplished in the same manner as establishing one with any remote computer or device on the network. The primary difference is that the connection avoids using the local network interface hardware. System administrators and application developers commonly use 127.0.0.1 to test applications. Typically all IP addresses in the range 127.0.0.1 - 127.255.255.255 are reserved for private use.
