★What are some good books on computer networking?
My Personal Favorites are For learning the concepts: 1) Computer Networking - Top Down Approach  -- Kurose, Ross ( Best for a Beginner . This is so interactive that, sometimes you feel that you are actually involved with this book :p. No prerequisites are required for this and It is written marvelously for anyone to get interested in networking ) 2) Computer Networks -- Tanenbaum ( Good but, dry. Well formed Contents, Should have some basic understanding of data communications before reading this book ) 3) TCP/IP illustrated -- Richard Stevens Vol 1 ( Its a Gem ) I would suggest you to read 1 or 2 initially, but after getting pace start reading 3rd book, it is the best book for understanding the protocols and their working scenarios. It is written by Stevens who is considered as a Networking Guru. For programming: Unix Network Programming Vol 1 Sockets API - Richard Stevens Unix Network Programming Vol 2 Inter process Communication - Richard Stevens ( These are helpful if you would like to program in UNIX environment using C . I would strongly suggest anyone to learn Network programming in UNIX using C )
