â˜…Cyberwarfare: Isn't the USA also hacking into Chinese corporations and government institutions computer networks?
Quite possibly, but if so, the US deserves to be taken to task for it as well. It is an extremely common rhetorical move by supporters of the Chinese government to sidestep any criticism (without directly responding to it on its own terms) by attempting to aim it at the United States. You will see this technique used constantly in online discussions -- including on Quora -- and in official communications such as the one quoted here. The implication is either that the Chinese position is more or less, "Two wrongs make a right," or, more ironically if you parse it to this extent, that they believe the US is the model of moral behavior and thus that any action the US takes is automatically above reproach if it's also taken by someone else. Unfortunately, it's possible for two parties to do the same thing and for it to be wrong in both cases. "But he's doing it too!" wasn't a good defense when we were six years old, and it doesn't fly in international relations either.
