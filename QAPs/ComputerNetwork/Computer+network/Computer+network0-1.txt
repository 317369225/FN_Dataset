★Is computer networks a boring area?
Since you are looking to do a Master's thesis, and apparently can't find the "next big thing" in Computer Networks, I will try to point out some areas which are very relevant right now and interesting(?) too. 1. Datacenter Networking: With the likes of Facebook, Google and Amazon taking center-stage in the Internet world, Datacenter networking is bound to become more and more important. From finding solutions to Ethernet scalability problems in a datacenter to designing new architectures (see Portland, VL2)[1][2], there is possibly still a lot of scope for improvement. Exploring RDMA/Infiniband is another option. Modifying TCP to suit datacenter needs is yet another active area of research[5]. I should point out that "innovation" is relatively fast in this space, since Datacenters are privately  managed by companies, unlike the Internet where deployment of protocols can be terribly slow (IPv6). 2. Software-defined Networking: Think that TCP/IP is not interesting enough? Maybe try designing protocol/policies for your own network and see how it fares. Software-designed networking using Openflow[3], for example, can be a great learning experience. 3. White Space Networking: As the frequency space becomes increasingly congested with all sorts of devices, White space networking[4] utilizing unused capacity of already licensed channels provides a promising solution to these woes. 4. Wireless Networking: Internet protocols have been traditionally designed keeping wired Internet in mind. That's why, many of them need to be completely/partially modified to be suitable for wireless networks. Indirect TCP, Snooping TCP [6] come to mind. If you are more evil-types, you can look at designing selfish wireless nodes or still better, detecting and penalizing selfish nodes[7]. Hope that this answer would help change your perception.
