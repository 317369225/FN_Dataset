★What are the best undergraduate textbooks on computer networks?This is for someone with a computer/electrical engineering background
I was also an electrical engineering major. I dont remember which of these was the  textbook but I do recall having these as the recommended texts: Computer Networks: A Systems Approach Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet . Computer Networks by Andrew S. Tanenbaum My favorite is the Systems Approach book. Also if you are good in C, Beej's Guide to Network Programming is a very good start before you delve into the details.
