â˜…How do I learn Computer Networking in an effective and practical way?
My suggestion is.. Don't start with reference books. TCP/IP, networking has come into existence long back and many authors, bloggers, researchers have put everything in simple terms which are all available in internet. I can give one example: Beej's Guide to Network Programming The author puts everything in fun way and skips of all complicated parts and just gives references. If you start with such books and such guides, you will develop interest and understanding using which latter you can go for reference books and in-depth study. Follow these steps 1. Search for a topic on google. e.g., TCP/IP or firewall or DNS or HTTP 2. See various links presented. Skip off the ones that has too much technical details during initial study. 3. Read the pages which explain things in little simpler terms, some like "How stuff works" kind of pages. 4. Once you understood the concept and saw some practical applications of it, then go for technical details. We have lot of knowledge around in the internet my friend, only you need to chose wisely and grasp the concepts.
