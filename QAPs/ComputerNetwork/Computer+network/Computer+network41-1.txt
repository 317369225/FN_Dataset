â˜…What is the significance of 127.0.0.1 in computer networks?
127.0.0.1 is known as a loopback address. Simply put, if you are locally using a machine and want to verify that your network interface card is working correctly, open terminal or a CLI and ping that address. If you get a response, your hardware is good to go. Another use is if you are using a machine that hosts a webpage or other http service, opening a browser and keying that address should open the page that is hosted on that box. For example, if you use SickBeard or CouchPotato, opening a browser and keying 127.0.0.1:8081 or :5050 respectively should route you to those pages.
