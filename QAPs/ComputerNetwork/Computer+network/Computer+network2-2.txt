★What's next in computer networking?What is the new technology, architect or protocol in the field of networking
Professional networking is growing in a way that better utilizes technology to make meeting potential business connections more efficient and relevant.  Just as dating apps have been popping up everywhere to make it quicker and easier to meet your "match" in person, tech is making business networking "smarter" so you can make face to face connections with people who can genuinely make a difference in your professional life. As our digital presences become more and more closely related with our real-life personalities (remember when picking a username meant "Networking_girl525" as opposed to "Emma Borochoff"?) and we make more data about ourselves and our goals available online, networks like LinkedIn and networking apps can give us smarter suggestions about who we should meet and then gives us the means to through instant and personal messaging.  Technology can't (or at least, shouldn't) replace the in-person aspect of professional networking, but it can speed up the process and efficiency of meeting the "right" people.  It's definitely been a much slower process than the growth of more casual social networking- but it's getting there!
