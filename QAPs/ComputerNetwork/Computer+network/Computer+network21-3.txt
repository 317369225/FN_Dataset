â˜…How do I learn Computer Networking in an effective and practical way?
It is actually quite easy to do. I dropped out of college; I wanted to become a musician way too much. Where I come from, music doesn't pay the bills all that much so I had to find a career that I liked, and more importantly, understood. Computer networks presented itself in a weird way. I went for this internship kind of a thing - and the first task I took on was to create a Squid server running on Linux to serve as a proxy server. I didn't know anything about computer networks at this point, nor about Linux for that matter. I took a headfirst dive into the world of networks. The first thing I referred to was Google, ofcourse. Some very easy to understand sites came up and I read through them. Ample YouTube videos are also available if you are into learning via videos. Then I went on and did my CCNA, CCNP, currently getting ready for the CCIE, Juniper certifications and Microsoft Virtualization certifications. My suggestion to you would be to go through the CBT Nuggets for CCNA. They will help you a TON! You will be covering the theory AND at the same time, you will also be getting a feel for how Cisco routers and switches are configured. Look for YouTube videos. You don't have to invest in hardware right away if you want to learn networks practically. You can use Cisco Packet Tracer and/or GNS3 for that. I have used both of these extensively. Best of luck! :)
