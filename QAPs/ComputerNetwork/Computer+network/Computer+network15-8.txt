â˜…Which are the best US graduate schools for studying computer networks?Please suggest some good schools apart from the usual suspects (CMU, MIT, Stanford, UCB). I am not too keen on wireless networks.
You can take up USC. Professor Ali Zahid is best professor you will ever get learn computer networks. Also lot of networking companies hire from USC.
