★Skyfall (2012 movie): Why would Q attach the computer of a known cyberterrorist to the MI6 computer network?Is he the worst digital forensics investigator in history?
The logic of this action is based on the "message" of the film itself: the value of experience.  The Old vs The New; old is not always bad, new/young is not always good, and  experience counts. So it's part of the plot. That said.... -- FOR YOUR EYES ONLY - SPOILERS AHEAD -- ..... Skyfall is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Absolutely  boring and full of clichés. And the plot itself.... OMG... Why on hell would a completely successful  super-villain, an unreachable shadow whose identity is unknown, allow himself to get caught and  taken to London just for scaping through the underground and kill M  shooting her in a governamental building? Add to this other stupid  complexities of the plan itself like hacking the MI6 for months or  provoking a gas explosion just to get the MI6 headquarters moved to a  place where he could scape after years of studing the under-London, and you've got it... Skyfall is rubish!! Wouldn't  it had been much simpler just to take a plane, fly to london (no  problem to travel 'cause nobody knows him so nobody's looking for him),  get into M's house (if Bond can he can), show himself to her (that's  what he really wanted), and kill her???? OK, that's not an exciting Bond movie plot, but it's logical, and Skyfall is neither one thing nor the other!!!!!!!
