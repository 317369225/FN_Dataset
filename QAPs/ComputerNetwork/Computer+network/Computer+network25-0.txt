★What is clustering in computer network?Give me some solution with diagrams?
cluster  is used broadly in computer networking to refer to a number of  different implementations of shared computing resources.  Typically, a  cluster integrates the resources of two or more computing devices (that  could otherwise function separately) together for some common purpose.Here the Web farm that works as clusters that's it the collection of web servers that access the same site that is the resource but though depending on the hardware as well software configuration they may arouse a debate on this classification of server farm as cluster! And i think i can suggest you this http://ixbtlabs.com/articles/clu... website that would be helpful for u as it provides the details ,problems and the solutions for clustering with diagrammatic references.
