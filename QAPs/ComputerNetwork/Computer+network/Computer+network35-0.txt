★Computer Networking: What are the basic routing concepts?CEF, Packet forwarding and Router lookup process.
The basic concept to understand is packet structure. That is as basic as you can get. How the layer 2 header works, why do you need it, why is layer 2 so important. Do the same for layer 3. Use wireshark to see the packets being sent. You can look at what information is being sent and why it is being sent.  Look online for basic networking concepts. You want to look at MAC address, arp tables, routing tables, ip and ethernet headers.  What is a switch and what is a router. What is layer 2 and layer 3. Look for a good book that details all this.  Once your basics are a little clear, look to get the CCNA study guide. That gives a little more information on how networking works with protocols.
