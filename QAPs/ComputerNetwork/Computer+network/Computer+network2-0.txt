â˜…What's next in computer networking?What is the new technology, architect or protocol in the field of networking
For professional networking, I'm guessing it will utilize the internet much more in the future. It would be an expansion of LinkedIn to include online networking event promotions, panels, seminars, discussions, etc. The problem with networking now is a lot of people don't know when there is a networking event happening. If they utilize the internet to promote the event, I think more people will show up. When more people RSVP to these events, people are more willing to create future events. More professional groups would form in different counties. And people can, hopefully, connect more easily professionally. The other problem is that networking events can be very expensive with no guarantee of obtaining an actual job, business partner, investor, etc. I think an online networking event can help reduce or eliminate these costs to attract more people. Once people know each other a bit from the online networking events, they are more willing to pay to attend an actual event.
