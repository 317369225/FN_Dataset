★What is the difference between a distributed system and a computer network?
A computer network by and itself is a distributed system. Not every distributed system can be considered a computer network though, where by computer network I mean a telecommunications setup.  For instance, your laptop is a distributed system (multiple CPU cores, devices, communicating over a variety of buses), but this isn't typically within the domain of computer networks. As far as both domains go as sub-fields of computer science/engineering, they deal with very different abstractions and problems. Edit: Computer networking is mostly concerned with the Internet stack and the protocols that need to work together to get the Internet working. Distributed systems is concerned with the problems, challenges, and corresponding techniques and paradigms involved with building systems that comprise nodes that communicate with each other over a channel in order to provide some kind of service.
