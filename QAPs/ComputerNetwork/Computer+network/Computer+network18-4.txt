★Skyfall (2012 movie): Why would Q attach the computer of a known cyberterrorist to the MI6 computer network?Is he the worst digital forensics investigator in history?
He wouldn't. Unless, of course, it was part of his mission. Or to use a slight alteration of one of the most memorable quotes from Casino Royale's Le Chiffre: "I am afraid that your friend Q … is really … my friend Q".
