â˜…What are the best undergraduate textbooks on computer networks?This is for someone with a computer/electrical engineering background
Like others, I've used Tanenbaum's book and also took a close look atLarry Peterson's book, but I found that my experiences on line on various networks far more educational from ARPAnet to XNS and early Ethernet. I have always seemed to find books on the subject lacking. Some of that seemed to be based on the limitations of the authors experience and some with the interaction of the people running systems (topical issues and problems). The O'Reilly books address some of these problems, but in some cases, even these get out of date quickly.
