â˜…What are some good books on computer networking?
For getting big picture and essentials, these two resources was really useful for me: Sybex book "Microsoft Windows Networking Essentials". (Microsoft Windows Networking Essentials: Darril Gibson: 9781118016855: Amazon.com: Books ) Broad and not specially detailed on advanced concepts, but really well written especially for people with no or minimal prior experiences. Still running Stanford online course " An Introduction to Computer Networks" (An Introduction to Computer Networks ). Well put together with excercises and problem sets, also referencing other resources and books.
