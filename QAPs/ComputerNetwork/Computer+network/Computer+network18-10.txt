â˜…Skyfall (2012 movie): Why would Q attach the computer of a known cyberterrorist to the MI6 computer network?Is he the worst digital forensics investigator in history?
Because it was necessary for the plot. Of course "in real life", nobody would do that. Air gaps (at the least) standard practice in situations like that.
