★Which are the best US graduate schools for studying computer networks?Please suggest some good schools apart from the usual suspects (CMU, MIT, Stanford, UCB). I am not too keen on wireless networks.
I have to strongly disagree with measures that look at department publications.  Yes, they're a very good quantitative measure, but they are per-department, and includes history. But similar to what Blake said, if you go get a PhD, you'll be working with 1 networking faculty (most likely), not the department.  And many of those depts have folks who are no longer active in networking.  So instead, I'd recommend you look at say proceedings lists from recent mobicom, sigcomm, imc etc, and look at where the papers are coming from.  Identify a small # of faculty who generate 3-4 of these top papers every year. Wherever they are, that's where you want to go. Personally, I'd say Berkeley, UCSD, UMass, UW, MIT, Rutgers, UIUC, UCSB, should be in that list somewhere.
