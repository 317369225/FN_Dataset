â˜…What is a socket in computer networks?
A socket is an endpoint in communication between two computers across a computer network. Its a virtual thing, and it does not mean any hardware. A socket is uniquely identified by an IP address and a Port. These (IP, Port) couple uniquely refers to an application. So data received by the network card of the computer (the actual hardware interface which receives the data), are sent to a particular process based on the Port number of the socket opened for that application. In this way, we are able to run multiple internet based applications in our computer. One machine (generally) has only one IP address. But different sockets with different ports are opened to run different applications. A basic understanding can be found in the following link: Network socket
