â˜…How can I learn Computer Networking practically?I have only a laptop on which Windows is host and CentOS is running as guest on Virtualbox. I can arrange one more laptop, maybe a printer and a router at most. Is there any increase in possibilities after adding a couple more guest OSs in Virtualbox?
You mentioned you have a laptop and experience with virtualization. So, You can do the following to learn a bit of networking. 1. Get your hands on some material (books or video tutorials or online courses) so that you can study networking. 2. Setup Cisco packet tracer or GNS3 like software to simulate virtual network topologies with varying complexities and experiment with them. When you mentioned a router in your question, I am assuming you meant a SoHo(Small office Home office) router. These are the types of routers you use at homes that act as a combination of firewall, router, wifi access point(maybe), NAT, and maybe more. If you want to experiment with routers, download a router software(google should point you in the right direction) and work with it on a VM. In the same way you can fiddle with firewalls, Ip tables, Access control lists, DHCP, DNS and other services using a linux box or a VM. Also, you can use tools like wireshark, tcpdump, iperf,trace route, netstat, ping etc to troubleshoot or get a get a better understanding of what's happening in your network. Hope it helps.
