★What is the next big thing in computer networks?
It is little biased but people working on totally cordless environment. All your machines at home or office will be talking to each other. Energy comes and goes from cordless channels. With the wide extend of the network technology, augmented reality and the applications will take place on vast kind of environment. All the money will go around online with bit-coin like technologies.  Cloud technologies will take all the burden of the systems. I suspect that one day some of your home tech. needs will be outsourced by cloud systems. I guess network technologies going also to teleportation (of course it is a kind of dream but another way of networking)
