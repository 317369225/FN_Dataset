★What is the difference between a distributed system and a computer network?
To some people, a computer network is just hardware and software that enables computers to exchange data while still operating independently.  More pertinently, a network could be considered to include the computers that are connected to it, but they're still operating independently.  Each such machine still appears to the others as a separate machine.  By contrast, a distributed system consists of computers that are not only connected but coordinate among each other to form a single system.  That distributed system then provides one or more services to other machines outside the system, without those clients needing to know or care about which machine within the distributed system performs a particular role or holds a particular piece of data. One rather philosophical way of looking at it is that a network creates a shared space, while a distributed system creates a shared purpose.
