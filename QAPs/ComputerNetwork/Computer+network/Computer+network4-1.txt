★What is the most important computer networking protocol?
While IP is without hesitation the most used protocol for data encapsulation, There are also a couple of protocols that are used in the backbone of our infrastructure in order to make Internet or any network as a whole work correctly. The most famous of those protocols being BGP, Border Gateway Protocol. BGP is the routing protocol used  on internet backbone for routes exchanges. It successfully managed to scale to the size of the complete internet routing table (a couple of hundred thousand routes and still growing). What is even more outstanding is that BGP is made to work over different administrative boundaries that have different interests in sharing internet routes. BGP is also an extensible protocol and as such, Multi Protocol BGP is the main control protocol used inside services provider in order to synchronize control information accross and between participating nodes, typically to exchange routes and reachabilities for VRFs. Over the last few years MP-BGP got some interesting extensions such as eVPN that uses the BGP scalability to efficiently distribute ethernet layer 2 information accross the network. eVPN can mainly be used in order to improve the network inside virtualization Data Centers for example in order to have a complete and uptodate view of the reachability and localisation of each Virtual Machine in the network. And this is what we do at Nuage Networks. BGP is today what keeps Internet under control, and for sure one of the most important protocols used today in networking
