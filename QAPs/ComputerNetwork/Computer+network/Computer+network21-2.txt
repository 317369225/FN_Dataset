â˜…How do I learn Computer Networking in an effective and practical way?
If you have a router / modem / switch then you already have a basic network. Install Wireshark and trace and analyse traffic across your network. When you see something you don't understand Google it. Learn the Ping utility, as well as Trace Route, Netstat, etc etc and the other basic tools. Trace what they do. Read up and learn about DHCP / DNS / ARP, again trace them out. Keep doing this until you can recognise and explain all the traffic you capture and trace. Also find someone who is a network guy and buy them a coffee, (and a Danish) you'll find most people are more than willing to share knowledge and help you. Enjoy
