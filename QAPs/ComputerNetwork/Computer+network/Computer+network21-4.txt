★How do I learn Computer Networking in an effective and practical way?
Honestly, it depends on the person. For me, I decided that hands-on was the best way. - Go learn how to use Wireshark, which will teach you about internet traffic. - SSLsniff and SSLstrip to learn how MITM (man-in-the-middle attacks) works and how SSL works. - The thing about networking is that it test a little bit of everything. Being able to think outside the box, use a linux terminal and read  TCP information will all help you so try to learn a little it of everything if not alot about everything.  Use applications and create ideas off of the new found knowledge you have gained. If you're truly interested, like I am, you'll figure it out and it'll all come to you. If you need anything, just PM me.
