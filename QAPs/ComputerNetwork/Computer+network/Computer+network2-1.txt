★What's next in computer networking?What is the new technology, architect or protocol in the field of networking
I believe that Online networking will continue to grow but I believe that it will be a way to enhance our face to face networking. I network globally, I belong to international networks so that I can meet people from all over the world, I use social media as a way to stay engaged with them and to continue to build the relationship. What i will not do is build an online network and then refer business to them or recommend them for a job. If I do not meet the person face to face or know someone who has, I am not likely to put my reputation at risk. You don't know who is sitting behind the screen.  That being said, the people I have met I have great relationships with because of the online networking.
