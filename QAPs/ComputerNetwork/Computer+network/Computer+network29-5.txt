â˜…What are some good interview questions asked from computer networks?I am a fresher.
The answer to your question can depend on two things ie. your experience & the level and type of company you are interviewed for. 1) You are a fresher and interviewed by a company like tcs, wipro, so they will mostly try to check your basic knowledge on the subject, what you learned during your studies. 2) You are a fresher and interviewed by company working in network domain like cisco or openings are for networking domain, they will try to go deep into your concepts and will also check your approach for a particular problem. 3) You are a experienced guy in networking and interviewed by any XYZ company, they will first check your knowledge what you have learned in your industrial experience, your networking knowledge and then they will ask questions specific to openings which they have. 4)Sometimes, it doesn't matter who your are, they will check your knowledge level wise.You tell them this things they will move forward & forward, by this they will judge you on many things. So, it depends what type of questions will come to you during the process.
