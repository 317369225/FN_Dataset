â˜…How do computer networks handle data overload?
As mentioned, buffering is the first method, however, it is not enough. Modern transport protocols are able to monitor link parameters, such as one-way delay, RTT, losses and so on. These metrics are updating continuously and transport protocol is able to make a decision about further protocol actions. E.g. if losses are high, it will decrease data rate (rate based congestion control), or decrease TCP window size (window based congestion control). Name for this procedure is Congestion Control Algorithm. There are tons of different mechanisms to do it in a real world. Useful link is: TCP congestion-avoidance algorithm. It describes, how TCP (the most popular data transport protocol in the world) handles congestions. If you want to learn about novel schemes. take a look at one of my papers: Google Scholar Citations
