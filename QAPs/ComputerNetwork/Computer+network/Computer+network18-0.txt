â˜…Skyfall (2012 movie): Why would Q attach the computer of a known cyberterrorist to the MI6 computer network?Is he the worst digital forensics investigator in history?
It was a plot device, pure and simple. There is no logical -in character- reason why this would have been done. No-one, not even someone working in IT for you-name-the-lowly-company would ever be so dumb as to do what he did.
