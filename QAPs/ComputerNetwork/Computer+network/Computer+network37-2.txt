â˜…What is the difference between a distributed system and a computer network?
A computer network is a collection of seperate but interconnected computers , connected by a single technology. Even a distributed system is a collection of independent computers. But the main difference is that, in a distributed system, the whole collection of computers appears to its users as a single coherent system. A well known example of distributed system if World Wide Web, in which everything looks like a document. In a computer network, this coherence is absent. Users are exposed to actual machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines look and act in a coherent way.
