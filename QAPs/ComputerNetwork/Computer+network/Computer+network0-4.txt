â˜…Is computer networks a boring area?
Well, yes, and no! The no part: Computer networking has not evolved for years due to an stupid main-frame model that status quo is pushing for. Computer networks used to be defined as protocols, that are so simple at core but too complex in boilerplate. For example, there are many protocols for finding a shortest path in a network each specified in a large document, and funnily their core (the Dijkstra algorithm) can be explained in a page. And when you engage in a talk with network researchers and engineers, you'll hear lots and lots of boring discussions about these protocols. Network education in the industry is based on the same shit. lots and lots of protocols, lots and lots of false arguments, .... The yes part: You probably have heard about Software Defined Networking (SDN) which basically aims at ending this boring discussion about protocols. I know, I know, SDN is hyped, not well defined, ... but, in essence, when you can program your network via commodity software, you can define your own way of managing the network, your own optimizations, your own algorithms, ... "network defined by software" is disrupting the "network defined by protocols", and it will extensively change the field. I strongly encourage you to watch this:
