â˜…Which are the best US graduate schools for studying computer networks?Please suggest some good schools apart from the usual suspects (CMU, MIT, Stanford, UCB). I am not too keen on wireless networks.
Check out North Carolina State University. I don't know if I am correct but it's CN department was ranked in the top 5. http://networking.ncsu.edu/
