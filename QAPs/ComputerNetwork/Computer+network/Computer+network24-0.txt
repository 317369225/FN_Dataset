★What are the best resources for learning computer (network) security?What are the best resources for network security for beginners? Also some general practices in network programming are appreciated.
So let's start with some general information security stuff, and then focus on networking and programming. Here’s are seven easy (?) steps: 1. Pick an area you’re interested in. Programming, database admin, network engineer, and sys admin are all great options. 2. Read voraciously. 2a. Books Start with Secrets and Lies by Schneier and Counter Hack Reloaded, and then look at the third link below, and the Bejtlich’s previous end of the year book review lists. 2b. Blogs here are a couple link: https://www.schneier.com/blog/ar... https://krebsonsecurity.com/2012... http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/... 2c. Magazines 3. Look for opportunities to “do security stuff” at work. This might be resetting passwords, helping with security awareness campaigns, lending a hand with a disaster recovery exercise, doing code reviews, 4. Play with this stuff in your free time. Setup VMware and a bunch of guests and try to get them to do things like: get the syntax highlighting in vim to work via PuTTY, setup load balanced PF firewalls, or setup DNSSEC. Or try your hand at pen testing: http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?pa... 5. Visit information security organizations.  Here’s a list of current events in the DC area (since you mentioned government) http://www.novainfosecportal.com... Most of these groups also exist outside of DC. 6. Don’t do stupid (e.g. illegal) stuff. The government isn’t the only organization that does background checks. Many organizations have a low tolerance for information security folks they can’t trust. 7. Let people know that you want to work on “security stuff.” I know lots of folks that believe that the two keys to hiring information security folks are attitude and aptitude. Demonstrate these two and you’ll find doors open. Specifically for networking and programming, some interesting resources include: Dan Kaminsky's Black Ops (slides: http://www.slideshare.net/dakami... audio: http://mirrors.easynews.com/blac... more audio: http://mirrors.easynews.com/blac...) OWASP is programming centric, but not networking centric. Regardless, it's worth a look. Good luck.
