★I am going to be walking from Beijing to London... What's the best route I should take?
Wow.... What am ambitious project.... You have obviously thought of this: no-one has a vision like that without a route. I would think that you ought to follow the old trading routes: more history; more story; more places that matter. And much of northern China, Mongolia would be very dull. Southern China maybe more interesting but a detour. So the Silk Road. Beijing, Xian, Samarkand, Istanbul then Balkans, Venice (Marco Polo!) , london - as a rough line. Maybe you could mix in some of the old Pilgrims route? Would you take a detour via Jerusalem? Or Rome to Canterbury? And I imagine they included Byzantium? That is very cool... I want to hear what you end up with.    Embed Quote
