★What are some of the best roads/routes in India?Please add images! Let us please limit the scope here (India only), else the data here will become incomprehensible. We'll be lost in a sea of data otherwise!
One of the most beautiful roads that i've ever driven on, the road from Puri to Konark. The canopy makes it appear absolutely splendid. Make sure you don't speak much when traveling on this route, else you'll miss a lot! The ride from Shillong to Cherrapunji was equally mesmerizing, if not more. The early morning fog, the mist in the air and the splendid beauty all around. I couldn't have asked for more! :) Update : Adding a few more roads that should appear on this list. The road joining Jammu and Srinagar. You're in for a surprise as soon as you exit the tunnel! And a view from the same route. The road connecting Gangtok to Lake Tsomgo, absolutely stunning! You're above the clouds, literally! UPDATE 2: Adding a couple of pictures from the NH6 running through Odisha, you're probably not going to believe me once you see the pictures. Also, the roads aren't four laned, but you'll see in the pictures why i added this here. Do you believe me now? :D    Embed Quote
