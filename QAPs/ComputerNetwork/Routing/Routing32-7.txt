★What is the easiest/cheapest route to break into banking?
It depends on which arm of banking  are you trying to break into. My friends who are in the investment banking/equity research positions had BBAs, MBAs and/or financial engineering backgrounds. If you are looking to break into the technology arm of banking then yes one of those options you listed above might help but there might be cheaper ways of getting there. I had a bachelors in EE and was exposed to a few financial services clients through a consulting firm I worked for. The skills that I used on those projects were acquired working on different projects.    Embed Quote
