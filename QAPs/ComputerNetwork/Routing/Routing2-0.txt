★Indian Railways: Which is the best train route in India?
I have travelled many places in India and most of them through the Rail. The best Rail route which I have come across, was the Pamban Bridge. I have got a fair bit of reason for this. 1.Sea on the side of rail network(both sides). 2.The railway bridge is 6,776 ft (2,065 m) long and was opened for traffic in 1914. The scenery which you will see through the journey of 10 minutes will be full of excitement and you will cherish it for the rest of your life. 3.The road route from the Peninsular India to the Rameshwaram (Island) will add to the scenary. Many people would come to the side of the road and see the train passing by. 4.You can also see the view from above later on. But for that you have to travel 10 km from Rameshwaram to the side of the Island. It looks like this. 5. It is the the only rail route over sea in india. 6.Whenever the ships passes by. The bridge is opened like this.(only at one point in the middle of the route . This shows  that Pamban Bridge is one of the best train routes in India and one of the oldest too .    Embed Quote
