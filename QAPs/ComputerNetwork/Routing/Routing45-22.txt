★What is the best route (or tips) for a 25 year old who is focused on becoming financially free?
1. Define what "financially free" means to you. Some people are financially free with $30K a year. Some with way less. Some have millions and aren't financially free. Some have millions and are perfectly free. This is. It's not the amount of money but what you define as freedom. Freedom from worrying? Peace, happiness? Freedom to buy whatever you want when you want? Freedom to help others without sacrifice? Freedom to stop working? 2. Once you figure that out ask the next question.    Embed Quote
