★Why don't airplanes follow the shortest route?I have noticed this in various flights. Airplanes don't follow the shortest route. Why do they deviate so much from the shortest route? Are there any way-points that they must pass through?
A few reasons: Flyover restrictions Quite simply, some countries do not allow you to fly inside their airspace.  Safety in mind too - airlines do not fly over the Ukraine and would be reluctant to fly over other war zones. Engine-out Provision Airlines must always be able to reach an airport capable of accepting them with a single engine in the event that one engine fails (for a twin-engine aircraft like the Boeing 777). Winds It is more cost and speed efficient to fly where the winds are favourable (ie behind the plane, called a tailwind), and even if the distance is longer it could use a lot less fuel and time.    Embed Quote
