★What can possibly be wrong with seeking the easiest route?
Nothing is wrong with it. Which road it's good to take depends on the goal. If getting to the end of the road as soon as possible is the goal - take the easiest road. If learning, growing, developing is the goal - take the road that will be a lesson to you while you travel.    Embed Quote
