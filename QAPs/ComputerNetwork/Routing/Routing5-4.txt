★What cross-country route is the longest road trip in the world?
I'm thinking that if you diverge from Mongolia South, you could easily extend the trip by traveling through China, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, (short ferry), Java, ((very short ferry) Bali where you'd come to a more blissful halt. And it would be somewhat longer than Ulaan Bator to Vladivostok.    Embed Quote
