★What music do ambulance drivers play en route to emergency calls?
It depends on who is driving...and what stations we have available to us. I tend to listen to classic rock because we have a good classic rock radio station available, and it tends to be a good neutral ground with my regular partners. There are shifts when I come in and the radio is tuned to country...or dance music...or pop...or sports. One of my old partners favors classical. Another of my partners always asks me to plug in my iPod because I have music she isn't familiar with. Granted, I'm not technically an ambulance driver as my current job has us in Suburbans, but our listening preferences don't change with the vehicle class.    Embed Quote
