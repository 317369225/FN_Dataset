★Has anyone done any of the SF2G bicycle routes?http://sf2g.com/ What was it like? What was the speed 'type' and how hard was it for you? How many people did you ride with?
The First Friday Friendly Frolic is the place to start.  This is a No Rider Left Behind ride.  And, from time to time, it's been known to feature fresh baked pastries from my wife at the mid-ride waterstop in San Mateo (see kahnfections (classic sweet treats) -- shameless plug).    Embed Quote
