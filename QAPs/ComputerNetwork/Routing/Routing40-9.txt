★Has anyone done any of the SF2G bicycle routes?http://sf2g.com/ What was it like? What was the speed 'type' and how hard was it for you? How many people did you ride with?
I've only done a couple Bayway rides (on No Rider Left Behind rides) and a few more Millbway rides, ending at Foster City.  The first time I went with the group was a little intimidating because it was the first time I had ridden 20+ miles, the first time I'd ridden in a group of any size, and I had no idea what the route was.  But the pace was okay and everyone was very friendly & easy to follow. Last month I had a flat before we got to SFO (so before I knew the route) and true to the description I was not left behind.  Someone always volunteers to be the sweeper in case of people like me. It's something I'd like to do more of, but I have a hard time getting myself out of bed early enough for most of the rides (6:30?) when I don't have as far to go.    Embed Quote
