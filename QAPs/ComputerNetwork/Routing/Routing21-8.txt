★Is it offensive to use a cemetery as part of the route on a morning run?Without sharing my own, I'm interested in where opinions fall on this question.
I live in Daly City/Colma and I will often run through cemeteries. Use common sense and stay clear of actual funerals but it is quiet, paved and safe.    Embed Quote
