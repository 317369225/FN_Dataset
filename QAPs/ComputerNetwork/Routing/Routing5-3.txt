★What cross-country route is the longest road trip in the world?
too bad that you cannot put in multiple stops into Google Maps because then you could take a drive from the starting point in far easterly russia, thru norway, around europe, tour most of africa and back thru asia to china or someplace and spend a gloriously long time in a car,truck etc..  You would beat the vehicle to crap along the way and meet some very interesting people.    Embed Quote
