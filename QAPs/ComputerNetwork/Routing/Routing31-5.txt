★What are the best websites to map my itinerary and route for a trip?I've been looking but most of the websites I found do not have the basic features to map my trip properly.
Travel & tourism industry is growing on a faster scale and it is very hard to choose any of the best websites to map itinerary and route for a trip while planning trip itineraries.. All of the challenge is hidden under the technically strong trip planner or route planner algorithm which is used. Firstly I always check out the technical background of that product and secondly the design which is user friendly or not. For me TripHobo and Tripoto are top websites for mapping travel itineraries. http://TripHobo.com http://Tripoto.com For more travel websites check this question - What is the best trip planning website?    Embed Quote
