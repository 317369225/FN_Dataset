★Is it offensive to use a cemetery as part of the route on a morning run?Without sharing my own, I'm interested in where opinions fall on this question.
My cross country team in high school went through our local cemetery to warm up every day.  No one seems to have been bothered by it, although someone on the team did tell me to be careful about running over the places where people were actually buried once.    Embed Quote
