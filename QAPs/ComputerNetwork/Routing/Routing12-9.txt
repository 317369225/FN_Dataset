★What was your route to becoming a Product Manager, and how do you think it helped you to become a better PM as opposed to other routes?
When I started my business degree back in 1995 I probably spent more time in the computer lab building websites for everything from the student magazine to local businesses as a self-taught web designer and developer. I decided this was more fun than joining a bank like so many of my classmates and joined a start up as a web designer in 1998. I quickly started using my business skills in prioritising work and focusing on monetisation - without realising it basically doing product management. And then I realised I wasn't good enough at design or developing to compete with the best, but that I was pretty good at interfacing between them and the business... It was when I joined Monster in 2000 that I learned the craft of product management properly, and I haven't looked back. 6.5 years there took me from Product Manager to Director, and led to the Financial Times, then VP Product at Huddle (SaaS collaboration startup in London) and now CPO at Covestor.    Embed Quote
