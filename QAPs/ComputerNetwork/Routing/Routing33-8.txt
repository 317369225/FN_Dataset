★Why don't airplanes follow the shortest route?I have noticed this in various flights. Airplanes don't follow the shortest route. Why do they deviate so much from the shortest route? Are there any way-points that they must pass through?
They take advantage of prevailing winds, and also they must often avoid other traffic -- I'm sure there are other reasons as well, but these are the first two I could think of.    Embed Quote
