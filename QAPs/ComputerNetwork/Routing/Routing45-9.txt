★What is the best route (or tips) for a 25 year old who is focused on becoming financially free?
I think there is a big difference between being "financially free" and being rich.  In my view, being financially free means developing and maintaining a hefty financial cushion such that you can sustain your wants and needs for a fairly long time horizon.  This can be achieved without being 'rich' (although that would help). On the flip side, one can be 'rich' and still living on the edge.  If a high flying lifestyle is reliant on a constant stream of high income, that person might not be 'financially free' at all. Also, while I completely agree that the entrepreneurial path is more likely to make someone rich than a salaried job; it is also a more likely path to poverty.  We need to remember that our biases about entrepreneurial success are heavily influenced by the successes we hear about.  We don't hear about failures (and when we do, it is always in the context of a subsequent success, which might have the unfortunate effect of encouraging entrepreneurs to continue to invest in a losing venture).  For all the criticism of salaried employment, it is a more likely road to financial freedom than entrepreneurship:  salaried employment generates income with no capital risk.  That is an advantage which should not be dismissed easily.    It also creates a stable base from which to align income and expenses, allowing a person to spend, save, an invest with a higher degree of consistency. So again, investing your own capital in your own venture is more likely to "make you rich" (or poor), but the stability of employment is a better road to financial freedom. Best of luck to you.    Embed Quote
