★What is the easiest/cheapest route to break into banking?
I'm assuming that you are trying to get through the technical route. Among the three choices only option 3) is helpful.  1) is useless 2) is worse than useless 1) is useless because banks don't care about certificates.  If you've made a name for yourself being a developer for a large open source project that's useful.  Having certificates is completely useless.  People don't care about certification.  If you learn something while you are getting the certificate, that's fine but, the certificate you can toss in the trash. 2) is worse than useless because having two bachelors degree looks bad.  3) is one way of doing it. The best option which you didn't ask about is to somehow get a job in software development, and the laterally transfer.  Also no one, expect the initial screener cares about degrees.  They care that you can code.    Embed Quote
