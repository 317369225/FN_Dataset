★What are the best websites to map my itinerary and route for a trip?I've been looking but most of the websites I found do not have the basic features to map my trip properly.
We have just launched http://www.Tripoto.com - a platform for sharing and discovering amazing travel stories. We create visually appealing pages for your travel stories with minimal effort from your side. For plotting a map all you have to do is enter the spots of your trip and we plot it for you. You can also associate images with your map, write description and select custom map icons. You can keep a trip private - to share with friends/family or you can make it public for everyone to see.    Embed Quote
