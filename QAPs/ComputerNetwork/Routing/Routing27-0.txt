★What can possibly be wrong with seeking the easiest route?
The same thing that can be wrong with going to the gym and only lifting 2lbs, only jogging for ten seconds, and then going home and watching TV. That's "wrong" (a.k.a. impractical) if your goal is to build up your strength and endurance. Your body and brain grow by being challenged. In most cases, the easiest route won't challenge you. Which doesn't mean it's bad. I walk to the closest post office rather than one fifteen miles away. That's because my goal is simply to post a letter. But I wouldn't want to live a life in which I always took the shortest route, in which I never challenged myself. Challenges keep us from growing old too early; they help us develop new skills; and when we overcome them, they endow us with that most attractive of traits, confidence.    Embed Quote
