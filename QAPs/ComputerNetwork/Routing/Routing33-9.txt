★Why don't airplanes follow the shortest route?I have noticed this in various flights. Airplanes don't follow the shortest route. Why do they deviate so much from the shortest route? Are there any way-points that they must pass through?
Via Vaibhav Shukla For flights its simpler than you can imagine. It doesn't have to follow road or railtracks or avoid mountains and valleys. It just follows one thumb rule with certain degree of exception. Thumb Rule: Shortest distance  (You actually want it to be a straight line) Exceptions: There are a few checks for this straight line path to be followed: a) Route should have tolerant weather. You don't want to fly through a region where meteorologists are anticipating a hailstorm. b) There should be airports in near vicinity of the route. If you run into a problem like an engine failure then you should be close enough to an airport in which you can attempt emergency landing. This vicinity will be described by size (or actually the fuel carrying capacity) of the aircraft. Well this second reason is the biggest reason for the international air routes to be curvilinear. By the way, most of the long distance flights stop for refueling and that also determines your itinerary.    Embed Quote
