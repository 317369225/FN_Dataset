★What's the best free website or app for mapping running and walking routes?I've been using MapMyRun.com but they now have so many ads that the site is less functional.
I use www.runningahead.com because: 1. It is free 2. You can import gps but you don't have to. 3. Reporting is strong and you can view your data in a variety of ways 4. Workouts can be cross posted to Facebook 5. No advertising 6. Active community but it isn't the focus of the site    Embed Quote
