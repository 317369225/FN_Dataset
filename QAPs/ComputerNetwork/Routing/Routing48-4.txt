★Rock Climbing: What is it like to free solo a route?I'm curious about the motivation, thoughts, fears, emotions, focus etc. involved.
I'm hesitant to respond to this given the potential for serious harm, but at the same time if someone is going to try it regardless, I'd prefer to help then prepare and minimize the risk. Now for how it feels: Liberating, calming, and focused. It's s hard feeling to describe- I dont get an adrenaline rush unless there's a really dynamic move like a dyno or dead point involved. Its almost as if you're weightless, and nothing exists more than five or ten feet above or below you, kind of a trancelike hyperfocused state. People talk about seeing things in slow motion when suddenly thrown into a life treating situation (car crash, gun fight, ect. ), take this same feeling and instead of only having that feeling for a couple of seconds, extend it across an entire route. I very rarely solo routes I don't have memorized and wired, so the floating feeling may be due to the absolutely continuous nature of the climbing- no annoying clips or having to worry about whether or not the rope would go behind your leg if you fall- just pure unadulterated movement. My experience may be different than others because most of the routes I've soloed have been short sport routes where it rarely takes more than five minutes to complete a route. All this being said, the other commentators are absolutely right- it's completely selfish- and isn't forgiving. There are very few things in the world with literally zero room for error, but this is one of them. If you go for it, start small and easy- make sure you have a way down (no take and lower options)- spend sometime meditating to contemplate why you're doing this and whether or not there is any doubt at all in your head about your ability to pull it off. If you have to "psych" yourself up for it, then that's a clear sign you're not ready for and you need to have the discipline to walk away.    Embed Quote
