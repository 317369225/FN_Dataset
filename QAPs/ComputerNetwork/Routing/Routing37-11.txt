★What's the best free website or app for mapping running and walking routes?I've been using MapMyRun.com but they now have so many ads that the site is less functional.
www.mapmyrun.com is excellent.  Also, you can go to www.dailymile.com and look up routes that other people have shared.  It is also a great online running community.    Embed Quote
