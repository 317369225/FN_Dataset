★What algorithms are common in IP routing?
Almost all routing today is done using some kind of content addressable memory structure. In software, these are implemented as tries. There's a lot of theory behind tries. CEF, by Cisco, was a huge breakthrough when it first came to market. Another highly interesting line of research involves memory allocation. Anything that makes allocation faster, more efficient, reduces copies of data between blocks of memory, is worth a lot in router and switching design. QoS also has some very interesting algorithms. Queiuing is a fairly complex topic with ramifications into statistics and modeling. Last, there's a lot of math and fairly complex algorithms in the clos architecture that is becoming the standard way to design large datacenters.    Embed Quote
