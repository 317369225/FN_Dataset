★What are the best websites to map my itinerary and route for a trip?I've been looking but most of the websites I found do not have the basic features to map my trip properly.
Without doubts www.goprotravelling.com is the best place to do it. You can add dates, days of the week, comments, you can even map your flight too... things you cannot do in other sites without mentioning that you can add any travel info you consider important.    Embed Quote
