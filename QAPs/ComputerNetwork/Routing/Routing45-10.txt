★What is the best route (or tips) for a 25 year old who is focused on becoming financially free?
I've just finished reading Dave Ramseys 'Total Money Makeover' and he makes a case for being debt free as soon as possible along with practical methodology to just do that regardless of what your income is. It's not rocket science and it really works. Go through the short term pain of getting debt free, building your emergency fund, retirement fund and have the long term gain of financial freedom reaching a point where your passive income exceeds your outgoings leaving you free financially to pursue your passions in life without worrying where the next dollar is coming from. Every success to you and I hope you accomplish your goal!    Embed Quote
