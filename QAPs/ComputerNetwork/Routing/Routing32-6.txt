★What is the easiest/cheapest route to break into banking?
I suppose you are referring to "Investment Banks" when you mention banks. It's a typical of such institutions to expect candidates be able to program and take care of the applications that are running. You have the domain understanding (as you have graduated in this discipline), so an additional degree may not make much sense, as your core work would not change. So, getting some certifications, carrying out projects which would capture financial institutions attention, would be well suited. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
