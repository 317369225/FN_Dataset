★What's the best free website or app for mapping running and walking routes?I've been using MapMyRun.com but they now have so many ads that the site is less functional.
Sharemyroutes.com is good. Minimal ads and allows upload & download to GPX. KML etc. Great quality mapping with Ordnance Survey layers for the UK. It plots a long section profile of the route and also estimates calorie burn. Movescount by Suunto is excellent for planning and recording your runs etc. It is designed around their HR watches but data can be added manually and the route planning section is excellent. Supports KML upload. I hear Runkeeper is good and has an iPhone app so is ideal for recording routes.    Embed Quote
