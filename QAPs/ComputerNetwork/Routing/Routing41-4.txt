★Where are the best running routes in Amsterdam?I will be there in October. What are some good routes to run (early morning)? Anything unique or routes that will help me see more of the city would be great.
I will be running the Amsterdam marathon for the second year running on October 21 this year. There are running events over several distances on the day to suit all tastes and abilities. My favourite part of the marathon route is out along the Amstel river and back. http://www.tcsamsterdammarathon....    Embed Quote
