★Is it offensive to use a cemetery as part of the route on a morning run?Without sharing my own, I'm interested in where opinions fall on this question.
If you by doing so intrude upon how others use the cemetery, then it is offensive. You do not want to come too close to people who are obviously visiting a grave and who may be seeking a moment of stillness to remember a loved one, nor would you want to bump into a procession while singing out loud what happens to be on your iPod, etc. You want to display discretion, tact and decorum, and more so than in other places where you might find yourself making a morning run. If this is a daily habit, you might even consider not wearing stark pink or other "shocking" colors so as to be able to easily blend in by just not running any more. Avoid semi-nudity like the plague. You most definitely shall make certain not to run where you are not supposed to walk (look for signs and I need not stress that graves are inexcusable to walk/run upon, or jump over). You should also be prepared to quit your run or at least postpone it if you find that there is someone who thinks you are violating the purpose of the place. You most definitely should not argue your "right" to use the cemetery for a morning run against the rights of a mourner. You apologize in a friendly way and leave, there are no alternative ways to conduct yourself in such a situation. I would seek out another place, if possible. If there was no other option, I would advise the earliest possible hours in the morning, in the hope that there will be no other visitors around at that time.    Embed Quote
