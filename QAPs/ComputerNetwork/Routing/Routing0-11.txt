★What are some of the best roads/routes in India?Please add images! Let us please limit the scope here (India only), else the data here will become incomprehensible. We'll be lost in a sea of data otherwise!
The zig-zag roads of Zuluk (old silk route) in Sikkim. It's an off-beat destination and not many people have visited. We traveled through the Old-Silk Route till the nathu-la which touched the China-India Border. There is a strong belief and story that at some point they gave up completing this road because of the very difficult terrain and one person from South India (mostly from Tamil Nadu) completed this single-handedly. There is a viewpoint of his name -- called Thambi (brother in Tamil) View Point. It looks so different in each curve, and in winter it's a different story altogether.
