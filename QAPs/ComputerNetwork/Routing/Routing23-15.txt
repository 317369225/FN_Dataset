★Is it physically possible to walk uphill to school both ways, using the same route?Apart from having a hill in between your house and the school and forgetting to mention that.
You have a hill between you and the school.  On the way to school, you walk up the hill, then get on your skateboard and ride down; on the way home you reverse the process.  You have, indeed, walked uphill both ways.  It's all in the phrasing.    Embed Quote
