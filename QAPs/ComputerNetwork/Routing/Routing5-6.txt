★What cross-country route is the longest road trip in the world?
Related to Todd Gardiner's answer, this is the longest driving directions search I can find on Google Maps: Р481 to Diaz Rd - Google Maps. As Todd found, this trip is Magadan Russia to Cape Town, South Africa. The journey is 14,917 miles or 24,007 km and would take a mere 304 hours without bathroom breaks. Google Maps should probably show a longer trip, but because its directions do not cross the Iraq-Jordan border, Google has the traveler taking a ferry from Saudi Arabia to Egypt. The longest walk in the world is similar but follows the north side of the Caspian Sea and ends at the terminus of a hiking train in South Africa's Quoin Point Nature Reserve.
