★What is routing?I understand it makes the URLs prettier. Some examples show PHP code, some just show examples of a mod_rewrite. Can someone explain the logic of routing and why it's used?
Routing in MVC applications is about calling a resource that matches a URL. Either using a convention like executing Mod\class->action() in the path mod/class.php or by configuring a route in a file that might look like array('route' => 'module/controller/action') Using a front controller which is basically the index.php that gets all the requests, a server request could be then intercepted and the corresponding resource is executed then the specified view will be included/generated/compiled or just echoed as an answer. mod_rewrite is used to direct all requests to index.php (requests that are not static like css, js, images and other real files). Frameworks use one or more forms of this but it all boils down to a rewrite rule intercepting requests to a resource locator (router/dispatcher) which then calls/executes whatever resource is selected to match the URL and returns some form of response. Hope that makes sense    Embed Quote
