★What constitutes a good running route?Regardless of distance, but taking terrain, scenery, elevation and any other factors into account.
This is a very personal question - it really depends on what you like. Some people love hills, some people hate them. It all depends. Also, there's no one good running route; in general, I like a variety of different routes in my "portfolio." Sometimes I just want a simple flat route; other times I love the challenges of some big hill with rewarding views at the top. Trail running in nature is the best, but it can also be a lot of fun to do a good urban route. Some of my all-time favorites: 1) Running in Huddart and Purissima Creek Redwood parks: redwood forest, trickling streams, long steady climbs, and great views 2) Running in Marin on the Coastal trails and Mount Tamalpais 3) Running through all the memorials in DC; do this at dawn (like 5 or 6am) before all the tourists come out. It's pretty incredible to stand on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and look across the reflecting pool as the sun rises, without a tourist in sight. 4) Running through Paris, also at dawn with very little foot traffic Runner's World Magazine has an awesome "Rave Run" series, where they highlight amazing routes form around the world: Rave Run    Embed Quote
