★What algorithms are common in IP routing?
Most common is Dijkstra's algorithm (a.k.a., Shortest Path First or SPF). After that, there are a variety of lesser things to consider, such as: Retransmissions with Exponential backoff Sliding window protocol And of course, there's a whole lot of generic computer science.    Embed Quote
