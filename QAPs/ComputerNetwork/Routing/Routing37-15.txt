★What's the best free website or app for mapping running and walking routes?I've been using MapMyRun.com but they now have so many ads that the site is less functional.
Update: I like http://runmap.me as well. http://jog.fm/maps - probably the best mapping tool I've used.  No ads No user account required It stays out of your way Really easy to use (click, drag & drop) And it's free    Embed Quote
