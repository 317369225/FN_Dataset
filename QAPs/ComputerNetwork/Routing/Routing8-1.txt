★Does OpenFlow basically centralise routing decisions?Trying to understand what's going on from reading this : http://www.wired.com/wiredenterp... Is OpenFlow basically central planning of routing decisions?
OpenFlow is a standard northbound interface from Network Elements (Switches/Routers/possibly wavelength switches too). OpenFlow seems to be the most popular way to control network elements from this centralized entity called "Controller". Theoretically, the controller could do all the routing decisions for the underlying network it is controlling, but this is not necessary. For example, inter-domain routing: The picture shows a controller speaking to three clouds (domains). The controller is aware of only the edge nodes in all the three domains. To setup an end-to-end path from A to F, the controller could: (1) Talk to A and/or B and setup an e2e path within the MPLS cloud: Internally, A to B path routing could still use existing MPLS signaling (LDP/RSVP-TE) (2) Talk to C and/or D and setup an e2e path within OTN cloud: Internally, GMPLS could be used to signal the routing (3) ----"---- within Ethernet cloud: OSPF/CSPF for routing. In this case, every cloud is continuing to use it's own intra-domain routing. But the inter-domain paths are "stitched" by the controller. So in essence, you can have a hybrid use-case. Where the networks could still leverage their intra-domain routing/signaling and Controller could make inter-domain routing decisions. TL; DR; - It's not necessary for SDN/OpenFlow to centralize all of routing decisions. (NOTE: You introduce protection/restoration scenarios, and it gets even more complex)    Embed Quote
