★What can possibly be wrong with seeking the easiest route?
Nothing, as long as it gets you where you truly long to go.  That would be very good karma indeed, as this Earth school is not known for its easy, breezy  agendas.   All we can do is explore and find out for ourselves.  Don't think in terms of right and wrong.  It doesn't matter what others say.  Follow your heart and find out for yourself.  You are here to learn first hand.  Your own experiences are the best teachers. Just keep in mind that making your own life easy by harming or taking from other creates karma that is far from 'easy' to endure.    Embed Quote
