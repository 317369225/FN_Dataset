★Is it physically possible to walk uphill to school both ways, using the same route?Apart from having a hill in between your house and the school and forgetting to mention that.
My kids go to Schools of the Sacred Heart San Francisco.  The front door is on Broadway, the back door is a block below on Vallejo, with essentially a cliff in between.  If my son enters the front door in the morning and exits the back door after school, it is indeed uphill both ways from our old house. Here is a recent ski jump event that took advantage of the 23% slope. And bike race: Q.E.D.    Embed Quote
