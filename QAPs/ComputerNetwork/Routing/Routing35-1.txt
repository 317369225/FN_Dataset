★How is an airplane's route decided?What are the factors taken into consideration?
Thanx for the A2A..Although I'm not that well versed about how the aviation industry works, this is something I found out when reading up on the Internet.. The aviation authority in any country will determine the flight paths. e.g In the Uk it is from one beacon to another.Now, beacons are signal emitting devices that came in before radars and the sophisicated equipment on planes today,  The land based beacons gave a straight line to the next point, from there depending on the destination the next appropriate beacon would be selected.Nowadays the same flight paths are used for safety.  Internationally the flight paths are determined and civilian planes stick to those routes knowing they will not be entering another countries airspace.  The GPS systems on planes assists in this with the autopilot system. Also, the captain cannot change flight path once en route without authority of the traffic control in the countries being overflown.  These flightpaths often cross, where this occurs there is a minimum distance and height to prevent collisions or damage from turbulence.  Most flight paths will try to avoid the minimum time over sea and often keep a close proximity of an airport incase of emergency.  Most western countries have several alternatives, however China for example has a flightpath into and out of their airspace that is closely monitored for deviation.    Embed Quote
