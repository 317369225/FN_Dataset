★What is the easiest/cheapest route to break into banking?
Wouldn't mentionning it on your CV be enough? Afterall, if they wanna assess your skills after screening your CV they might just ask you about stuff in programming. I'm not sure going for a master would be worth it, so I'd go for option #1 or just learn on my own and write it down on my CV. The ones you'd need the most though I think are VBA for Excel modeling, Matlab and @risk. I'm interested in hearing other people's insights on the topic though :) !    Embed Quote
