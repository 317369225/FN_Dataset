★Which Compostela route is the most scenic?There are so many different pilgrimage routes that lead to Santiago de Compostela, I actually don't know where to start my research.
I've done four of the routes, and they were each beautiful and scenic in their own way. But the one that really stands out to me is the Camino del Norte - lush green mountains set against the sea, and the food in the Basque region, Cantabria, Asturias, and Galicia is amazing. There's also less traffic on that Camino versus the Frances (until the paths converge as you near Santiago).    Embed Quote
