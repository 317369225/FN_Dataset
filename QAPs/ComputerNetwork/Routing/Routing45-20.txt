★What is the best route (or tips) for a 25 year old who is focused on becoming financially free?
I will make this very simple. I'd almost think of economic decisions like a flow chart. Whenever the question comes up as to whether or not to buy something go through this process in your mind: 1. Can I afford it without going into debt? If the answer is no then 95% of the time you should just move on. Odds are you either don't actually need it or there is a cheaper way to accomplish the same goal. 2. Is this something I need? Things like food, shelter, medicine come to mind as no-brainers here. If the answer is yes then bite the bullet, spend the cash and move on.  If no then move on to question #3. 3. Will it appreciate in value or be an investment in my future? Additional education (provided you don't go into debt) can be a worthwhile investment. Buying a house or apartment in an area where you intend to live for the next 5-10 years minimum can be smart. Spending $10 on a book like The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham can change the way you think about money and investments. Or better yet, just go check it out from the library for free. 4. Will it make my life or someone else's life better? Giving a gift to someone you care about can be one of the most rewarding things you can do. Seeing the appreciation is often worth more than money. When thinking about spending money on you, do you need to buy that plane ticket to Europe? You probably don't need to but I don't know a single person (aside from those who have gone into debt to do so) who regrets money they've spent to travel the world. I know I haven't. And finally, after you've gone through your mental checklist to determine if you want to spend the money (hopefully most times you'll determine that you don't), ask yourself one more thing: Can I do it cheaper?    Embed Quote
