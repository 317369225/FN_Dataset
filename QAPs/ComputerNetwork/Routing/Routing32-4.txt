★What is the easiest/cheapest route to break into banking?
No point learning programming languages. Just brush up on the basics of one programming language you find easy - not important though. You're not going to work for a technology firm.. they don't really care how much coding you know. All they care about is your capability and aptitude to pick up things on the fly. Infact, learn a different language like Japanese, French or German. The biggest banks have clients from these countries and are over reliant on speakers of local languages. You need to first make up your mind about where you want to be. Do you want to be an FX Trader or Commodities Trader (Sales? or Execution?) - this might need impromptu VBA or Corporate Advisor or work in IPOs. Do you want to be on the buy side or the sell side? Do you want to be Front office or Middle office or Risk? Why would you want to work in Banking anyway? Its an over regulated mess. You're better off in Private Equity or Hedge Funds or Asset Management where salaries are higher and bonuses are excellent and regulation is relatively tolerable. You cannot just say I want to be in Banking because it generally sounds good. You can argue you do not know where you want to be yet and that is fine.. but  if you take an interest in learning about the markets and economies, you might already have an area of interest. Just read Bloomberg, Reuters or rather any news available. When you go for an interview, study the balance sheets of the bank and a couple of other firms. Most importantly, STOP THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S OUT THERE AND JUST GO OUT AND APPLY. That's the best way to find out. Frankly, the universe has sometimes surprised me about how accepting it can be. IMO, your BBA in Finance is way more than enough. There's tons of bankers that have done degrees like Physics and Engineering so you're better off. PS. CFA is ultimate    Embed Quote
