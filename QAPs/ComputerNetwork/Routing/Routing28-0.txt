★Are wine routes useful?Writing an article on their usefulness in Spain, but curious if anyone has found them appealing around the world, and if so, why?
I think they are, though I don't have direct experience of the details. Traveling into "wine country" whether Napa or Virginia or any local state area where they are growing grapes and producing wine is a fun afternoon for most people who enjoy wine. Learning the local grape varieties and seeing an operating winery is always fun.  I would make one suggestion..buy at least one bottle of wine. The wineries are in business and while they enjoy and encourage visits and tastings, it is common courtesy to not look upon them as "free" entertainment. Their time is valuable too.    Embed Quote
