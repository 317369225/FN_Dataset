★Has anyone done any of the SF2G bicycle routes?http://sf2g.com/ What was it like? What was the speed 'type' and how hard was it for you? How many people did you ride with?
Check out Strava for this data; because of the population of people who do the San Francisco to Google ride, there's a lot of self-trackers who contribute data there, and it's well logged and categorized. http://app.strava.com/segments/s... It has both average times, elevations, distances, difficulty levels of every different way to do that route.  (And there are a number of options).  The question is otherwise kind of meaningless unless you pick a specific one of those routes to ask about -- the main routes are Bayway, Bayshore Express, and Skyline, all of which are at that link.  Skyline is dramatically harder than the other two; Bayway is I think the most popular.    Embed Quote
