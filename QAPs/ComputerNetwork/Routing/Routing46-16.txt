★What are some of the legendary bus routes in chennai?
It has got to be 29C. Previously used to connect mandaveli and perambur (1980's), it was extended till besant nagar and recently some deluxe buses start from thiruvanmiyur. It is one of those buses which connects the south madras with north and it is famous for its bus stops especially the stella maris college (even though 23A ladies special was especially started for this).    Embed Quote
