★What music do ambulance drivers play en route to emergency calls?
I love having music on the truck but the type all depends on the type of call. Any call that is going to be high energy then it's hardcore rap or rock, techno, anything with a fast beat. Codes, I also play Another One Bites the Dust and Staying Alive (I sing both in my head once on scene). I do not allow passengers if the ambulance will be traveling emergency traffic, there is entirely too much risk if you aren't the person on the stretcher. After calls that are emotionally or psychologically upsetting I will listen to classical music or Dr Suess audiobooks specifically Have I Ever Told You How Lucky You Are. By the way, I make absolutely certain the person not driving is holding a radio close enough to monitor operations traffic.    Embed Quote
