★What are the best websites to map my itinerary and route for a trip?I've been looking but most of the websites I found do not have the basic features to map my trip properly.
Some great resources are listed here, with one exception that should be included: - HipTraveler - Inspired Travel Stories & Itineraries We focus not only the physical coordinates of the trip (i.e. mapping, printable & bookable itineraries), but also on the story telling that naturally goes along with traveling. Travelers visit HipTraveler to get inspired by travel stories that have embedded itineraries - we call them "Travelogues" and they are both entertaining (for inspiration when not traveling) and actionable (if you're planning a trip and want to start with a template) . You can also start an itinerary from scratch via a drag & drop interface that includes 55m destinations/activities from around the world, each with Wiki-Travel information and TripAdvisor reviews (for hotels). Your finalized itinerary is plotted on a map, printable, shareable, and fully bookable via top resources on the web or through our partner team of 700 travel planners. Hope you find the site helpful. Cheers!    Embed Quote
