★Where are the best running routes in Amsterdam?I will be there in October. What are some good routes to run (early morning)? Anything unique or routes that will help me see more of the city would be great.
Simple: go to the Amsterdamse Bos (Amsterdam Forest). Especially the south part around the Amstelveense Poel (the Amstelveen lake) is beautiful. Many routes and you'll see forest, water, animals and other crazy Amsterdam people.    Embed Quote
