★What route to take for a CSE student?
You couldn't be in a better mindset to begin. 1st thing's first - Do what you love. Secondly, polish yourself, absorb all the knowledge you can. Roadblocks always exist but so do ways to work past them. Thirdly, Simply because microsoft and google are 'big' shouldn't make you want to 'work for' them. (mind the apostrophes). Develop your skills, they might even want to work 'with' you. Or maybe you could make the next google. The possibilities are endless. Final advice - Keep learning. Keep creating.. no matter how stupid it is what you create. Never stop. Food for thought - It is as easy to dream as difficult it is to do. Take it from a guy who's tried and failed more than a few time.    Embed Quote
