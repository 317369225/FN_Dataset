★What are some of the legendary bus routes in chennai?
It is surprising to see not many people mentioning about the legendary 23C. This bus plying from Ayanavaram to Besant Nagar, passes through almost all parts of the the city. Plying through the mount road for its major part it connects the likes of major areas along the poonamalle high road to besant nagar. More importantly it gives access to major bus stops in the city from where you can get access to all parts of the city. The frequency of this bus is also very high and it is very special. 27D and 29C come a close second according to me.    Embed Quote
