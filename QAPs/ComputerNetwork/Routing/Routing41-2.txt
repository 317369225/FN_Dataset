★Where are the best running routes in Amsterdam?I will be there in October. What are some good routes to run (early morning)? Anything unique or routes that will help me see more of the city would be great.
Bike up the Amstel to Amstel Park. Lock Up Your Bike, and run from there as far as you can go. It's a beautiful run along the Amstel, and if you can really hoof it you'll get to Oudekerk on de Amstel, which is a beautiful small town on the Amstel. Beautiful clear path, you don't have to run in circles, and you get to see a beautiful part of the Netherlands that few tourists see.    Embed Quote
