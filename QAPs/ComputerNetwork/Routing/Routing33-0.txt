★Why don't airplanes follow the shortest route?I have noticed this in various flights. Airplanes don't follow the shortest route. Why do they deviate so much from the shortest route? Are there any way-points that they must pass through?
The other answers are all good. In addition to them, there's other factors.  Various ATC providers (usually nations) have different fee levels; there might be times when it's cheaper to slide a few dozen miles to one side or another and fly over a different country to get a lower cost bill from ATC. Additionally, various ATC systems have "preferred routes".  These are routes that the ATC provider wants flights to fly for various reasons; usually it's because the routes are deconflicted with other routes, airspaces, military use airspace, or other factors.  Here's a page for the FAA: NFDC Preferred Routes Database Finally, there's times when ATC will have to move your flight just because of equipment issues or outages.    Embed Quote
