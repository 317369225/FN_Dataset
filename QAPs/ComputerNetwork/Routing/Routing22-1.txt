★What is the Route in EmberJS?
The route plays a significant role in an ember application. The route wires together the model, controller and template, handles actions and provides hooks for various stages in the flow. How things are wired together: Conceptually (not necessarily in this order) the flow is: Url changes. Router gets new url and finds the correct route that should handle this url. The route loads the model. The route loads the controller and "gives" it the model it loaded. The route loads the template and "gives" it the model it loaded. The route renders the view (which, in turn, renders the template). (image take from smashingmagazine.com) Handling actions When an action is sent/triggered from a template it first goes to the controller, and if it is not handled there (or the action handler in the controller returned true) it will be sent to the route and bubble up the route chain if the route is nested. This means that you can choose to handle user actions in the route. Action bubbling: (Image taken from the ember documentation) Some useful hooks in the router: Model hook - this is the most important hook. This is where you load the model you want. setupController - this allows you to do some initialization work on the controller as it loads. redirect - this allows you to redirect to a different route. renderTemplate - this allows you to load any template you want for this route (this will override the default implementation of finding the template by naming convention) etc..
