★Link state routing is centralized routing or distributed routing?I don't understand the question. When you say centralized do you mean one node creates the routing table and tells the other nodes what to do? When you say distributed do you mean each node builds their own routing table independently?
Link state routing is essentially a distributed way of building routing tables at each node in the network. Consider it like this - initially, none of the nodes in the network have any information as to how many hops it would take to reach other nodes. So, to begin with, each node gathers information about its neighbours (nodes to which it is directly connected), and packages it into what is known as a 'link-state advertisement (LSA)' . True to its name, each node then advertises this 'link-state advertisement' throughout the network, essentially telling all the nodes about its own connectivity info. In finality, every node in the network gets such 'advertisements' and therefore, now has a picture of the complete network. With the knowledge of complete connectivity info, the problem of finding the shortest path to any node from this node can now be solved by the old faithful 'Djikstra's' algorithm. Each node then uses this algo. to create its own routing table. Since, the routing table is being independently build up at each node, it is a distributed algorithm. Also, any time a link-state changes (it fails or a failed link comes up), the nodes involved in the link create a new LSA and broadcast it again to the whole network. Each node then runs the Djistra's algorithm again to update its routing table.   P.S: As you might expect, there do exist optimized versions of this basic algorithm.    Embed Quote
