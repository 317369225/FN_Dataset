★What flight routes have the best views?What commercial airline flight routes have the most striking and unforgettable views out of the passenger cabin windows?
Landings on KOA are amazing. You get to see Maui, beautiful clear water and the coral/lava art (http://www.flickr.com/photos/asm...) that people create near the runway. Views landing in the Bay Area can be pretty nice, though the usual 28L/28R landing into SFO results in view of the ugly salt ponds. Here's a recent approach to SJC. Sadly, I got out the camera too late to snap the Marin Headlands and GG Bridge. Portland is also very nice. On a clear day, you can see quite a few mountains along the Cascades range. What's really nice about PDX is that you get a great view regardless of which side of the plane you're on. If you're looking South, you'll see Mt. Hood and possibly the sisters. If you're looking North, you'll see Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Adams and Mt. Rainier. This view is to the south: Mt. Hood is the big mountain you see. There are a few others further back, but I don't know what they are. One of the most interesting approaches is the one to SAN. Not recommended for nervous fliers.    Embed Quote
