★How do airlines design their routes?Do they just look at their hub-and-spoke model and make changes around the edges or do they think about maximal connectivity of their network?
It's sometimes instructive to see if you can get a hold of some copies of the internal magazine/newspaper for an airline.   Certainly when I worked for the subsidiary of an airline and we got copies of the newspaper there would be a question every so often along the lines of "why don't we fly to X destination, our competitor does and he's always full".   To which the answer was invariably "we've looked at it but the yield isn't enough for us to make money". In the end route development is driven by profit.   Connecting traffic is undoubtedly a part of the whole.   There's a story which I've never been able to verify about a travel agent in Austin who could never get a reasonably priced seat on a particular flight to Dallas.   Then, one day, just after he'd failed (again) he was looking at a connection to New York over Dallas and discovered that he COULD book a seat in the cheap class.   However, he discovered that he could only get availability to show if he booked Austin/Dallas/New York; whenever he looked at Austin/Dallas alone seats were never available.   So he took to booking the connection and then cancelling the Dallas/New York.   Of course, the airline eventually spotted what was going on and a law case ensued (don't know the result).   The result of that is 'married segments' these days if you book a connection they can be linked together in such a way by the airline that the agency cannot cancel just one flight - they have to cancel them all.    Embed Quote
