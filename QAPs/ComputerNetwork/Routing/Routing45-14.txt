★What is the best route (or tips) for a 25 year old who is focused on becoming financially free?
Pay down debt as fast as possible.  If you incur any future debt, it should be to acquire a useful professional education or income property. If you aren't smart enough to be a highly-paid accountant, attorney or engineer.  You can create a family-and-friends consortium, use the group's resources/credit to purchase residential properties. Install tenants and 'play monopoly' Let the tenant's labor pay for your houses.  Repeat this formula as much as possible.  Be selective, median housing prices and the price of money are both rising, but real estate in the right region is the best path to wealth. (Investigate the Reno/Carson area in Nevada, it will soon be a new technology corridor with many more jobs. Rents will rise). The only problem with these approaches is a perverse paradox.  These strategies take time.  You need to get rich slowly over the course of 5-15 years. Infants like yourself, who have all the time in the world, want everything immediately.  They can't imagine working 15 years for anything. Older folks have the self-discipline to delay gratification.    Embed Quote
