★Rock Climbing: What is it like to free solo a route?I'm curious about the motivation, thoughts, fears, emotions, focus etc. involved.
I remember when I learned to rock climb outside, ropes just seemed so stupid!  A very childlike view: why would people carry all this heavy, expensive shit out to the steepest cliffs (a tiny fraction of an immense rocky landscape), and then flail over and over on the same super-hard contrived moves??  So they could say they climbed a 5.XX??  Wouldn't it be more fun to just run around anywhere you please doing easier moves and scrambling?  Then you don't have to worry about going in a straight line, or getting tired and scared and falling...because you're doing easy comfortable moves and not pumping out your arms on extended vertical terrain.  You can stop and start when you want to instead of coordinating with a belayer and worrying about time.  I wanna go over there!  OK, I bet I could get there that way.  DONE!  Ooh, this is cool.  Oh, look, now I could get to up there via that little ledge.  Let's try it!  DONE!  What's around that corner??  Oh, not much, it's kinda steep and blank over there.  I guess I'll try this other way...ad infinitum.  Just as long as you can retrace your steps back down.  I've done some longer easy solos, and I usually find they're intimidating to look at from the bottom/approach, but then not scary once I'm up there.  It feels pretty similar to climbing trees.  Then if you have goals or "projects" that simple feeling gets all fucked up and fear comes into it.  I get way more scared leading than I do soloing.    Embed Quote
