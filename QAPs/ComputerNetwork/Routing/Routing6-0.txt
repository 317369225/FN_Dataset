★Public Transportation: How are bus routes determined?
For deciding bus-routes, authority has to decide the bus-stops first. Origin-Destination (O-D) matrix for all the trips in the region is created (there are several ways of data-collection like house survey, etc). Then considering the demand of the 'potential bus users' (which can be estimated with stated-preference survey) bus stops are chosen (so that the average walking-time to stop is optimized and a large number of users are covered). Using the O-D matrix, authority knows (or can guess) the travel-pattern of the potential bus-users and according to that it tries to optimize the operating cost (shortest distance -> fuel saving) and maximize the user-profit (network accessibility and minimum travel-time) by choosing between various bus-route options. (The routes can sometimes also depend upon other factors such as the traffic on particular routes, width of road, etc). I think this is the most basic idea in which bus-routing is done.    Embed Quote
