★Indian Railways: Which is the best train route in India?
My favorite & proud train route in India is Konkan Railway 738kms stretch of one of the fastest railway tracks in India with an operating speed of 120kms/hr from Thokur to Roha. The challenges to build this rail route were flash floods, landslides and tunnel collapses because of the high amounts of rains that affect the western ghats every year. With a total number of over 2,000 bridges(both short & long) and 91 tunnels to be built through this mountainous terrain containing many rivers, the project was the biggest and perhaps most difficult railway undertaking during this century, at least in India.    Embed Quote
