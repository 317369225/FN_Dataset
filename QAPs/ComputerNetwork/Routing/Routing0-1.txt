Traveling through the village of Maravanthe on NH-17 (now NH-66) connecting Mangalore to Goa is a one of a kind experience. The scenic beauty on this stretch is attributed to the Maravanthe beach on one side of the road and the Suparnika river on the other side. It's the only one of its kind in India. Of late, to prevent water from coming on to the roads, they now have a barrier of cut stones by the side of the road. This is how the stretch looks as of now.    Embed Quote
