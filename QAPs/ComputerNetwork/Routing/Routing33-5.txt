★Why don't airplanes follow the shortest route?I have noticed this in various flights. Airplanes don't follow the shortest route. Why do they deviate so much from the shortest route? Are there any way-points that they must pass through?
The downing of the Malaysian Airlines flight over Crimea has made airlines more aware of avoiding conflict airspace.   However I'm not sure the route shown is avoiding any such zones. There are zones that countries define as "prohibited airspace".   These can be implemented permanently or on a temporary basis and can be defined in terms of "all the way to outer space" (I can't remember the specific term) or as specific altitudes e.g. 0 to 5000 ft or Flight Level 120 to Flight Level 320 (essentially a 21000 foot prohibited area).   I don't have access to aeronautical charts or the NOTAMS in which the prohibition is announced but I'm guessing the dramatic change of course may be related to a prohibited piece of airspace. One other possibility is that given relations between India and Pakistan I suspect there are very specific gateways through which entry must be made and the kink was made to conform with the requirements of that entry point.    Embed Quote
