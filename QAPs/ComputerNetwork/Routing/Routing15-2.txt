★Can Ripple credit routing develop into an actual currency?
Yes and no. Ripple is a project to develop a protocol to establish a routing system to allow people to exchange IOUs with untrusted parties by exchanging IOUs only with trusted parties. The idea is slick and potentially revolutionary, but the problem is that nowadays very few people transact with each other exchanging IOUs even if they trust each other, while most people transact with each other exchanging central banks notes even if they trust each other. As said, routing IOUs through the trust graph is a revolutionary idea, but unfortunately the basic assumption of Ripple is wrong. So the main answer is no. The only exception would be if somebody came along that made exchanging IOUs between trusted parties work in the real world as a form of payment. I personally cofounded a startup project back in 2007 that tried to do just that, but it didn't work as expected. My personal experience is that it can be very hard to explain to the layperson that there's not much difference between receiving an IOU from a friend or receiving a central bank note from the same friend. Still, if someone solves this problem, then the answer will be yes.    Embed Quote
