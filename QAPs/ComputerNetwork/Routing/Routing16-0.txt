★Is the AODV routing protocol IP based routing protocol or link layer routing protocol?
I believe that AODV was initially developed within the MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks) context of IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), so you could chalk it up as IP layer routing. That said, AODV refers really to an algorithmic approach of creating routes reactively to when traffic appears for given destinations (nodes in a mesh). I am aware of several layer-2 mesh networking protocols that drew on AODV as their approach, for instance during the development of the 802.15.4-based wireles mesh networks (Zigbee and other stacks over 802.15.4 radios).
