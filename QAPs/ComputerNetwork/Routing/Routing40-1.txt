★Has anyone done any of the SF2G bicycle routes?http://sf2g.com/ What was it like? What was the speed 'type' and how hard was it for you? How many people did you ride with?
What was it like? Without a doubt, riding your bike 40+ miles to work is the absolute best way to start your day.  Didn't get enough sleep?  Whatever.  Raining cats and dogs?  Bring it on.  You start the day feeling like you've accomplished something (getting up that early!! :-).  If you can ride your bike 40+ miles to work, you can tackle anything your job throws at you.  It's quite empowering. What was the speed 'type' and how hard was it for you? I've done the range.  When I first started riding with SF2G in 2010, I felt confident I could hang with a "style 2" ride, but it was a struggle that very first one.  But SF2G are a friendly bunch, so there was always a wheel to follow.  Eventually, I got stronger and have always been able to  find others to ride with at any given pace.  I strongly recommend coming out for one of the First Friday rides to start with, then work your way up through the styles - in order of increasing difficulty: 3, 2, and 1. How many people did you ride with? My very first SF2G ride had 6-8 people, I think?  The First Friday rides tend to draw large crowds -- upwards of 30-40 and beyond in the summer months.  My schedule (work, kids in school, etc.) currently limits me to 1 SF2G day per week, and our grupetto is usually 3-6 total (it's generally a "style 1" ride along the Skyline route). Final comment: I think it's only fair to say that SF2G changed my life.  I always enjoyed riding a bicycle, but SF2G has instilled in me a love for the sport of cycling that I don't think I would have had otherwise.  I always look forward to getting up stupid early on Wednesday mornings so I can ride my bike 57 miles from my house to my office with my SF2G pals.    Embed Quote
