★Which Compostela route is the most scenic?There are so many different pilgrimage routes that lead to Santiago de Compostela, I actually don't know where to start my research.
Last year I hiked the Camino Francés and the Camino Aragonés and I can safely vouch for the latter. This is where I officially started in Somport. After a couple of miles the altitude was already heavily decreased. This was in the middle of nowhere - second day. There were a lot of forest paths on the second day. This is where the second day ended. I slept in the buildings on the left, with two other hikers. At this point there was absolutely nothing in a 10 mile radius - very usual for the Camino Aragonés. The following four pictures are from the third day. The altitude decreased roughly to 700m/2300ft and stayed like that for the rest of the trip (on average). Except for the first day, I catched really bad weather and taking photos was impossible for the most part. The first 5 days were really special (until the two ways merge in Puente la Reina). It was rare to see other hikers on the way, usually only in the albergues. After the Camino Aragonés flows into the Camino Francés the whole feeling changes. You suddenly meet dozens of pilgrims every hour, which isn't a bad thing, but I was there in April-May 2012 and that wasn't exactly high season yet. Even though the Camino Aragonés is less popular, the infrastructure is still very good (Wi-Fi is pretty rare though). I can't think of one unfriendly person along the way. Everyone was super nice and helpful despite my non-existent Spanish skills.    Embed Quote
