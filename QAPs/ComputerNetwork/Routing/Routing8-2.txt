★Does OpenFlow basically centralise routing decisions?Trying to understand what's going on from reading this : http://www.wired.com/wiredenterp... Is OpenFlow basically central planning of routing decisions?
Nice answers. If I may add. Sometime it seems openflow centralizes the decisions because of the use of a controller. However, these controllers don't have to be centralized. The protocol allows you to use many controllers, distribute controllers, integrate controllers. This level of mixing and matching gives unprecedented capability to implement your plans. However, you CAN make it centralized if you wanted to. But remember that ones rules are installed, the openflow switches execute these themselves.    Embed Quote
