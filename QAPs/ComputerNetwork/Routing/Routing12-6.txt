★What was your route to becoming a Product Manager, and how do you think it helped you to become a better PM as opposed to other routes?
Dan Schmidt experience is very exciting!  Goes to prove that perspectives are more important for a career in Product Management! My journey was more straight forward.  It was a straight entry into product management.  But there were a few deviations in between: 1) I started with a short stint in the support team, which I consider a great incubator for a Product Manager to understand the product fundamentals, get to build rapport with customers (who are the potential customers for future releases), work with development etc. 2) After 2 years into my product management job, I took a sabbatical (if I can call it so) and joined the projects team as a business consultant.   I got to understand the way consultants and project members work with the product, what kind of requirements does customers put across and how the project team handles them.  I would say this experience is very essential for product managers: You get to acutely understand customer requirements and product limitations in this phase.  You get to understand that there's some truth in the consultants' frustrations with your product; you start respecting them more. And in turn, project teams start respecting you more (from being a white-collared PM guy sitting at the tower to a 'I'm willing to get my hands dirty' guy).  3) Again after 10 years of core Product Management (which includes 3+ years in project teams), I am  now delving more into Product Marketing and Sales.  This, needless to say, offers a totally different perspective to what PM is all about.    Embed Quote
