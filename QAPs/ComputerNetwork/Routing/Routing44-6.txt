★What is your escape route from the reality of everyday life?what are the things that you do in order to relieve yourself from daily stress and anxiety. Eg: Books, exercise, walking, chatting, swimming etc ...
I used to read books and listen to music to "escape the reality of everyday life". But I realized that I read books regularly anyway, and I'm permanently listening to music. I needed something else. Then I realized...I live in a city which has tens of hundreds of areas inside it, and so many smaller towns around it. So I go explore these places. Mostly inside the city, during the week. I go for a walk to these places, into bylanes, onto the main roads, via the little streets. It's something else. :)    Embed Quote
