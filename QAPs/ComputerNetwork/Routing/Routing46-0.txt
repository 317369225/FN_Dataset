★What are some of the legendary bus routes in chennai?
I cannot forget the days i paid 30 rupees to get a ticket from Tambaram to Broadway to travel on the Volvo AC - 21G just to get a glimpse of the chennai airport over the flyover. and yeah, it takes you thro' the GST road and cuts into the heart of the city at Guindy...The only days you wished desperately for a traffic jam at Guindy to enjoy the AC more ! sorgam :D    Embed Quote
