★What are the best running routes in Paris?The longer, the better—preferably over 6 miles (~10km)
Depends where you're starting from. In the summer, a cool route to follow is simply along the river Seine - either bank is fine. You'll pass next to a large number of landmarks - the Eiffel tower, Notre-Dame de Paris or l'Assemblée Nationale to name but a few. More classic or if you like a country-like setting are Paris' woods: the Bois de Vincennes and the Bois de Boulogne. Both feature a lake that it's nice to run around.    Embed Quote
