★What internal routing protocol do ISPs use?
By "internal routing protocol" I'm presuming that you're referring to the protocols used to propagate internal-only routes and routes to BGP peers (as opposed to external routes learned via BGP, which should always be propagated internally via IBGP). In my experience, IS-IS is seen most commonly on inter-city backbone networks, often with MPLS/RSVP being used for additional traffic engineering. For routing inside a POP or datacenter location (between access and backbone routers), OSPF is common, but sometimes you'll see BGP utilizing private AS numbers here as well (see http://www.nanog.org/meetings/na...)    Embed Quote
