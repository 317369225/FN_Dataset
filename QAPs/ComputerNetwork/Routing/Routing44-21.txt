As weird as this may sound, whenever I'm nervous or tensed out, I eat. More than usual. To be honest, a lot more than usual. I keep on checking the fridge every 5 minutes like an idiot, hoping that chocolates will magically appear. Unfortunately, they don't. I eat whatever I can, but I prefer chocolates. Eating somehow calms me down, and helps me concentrate. A great way to unnerve, isn't it?    Embed Quote
