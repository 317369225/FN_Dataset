★Where are the best running routes in Amsterdam?I will be there in October. What are some good routes to run (early morning)? Anything unique or routes that will help me see more of the city would be great.
In addition to those nice, quiet routes in Vondel Park and Rembrandt Park, if you want to see more of the old town, try zig-zagging along the nicest canals (grachten). Here is a description of a nice canal route, with images and a map: Amsterdam Canals Running Route    Embed Quote
