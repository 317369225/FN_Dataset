★What can possibly be wrong with seeking the easiest route?
When people set out to climb a mountain, they may be undertaking an almost superhuman task, but you can be sure that they climb it step by agonizing step, by the easiest route possible. I wonder about the fitness analogy, since walking and working out really are the easy way to get fit. You don't often see a guy out baling hay just for the exercise. You'd get fit, all right, but it's no fun.    Embed Quote
