★What's the best free website or app for mapping running and walking routes?I've been using MapMyRun.com but they now have so many ads that the site is less functional.
If you want full fledged functionality in a free app, you might want to try runens (http://www.runens.com). We decided to start developing it because none of the existing apps take a social approach. It's available for free on the Apple's App Store: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/r... We would love to hear from you guys!    Embed Quote
