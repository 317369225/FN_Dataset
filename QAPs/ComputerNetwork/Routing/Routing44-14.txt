★What is your escape route from the reality of everyday life?what are the things that you do in order to relieve yourself from daily stress and anxiety. Eg: Books, exercise, walking, chatting, swimming etc ...
Snacks, because it gets me pepped up. Sleep, because with sleep comes dreams and with dreams I get to imagine things that reality can't provide me. Watching sitcoms, because I laugh and forget all worries at least for a while. Watching movie or a chat with dad and mum, because it is a strong reminder that I am never alone in this world. Music, because it is a powerful mood changer.    Embed Quote
