★What are the best scenic drives in the Bay Area?All types of drives: city, ocean, country, mountain, etc...
There's no shortage of wonderful drives throughout the area -- along the coast, in the redwoods, or in the towns and cities, especially SF.  But if you JUST drive, you'll miss a lot of what the area offers.  There are hiking trails everywhere, and it's easy to park and spend an hour or two walking in every sort of local environment.    Embed Quote
