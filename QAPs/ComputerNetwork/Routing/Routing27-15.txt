★What can possibly be wrong with seeking the easiest route?
We all have a tendency to try to make life easier on ourselves. If we are going somewhere, we try to take the shortest, most efficient route. However, there are a lot of things in life that require hard work over a protracted period of time to accomplish, and there are no easy ways to do them. In a relationship, it often takes a considerable effort to make it work. The easy way would be to give it up and look for someone else the first sign of conflict. That is seldom the best way to go either short or long term. In our studies, it may be far easier to coast along, doing the minimal work required, but that certainly isn't the best way to maximize the value of your education. In business, we may see easy ways to cheat for short term profit, but any time we compromise out integrity, we lose out in the long term. A lot of things take time and effort to do well, and the easy way does not produce quality results. Always seeking the easy way may lead us to make many unwise or foolish decisions.    Embed Quote
