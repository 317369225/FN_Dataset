★Who designs the routes at rock climbing gyms and how?Is there repository or something?
Each route setter has a different way of doing it. From climbing walls I've been to I've seen 3 types. 1. Place a specific hold or move on the wall and then put holds around it until they reach the desirable grade. 2. Create a problem without planning, climb it and then grade it. 3. Look at the kind of moves a certain grade has and try and put those moves on the wall. I haven't been to many walls but this is all I know. There could be loads more ways    Embed Quote
