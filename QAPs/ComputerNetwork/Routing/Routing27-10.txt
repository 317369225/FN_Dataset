★What can possibly be wrong with seeking the easiest route?
If you train yourself to only take the easy route, then when something difficult comes along you might not be able to cope.  However, "path of least resistance" occurs quite a lot.  Some people do have a genius at finding solutions with the least possible consequences or effort, and that's not being lazy, it's being brilliant.  Nothing wrong with that.   If you know that you are a person who seeks or just plain always finds the easiest route, your self-awareness is a really good thing.  So, seek out things that might interest you, but are difficult to achieve.  Maybe you can find an easy route to those as well, but it just needs you to apply yourself more initially, and create a strategy to make it easy in the long run.   Good luck!    Embed Quote
