★What are the best scenic drives in the Bay Area?All types of drives: city, ocean, country, mountain, etc...
All these suggestions are great, and it makes me extremely grateful that I have lived here for 25 years. Here are a couple short ones that are rather surprising, as all the key ones have already been mentioned: 1) Crow Canyon Rd. from Castro Valley to San Ramon is a winding road that weaves thru the hills where there is one equestrian ranch after another. You see people training on their horse in the ring in the front of each place and its truly unique, sitting between 2 highly urbanized areas. The rolling hills add more character to it, especially in the winter when everything is so green. Its only about 15 minutes long but its really nice. 2) Route 84 between 680 and 238 in Fremont. It runs along the Alameda Creek which is more like a very small river. Its very beautiful and tranquil and reminds me of Europe a bit, where French stop along the road and have lunch. Its also only about 15-20 minutes long but is a nice alternative to staying on the freeways.    Embed Quote
