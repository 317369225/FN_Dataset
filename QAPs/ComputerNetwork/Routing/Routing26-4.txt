★What are the best running routes in Paris?The longer, the better—preferably over 6 miles (~10km)
I agree that with the list so far: the Bois de Boulogne is great for a green getaway, the Canal St. Martin for quiet canal-side runs and the Seine for running by all the famous sites (with loud traffic on the riverside streets). I've written up all of these route descriptions, with maps and images, at my blog, if you're interested: http://www.joggingroutes.org Just click on the "Routes by Countries/Cities" link for the list    Embed Quote
