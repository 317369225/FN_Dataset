★What route to take for a CSE student?
Let me tell u one thing Do you know the company you are dreaming to join to work on OS is actually a company started by college drop out. At that time when he had started making an OS , how many of them had disrespected him and must have said that it is most difficult work to do. I believe every single person. If at that time he would had stopped working on his OS then he wouldn't be the king of the computer world at present time. So think yourself. Either to stop by seeing the difficulties or you say to ur difficulties "Do u even have the guts to stand infront of me because I can solve you very easily" Choice is all yours...    Embed Quote
