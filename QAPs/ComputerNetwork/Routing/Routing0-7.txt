â˜…What are some of the best roads/routes in India?Please add images! Let us please limit the scope here (India only), else the data here will become incomprehensible. We'll be lost in a sea of data otherwise!
From my experience, the route from Gangtok to Nathu La pass is pretty breathtaking! It's very close to the Indo-Chinese border in Sikkim and thus is used a lot by the army. I don't think these photographs do justice to the same! It passes right through the Himalayas! A look from the road of the Tsango lake. The road close to the Chinese border. An army man looks on as we cross an army post.
