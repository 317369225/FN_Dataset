★What can possibly be wrong with seeking the easiest route?
It obviously depends on the destination.  There are opinions that say work, work, work, blood and sweat builds character.  While a more centered approach dictates the use of outsourcing and teams to better handle a task.  My thought is, you did it yourself, then toot your horn, but put credit where it's due.    Embed Quote
