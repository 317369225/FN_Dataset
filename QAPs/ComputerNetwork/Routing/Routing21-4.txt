★Is it offensive to use a cemetery as part of the route on a morning run?Without sharing my own, I'm interested in where opinions fall on this question.
I don't think so, you don't bother the living, and you bless the dead with some company. Along the way, you get a nice place to run through with peace and quiet. Sounds like a "hell" of a bargain :) Kidding, that's great.    Embed Quote
