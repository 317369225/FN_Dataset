★What are the best websites to map my itinerary and route for a trip?I've been looking but most of the websites I found do not have the basic features to map my trip properly.
I like TripRider < TripRider > it doesn't really do maps, but I like it for planning my itinerary and route.  It has a lot of flexibility for adding other stuff and links, and you can add maps or link images to your itinerary or trip journal..  I like it for the budgeting and planning stuff, the realtime journalling and diary stuff, the expense tracking and location tagging.  I have tried several trip mapping apps, and have not really found any that are worth recommending.  Either they don't work at all offline, or have a very outdated database of sites (restaurants, hotels, etc), some had a very complicated scheme for selecting which maps you wanted downloaded for offline maps and which were downloaded and every time they updated the app I lost all the maps that I had downloaded, so I went on a trip assuming I had maps downloaded for the local area, when to look at a map and there was nothing..    Also, all of the ones I tried would allow you to view maps offline, BUT there was NO route planning or even distance checking between two points off line... Offline was viewing ONLY..    Embed Quote
