★Rock Climbing: What is it like to free solo a route?I'm curious about the motivation, thoughts, fears, emotions, focus etc. involved.
I explain it like this: When you walk up stairs you don't always use the handle. So if you get really good at stairs i can take the railing away. Now, no railing, but I am going to make the stairs smaller, you master this in no time, but it makes your heart beat harder. This is the concept. You gain mastery and it feels like walking up stairs. This is how your perspective changes and you reach a mental place where you are able to solo. During a solo: You feel freedom. "You never climb better then when you are soloing" ~ Honnold For me, I feel weightless because falling is not an option. There is a rush, but it comes in the anticipation, not in the execution. Soloing is very centering and requires a sound and confident mind. It also has the ability to change your perspective on climbing and how you view risk. Soloing is personal and each person's experience will be unique, what you think about and how you do it is 100% up to you and don't let anyone convince otherwise. I sing. Or repeat rap songs in my head. Or i just breath. Soloing is selfish, anyone who argues has not lost a friend to climbing. It can be like a drug and I had to step away from it. These are my thoughts from personal experience. Roberto    Embed Quote
