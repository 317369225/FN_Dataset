★Has anyone done any of the SF2G bicycle routes?http://sf2g.com/ What was it like? What was the speed 'type' and how hard was it for you? How many people did you ride with?
Yes, many times. The route, number of others, and intensity varies a lot. Most mornings a group leaves on the Bayway route (or variation of, see http://sf2g.com/bayway.html) at about 7am. Pace is generally ~18/9mph rolling ("style 2". Even if you can't ride on the front a that speed sitting in a group is quite comfortable. When I've done this there have been between 4 and 12 others. The route is about as traffic-free and safe as it could be, if a little uninspiring. In addition to the Bayway rides there are a lot of alternatives -- Skyline rides, FFFF (First Friday Friendly Frolic -- Bayway where nobody is left behind), etc. Now and then there are style 1 rides, which are very hard (stretches at 25-30mph). Your best bet is to watch the mailing list (https://groups.google.com/forum/...) for ride announcements and decode them with the terms and definitions page (http://sf2g.com/terms.html).    Embed Quote
