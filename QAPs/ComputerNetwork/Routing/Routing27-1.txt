★What can possibly be wrong with seeking the easiest route?
In the immortal words of Utah Phillips: the profit system follows the path of least resistance and following the path of least resistance is what makes the river crooked! That said, the Daoist in me says why not take the easiest road? The easiest road is the one most in alignment with integrity. This path causes the least disturbance psychologically. It has nothing to do with easy in terms of effort though.    Embed Quote
