★Rock Climbing: What is it like to free solo a route?I'm curious about the motivation, thoughts, fears, emotions, focus etc. involved.
I have done a fair bit of rock climbing and recently went on my first free solo climb. The euphoric feeling of having conquered the climb alone with no support, the feeling of being one with the world around you when you stand at the apex and the quiver in your hands and knees from all that adrenalin is matchless. To stand on top of a ridge and proclaim yourself master of all you see gives one a feeling of invincibility and as every man knows, no amount of testosterone can give you that.There were moments where loose rocks came off in my hands when climbing and  I nearly slipped and fell. If I had fallen  it would have meant plunging 50-60 odd meters. I lost my nerve at a  point and it is not a nice feeling. It's a feeling of paralysis brought  on by terror and despair. My voice shook and my hands were trembling. The feeling of being in the zone, knowing that every step you take may  be your last, brings your mind into extreme focus. Nothing exists but  you and the next step you take. I do not recommend it. It is extremely dangerous and an incredibly stupid thing to do.    Embed Quote
