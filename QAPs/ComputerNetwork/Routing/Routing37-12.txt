★What's the best free website or app for mapping running and walking routes?I've been using MapMyRun.com but they now have so many ads that the site is less functional.
I like www.mapmyrun.com - it's great for just tracking and measuring distance. If you're serious about running and walking, I'd suggest joining a community like www.dailymile.com. I love it! You can also map your walks/runs there, track them each day, write notes, find running routes and walking trails nearby, follow your (and others') progress, etc. I find being part of the community, even though it's just virtual, does wonders for my motivation. How can I make myself go back to bed knowing that everyone else is waking up and running?    Embed Quote
