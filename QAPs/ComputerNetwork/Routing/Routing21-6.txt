★Is it offensive to use a cemetery as part of the route on a morning run?Without sharing my own, I'm interested in where opinions fall on this question.
The best ultra runner in the world Yiannis Kouros has built his home in the past opposite of a cemetery. He could see it from his window of living room and kitchen. When they asked him why he said that he reminds him that every day must do something for his targets. Just run in the cemetery.    Embed Quote
