★What cross-country route is the longest road trip in the world?
I want more better travelled people than myself to answer this, yes, but venturing a guess from my understanding of geography here.   Vladivostok, Russia to Cape of Good Hope, South Africa?   You'd have to get from Kamchatka peninsula via Siberia, Kazhakstan and other Bactrian states through Iran, Iraq, Arabia and past the Al-Salam bridge into Africa. Then there's the daunting task of getting from Cairo in northern Egypt, all the way to Cape of Good Hope, at the southern tip of the continent.
