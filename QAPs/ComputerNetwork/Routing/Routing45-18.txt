★What is the best route (or tips) for a 25 year old who is focused on becoming financially free?
I think financial freedom comes in two ways. Charles gave some good advice on the "saving" side, but there is also the "spending" side. Being financially free requires all material needs to be met without much concern for those needs being met in the future. Adjusting your spending right away to allow for saving and also set the stage for future expectations is the key. Some ways younger people are approaching meeting financial freedom is living in a very small place, sharing or buying a "tiny house". For me personally, I invested in the stock market at 17, purchased a house and from then on I had tenants to pay my mortgage for me. At the same time I was still working, reaping investment earnings and my home was appreciating in value. My next step is to look more seriously at dividend stocks, buy another home and re-evaluate the material possessions I need to be happy. A useful tracking tool for how much you need in retirement (aka to be financially free) is the goals function on Mint.com This will show your progress and encourage you to keep saving.    Embed Quote
