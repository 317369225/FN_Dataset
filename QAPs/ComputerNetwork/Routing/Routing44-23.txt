★What is your escape route from the reality of everyday life?what are the things that you do in order to relieve yourself from daily stress and anxiety. Eg: Books, exercise, walking, chatting, swimming etc ...
Working out. That one hour, hour and half, its just me, locked in my zone. Either I'm lifting weights or I'm pacing around, gathering my breath. I won't talk to anybody, my phone will be switched off. There's no wasted time, no wasted effort. When you enter the gym, you leave all your worries and insecurities behind. The gym is a place where we all get better. The endorphin high after a workout is also always welcome.    Embed Quote
