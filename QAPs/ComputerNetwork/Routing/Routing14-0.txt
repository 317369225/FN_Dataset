★What are network routing protocols?
Routing protocols are the languages(generic) used by routing devices like routers or L3 switches to conduct the packets according to a routing algorithm.They are used to determine the appropriate path over which the data is transmitted. It enables dynamic adjustments to specific conditions, so routing decisions need not be static. Routing decisions can be based on minimum number of hops, least cost paths, source routing(the path is predetermined) or based on any other metric. There may be multiple routing protocol's which are responsible to carry a packet from your default gateway to the destination. Some of them are BGP, OSPF, EIGRP, IS-IS et al.
