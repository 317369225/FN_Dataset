★What was your route to becoming a Product Manager, and how do you think it helped you to become a better PM as opposed to other routes?
When I was 5, I knew I wanted to be a product manager... "PM" ... sounded soo sexy and exciting. Yeah, right. It's not one of those titles or jobs. However, there are many kids now a days who say they want to own their own business or be their own boss and founders & product managers tend to go hand in hand. Often as a product manager, you essentially own the product and deal with many similar tasks and challenges that founders of early companies face. In high school, I had no clue what I wanted to do and the same goes for my first year of college. However, that first year was great because it's where I learned a lot of things that I DIDN'T want to do. So I transferred from the small liberal arts school going into my second year to another small school, but it at least had a business school. I decided to major in MIS primarily because I wasn't too interested in any other major except for CS but I knew I couldn't code. My mind doesn't work that way. I didn't know that it would lead to product management or that I always wanted to work on products but looking back it makes total sense. The internet always fascinated me but I didn't even know who was responsible for it and all the cool things on it. I was fortunate enough to snag an internship during my sophomore year that I actually kept until my senior year (I started out at 20 hours a week and quickly worked my way up to about 30 and sometimes more than 40 by modifying my schedule to always take night classes). I worked in a small product group for a company called Bill Me Later which was eventually acquired by eBay/PayPal. My internship is where I learned everything; I mean everything. I hated school and got very little out of it. The most that I got out of it was the internship and I'll be forever thankful for that.    Embed Quote
