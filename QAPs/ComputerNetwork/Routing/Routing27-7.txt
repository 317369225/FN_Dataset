★What can possibly be wrong with seeking the easiest route?
Take things always by their smooth handle « Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello Take things always by their smooth handle There is no point in making most things more difficult than they have to be, make the light be worth the candle.  If you're pioneering a new radical cure for Cancer, throw yourself against the wall.  If you're making an omelette, there's no good reason to make your own pan and then raise your own chickens and churn your own butter.  More importantly, doing unnecessary drudge work the hard way actually ties up time and energy you could be applying to that cure, so it's really an opportunity cost argument.  Having said that, there is great value in having done most things the hard way at least once.  That's what most of education is about because actually doing the grunt work gives you insight into the whole problem.    Embed Quote
