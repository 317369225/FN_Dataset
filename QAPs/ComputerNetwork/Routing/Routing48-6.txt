★Rock Climbing: What is it like to free solo a route?I'm curious about the motivation, thoughts, fears, emotions, focus etc. involved.
I only did it on one easy route 5.8 (several times though). My main motivation was to put myself in extreme focus. Mistakes there would mean injury or possible death (depending on how you fall). But each time I did it on that route my confidence would go up and I liked that feeling. But I started free soloing on it only after I had climbed it few times via top rope.    Embed Quote
