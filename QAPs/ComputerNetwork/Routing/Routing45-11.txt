★What is the best route (or tips) for a 25 year old who is focused on becoming financially free?
Currently the question does not specify how soon you want to be financially free or how wealthy a lifestyle you want to secure.  There are different answers for different versions of your goal. If you want financial freedom in less than 5 years, and you want to be rich, then you'll have to gamble.  You probably have to try stock market speculation.  You'll have to invest borrowed money, secured with just about everything you have.  See Charles Tips's answer on leverage.  This is obviously risky.  Your chances of success are better than investing everything in lottery tickets, but not great.  Try to identify some factor that moves the whole stock market, that other people haven't identified, and that you can accurately measure/predict.  And be prepared to fail and keep failing. If you want financial freedom in 10-20 years and you can be satisfied with slightly rich, you should look to start your own business.  Again, you will probably use borrowed money, secured with everything you have.  Try to learn the business first, so you can make a smart choice whether to start a business from scratch, buy a franchise, or buy an existing business.  A lot of new businesses fail.  So you should understand (not just hope) how your business will be different from the failures.  If you want financial freedom in 40 years, and you are satisfied with prosperous, then get an education, work at a high paying job for 30+ years, save your money, and avoid the kind of risky behavior that can bankrupt you (from texting while driving to spending more than you earn).  This path doesn't guarantee success (there may be recessions, wars, and political upheavals in the next 40 years).  But your odds are very good if you live in a generally successful economy (US, Canada, western Europe, ...).    Embed Quote
