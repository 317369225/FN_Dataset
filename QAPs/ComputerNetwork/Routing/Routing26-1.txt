★What are the best running routes in Paris?The longer, the better—preferably over 6 miles (~10km)
Bois de Vincennes is just outside the city on the east side of Paris at the end of the 1. It has great paths and trails to run on and is very pretty. There is also a track in the park that is open to everyone.    Embed Quote
