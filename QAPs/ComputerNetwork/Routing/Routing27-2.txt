★What can possibly be wrong with seeking the easiest route?
When we need to reach our destination, we don't curse the road that is easy to travel, nor do we question why the road is so easy. However, we don't take the easy road if it doesn't lead to our destination. Taking the easy road is not a problem, but beware of people that change their destination in favor of being able to travel the easy road, for you may find them difficult to depend upon.    Embed Quote
