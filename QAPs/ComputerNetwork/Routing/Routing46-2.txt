★What are some of the legendary bus routes in chennai?
Some of them are Route 1 : Thiruvanmiyur to Thiruvotriyur    Connects the north end to south end. Supposedly the most frequent , one in seven minutes. Goes through Queen Mary's college Route 29C: Besant Nagar to Perambur. Connects the cool part of the city to the industrial areas. Have seen so many flower merchants on it. Goes through the all important Stella Marys college and stops close to Satyam cinemas The extended version goes to the various Milk factories Route 5b : Mylapore to T Nagar. Via adyar ceg Guindy. Other famous routes are 21G 21L 47d 147 ( spent many hours while in college dreaming about getting a job in Padi which would ensure I still took this bus, think it's the longest route) I know am a little prejudiced towards the buses operating where I had to go and hoping other can share better examples    Embed Quote
