★What is routing?I understand it makes the URLs prettier. Some examples show PHP code, some just show examples of a mod_rewrite. Can someone explain the logic of routing and why it's used?
One example could be routing to specific Controller with usage of MVC architecture. I suppose you know about MVC and how it works... Suppose this url scheme: Page on someurl.com e.g. http://www.someurl.com/user/login/   => login user to website        http://www.someurl.com/user/logout/  => logout user to website        http://www.someurl.com/editor/ph... => edit article with specific title In this case first parameter presents specific Controller that will be initialized (user,editor) by Router. Next parameters listed after Controller name in url represent actions that will be processed (login,logout,article title) by Controller. Parameters  will be passed to the Controller object. According to specific action, controller initializes particular Models and procces request then return result to a Router which puts data to a view template. If you have directory tree on server e.g. like that: /classes/ /classes/Model/ /classes/View/ /classes/Controller/ ... and if each class is in special file called same as Class name within files, you can easily call for particular Controllers according to the URL. It's very useful to setup autoloader so you do not have to include each file-class that you want to use. Reasons of usage are simple: A Code of web application is much more "clean"/"readable". Also it allows as to easy expand our application. ps.: this is more relating to the MVC architecture but I think properly routing makes also difference to better. Also clean and readable urls are better for ordinary users than long confusing strings.    Embed Quote
