★Why don't airplanes follow the shortest route?I have noticed this in various flights. Airplanes don't follow the shortest route. Why do they deviate so much from the shortest route? Are there any way-points that they must pass through?
Several reasons: Air Traffic Congestion Hazards and restrictions Sovereign airspace rights You are correct, way points are required checkpoints because in many regions of the world, commercial radar service does not exist and thus to maintain safe flight traffic separation, reporting in is required.    Embed Quote
