★What is the easiest/cheapest route to break into banking?
Thanks for the A2A but being a civil engineer, I am familiar only with excel VBA and Python and hence am limiting myself to those. Precisely as Yaj Kumar says, non-core companies (like consulting, banking) can not and do not expect you to know exactly what you need to do from day #1. But they definitely expect you to have at atleast a sound basic understanding so that they can confidently invest money and time in getting you to learn the nuances of your work.   Learning Excel VBA: "Excel 2010 power programming with VBA" by John Walkenbach is an excellent reference material Have you tried youtube for online tutorials ? Bill Jelen ExcelVbaIsFun and a lot other channels offer excellent tutorials. Learning Python: Youtube !! and of course there are so many other learning websites like Coursera which offer online courses (free). For your information: What are some websites similar to Coursera? Hope I helped.    Embed Quote
