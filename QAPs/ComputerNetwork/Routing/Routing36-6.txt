★What are the best scenic drives in the Bay Area?All types of drives: city, ocean, country, mountain, etc...
The drive through Napa Valley Wine Country, Highway 29 from Napa to Calistoga, is outstanding.  And, if you're turning around and coming back through again, try taking the Silverado Trail that parallels R29 on its eastern side.  Leave plenty of time to stop at the many wineries and quaint little towns along the way.  Our favorites are Yountville, St. Helena, and Calistoga. One tip, however.....if you can, go on a weekday....R29 gets very congested on weekends during tourist season (May thru October).    Embed Quote
