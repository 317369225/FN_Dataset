★Who designs the routes at rock climbing gyms and how?Is there repository or something?
There are professionals called setters that are responsible for routes and bouldering problems. There isn't really a "repository", they come up with them on their own or in a team. For big competitions, there will be a few people on each route to make sure it is doable, challenging, and entertaining, but for a local gym each setter with come up with a bunch of routes or boulders and get to work. Some gyms do let anyone set, but this can be a dangerous practice, as using the wrong bolts can break holds, putting holds in the wrong places can break holds, and some moves could be dangerous if done incorrectly (for example, setting a dyno where missing means a head injury). Good setters will also try to set for all body types, not just tall or short problems.    Embed Quote
