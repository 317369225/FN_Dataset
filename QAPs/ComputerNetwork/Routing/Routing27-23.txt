★What can possibly be wrong with seeking the easiest route?
In today's generation ,not at all. Infact people appreciate when we seek for the easiest way because today time is money and if a work can be done easily in less time and less effort than we are eventually saving time. Complicating things some how proves that you have less knowledge about the thing.Some people ,some how like to do things in a complicated manner but it makes no difference . So go for it.    Embed Quote
