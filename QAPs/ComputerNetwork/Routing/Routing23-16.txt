★Is it physically possible to walk uphill to school both ways, using the same route?Apart from having a hill in between your house and the school and forgetting to mention that.
I suppose it is possible depending on your definition of "uphill." If it is defined relative to the direction of net gravitational pull, then it would be possible because the moon could be pulling against you both ways. Imagine, for example, that the path is completely flat relative to the net gravitational pull of all objects except for the moon. You would just need to have the moon "behind" you and on the other side of the earth for each transit. That would give the feeling (albeit a very slight and imperceptible one) of walking uphill each time.    Embed Quote
