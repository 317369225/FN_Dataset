★Has anyone done any of the SF2G bicycle routes?http://sf2g.com/ What was it like? What was the speed 'type' and how hard was it for you? How many people did you ride with?
I've taken part a few times on supposedly Style-3 rides that were revealed to have turned into Style-2 :D. Bear in mind, while I bike a lot I am a pretty big guy. Some of the SF2G'ers are probably half my weight. So my experience is colored by that. The first time was a challenging but very enjoyable Bayway Express (I think). I rode with about 8 regular SF2G'ers and the atmosphere was great. There were one or two tough bits but most of it was just solid pace on flat ground. I don't recommend it unless you have a fast set-up (light bike, drop bars, SPD pedals) or are pretty fit or ideally both! I found a cyclocomputer useful as I was able to monitor myself and the group better. The subsequent two times were less enjoyable: both times I struggled to keep up with the group, and whatever the route was (some variant of Bayway) there were some tough hills near the start. The 3rd time I got a puncture and ended up just taking Caltrain from San Mateo for the remainder of the route. That was last summer. Now that I'm back in the Bay Area I'm hoping to drop some weight and take part maybe every 2 or 3 weeks for kicks (I work in the Google SF office so don't need to be in MTV much)    Embed Quote
