★What is the best route (or tips) for a 25 year old who is focused on becoming financially free?
Save (invest) as much money as you can, and start immediately. This will have a profound long-term effect to make you financially free. That said, it's much more effective to generate new sources of wealth by developing income-producing ideas. But don't trade your time for money. That's a sucker's game. The best you can hope for is to bill 2000-3000 hours per year (as a lawyer, architect, doctor, or bartender). It's better to build something once that you can resell many times (a book, software, etc.) or to hire employees that can multiply your time. But it all starts with the discipline it takes to consistently save and invest your money, rather than spending it on things that won't last.    Embed Quote
