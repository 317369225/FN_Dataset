★What music do ambulance drivers play en route to emergency calls?
Your choice of songs remind me of a radio interview on CFOX when a couple of members of the Vancouver Coroner's Office said they listen to "Dead and Bloated" by Stone Temple Pilots! You guys do incredible work, and your music choice is parallel to the great jobs you have!!    Embed Quote
