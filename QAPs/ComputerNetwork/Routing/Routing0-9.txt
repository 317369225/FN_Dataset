★What are some of the best roads/routes in India?Please add images! Let us please limit the scope here (India only), else the data here will become incomprehensible. We'll be lost in a sea of data otherwise!
I took this picture in december 2014 . I was travelling from Rameshwaram (town of India's former President A.P.J Kalam ) to some temple on the outskirts of Rameshwaram. I knew that I was on an island but while travelling there I was amazed to see few roads of some quite a good miles which had sea on both side. As you can see in the picture which I took from inside an auto. I have never seen such a view ,first time I saw that and it was quite unexpected at that time for me. The water almost seem to hit the side of the road .As it was a kind of bay type of thing so tide was not forceful but still scenary was quite unbelievable. Rameshwaram is almost one night journey from Chennai.  :D    Embed Quote
