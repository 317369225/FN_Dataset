★Is it physically possible to walk uphill to school both ways, using the same route?Apart from having a hill in between your house and the school and forgetting to mention that.
Yes. You could walk from your divorced Mom's home in the morning uphill to your school. And then leave school in the afternoon and walk up another hill to your Dad's house. You just have to get driven back to your Mom's place later that night so that you can rinse and repeat the process...    Embed Quote
