★What can possibly be wrong with seeking the easiest route?
If only you chose a slightly more difficult route, you might get much more out of it for a little more effort. So it's in your best interest not to choose the easiest one, but to choose the hardest one that you think you could reach, to maximise the outcome and therefore your happiness in life. But sometimes your assumptions about easiness might be wrong, and the route might turn out much harder and you will lower your goals. But sometimes your assumptions are wrong the other way, when something isn't at all as hard as you thought, and if you choose the easy route, you'll be less happy than you could be.    Embed Quote
