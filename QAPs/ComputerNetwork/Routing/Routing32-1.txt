★What is the easiest/cheapest route to break into banking?
Unless your applying for a quant position a BBA in Finance is certainly enough. Go on LinkedIn and look at the credentials of professional who currently hold the job title you are looking for. If I were you I would ask them. My two cents.... I have no programming skills and have interviewed at many large investment banks. I'm a grad student now with a finance degree and experience as a credit analyst for one of the largest energy companies in the world. You don't need to know how to code or even VBA. Having a good grasp of excel is beneficial in nearly every job but being a master of VBA is certainly not required to obtain a banking job.    Embed Quote
