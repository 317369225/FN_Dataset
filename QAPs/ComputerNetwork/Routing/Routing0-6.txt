★What are some of the best roads/routes in India?Please add images! Let us please limit the scope here (India only), else the data here will become incomprehensible. We'll be lost in a sea of data otherwise!
NH 1D (and other roads in J&K) This picture is taken somewhere between Kargil and Srinagar. UPDATE: Additional photos, all taken along NH 1D Signboard on the road along the LoC just after Kargil towards Dras. Baralacha La covered in snow. Suraj Tal, second highest lake in India. A canyon near Sarchu. More Plains, one of the highest desert in the world. Note: All the pictures are taken using a 3.2MP point-and-shoot camera in 2009. The entire route is so beautiful that the quality of the camera (or even the skills of the lesser photographers like me) doesn't prevent the photo quality from being good.    Embed Quote
