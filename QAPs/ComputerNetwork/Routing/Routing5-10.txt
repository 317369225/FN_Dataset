★What cross-country route is the longest road trip in the world?
This route is not very politically unstable, no real warzone unlike eastern africa and middle east. You'll just need two ferries in between. Also you'll need to figure out how to cover the extreme right tip of Siberia and a bit of wild Alaska.    Embed Quote
