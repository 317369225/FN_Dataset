★What is routing?I understand it makes the URLs prettier. Some examples show PHP code, some just show examples of a mod_rewrite. Can someone explain the logic of routing and why it's used?
Routing is just nothing but connecting two packets each other by certain weight, so that the cost or time between each packet will be easily understood....    Embed Quote
