★What are the best scenic drives in the Bay Area?All types of drives: city, ocean, country, mountain, etc...
I've driven all over the Bay Area and I'm a big fan of scenic drives. The following are my favorites: Sir Francis Drake Boulevard. This drive takes you through gorgeous ranchlands, deep redwood forests, and out onto the wild, windswept coast of Point Reyes. Mount Diablo North and South Gate roads. This drive takes you to the top of one of highest points in the Bay Area with spectactacular view the entire way. San Francisco to Marin. From the Presidio, cross the Golden Gate Bridge. Then, make sure you take Conzelman Road over the Marin Headlands, from which you'll get unbelievable views of the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco. Finally, drive down to the beach at Rodeo Cove. State Route 84. This drive is the most scenic route from Silicon Valley to the coast. Highway 1 from Pacifica to Santa Cruz. You can't visit California without driving Highway 1. The best part of it in the Bay Area goes from Pacifica to Santa Cruz. There are scenic beaches you can stop at every few miles. Half Moon Bay and Santa Cruz are excellent, too. Skyline Boulevard. Drive along the crest of the Santa Cruz Mountains through towering redwoods and open grasslands. Panoramic Highway. Drive from Mill Valley to Stinson Beach. Two essential stops along this route are the Muir Woods redwoods and the summit of Mt Tamalpais.    Embed Quote
