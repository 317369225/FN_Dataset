★What's the best free website or app for mapping running and walking routes?I've been using MapMyRun.com but they now have so many ads that the site is less functional.
I like http://www.mapmyrun.com/.  I love RunKeeper as well to use during runs to keep track of distance and pace, but I've never used it to map a route.    Embed Quote
