★What constitutes a good running route?Regardless of distance, but taking terrain, scenery, elevation and any other factors into account.
As Simi points out, the answer is entirely subjective. What makes me happy: Trails (not pavement) A beautiful forest/wilderness Occasional rugged, rocky sections Some climbing, intensely steep is fine Views Shade Few people around So Sumi's No. 1 above does it for me. In fact, I rode this exact forest last week and loved it.    Embed Quote
