★What are the best scenic drives in the Bay Area?All types of drives: city, ocean, country, mountain, etc...
If you don't check out the scenic route North of the Bay, you might as well have never have been to San Francisco. It's proof that you can't really "see" the city until you step out of it. From numerous viewing points along the road you can see the Golden Gate Bridge from many different angles. More importantly, the entire city shines illuminating the the entire bay all the way to the Bay Bridge. Every major viewing point you have ever seen in a movie you have ever seen that shows the bridge and the city was filmed from spots along this road. It is literally just two minutes across the bridge and worth so much more then the fair to cross. In this picture we went up to see the city on the night of the Supermoon last June. It was an absolutely perfect visual experience as this massive moon lit up the bay while a fog rolled in through the early evening to cover the city beneath. This spot was my favorite. Just googlemap "Hawk Hill". You'll figure it out.    Embed Quote
