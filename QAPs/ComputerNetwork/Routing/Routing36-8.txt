★What are the best scenic drives in the Bay Area?All types of drives: city, ocean, country, mountain, etc...
I don't think I saw this one but I take the long way when I see family in the East Bay. Exit 580 @ Redwood Road (Castro Valley) and head North for some smile-inducing twisties. Turn right at Pinehurst for a freshly paved section of switchbacks then continue on Grizzly Peak Blvd to the Berkeley Hills. *note* Lowered cars can bottom out at a few sections on this road. There are a LOT of cyclists and normal drivers who do not pull over when three+ cars are behind them. Best conditions in my opinion are weekend evenings when the cyclists start heading home.    Embed Quote
