21G- Takes you through the most important parts of the city-Airport, IITM, Park Sheraton, Mylapore and the BEACH!!! 29C-Another legendary bus routes, connecting the south-east (Besant Nagar) to the central-west (Perambur) 23C- I don't know a lot about this route, but I find this bus appearing in  almost every movie in the late 90s-early 2000s era 21H-Once considered "out-station" bus, plying all the way along OMR has now made it one of the "highest collection" routes, primarily due to the IT Companies Who can forget 12B when there is a movie named after it? PP19 (PP19extn)- The only buses (used to be, now there are many 5xxs plying to Mamallapuram) that run all along the east coast, starting from Broadway and treading nearly the same road till Kovalam    Embed Quote
