★Which Compostela route is the most scenic?There are so many different pilgrimage routes that lead to Santiago de Compostela, I actually don't know where to start my research.
I haven't see any discussion of routes on the French side in the other answers, apart from one mention of the Via Podensis by Julien Vaché. I've never done the Via Podiensis (well, in fact I've never 'done' the Chemin de Saint-Jacques as a multi-day hike and I don't think it's really my thing to be honest), which is the most popular route on the French side, and I believe it is certainly stunning, especially the section through the Aubrac, but I'd like to recommend the second popular route, the Via Tolosane, also called Chemin d'Arles, here. I live very near it (I can reach it in an hour on foot), and I've done I think all the sections of it between the tourist hotspot of Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert and the more remote, windswept mountains on the border of the Hérault and Tarn departments, as day hikes. It is all low mountains, so not difficult, yet with great views all the time, a sunny Mediterranean climate (getting more oceanic-influenced as you move west towards the Tarn department), and yet constantly changing vegetation and scenery (due to a succession of different micro-climates but especially the geology which is very complex and varied around here). It is really lovely. I never get tired of that trail (and other connected trails) which I have done many more times than the average 'pilgrim'! View of Saint-Gervais-sur-Mare    Embed Quote
