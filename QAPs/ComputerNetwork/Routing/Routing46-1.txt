★What are some of the legendary bus routes in chennai?
29 C anyday... its route passes by or is quite close to many colleges. IITM, Stella maris ( some beautiful girls :D), MOP Vaishnav, Pachayapas, Loyola (College road stop), KMC etc.. So there is no dearth of fun by the college students..Passes via some important landmarks like Shastri bavan, Kapaleeshwarar koil. I have travelled in 29C for 3 years when i did my schooling and i have a lot of memories realted to that bus.    Embed Quote
