★Does OpenFlow basically centralise routing decisions?Trying to understand what's going on from reading this : http://www.wired.com/wiredenterp... Is OpenFlow basically central planning of routing decisions?
OpenFlow is an open standard for separating the routing decisions from the forwarding engine.  This allows you to customize the routing decisions / protocols in a manner which changes the forwarding behavior according to your specific network design. I am not 100% clear on Google's purposes, but if you think about how cloud infrastructure services work - being able to route / forward between cloud machines according to your infrastructure design using a proper switch / router (as opposed to relying on the linux server acting as a cloud controller) would be a tremendous advantage to scale.  That is what OpenFlow could allow you to do. http://www.openflow.org/wp/learn...    Embed Quote
