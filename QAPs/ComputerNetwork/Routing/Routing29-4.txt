★Who designs the routes at rock climbing gyms and how?Is there repository or something?
The person that's getting paid the least (usually trade for gear discounts, usage) or members of the gym that have a route they feel they need to tape. This is advice given from someone who route set from 1994 on. I spent three years working at a gym....when they are paying me they would much rather have me cleaning holds or doing something other than route setting. I taught a climbing class in college, because the climbing area was apart of the Phs. Ed. department climbers set along with class teachers. Worked at another gym, climbers set along with one (sometimes more) employees that they can get to set for trading. You want to trade something the owners can buy at cost and trade at 10-20% below retail, then you are route setting. Granted I got a degree and haven't been setting much since getting a job after college, I never met a owner that would spend money on software for route setting when they could spend that money on more holds or replacement ropes, soles for rental shoes.    Embed Quote
