★What exactly was "the Singen route"?
I will dig out my various books on Colditz, but essentially the 'Singen route' is a part of the Swiss-German border near Singen that is so higgledy-piggledy as to make it very difficult to guard. Specifically, the town of Ramsen forms a salient north of the Rhine that was very lightly guarded. If you look up Ramsen in Google maps, you should see what I mean.    Embed Quote
