★What is the difference between switching and routing?
to properly define the term "switch", you need to think about bridging.  a network bridge connects two network segments together to make them one.  same broadcast domain, same ARP tables, same default gateway, same DHCP table, etc.  a switch is a multiport bridge, making one network segment bigger and more robust.  switches connect user PC's, servers, printers and other devices on the LAN (local area network). a "router" connects different LAN's together, so they are a part of the same network, but are separated by different default gateways, security rules, etc. as programmed on the router.  these different default gateways are typically different physical or virtual ports on a common router or routers in the company datacenter, computer room, etc. read about the OSI model.  switches work primarily at layer 2 and routers work primarily at layer 3.  i say "primarily" because many vendors make switching with routing functionality, and they make routers with switching functionality.  so the lines are very blurry, but the OSI model will keep everyone straight on how networks are designed, built and operated. secret ... traffic between PC's on L2 switches don't work IP address to IP address, they work MAC address to MAC address, which is why you need an ARP table.  PC traffic between LAN's moves via a router at L3, that is when IP addresses matter, for routed traffic.  switched traffic = MAC to MAC.  routed traffic = IP to IP. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI... disclosure; i work for Cisco, one of these vendors blurring the lines  :-) i recommend the book "interconnections, bridges routers and switches" by radia perlman    Embed Quote
