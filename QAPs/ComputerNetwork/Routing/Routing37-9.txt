★What's the best free website or app for mapping running and walking routes?I've been using MapMyRun.com but they now have so many ads that the site is less functional.
I like Google's MyTracks (for Android). You can add waypoints and take photos on your route. Then upload your map(s) to google maps where you can keep them private or share them publicly. http://mytracks.appspot.com/ I also upload my (Garmin) Forerunner runs to Trimble Outdoors and use their mapping tools. http://www.trimbleoutdoors.com/    Embed Quote
