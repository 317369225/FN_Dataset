★What can possibly be wrong with seeking the easiest route?
Mostly people who worked or are working hard in their glourious spiritual path feeling that it is not fair, and then telling you that you are lazy or deluded. It is the same thing as people criticizing you because you were born in a rich family and they have to work hard. False sense of injustice. But maybe you are trying to run away from some things with this easy path. But people doing it the hard way also do that. Test it out, see how it goes.    Embed Quote
