★What are the best scenic drives in the Bay Area?All types of drives: city, ocean, country, mountain, etc...
Expounding on what Yaniv mentioned... The "Forest" drive mentioned, Skyline Blvd, is quite awesome. Goes through the peninsula, west and mostly parallel to 280, ocean to one side and civilization on the other. If you're going to Santa Cruz, take Highway 9 rather than 17 — it's more curvy, but heads right through the mountains and redwoods. Expect the drive to SC to take twice as long, however.    Embed Quote
