★What are the best scenic drives in the Bay Area?All types of drives: city, ocean, country, mountain, etc...
This might be something that most people take for granted, but to me, my mind was blown when I drove over the Golden Gate Bridge for the first time. The very first time I drove over the bridge (after having visited the city at least a dozen times), I was going north of the city to complete a Craigslist buy. After I made the purchase, I went home and insisted that my wife should go on this drive with me, just to experience what I experienced as I crossed the bridge. Our trip was capped off by a drive/walk through Sausalito which is also very beautiful. I've driven through Half Moon Bay, East Bay, Monterey Bay, Pacifica, you name it, and there is very little that beats the scale of the Golden Gate Bridge. If driving across this bridge doesn't really blow your mind, then OK, you are jaded, but do me one favor, park your car somewhere, and walk out on to the bridge and peek over the edge as a supertanker passes under it and looks like a toy boat. Taken from a small dock north east of the bridge where people were fishing/crabbing and didn't seem to have their mind blown by this bridge any longer.    Embed Quote
