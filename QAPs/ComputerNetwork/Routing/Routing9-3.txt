★What algorithms are common in IP routing?
There are many algorithams used in IP routing. They are classified as 1) Algorithms for IGP(rip, ospf, is-is, eigrp) 2) Algorithms for BGP(bgp, ebgp etc) Examples for IGP are bellman ford, dijkstras. Google these for more details. But there are many data structure implemented for different tasks Linked list, tries, binary tree etc. Datastructures used in RIB/FIB may be doubly linked list/circular linked list. Packet forwarding/ packet switching will use different data structures. If you really want to understand how routers work, then check out any open source routers.    Embed Quote
