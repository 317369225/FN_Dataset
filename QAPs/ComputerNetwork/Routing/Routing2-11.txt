★Indian Railways: Which is the best train route in India?
Let me add one more Amazing Railway route to this list. Nilambur Shoranur Rail Way Route in Kerala would give us another travelling experience. Here I have some snaps , which I have taken from google and some blogs ; And of course the route is ending there in the land of Teak (Nilambur). Railway Authority has a plan to extend the route up to Nanjangud (Near Mysore) but yet to start the survey ! Happy Journey !    Embed Quote
