★Why don't airplanes follow the shortest route?I have noticed this in various flights. Airplanes don't follow the shortest route. Why do they deviate so much from the shortest route? Are there any way-points that they must pass through?
A good example of why aircraft don't always fly the most direct routes is the difference between aviation on the east coast of the United States and on the west coast. Because the east coast is much more heavily congested with several major airports within hundreds of miles of each other, aircraft are forced to fly more circuitous routes than they would on the west coast where airspace is more wide open. I remember getting an irate message from a pilot who wanted to know why he was flying as far north as New Hampshire before turning southbound when he was flying from Connecticut to Florida. My response was welcome to the east coast. So, some of the routing is determined by Air Traffic Control based upon what the system can handle. The rest of it is generally determined by the operator of the aircraft based on issues like fuel consumption, time, smoother ride for the passengers, etc.    Embed Quote
