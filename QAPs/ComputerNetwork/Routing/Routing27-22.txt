★What can possibly be wrong with seeking the easiest route?
Be prepared to face toughest competitions, as  lots of people will be in same track due to the same reason. That actually at the end makes things 'no so easy'.   The right path should be following you passion. Of course you will need to work hard to get the desired success to make your effort truly distinguished, but at the end because of following your passion, you will not feel as hard as it supposed to be - and that make things 'easy' at the end, but with lots of value.    Embed Quote
