★I am going to be walking from Beijing to London... What's the best route I should take?
You should read about Bernard Ollivier, a French journalist who walked from Paris to ... I can't remember where he stopped in the end, the goal was to get to Xi'an, walking the silk road. As he wasn't that young anymore and therefore feared the winter, he cut the trip in 3, starting again at the beginning of each summer where he left the summer before. He wrote three books in which he tells the story. I don't know if they have been published in any language other than French. In case you speak French, then here's the book; Traverser l'Anatolie: Amazon.fr: Bernard Ollivier: Livres I only remember him going through Turkey and Iran. All the rest is blurry and also I don't think I read the Chinese part of the books.    Embed Quote
