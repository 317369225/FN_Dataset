★What is the best route (or tips) for a 25 year old who is focused on becoming financially free?
This assumes you live in America. 1. 10-20% of your income into low to moderate risk, low to moderate growth investments like 401K, mutual funds, etc. Forever. Period. Never stops. 10-20% of your income regardless of income. If your insane student loan takes 50% of your income, and after the 10% you're left with $500 a month...then you're going to live in a box with a roommate for a while...with 10-20% going into this investment.  2. Then determine the base amount of money you need to live a good day-to-day life, including disposable income for fun and prizes. No Maseratis,  please. Take the rest and use it in higher risk ventures such as individual investments, starting a business, entrepreneurship, venture capitalism in other's ventures, ETC. ... which ever of those venture capitalist schemes best fit your personality. 3. Avoid at all costs anything that will "make you rich quick". 4. Take out no loans beyond education, car, and home....unless it's a business venture loan protected by incorporation.  This includes no credit cards. Period. The education loan is optional since the cost-to-benefit ratio is dropping like a stone in the US. 5. Re-do this evaluation every 5 years, because it will constantly change.
