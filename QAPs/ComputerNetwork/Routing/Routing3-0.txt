★What is the difference between switching and routing?
Switches pass packets to or from the device (computer, printer, etc) on the network that has requested it - that is defined in its 'where am I going' portion of the packet. Routers take the packets up a level and know that the packets are going outside the network. They know the next hop for that packet and will send it on its way to the next router until it reaches it's destination. Of course, this is very simplified. Routers have tables that calculate the shortest distance, change the route taken if one stop is not responding, decreases a bit in the packet so it will die if it never gets to its destination, etc.  And switches can be smarter - they can only pass certain types of packets on certain ports, send replies, not send replies, etc.    Embed Quote
