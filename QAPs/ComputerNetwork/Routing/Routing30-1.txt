★What constitutes a good running route?Regardless of distance, but taking terrain, scenery, elevation and any other factors into account.
I recently was training for a half marathon, and after that a 14km race.  I'll do short runs during the week, and longer runs in beautiful places on weekends.  What I look for on my longer training runs: * The right distance, building up to the full distance of the run (14 to 21km) * An easy to navigate path (I hate having to constantly look at my phone to decide which way to go.) * A path through a reserve/park, where I can see water or greenery * Water fountains (I'd prefer to only take 750ml, but I drink a lot.) * A path that other runners take (it's often motivating to run behind someone who has a slightly faster pace.) * public transport there, or parking within 1km. * not too much altitude gain/loss It's rare that a run has everything.  I'll usually set up something via mapmyrun, and then make sure that I can get there/back via google maps. I've been living in Sydney, which has some very picturesque places to run, like Vaucluse: Manly to Spit Trail: Cremorne: Coogee: Maroubra: The Sydney area has 140 miles of coastline and harborside, so has a fair amount to beautiful place to run.    Embed Quote
