★Rock Climbing: What is it like to free solo a route?I'm curious about the motivation, thoughts, fears, emotions, focus etc. involved.
It's like burning your boat, and lighting a fire in the forest behind you at the same time. If you're not in the condition to outrun it given the terrain, you're not going to survive, and if the wind or weather, which is totally out of your control, changes for the worse, you're not going to survive.    Embed Quote
