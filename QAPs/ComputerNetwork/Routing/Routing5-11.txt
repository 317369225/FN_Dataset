★What cross-country route is the longest road trip in the world?
A Lot of people here seem that Cape town is the southern most town to start or end at, But if you look closer you can find a small town even lower then Cape town. that little town is Alguhas. near that little town is the Cape Agulhas Lighthouse. So if you drive from from the CALH to Ola Russia the mileage would be 27,948km. This breaks the ferry rule however as instead of going through Israel and Iran, You would go north and take a ferry from Algiers Algeria to Alicante Spain. From there you would go through the European Country's.    Embed Quote
