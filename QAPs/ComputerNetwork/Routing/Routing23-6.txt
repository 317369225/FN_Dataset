★Is it physically possible to walk uphill to school both ways, using the same route?Apart from having a hill in between your house and the school and forgetting to mention that.
I went to Sailor Elementary, which was on board a ship moored near my home. The school day was adjusted so that it started at high tide every day, and ended at low tide. My home was near the docks, and was about halfway between the high tide and low tide marks. Every day I would walk to school, walk up the side of a dike, and board the ship for my day at school. My walk was either level or uphill the entire way. At the end of the school day, I would exit the ship, walk up the staircase to a door cut in the dike, and walk home. My walk was either level or uphill the entire way. -Mark    Embed Quote
