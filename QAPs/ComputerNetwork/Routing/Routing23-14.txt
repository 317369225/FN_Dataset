★Is it physically possible to walk uphill to school both ways, using the same route?Apart from having a hill in between your house and the school and forgetting to mention that.
Here are a few I just thought of.. They kind of break the rules. This is fun! Attach a stairmaster to a segway. Ride your segway on a flat road to school "walking" uphill simultaneously. Live in a rotating wheel space station with your house on one side and your school on the other. Walk to school uphill from your dad's home. Walk uphill further to your mom's after school. (Only works for one day, unless mother drives you home to your dad's every night. Then you walk uphill both ways everyday.) Move houses and schools everyday so that you are constantly walking up hill. (Started from the bottom now we're here) Build an extremely tall staircase from your front house curving upwards around the entire earth all the way back to school. (If you run fast enough you won't fall! Magnetized boots? Suction cup boots?)    Embed Quote
