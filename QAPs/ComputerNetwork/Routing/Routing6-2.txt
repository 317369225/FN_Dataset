★Public Transportation: How are bus routes determined?
First the routing consideration, which includes the route pattern, location considerations, and transfer policies, is done. The types of route pattern are one-way (or loops) and two-way. One-way patterns extend the coverage area, and reduce capital costs. Two-way patterns on the other hand provide a direct travel pattern. Location considerations are done to ensure — coordination among routes for transfers, connectivity of major trip generators (for instance, work trip origins and destinations), and desirable route length. There are certain thumb rules to ensure convenient transfers. Then the terminal/stop spacing is decided. This spacing is optimized based on various costs (operator costs, user access time, and line haul time). It is to be noted that time can be considered as a cost since more the time it takes to reach a destination more discomforting it is (disutility to the user). Note that increasing stops per mile increases on-board travel time while decreasing it increases the distance one has to travel to reach the bus stop (there is a trade-off). However, the typical bus stop spacing might be well below the optimal value. This is because of the transit history of the place. As people become accustomed to established bus locations, it becomes difficult to remove them.    Embed Quote
