★What are some of the legendary bus routes in chennai?
I am suprised no one has mentioned the buses plying between Adyar and Mahabalipuram along the ECR. The initial part of the journey from Adyar past all the vakkams (kottivakkam, pallavakkam etc.) is more or less like any other route. But come MGM and the muthukkad lake, the scenery changes substantially. The ECR, if you've ever been there is peppered with beautiful beaches (there's no dearth of isolation along these stretches), mini coniferous forests, resorts and all the other things that make a sunny Sunday afternoon (or any other afternoon) perfect. The best part of the journey starts, in my opinion from, Kovalam, where the road runs a lot closer to the shoreline and the views of the Bay of Bengal can be magnificent. S588 and 588 are my favourite routes for this reason.    Embed Quote
