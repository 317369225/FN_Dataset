★What are the best websites to map my itinerary and route for a trip?I've been looking but most of the websites I found do not have the basic features to map my trip properly.
A few months back I was planning my vacation and things weren’t as easy  as I thought. I had figured out the destination, booked air tickets,  short-listed places to see and hired a car. The challenge however was to  set up a local itinerary. I had X places to cover in Y days with  optimized routes so we weren’t spending all our time travelling.  This  required finding exact locations & distances between them so as to  figure how much could be covered in available time. I had nothing at my  disposal but Google Maps & notepad - and here is the best I could visualize As a Product guy, I couldn't help but create a wishlist, and put it on my blog.
