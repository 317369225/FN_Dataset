★What are some of the legendary bus routes in chennai?
29C and 21G... Since I lived in Mandaveli, 90% of my bus journeys belonged to one of these 2 routes.. there is no scarcity of decent looking girls in 29C... and you can easily notice how the sample population in the bus changes along its route... from a more posh Besant Nagar to a less posh Perambur... 21G was also special to me because I had to ride to Chromepet for the 4 years of my college.. the buses are abundant.. and when you are lucky u will get that AC bus, which will make your day...    Embed Quote
