★What is the best route (or tips) for a 25 year old who is focused on becoming financially free?
I always called it, "addicted to salary." The state where the person had no ability to change jobs, no ability to be an entrepreneur, and finally, no ability to even stand up for themselves at work because they needed the salary so much. All risk taking becomes verboten. How does one get addicted to salary? Spending and taking on debt by projecting one's current income into the future and then pledging it for short-term pleasure or indulgence. Don't do it. Short version: debt sucks.    Embed Quote
