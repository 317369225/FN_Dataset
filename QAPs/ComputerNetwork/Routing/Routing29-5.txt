★Who designs the routes at rock climbing gyms and how?Is there repository or something?
I don't think there are rules here. Maybe in some top-level gyms you're going to have professionals creating the routes. In the gym where I practice, anyone can open a route. There was a championship a couple of months ago and all the routes were cleared. Experienced climbers set the championship routes, and they stayed so now anyone can use them. But since they're not enough, the gym owners keep askings us to open new ones. I'm not that experienced (less than 1 year climber) and I opened an easy route for absolute beginners and helped opening some other intermediate with more experienced climbers and members of the staff.    Embed Quote
