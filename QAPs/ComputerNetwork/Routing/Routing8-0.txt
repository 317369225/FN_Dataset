★Does OpenFlow basically centralise routing decisions?Trying to understand what's going on from reading this : http://www.wired.com/wiredenterp... Is OpenFlow basically central planning of routing decisions?
OpenFlow in and of itself does not centralize routing decisions or protocols. It's an open standard for a "network controller" to communicate with switches, which lets the controller program switch hardware. The centralization of the routing decisions is up to the controller implementation. Think of OpenFlow as a way to make a switch "programmable". It isn't the only way, as in theory vendors could release REST based APIs to achieve switch programmability. The big advantage with OpenFlow is that it's an open standard and can be used to control any switch that supports it. The drawback vis-a-vis any vendor-proprietary programmability scheme is precisely because OpenFlow is supposed to work with all switches, it can't take advantages of specific hardware capabilities in a given switch, which a vendor API would be able to. A controller can program 'flows' on a switch using the OpenFlow protocol. Flows can match on fields like IP address, input ports and others. Actions include sending packets to specific ports, assigning Quality-of-Service parameters and sending packets to the controller via the controller's interface to the switch. In this way, the controller can become aware of new flows and take decisions on what to do when it sees them. OpenFlow started out as a great way to prototype ideas and features in a production network. Once an idea was proven to work, it could in theory be baked into the switching silicon and be implemented in hardware. That being said, as OpenFlow has started to be deployed in datacenters, there have been use cases other than centralizing the control plane that have been more popular. I think a lot of questions surrounding viable use cases will start to get answered as datacenter architects and operators get their hands on switches with OpenFlow support and start exploring how they can leverage increased network programmability.    Embed Quote
