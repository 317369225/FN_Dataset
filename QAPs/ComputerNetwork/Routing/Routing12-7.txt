★What was your route to becoming a Product Manager, and how do you think it helped you to become a better PM as opposed to other routes?
This is how I became a Product Manager: I was a hard core development engineer for more than 6 years. Sometime after 6 years, I was in a team working on a relatively small but high visibility product. Based on my skills and interests I was asked to represent the product at technology events, fill-in as pre-sales engineer, do product trainings, elicit product requirements and so on while I still continued to code. I found my new role interesting and discovered that the person doing such jobs is called "Product Manager", the one who is completely responsible for the product. Sounded really nice. To formalize my understanding about the cross functional role, I enrolled for a year long part-time general management course at a good management school. The management education was not absolutely necessary but was good to have and enhanced my horizons and respect for other departments (especially sales). Coming via the engineering route had its advantage in being a good Technical Product Manager as I was apt at speaking the language of engineers; you do not need to code but you need to understand the underlying design at times; you do not need to make high fidelity interaction designs but you must be able to make mock-ups. For products that are heavily tilted towards engineering, the route via engineering was surely advantageous.    Embed Quote
