★Why don't airplanes follow the shortest route?I have noticed this in various flights. Airplanes don't follow the shortest route. Why do they deviate so much from the shortest route? Are there any way-points that they must pass through?
Firstly, the curvature of the planet means that the flight has to travel in an arc at some points. Other areas have a lot more deviation due to existing air traffic or restricted air space. And the last curve on the map at Lucknow is the pilots aligning themselves with the runway. The curve near Turkey is so that the aircraft flies near the coast of the Black Sea; it's just wha some pilot prefer doing, I suppose.    Embed Quote
