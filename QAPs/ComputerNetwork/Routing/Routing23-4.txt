★Is it physically possible to walk uphill to school both ways, using the same route?Apart from having a hill in between your house and the school and forgetting to mention that.
Okay, since this is a purely speculative question and we're all trying to invent any scenario in which it could be proven true, I have one that works perfectly. The whole town is built on a gigantic see-saw.  The families all live in homes at the center of this giant see-saw. The school is at one far end of the see-saw, and the parents' jobs are all at the other end of the see-saw. Each morning, the parents leave home first, and they ride to work in a big heavy train that, filled with all of the parents, is enough combined weight to drop the job-end of the see-saw lower and raise the school-end.  Then the children walk to school, uphill. At the end of each day, the parents leave their jobs and go to their homes on the train. The job-end lightens, the heaviest weight is redistributed to the middle while the school-end is heavier than the job-end. To be sure we get a proper tilt, though, the parents then walk to the school to pick up their children. Then the children walk home with their parents, uphill. I think that works, it's the same identical route both ways, and it doesn't violate any provisions of the puzzle. (Now I just need to write a weird children's book about this insane town on a see-saw...)    Embed Quote
