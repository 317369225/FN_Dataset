★What are some of the legendary bus routes in chennai?
One of my favorite bus is B70 cos it goes from Guindy to Pattabiram, my grand parents' place. It goes through 100 feet road, and into CMBT, Anna nagar, Ambattur and finally Avadi. Its one of the longest bus route in Chennai. It made life easier for me when I studied in CEG to visit my grandparents every week.    Embed Quote
