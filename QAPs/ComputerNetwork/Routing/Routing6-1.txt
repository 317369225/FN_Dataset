★Public Transportation: How are bus routes determined?
There is some art to the science of designing bus routes.  The quantitative measures are density (market), directness (time, safety, ease of operation) and connecting desirable destinations (origin and destination pattern analysis).  In an Urban environment, space between routes is a consideration as there ideally should be as little overlap as possible.Routes usually act as 'spokes' in a wheel that meets at a 'hub' so permit cross-town transfer.  Routes can also be 'through-routed' through hubs to eliminate changes in vehicle for passengers who are traveling cross-town.  Most modern cities have evolved by way of 'sprawl' where development has taken place for commerce and residential units outside of the central city thus making it a challenge to serve the area efficiently.  This is due to traffic management and transportation planning being focused on the automobile, not public transport. Schedule times are generally designed to be 'clock regular' on the hour, half hour and in fifteen minute intervals to make it easier for customers to understand.  Time points along the route are fixed in 'real time' that is, what it truly takes a vehicle to operate in traffic and allowing for passengers to board and disembark. Bus stop policy can be at frequent intervals - the end of every full block - or intermmittment - every other block or at very high traffic points,    Embed Quote
