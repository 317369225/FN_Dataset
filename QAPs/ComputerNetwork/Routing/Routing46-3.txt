★What are some of the legendary bus routes in chennai?
1. 27D (Foreshore estate to Villivakkam) is a pretty good route that cuts across the heart of the city and connects to a huge list of movie theaters (AGS Villivakkam, Abirami, Motcham, Albert, Shanthi, Devi, Anna, Casino, Sathyam, Escape and Inox). 2. I'm surprised how no one has mentioned PP19X (Broadway to Kovalam). This awesome route runs across the entire Chennai coastline! It takes the beach road and ECR till Kovalam. And of course, there is 29C and 23C.    Embed Quote
