★What are the best running routes in Paris?The longer, the better—preferably over 6 miles (~10km)
Hi, I really enjoy myself to go running along the Canal St Martin and Canal de l'Ourcq. The banks are more quiet than the Seine, and "further" from the pollution. Plus, the Canal de l'Ourcq is as long as you want / need to get tired!    Embed Quote
