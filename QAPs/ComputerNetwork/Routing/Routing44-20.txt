★What is your escape route from the reality of everyday life?what are the things that you do in order to relieve yourself from daily stress and anxiety. Eg: Books, exercise, walking, chatting, swimming etc ...
The reality of my life is I don't get bored with my routine life. I generally enjoy doing all sorts of work like lending a helping hand to my wife in her household activities, fetching commodities from market etc besides getting time for yoga, music, reading, writing etc. I am leading a rather peaceful retired life with life's usual ups and downs. In a busy life with an easy mood, one doesn't find anything too boring or too stressful. Even doing small things gives me sufficient pleasure.    Embed Quote
