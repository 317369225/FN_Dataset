★Which Compostela route is the most scenic?There are so many different pilgrimage routes that lead to Santiago de Compostela, I actually don't know where to start my research.
Camino del Norte is, in general, the most scenic (I have done "El Camino" 8 times already in four different routes), lush and green. Between the French and the Aragonés, I would say the latter but it is longer. They both merge in Puente la Reina. Probably the less exciting of them all is Ruta de la Plata (goes through Extremadura and the tough Leonese and Castilian planes). Another disadvantage of Ruta de la Plata is the lack of services along the way. My recommendation if you want to start to do El Camino is to start is in the French (or Aragonés) way because it is the most famous and will give you a real feel of it. Then you can start introducing variations in coming years.    Embed Quote
