★What is the Route in EmberJS?
Route is responsible for render each page when the user call it Kind of a map between the controller and the view. meaning that you have a template that needs to be called when the user call about page this.route("about", { path: "/about" }); with this code you tell Ember.js to render about Template as the first parameter when about page is called this.route("favorites", { path: "/favs" }) The Template name can be different than the page name here you are telling Ember to render Template called favorites when the user requests the page "favs" this.route("about"); leaving empty path will match the template name to the page name meaing that he will render about when about page is requested provied that they both have the same name .    Embed Quote
