★Who designs the routes at rock climbing gyms and how?Is there repository or something?
Based on my personal experience and observations, routesetting is usually done in one of three ways: Community- Experienced local climbers (who typically know employees at the gym) are invited to assist in routesetting during times of wall-stripping and re-setting, competitions, and special events. This is typically done for free and usually has random timing. Employees- Employees of the gym usually have the opportunity to do some routesetting, especially during times of competitions and special events. "Down time" at the gym is a good opportunity to put up new ideas as well. Certified routesetters- High caliber gyms may have one or more certified routesetters. These routesetters have likely been through USA Climbing (USAC) training and have a Level 1-5 certification. Setters who have gone through training may have a home gym but often travel the country (or world) setting in various gyms, often for competitions while finding inspiration in the best climbing destinations along the way. Certified routesetters are often climbing coaches or instructors and have many years of experience. As far as how routes are set is concerned... that's a tough one. Routesetting is an art that comes with experience. Climbing outdoors, traveling, and lots of practice are a good foundation.    Embed Quote
