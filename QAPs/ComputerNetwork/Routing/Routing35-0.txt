★How is an airplane's route decided?What are the factors taken into consideration?
I am not quite an expert, but a follower of Aviation. Let me add some basic thoughts here. The route should constitute: 1. A healthy load of people + cargo through most of the year, if not the entire year. 2. A reasonable assurance of premium traffic (people who are willing to pay for First and Business class) 3. The destination city should be popular enough to attract a full plane of passengers every day ... OR ... the airline should have connecting services [on their own or through other airline partners] to carry passengers forward to further destinations. 4. The existing competition and ticket prices on the route. If the route is already served by many airlines on a daily basis, the airline might not be able to command a premium price 5. Logistics : Does the airline already have the right plane for the route... do they have crew stationed at the origin & destination cities to support the frequency of service ... Just a few I can think of, off the top of my head.    Embed Quote
