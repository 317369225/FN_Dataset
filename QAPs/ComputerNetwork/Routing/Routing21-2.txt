★Is it offensive to use a cemetery as part of the route on a morning run?Without sharing my own, I'm interested in where opinions fall on this question.
Not really. Cemeteries are generally nice, peaceful areas, and I've seen many people taking recreational walks and runs in cemeteries, though always on the streets/roads created for motor vehicles.    Embed Quote
