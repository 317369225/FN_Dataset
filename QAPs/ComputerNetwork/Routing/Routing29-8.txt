★Who designs the routes at rock climbing gyms and how?Is there repository or something?
Who? Well I know one person offered such a job: Linus Pauling Kamb, and I'm not certain how many he's done (not a large number) and he no longer doing that (programming now). Personally, I have no interest in gym climbing. One English friend (physics prof at Oxford, former editor of the Cambridge Mountaineering Journal, etc.) says that most aren't designed well as they get mastered too easily. His opinion is that more variable movement needs to be done to change configurations (not just the geometry and topography of face climbing, but to had things like variable geometry cracks: most pure gym climbers have tended to be poor crack climbers). And also variable tilt on a wall is needed.    Embed Quote
