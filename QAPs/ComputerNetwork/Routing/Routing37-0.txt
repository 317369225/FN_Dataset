★What's the best free website or app for mapping running and walking routes?I've been using MapMyRun.com but they now have so many ads that the site is less functional.
I like http://www.gmap-pedometer.com for its simplicity and functionality. You can tell it to automatically map points to the closest road/trail or use the exact points you specify; export as GPX; save a route and get a permalink to it.    Embed Quote
