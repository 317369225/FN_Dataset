★What are the best running routes in Paris?The longer, the better—preferably over 6 miles (~10km)
For a bit more peace and quiet, the Coulée Verte is a long thin green stretch of pedestrian/bike path from behind the Gare Montparnasse out into the suburbs and the beautiful Parc de Sceaux. It can be a bit stop/start though, as there are roads to cross. Sceaux itself is a popular running park and big.    Embed Quote
