★How was the route for Delhi Metro decided?Was it done by scientists/mathematicians? Who all were part of the team? Any interesting details around this.
I have no complete knowledge about how routes for Delhi metro were decided but i do have a slight idea on how its usually done. I have worked with a city transportation department as part of my internship. Route selection is done by transport planners. They use mathematical and statistical methods to do this. There is a branch of engineering called Transport engineering. (IIT Kharagpur has this course) There are mathematical modelling methods like gravity modelling etc to arrive at Origin - Destination Matrices for a city. It basically gives the no. of trips between different Traffic analysis zones in a city based on land use distribution in a city. Doing that is not as easy as it sounds. It is a very complex process involving surveying households to arrive at parameters to be used in the modelling. Based on such matrices corridors with Peak Hour Peak Direction trips (PHPDT) are selected.  A metro is usually preferred in corridors where PHPDT is above 30000. These are also used to find rational routes for Buses. Traffic growth forecast done based on growth of population and future land use is also taken into account for identifying the routes. There are some good institutions in India like Institute for Urban Transport, (IUT, Delhi) which has done a lot of studies in this field. Institute of Urban Transport (India) There are several consulting firms providing such transport planning services like EMBARQ.    Embed Quote
