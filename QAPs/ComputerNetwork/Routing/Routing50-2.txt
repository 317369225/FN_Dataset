★What music do ambulance drivers play en route to emergency calls?
Usually, they aren't listening to music -- they're usually listening to the police/fire chatter over the radios. Of course, each unit is different. My background is that I was an EMT (a long time ago) and I remember what running to calls was like.    Embed Quote
