★Who designs the routes at rock climbing gyms and how?Is there repository or something?
There's no rules about it mate. Different in every place. In my 2 local climbing walls I've grown up near, the staff set some of the routes and regulars set the rest. Usually they'll change routes every few months, or less if there's not many routes. Occasionally, specialist route setters or top climbers will be called in by the centre to set a route of few, but that's not how the majority are usually done.    Embed Quote
