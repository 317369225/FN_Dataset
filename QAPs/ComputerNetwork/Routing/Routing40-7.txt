★Has anyone done any of the SF2G bicycle routes?http://sf2g.com/ What was it like? What was the speed 'type' and how hard was it for you? How many people did you ride with?
I work at our San Bruno office now and ride skyline solo. I miss riding with this group to Mountain View.  At the expense of potentially being insincere, I'll keep this short as I'm not a bona fide regular these days. Scott Crosby is right on the money - It beats the hell out of driving down south. Anyone can do it. Go to sports basement, grab yourself a decent bike. They'll give you 2 years of free maintenance, too, so you don't have to worry about time sinks with bike upkeep. Start off with the FFFF (First Friday Friendly Frolic) rides, and iterate towards riding with the faster folks (Style II & 3). Don't wait for bike to work day, it's once a year. No one becomes a fast rider overnight. You have the opportunity to ride a bicycle to work with a supportive group in California, of all places. If you ask me, It's a no-brainer if you like to ride bikes. Don't overanalyze if you're in decent shape, get out there!    Embed Quote
