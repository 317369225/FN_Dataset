★What music do ambulance drivers play en route to emergency calls?
Ambulance driver is a derrogatory term as we do more than just drive "the big bus with lights and sires that most people ignore." To answer the question, it depends on the call. If it sounds like a bad auto accident or a serious call like CPR in progress we listen only to the dispatch radios. If it sounds like it is going to be a normal nonsense call (the flu or back pain) we listen to whatever we like on the FM radio or our iphone/ipod plugged into the radio. I prefer rock, but I'll listen to anything but country. -Your Paramedic / ER Nurse.    Embed Quote
