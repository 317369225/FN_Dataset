★Are wine routes useful?Writing an article on their usefulness in Spain, but curious if anyone has found them appealing around the world, and if so, why?
IMHO - yes and no. Yes because they give you big picture about region's possibilities. No because it's defined route, won't feet every taste lover needs. What would be really cool and useful is a tool to build your own route based on locations from certain database. If possible with drag&drop feature.    Embed Quote
