★Is it physically possible to walk uphill to school both ways, using the same route?Apart from having a hill in between your house and the school and forgetting to mention that.
If you were raised in either the upper-Midwest or New England and had to walk to school during the winter, than the answer is a highly probable yes. Very possible. Packed snow and high winds can change the nature of the terrain quite easily -- which is why the full "grumpy old man" bit generally goes that they had to walk "fifteen miles to school. Uphill. Both ways. In the snow. And we liked it!!" That ultimately ties back to Anthony Yeh's general point that something would have to change about the route between the time you went to school and went back home. (For the record, the originator of the "uphill both ways in the snow" bit seems to be Bill Cosby. Jump to ~1:15 in the clip below...or just enjoy the whole clip.)    Embed Quote
