★What music do ambulance drivers play en route to emergency calls?
I have two CDs I keep up in the front of the ambulance to play on the way to calls. For most calls, I play action songs - things like the Rocky theme song, The FInal Countdown, and Eye of the Tiger. On the way to a working code I play Stayin' Alive and Another One Bites The Dust - the two songs that are the right tempo for giving CPR. That helps me get in the zone and also puts the right tempo in my head. Whatever you listen to, don't forget to pay attention to where you're going and what's in front of you, and make sure you can hear your communications center!    Embed Quote
