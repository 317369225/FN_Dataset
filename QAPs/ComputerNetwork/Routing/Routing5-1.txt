★What cross-country route is the longest road trip in the world?
I appreciate the efforts by others who have written thoughtful answers to this question and am looking forward to see Todd Gardiner complete his answer. If you are looking to travel by a motorcycle or a bicycle, the answer technically seems to be the Pan-American Highway. The network of roads stretching from Prudhoe Bay in Alaska to Ushuaia in Argentina measuring about 47,958 kilometers is on the Guinness book of World Records to be the longest motorable road. However, there is a gap in between Darien Province in Panama and the Colombian border known as the Darien Gap. It is an 87 Km stretch of rainforest and wikipedia claims that this gap has been coverd by "adventurers on bicycle, motorbike, all-terrain vehicle, and foot, dealing with jungle, swamp, insects, and other hazards." EDIT: As pointed out by Todd Gardiner in the comments, the 47,958 Km is the length of the total network of roads in that region and not the distance between Prudhoe Bay and Ushuaia. The distance seems to be more around 23,000 Km. References: Pan-American Highway    Embed Quote
