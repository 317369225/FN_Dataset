★Is it physically possible to walk uphill to school both ways, using the same route?Apart from having a hill in between your house and the school and forgetting to mention that.
Aside from Anthony Yeh's excellent options, another option would be if you somehow lose altitude while at school.  For instance, the school could be a hang gliding school at the top of a mountain, and you live halfway up the mountain.  You have to walk up the mountain to get to school, and then at the end of the school day, you end up at the bottom of the mountain and have to walk back up to get home.  Or, the school could be built into the side of a hill on which you live halfway up, and students are only allowed to enter from an entrance at the top of the hill, and exit at the first floor entrance, at the bottom of the hill.  Neither of these would technically be the same route, but they would both be uphill both ways.    Embed Quote
