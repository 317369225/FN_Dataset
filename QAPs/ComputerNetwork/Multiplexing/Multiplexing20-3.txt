★Why isn't Prasads Multiplex showing movies in IMAX anymore?
In addition to all that is said about the technical aspects, there is a cost aspect. There is a cap of 150 rupees on movie tickets in Hyderabad, if I'm not wrong. I'm sure IMAX will run in loss if they have to buy the IMAX print and can't cash in on that. PVR IMAX in Bangalore is relatively new and weekend ticket costs shoot up to 1000 per head depending on the movie. There is also a heavy entertainment tax in K'taka. Right or not, I feel that is one of the main reasons.    Embed Quote
