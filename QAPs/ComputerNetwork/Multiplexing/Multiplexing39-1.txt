★What is the difference between multiple access and multiplexing like in FDMA and FDM?
FDM is a process of multiplexing several signal into one using modulation techniques so that they all could be transmitted into a single channel which has a large bandwidth. It belongs to physical layer because you're operating directly on signal using filters and modulating circuits. For example, several TV channels are transmitted to your television using a single cable, this is possible because of process called FDM at the TV station. On the other hand FDMA is a technique or a protocol defined to access a channel based on FDM method. It belongs to data layer. For example as I said how several television signals are transmitted in single channel, FDMA tells how each signal can accommodate or access the given channel bandwidth so as to transmit efficiently,concurrently and cause less interference to other signals in the same channel. A set of frequency is fixed for each TV channel and it has to transmit it's signal within that frequency.    Embed Quote
