★How does multiplexed sequencing work?
Multiplexed sequencing means being able to run one that one sample in one "unit" of sequencing surface. These days, most sequencing is done by Illumina so that multiplexed sequencing refers to running several samples together in one "lane". Sequencing occurs on the surface of a flow cell, and flow cells have either 8 lanes or two lanes. Here's the 8-lane flow cell I'm holding in my hand right now: Samples are physically separated in each lane, however, if I can sequence more than one sample per lane, I'm saving money. Depending on the sample type or the genome type, I may be able to run many samples together in one lane, but for that, I need to be able to identify which sequencing read corresponds to which sample. So molecular barcodes are added to each sample during the "library" preparation. The barcodes are usually 6 base pairs in length (they can be longer, and there maybe 2 at each end of the template molecule) and the instrument reads them as a short sequencing read associated with the normal reads. In Illumina lingo, they are called indices. When we obtain the sequencing data, we "demultiplex" it, meaning we ran a program that identifies all the reads belonging to one index, or one sample.    Embed Quote
