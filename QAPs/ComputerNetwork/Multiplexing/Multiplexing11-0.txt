★How do multiplexes schedule movie timings?There are number of shows of multiple movies released over the week. The multiplexes must have a set formula to screen movies at different times, number of shows etc. What is the underlying algorithm behind it.
My brother used to work in multiplex chain in India. there is not a fixed alogorithm. Here are somethings i know. In India their algorithm consists of - The new movies being released in the week and their anticipated pull power. (Heavily marketed mostly win.) Distributor pressure. Opening collections percentage contracts of multiplexes.(the higher the %, more the shows) Multiplex location's Audience's profile preferences. (Example - The English language movies frquency varies from Mumbai to lucknow, infact even in different areas of a single city) Genre of movie being released. (e.g- Romantic comedy gets more shows than hardcore action, if the pull factor elements are almost same) Seasonal variations. (e.g- Kids/animation films are given good show slots during holidays) Main Audience's time prefrences. (For e.g - Many family type movies are given favorable post 7pm shows, considering the office closing timings. If their are many college goers, certain shows are given morning timing {bunking audience})Etc. Pls note - Every multiplex chain has diffrent priorities given to diffrent points. This algorithm is also tweaked/refined 3-4 times during a year. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
