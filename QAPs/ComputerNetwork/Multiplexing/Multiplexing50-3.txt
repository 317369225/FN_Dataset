★Should Kannada films be made compulsory in one of multiplex screens on lines what has been done to Marathi in Mumbai?
Absolutely Yes, not only Kannada and Marathi, any native language of a particular state deserves it. there is no harm in it. Anyways, multiplexes have multiple screens and world will not fall over if one screen is made exclusive only for native languages. As it is a multiplex, outsiders will always have several choices of movies in many languages and nobody is forcing anybody to watch native language movies. PS : Cosmopolitan Screamers and scumbags like Shobha De can go to hell.    Embed Quote
