★Gurgaon: Is there anything other than malls, multiplex and restaurants in Gurgoan?
There are some good things as well. Epicenter, if you are interested in plays Cyber Hub, although a group of restaurants, is nice Life in some of the localities such as Sector-14, Sector-17, Sector-15, Sushant Lok are way better than life in the new Gurgaon. Its funny that I am one of the few people who thinks Gurgaon treated me decently.    Embed Quote
