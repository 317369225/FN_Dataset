★Why do multiplex ticket prices vary from Rs 70 to rs 350 on weekday to weekend for same show timings?Isn't there any law that this violates?
I heard in Chennai~ No multiplex can charge anything more than Rs. 120 anyday plus the first row of every hall is compulsively priced at Rs. 10. If the respective state govt. want they can do the same in other States and cities too.    Embed Quote
