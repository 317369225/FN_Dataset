★What is your opinion on the new rule in Maharashtra that says "6 - 9 p.m. only for Marathi movies" in the multiplex?
i think it is not that of a bad rule as it says only one theatre should be reserved for that. Yeah a bit of an uneasy rule. But for promotion of a not-to-much-watched good films instead of the hot masala B-films(I assume this condition), this seems to be a good step. Your regular B-films and H-films are not getting banned from that. But yeah ticket for them will be a bit difficult. So a kind of a skeptic good effort    Embed Quote
