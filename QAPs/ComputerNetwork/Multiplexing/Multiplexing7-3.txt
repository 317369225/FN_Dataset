★Gurgaon: Is there anything other than malls, multiplex and restaurants in Gurgoan?
We have houses, schools, offices, parks, metro stations, colleges, banks, coaching centers, police stations, grocery stores, thekas (Shops that sell alcohol) and pretty much anything all other cities have, Gurgaon is probably one of the best cities in the country, it's a lot better in terms of infrastructure when compared to Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad, it's a lot less polluted than Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Kolkata.    Embed Quote
