★What exactly is a multiplexer and how does it work? Additionally, how does can it be controlled or set in a circuit?
Its a multiway switch with 1 input and N outputs. Or N inputs and one output. It needs a set of control signals that define which of the N you want to select. It's useful for distributing one control signal to N different points, or perhaps for measuring N different signal sources with one measuring device. important characteristics are voltage input range, and speed at which it can be switched and how long it takes to settle after switching N. there are many versions for logic signals, analog signals, thermocouples, optical signals, etc. that they are specialized, but the concept is similar.    Embed Quote
