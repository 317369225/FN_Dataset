★Why are food and beverage items sold at high prices above MRP at movie multiplexes?...can't they be sued ..? ...shouldn't government enforce a same pricing policy across all these chains?
No, they can't. Reason being that they have many more expenses to pay, such as rent, licenses, and the likes. On top of that, they need to maintain a profit too.    Embed Quote
