★What are the pros and cons applying time multiplexing on memory chip?Suppose I am using 64K X 8 memory with 8 bit processor and if I apply time multiplexing on its address pins A0-A7 after this,Could I use this memory chip with other processor (like 8086) ?
I don't understand your question. Do you mean using one line to drive A0-A7? In that case, you might want to use a shift register. pros: lesser real estate for bus lines. cons: increased circuit complexity, some compromise on speed.    Embed Quote
