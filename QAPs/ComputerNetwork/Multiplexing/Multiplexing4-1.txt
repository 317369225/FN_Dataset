★Why are there no multiplexes or malls in the capital city of Trivandrum?
The main problem for Trivandrum is cost of land.. To get some land in TVM downtown is going to cost a fortune.....For Lulu group to construct something like Lulu Cochin, in tvm  am not sure if they can get such a land parcel in TVM city ..There was even a news that Lulu asked for the TVM Domestic terminal land but could not keep up with the cost.. Personally I know a four storied shopping complex in Kesavadasapuram was sold for 75 crore .So one can imagine the investment needed in TVM.   There is a township project (which  includes malls, multiplexes, IT space, villas, flats) coming up in kazhakuttom, which is executed by Tauras from US... then we have the mall constructed by KSRTC in Thampanoor. Am not sure how well they can attract good brands. Recently a brand factory was started in Keston Road   20 years back, TVM mob was not known for a cosmopolitan culture. But today in TVM I can see this culture growing. One thing to note , this growth is despite the absence of big business houses like we have in Cochin...This essentially means the purchase power of  Government servants "Professors" and IT crowd, is growing many manifolds. Tehcnopark alone is injecting 1200 crore annually in TVM market..   Am sure, malls will come up, but it will be slow    Embed Quote
