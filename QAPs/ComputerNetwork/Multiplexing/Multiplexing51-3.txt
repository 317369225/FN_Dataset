★What is your opinion on the new rule in Maharashtra that says "6 - 9 p.m. only for Marathi movies" in the multiplex?
Why do people in India always try to increase discrimination based on your geography? Why north Indians are hated in south India but when it comes to watching a cricket match against Pakistan we all are united. Then why this discrimination at other times. To me, this only increases the already biased though of people of a particular state on the people of other states. Why can't we all be one and see each other only as fellow human beings rather than people of different states race gender or country. I think the which movie is be shown on primetime should be left on public response. If a local movie is very good and getting a good response I am sure it will be shown on prime time.    Embed Quote
