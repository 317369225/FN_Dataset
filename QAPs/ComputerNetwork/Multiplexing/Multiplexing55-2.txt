★How can I book a whole theater or a screen in multiplex for my fiance in Delhi, India?Please explain where can I book the whole multiplex sceen
Spending so much money just to make one person happy who is still not married to you is not a great deal.Instead,Make your parents happy for giving you everything and making you able to get married to someone. Or,best will be to plan something for all (already & would be) the family members to have a gala time together. If you still persistent to your idea,i would suggest to but a complete home theater for yourself.    Embed Quote
