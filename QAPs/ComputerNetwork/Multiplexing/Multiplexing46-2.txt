★Why can't Multiplex Movie Tickets cost be regularized in Bangalore (Kar) like in other major south Indian Cities?
Frankly, putting a cap on movie tickets is not a bad idea contrary to what what Vinod and Amit say. It may help increase demand by more volume of people willing to watch ordinary and sub-standard movies. Multiplexes in Cheenai have quite a crowd for several movies that do very little business in Bangalore. Moreover Vinod and Amit forget that it is job of the law to protect the consumer and hence just because there is a demand, the vendor cannot exploit you beyond rational economic standard.    Embed Quote
