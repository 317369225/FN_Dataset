★What is the difference between a multiplexer and a decoder?In computer architecture, all the cases where you implement multiplexer can be replaced by implementing decoders right?
Multiplexers and decoders are different devices. A multiplexer (mux) is a "many" to "few" device. For example, a 4:1 mux selects one of four input signals to be passed to the output. On the other hand, a decoder takes "few" signals and outputs "many". Typically a decoder is described as n:2^n. For example, a 4:16 mux reads the input 4 bits and interprets this as a binary number. The corresponding output line for this number is raised. So if the input is 0101 base 2 = 5 decimal, then the 5th output line is high while all other outputs are low[1]. [1] I think active low output decoders might be more common. In that case the 5th outputs would be low and all other outputs would be high.    Embed Quote
