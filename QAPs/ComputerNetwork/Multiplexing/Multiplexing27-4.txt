★Can you pass any information as input data in a multiplexer?They have explained me how a multiplexer works: however, from what I've understood, it seems kind of silly to me to use tons of datas and inputs just to output one single bit. Can the inputs and outputs be larger data streams?
Yes. In fact TONS of data get sieved through into a single channel for sake of reduction of load, ease of transmission and convenience using a Multiplexer........Like in the case of a Telephone Exchange. The purpose is not to "compress" the data to a single bit.......Oh NO !! It is a clever mechanism to ensure that all the data being transmitted gets to use the communication channel (which has a maximum bandwidth it can support in most cases ie there is a limit to the information it can handle)...So the information from various input channels is provided time slots or frequency slots to occupy while being transmitted using Muxes !!    Embed Quote
