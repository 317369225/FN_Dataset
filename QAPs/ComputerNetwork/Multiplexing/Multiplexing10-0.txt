★What is multiplexing of signals in communication?
For example. in telephony communication, it is sending the digital voice code samples of many sources/users ( may be 24 or 30 depending on the type of PCM system it uses) using a time-shared media as in the case of PCM systems.This is Time multiplexing In cable TV systems( which may be transmitting hundreds of different TV channels on it), it is sharing the same coaxial cable using different fixed size chunks of the available cable bandwidth.This is Frequency multiplexing. In computer networks, the transmission media may be Statistically multiplexed-that is, the bandwidth is allotted to a source on its bandwidth demand. This is used for real time video communication as well as for streaming video and network database applications. The bottom line is, push as many signals on the transmission medium as is possible to improve ROI on the network infrastructure you have built.    Embed Quote
