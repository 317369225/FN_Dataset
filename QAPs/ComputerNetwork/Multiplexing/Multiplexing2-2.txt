★What is the difference between a multiplexer and a decoder?In computer architecture, all the cases where you implement multiplexer can be replaced by implementing decoders right?
Multiplexing and Decoding are two different concepts, though they may look similar. Multiplexing is the process by which the output at any time shall be any one of the 2^n inputs possible. The inputs shall be selected using n-select inputs. So if we have 2 select lines, we can use it to multiplex 4 input lines. The select lines can take the values 00, 01, 10 and 11. When select line is 00, first input is given as output, when its 01, second input is given as output, and so on. Demultiplexing is the reverse process of multiplexing. In demultiplexing, the input shall be routed to any one of the 2^n outputs possible. If the select lines is 00, input is given to the first output line, when its 01, input is given to the second output line, and so on. Demultiplexing and Decoding shall look alike. If you look at the circuit diagrams of 8:1 demultiplexer and 3line-to-8line decoder, you shall see that they are very similar. The only difference is that in the demultiplexer, we have an input line connected to all the AND gates. In the 3line-to-8line decoder, we have 3 select lines and 8 output lines. Depending on the values of these select lines, any one of the output line shall become active. If the select line is 010, the output line corresponding to 2 shall become active. In the demultiplexer, the output line corresponding to 2 shall be chosen, and the input is given to that line. In the decoder, if the select line is 010, output line corresponding to 2 is always active. In the demultiplexer, if the select line is 010, the output line corresponding to 2 is active only when the input is high.    Embed Quote
