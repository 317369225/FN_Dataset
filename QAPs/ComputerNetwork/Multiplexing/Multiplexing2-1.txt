★What is the difference between a multiplexer and a decoder?In computer architecture, all the cases where you implement multiplexer can be replaced by implementing decoders right?
Multiplexing and decoding are two different concepts that serve two different purposes but indeed they are related in a way. Aside from computer architecture, for example, in communications systems (computer networks, radio, satellite, etc) the same concept is applied. In that context, multiplexing is sending multiple signals on a carrier at the same time in the form of a complex signal and then recovering (or decoding if you wish) the separate signals at the receiving end.    Embed Quote
