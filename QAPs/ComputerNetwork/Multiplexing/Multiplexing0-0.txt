★What is multiplexing?
TL'DR several telephone calls may be carried using one wire. Long Like any other industry, in telecom also the fundamental problem is the resources. Resources may be in the form of spectrum, transmission, Radio capacity or in any other form. The idea is to utilize the resources in most optimized way. The concept of multiplexing also talks about the same thing.  Multiplexing is a way by which multiple analog signals or digital data streams are combined into one signal over a shared medium. One can consider the simple analogy for better understanding of the Multiplexing. Consider a pipe which transfers the construction material from one place to another and there is only one such pipe available at the site. You know that there are typical 4-5 different types of materials required for construction like sand, cement, stones, bricks, water etc. Now they have to be made available at the same time at the required place, because even if one item is missing construction can’t progress. One way is to transfer the items sequentially. But, the problem with that is worker will have to wait till the time all the material is transferred to the site. The same problem can be addressed in different way. All the five items are first mixed together and then sent to the site.Afterwards, at the destination they are separated out again. In this phenomenon, mixing is called multiplexing and separation is called demultiplexing. Device that performs the multiplexing is called a Multiplexer (MUX), and a device that performs the reverse process is called a Demultiplexer (DEMUX).    Embed Quote
