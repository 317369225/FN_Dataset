★Can you pass any information as input data in a multiplexer?They have explained me how a multiplexer works: however, from what I've understood, it seems kind of silly to me to use tons of datas and inputs just to output one single bit. Can the inputs and outputs be larger data streams?
I think you are not understanding a multiplexer that well, there are multiplexers for many kinds of inputs and they can be paralleled for busses and more rapid inputs. Basically you would use a multiplexer to sample multiple slow streams of data to a single process that can process data much more rapidly than a single stream, that if you have an N:1 multiplexer and the stream goes to a device that can process N items at a time then you are fully using the process. Otherwise it has capacity that is wasted.    Embed Quote
