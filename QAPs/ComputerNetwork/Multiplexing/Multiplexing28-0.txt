★Will multiplexes convert all their cinemas into 3D?
It will be interesting to see what happens in theatrical. A great deal of the major Studio tentpole movies in 2011/2012 are slated as S3D. @Jason - That would be great, but autostereo (S3D w/o glasses) in a really good form is still a few years away, despite what you might have heard from CES this year!    Embed Quote
