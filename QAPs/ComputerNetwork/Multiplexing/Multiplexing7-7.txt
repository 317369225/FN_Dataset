★Gurgaon: Is there anything other than malls, multiplex and restaurants in Gurgoan?
I have lived in Lucknow, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore. I liked every place I lived. There were parks, people, kids, pets, road-side eateries, friendly neighbours, cinemas etc. Every city made me feel happy and feel at home. But only Gurgaon has made me feel empty from the inside. It has some of the nicest pubs, good restaurants, cinemas, malls etc. Its a flashy, cosmopolitan, rich city. It only lacks a soul. You would never call it home. To answer your question, no there is nothing else in Gurgaon    Embed Quote
