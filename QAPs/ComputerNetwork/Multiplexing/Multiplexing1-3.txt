★What is the purpose of time-division multiplexing (TDM)?From my understanding, multiplexing is used to increase communication speed, but I don't see how TDM does this.
The purpose of Multiplexing is optimization. Push as many signals on the carrier as possible to get reasonable Return on Investment. Communication speed will not increase. But multiplexing the already multiplexed signals gives rise to high bit rate. In TDM, the time slot is share by different inputs( calls) for example, 24 or 32 channels in one 125 microsecond time frame. That means 24/32 simultaneous calls can be routed together in that frame without giving rise to any cross talk.    Embed Quote
