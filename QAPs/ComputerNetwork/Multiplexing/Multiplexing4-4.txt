★Why are there no multiplexes or malls in the capital city of Trivandrum?
Well, Kochi or Thrissur or Kottayam are not going to grow alone! in central Kerala, every town and urban centres will grow with growing urbanization. see, a Town like Muvattupuzha has a mall with multiplex!(Canton mall). Canton Mall Perumbavoor getting mall, see the suburban centres of Kochi is slowly growing into something which we never witnessed in Kerela. It's growth of towns and cities in central and northern Kerala which can be seen in present and future decades. I honestly believe Trivandrum as a city survived due to better patronage from Rajahs(Pre-Independence) as well as Capital status of Kerala after Independence. Taxes collected from Travancore era "decorated" Trivendrum city alone or may be 50-60kms around it. other places rot.  Now, it is not possible to imagine Kerala starts and ends in Capital city. instead, Kochi, Kottayam, Thrissur, Kozhikode, Kannur and various small centres in these areas will grow. Capital city status does not mean we have to be like some states where everything is focussed in capital and let the other parts remain barren. There is no going back. Rajahs times over.    Embed Quote
