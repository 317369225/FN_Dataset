★Why are there no multiplexes or malls in the capital city of Trivandrum?
There were no malls in Kochi before Oberon was opened in 2008. It had a very late entry into the mall culture when compared to other Indian cities.  This inspite of the fact that Kochi is a very cosmopolitan city. But look where it is now?? Similarly, as of now, Trivandrum would be a great place for developers to start a mall instead of building more malls in the saturated Kochi market. Them not doing so shows their mob mentality and lack of initiative    Embed Quote
