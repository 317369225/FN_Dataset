★Is there any mathematical model which determines how seats in a multiplex gets filled?
I have some good news and some bad news: First, the bad news: It is hopeless to make a mathematical model for this, and even if you do make a model, the input parameters will be unknown to you. Eg: When she enters the class room, does she consider each and every seat ? Does she just look at the first few rows ? Does she like to write notes and ask questions ? (sit in front rows) Does she like to check her phone every few minutes ? (sit in last few rows) Does she avoid boys (or some specific girls) ? Does she regularly sit next to few specific girls (or best friends) ? Does she avoid windows or fans or bright lights ? What about the choices of the remaining people ? So you can not make a simple model, and even if you did, you could not plug in all the input parameters to get the best seat. Now, the good news: You do not need a model for solving your particular problem. All you need to do is to come late yourself. Delay yourself my talking on the phone, or going to restroom, or etc.  If you see her coming close to the classroom, then you also move. If she sees you, then smile and say something about getting delayed. Then, where-ever she sits, you go sit next to her. In case you can not make it the same time as her, then you can go later, and directly go sit next to her. If you are the adventurous type, then send this Ask2Answer to her. If she asks, which girl you are talking about, then : All the best !!!!    Embed Quote
