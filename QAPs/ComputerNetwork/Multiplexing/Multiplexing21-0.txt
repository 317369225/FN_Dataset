★What are the pros and cons applying time multiplexing on memory chip?Suppose I am using 64K X 8 memory with 8 bit processor and if I apply time multiplexing on its address pins A0-A7 after this,Could I use this memory chip with other processor (like 8086) ?
Yes, you should be able to use it but with a software modification. In this case your memory is a custom memory with a slight complexity in its behavior when compared to traditional memories. As long as the processor knows how to access data from the memory and how to write into it, you should be fine. Generally most of the programs which are loaded in the memory are in a way that at any given location they contain the instruction and the address in which the next instruction is stored. In your case, next instruction will be executed after 8 cycles i.e. 8 extra clock cycles are elapsed between any two meaningful operations(with all the intermediate instructions dummy and only address hopping is happening here), reducing the speed of your overall system by a factor of 8. Also the memory needed to store your program is increased by approximately 8 folds (may be slightly less) as most of the content in the memory is just pointing to a different location in itself. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
