★What is your opinion on the new rule in Maharashtra that says "6 - 9 p.m. only for Marathi movies" in the multiplex?
That's the people's choice.  Not that of the Govt.  Instead the Govt can insist on showing good movies.  Not bad movies, giving audio visual coaching on obscenity, romance or violence of any language.  Instead of protecting the interests of Marathis it is protecting the interests of Marathi movie producers.    Embed Quote
