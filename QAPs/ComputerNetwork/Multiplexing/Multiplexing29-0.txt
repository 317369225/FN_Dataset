★Which theaters/multiplexes/IMAX in Moscow screen latest Hollywood movies in english?Theaters/Multiplexes in Moscow showing Hollywood movies in english (original language and not subtitles). Particularly interested in Transformers3 and Cars2!
I have bad news for you... there are NO multiplexes or IMAX theaters in Moscow that would've screen american (or any other nit russian) movies in original language. There is one movie theater that always screens new english-speaking movies in original language http://www.domecinema.ru/index.e... And another one, that host international movies' festivals: so there depends on your luck, because besides american movies, there could be a weak of french, german, spanish etc. movies. And usually they chose independent or art-house movies. http://www.kino35mm.ru/en    Embed Quote
