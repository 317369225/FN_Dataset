★Should Kannada films be made compulsory in one of multiplex screens on lines what has been done to Marathi in Mumbai?
Particularly in bengaluru, rather than making compulsory as Rakshit said directive has to be given to multiplexes regarding sidelining of regional movies. To add one more point to his answer, ticket prices in multiplexes in bengaluru is different for different languages unlike other cities like hyderabad and chennai. So naturally multiplex owners screen more number of other language movies to increase their profits. This has to stop. Otherwise very soon it'll turn out to be "Multiplex Mafia" just like sand and mining mafia and difficult to control afterwards.. If this is done, then movies of regional languages can be screened in more screens(In significant numbers) and can be allotted more slots. If this is not regulated then in the future many state governments will follow Maharashtra government's  way...At that point of time the localites will also join their hands with the govt.    Embed Quote
