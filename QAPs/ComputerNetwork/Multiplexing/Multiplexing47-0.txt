★Why do multiplex ticket prices vary from Rs 70 to rs 350 on weekday to weekend for same show timings?Isn't there any law that this violates?
In a free economy - price is a function of supply and demand as long as it follows fair trade practices norms that excludes monopolistic practices, hoarding etc. Over weekends demand exceeds supply therefore prices would soar, on weekdays it's the reverse! So short answer is no - it's not illegal to fix price depending fluctuating demand when the supply is fixed (which is the case you are describing here).    Embed Quote
