★Should Kannada films be made compulsory in one of multiplex screens on lines what has been done to Marathi in Mumbai?
The incident in Mumbai is sad but there are a lot of factors that must be taken into account comparing both Bengalooru and Mumbai. The Marathi movies are not much popular and is not as lucrative as Hindi movies which is not the case in Bengalooru where kannada movies also are lucrative. But the choice is with movie goers. Incidentally if the move has not the expected results (if people boycott Marathi movies) how will the regional parties react?    Embed Quote
