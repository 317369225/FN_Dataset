★Gurgaon: Is there anything other than malls, multiplex and restaurants in Gurgoan?
I moved from Delhi, worked in Gurgaon and moved to Mumbai less than a yr back. And if you ask me, I feel empty in Mumbai too! Is it the fault of the place? No not at all, Mumbai is a fantastic city, but then why do I feel empty and restless? The only answer I can think of is that we human are social creatures and till the time we find people we can connect deeply too, we will continue to feel empty. Perhaps even if we are in paradise! Ultimately, you need to give a city and yourself time and create new bonds. In some places or some situations, it happens very quickly. And sometimes it takes longer. While you are in Gurgaon and choose to be there for any reason, take time out to discover the surroundings Delhi, Rajasthan etc. Open your hearts to people even if you get rejections or creepy looks, be kind and nice and eventually someone will reciprocate. People in big or (trying to be big) cities tend to be sceptical of niceness. But opening your hearts to people without judgement helps connect at a very different level. I have had the most fascinating conversations with our office cab drivers in gurgaon, so while you are there, relax, smile more and choose to connect, while I try to do the same in another city. :)    Embed Quote
