★Can you pass any information as input data in a multiplexer?They have explained me how a multiplexer works: however, from what I've understood, it seems kind of silly to me to use tons of datas and inputs just to output one single bit. Can the inputs and outputs be larger data streams?
Well its not silly if you imagine it in a computer. Suppose you want to express a pattern it shorter from. Like you want to to on a led if some certain pattern of bits are given. Multiplexer could be of any length , using this formula 2^n ==>  n means converts 2^n inputs to n outputs..  a simple illustraion can help u through this...    Embed Quote
