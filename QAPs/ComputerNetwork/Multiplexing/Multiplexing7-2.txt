★Gurgaon: Is there anything other than malls, multiplex and restaurants in Gurgoan?
I personally did not  like Gurgaon . I landed here in 2012 with many hopes and aspirations . It did not give me any thing rather than loneliness .  People here , don't have manners to talk . they are arrogant . Pollution is on its peak(dust n all). Dislike !!    Embed Quote
