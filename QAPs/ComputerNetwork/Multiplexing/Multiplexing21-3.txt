★What are the pros and cons applying time multiplexing on memory chip?Suppose I am using 64K X 8 memory with 8 bit processor and if I apply time multiplexing on its address pins A0-A7 after this,Could I use this memory chip with other processor (like 8086) ?
No you can't You will be storing some information in the memory If you do time multiplexing in memory then you will loose previously stored information in the memory    Embed Quote
