★What exactly is a multiplexer and how does it work? Additionally, how does can it be controlled or set in a circuit?
You have only one wire but you need to carry multiple distinct signals through this wire how do you do it??? You use a multiplexer. A 'MUX' has 2^N inputs and 1 output with N control inputs. 1 output is the single wire that you have and those 2^N inputs are what you want to pass through that wire, what MUX does is that it allows you to transmit signals of thos 2^N inputs to that 1 output wore but one at a time, so at a time only one signal is connected to output. The control input decides which input is connected to output.    Embed Quote
