★Why do some people prefer PVR over the other multiplexes?
I see this trend only in Delhi. Maybe because here PVR seems to have purchased or taken over so many other theatres. While I was in Hyderabad, people used to go to Cinemax. Or any other theatre close in proximity. No bias whatsoever.    Embed Quote
