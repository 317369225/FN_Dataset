★Why isn't Prasads Multiplex showing movies in IMAX anymore?
Very few movies( and only limited scenes in those movies) are shot using IMAX cameras like dark knight, dark knight rises, mission impossible ghost protocol  etc. only those scenes shot with IMAX cameras take advantage of the big screen and resolution of the IMAX ... remaining are just stretched out versions of the original aspect ratio.. there are only like 3 to 4 IMAX cameras made till now and are generally used for space photography and stuff .. so there use in movies is limited as of now..    Embed Quote
