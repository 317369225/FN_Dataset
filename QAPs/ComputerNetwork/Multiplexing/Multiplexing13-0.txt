★How does multiplexing in CAN messages work?
I am answering based on the understanding that you know CAN protocol in some detail, are familiar with the concepts and have some working knowledge. A very good description is provided by Vector here: Extended Signal Multiplexing in DBC Databases - Vector Short version: It is a method for sending data that does not fit into the 8 byte CAN payload. In some cases, it might be best to send it as multiple messages. One signal in the frame is used as a multiplexer and the remaining payload is interpreted depending on the value of the multiplexer signal.    Embed Quote
