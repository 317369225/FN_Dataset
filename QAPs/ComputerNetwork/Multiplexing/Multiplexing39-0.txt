★What is the difference between multiple access and multiplexing like in FDMA and FDM?
With example it is easy: 1. Times Now TV : Prime time Arnab's show. Shouting match between participants . So many collisions. Participants may have to repeat what they said.  This is an example of Multiple Access. Contention for access. 2. FDMA: Mobile networks sharing bandwidth to customers. For each time you call the same person on the network, frequency allotted to you is different. 3.FDM : Freq.Division. Multiplexing: Example: Cable TV cable. Carries tens of hundreds of TV programmes by a method of fixed Bandwidth sharing on the same cable.    Embed Quote
