★What is I/O multiplexing?
This is a very old term for allowing one I/O channel to send data to multiple peripheral devices simultaneously by interleaving the data to the devices. OS 360 Example (ca 1968): Think of a fast I/O channel that can send data to a high speed peripheral device like a tape drive, or a disk drive. Now, instead of attaching these devices on the channel, you attach a card reader & a card punch. The card reader reads a card & transmits its data to the system. While the card is physically moving the card through its read heads, the I/O channel sends data to the card punch (from another job). Now while, the punch is physically punching the card, the I/O channel fetches the data from the card reader. Second example: Attach 16 tty devices to an I/O channel. These get one byte at a time & then hit the paper with a hammer to type the requisite letter. The I/O channel is so much faster than the ttys that it looks like they are all being driven at the same time! Alternative: Burst Mode, which is used to send a large data block to a high speed device!    Embed Quote
