★Why can't Multiplex Movie Tickets cost be regularized in Bangalore (Kar) like in other major south Indian Cities?
It is ridiculous to think that the government should fix all pricing. Let the market decide the pricing. Government fixing the pricing was the reason why we were poor for 40 years after independence. It is good for the country and government if there are idiots who pay 600 or 1000 bucks for a movie ticket. Indians should stop this habit of expecting freebies for the government for everything. It does make sense for healthcare and education, but hell not for entertainment! You should understand that if govt provides subsidy for entertainment industry they are helping filthy rich movie stars who don't pay tax and are generally useless to the society to make more money.    Embed Quote
