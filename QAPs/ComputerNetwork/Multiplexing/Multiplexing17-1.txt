★How does Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM) work?I read in Frequency Division Multiplexing multiple frequencies each encoded with separate information is combined into one complex signal. Frequency-division multiplexing How do you encode bits into a wave of a certain frequency?
That isn't done anymore, it's old analog 1950 technology, and it takes racks and racks of amplifiers, oscillators, modulators, filters, mixers, and AGC loops.  you needed a full-time technician to watch over and tweak and repair each rack of those. It's much cheaper and simpler and reliable to do most of that digitally, and only do the digital to signal conversion as the last step.  To encode bits you can do like morse code, on-off modulation, or a bit fancier, FM, vary the frequency a little bit, that was used for decades to send news over shortwave all over the world, at 66 bits per second.  You can pack the bits in tighter by varying the carrier phase cycle by cycle, that's what was used in 1200 baud modems I think.  In faster modems they vary the phase in smaller increments, so you get more bits encoded by each phase shift, but you need very fancy phase-adjusters to compensate for the phase-shift in the phone lines.    Embed Quote
