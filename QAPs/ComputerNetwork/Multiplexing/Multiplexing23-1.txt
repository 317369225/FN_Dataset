★What is it like to watch several movies on a single ticket at a multiplex?
Great fun!  Some movie houses offer free previews, so you get in line to see the movie you wanted at a certain time, but as you purchase your ticket, they tell you they're showing this bonus movie first, and then you get to stay to see the movie you bought the ticket to see.  Two for the price of one!  I've never been disappointed by the preview movie.    Embed Quote
