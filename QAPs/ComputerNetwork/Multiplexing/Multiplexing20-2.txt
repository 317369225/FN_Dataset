★Why isn't Prasads Multiplex showing movies in IMAX anymore?
Our current Prasads IMAX screen's projector is a film reel projector. Now-a-days, all the latest films featured and shot in IMAX cameras like X-men, Transformers 4 are being released in IMAX Digital format so as to reduce costs of printing on film reel which our IMAX projector is not capable of projecting. I think our IMAX is undergoing an upgrade so as to facilitate new movies in Digital IMAX format. PS: Film reel IMAX format has much more detail and clarity than Digital IMAX formal. Due to certain circumstances it has been going through all these changes. Not to mention our Prasads IMAX is the largest IMAX 3D screen capable of projecting IMAX 3D movies in the world.    Embed Quote
