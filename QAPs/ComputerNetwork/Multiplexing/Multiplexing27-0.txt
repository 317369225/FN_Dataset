★Can you pass any information as input data in a multiplexer?They have explained me how a multiplexer works: however, from what I've understood, it seems kind of silly to me to use tons of datas and inputs just to output one single bit. Can the inputs and outputs be larger data streams?
Yes.  It's not just a single bit, you can multiplex buses and serial streams.    Embed Quote
