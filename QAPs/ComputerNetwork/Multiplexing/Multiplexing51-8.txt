This is what he said : Minimum government - Maximum governance. And then this is what they did: Beef ban - The government will control what you eat.( We've entered your living room ) Section 377- The government will control your sexual orientation.( We're in your bedroom). Marathi movies from 6-9 pm ( Now we're in your nearest theaters too !). This sums up our opinion and feeling about such moves.    Embed Quote
