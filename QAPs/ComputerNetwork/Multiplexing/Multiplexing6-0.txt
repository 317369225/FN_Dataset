★What is the application of a multiplexer?
A multiplexer takes N bitstreams and converts them to a single N times faster bitstream. There are variants of this concept. For example. an N by 1 select does essentially the same thing for static data. There are many reasons to multiplex. It is very common in system design to multiplex signals across subsystem boundaries. This reduces the number of lines that have to be supplied and avoids tricky phase alignment problems across N lines. In telecommunications, it has long been practice to take multiple signals and multiplex them prior to applying the composite signal to a carrier for wireless transmission. For example, since digitized telephone signals are generally 64kb/s and an optical or wireless carrier might operate at 2.048 Gb/s, it is easy to see that you can multiplex 32,000 voice channels on a single optical or wireless carrier. This makes a lot more sense than trying to lay 32,000 optical cables or send 32,000 wireless signals. Multiplexing gets much more complicated when OFDM and MIMO concepts are applied.    Embed Quote
