★What is the purpose of time-division multiplexing (TDM)?From my understanding, multiplexing is used to increase communication speed, but I don't see how TDM does this.
In my point of view, multiplexing will not increase the communication speed, because the multiplexing will not increase the channel capacity eventually(if multi-user gain is not considered). So what is multiplexing? In short, it is a radio access scheme. For example: Without losing generality, we take the downlink channel, one channel from frequency 10k~20kHz is given. At first, there is only one base station and one user. The base station wants to transmit DATA to user. Ok, it is very simple, the DATA is transmit through entire channel to user. An then, there is one base station and  and two user (UE1 and UE2). The base station wants to transmit DATA1 to UE1 and DATA2 to UE2. How to do? TDM: using 1st second and entire channel (10k~20kHz) to transmit DATA1 to UE1, and using 2ed second and entire channel (10k~20kHz) to transmit DATA2 to UE2, and iteratively ... FDM: using split channel (10k~15kHZ) to transmit DATA1 to UE1, and using split channel (16k~20kHZ) to transmit DATA2 to UE2, and iteratively ... CDM: using code to split channel. conclude: multiplexing is the way to split the channel to different users, if split the channel by time is TDM, split by frequencey is FDM and maybe other ways.    Embed Quote
