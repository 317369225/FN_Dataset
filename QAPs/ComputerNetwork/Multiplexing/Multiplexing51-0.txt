★What is your opinion on the new rule in Maharashtra that says "6 - 9 p.m. only for Marathi movies" in the multiplex?
Thanks to Net Neutrality issue, I think people will understand what I'm about to write... Now compare, multiplex owners to telecom operators... Big production houses to apps like Flipkart,Snapdeal etc... Marathi film producer to competetive but small scale app... Now you all know that FlipKart and SnapDeal will quickly kill the competition of there is no net neutrality because their app will be accessed freely by the consumers and small scale app will be charged or even made to load slower by telcos(that's bad right??) Similarly, In absesce of Neutrality, big production houses will book all multiplex slots by paying money to multiplex owners. Marathi film producers can not match that kind of money. Hence now you are seeing primetime slots not allowed to small players. We need the Neutrality here... So I think out of all screens in a multiplex, one dedicated screen for Marathi film will not hurt anyone, you can still watch other movies if you want. PS. Now a days there are more sensible Marathi movies than Hindi.    Embed Quote
