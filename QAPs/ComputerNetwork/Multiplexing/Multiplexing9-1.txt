★Why is food in multiplexes expensive?
This is because of the high rent they have to pay to keep the shop/space they have been allotted in the mall. Plus taxes. The builder who makes mall either rents the plots/areas or sells it at a very high price. Plus the mall maintenance, electricity bills to run ac an keep such huge volume of place cool, security guards, support staff, water, bathrooms maintenance etc add up huge costs. If you feel its expensive then How do you plan to recover all this and run profitable business and recover your investment in 3-5 years? :) Thats why you have free entry to mall but costly everything, food, clothes movies etc. Talking of the movie halls where food is costly, if you buy a ticket for rs. 200, out of that approximately 150 goes to distributor and tax. Outof the remaining 50 rs 25 per head goes into maintenance of hall. After all miscellaneous deductions hardly rs. 10 or so is left. The  only area the cinema owner owns fully and can make money is the food. Hence the high rates.    Embed Quote
