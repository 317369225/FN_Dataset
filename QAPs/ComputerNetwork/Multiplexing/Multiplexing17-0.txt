★How does Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM) work?I read in Frequency Division Multiplexing multiple frequencies each encoded with separate information is combined into one complex signal. Frequency-division multiplexing How do you encode bits into a wave of a certain frequency?
Each sub channel in an FDM system can be FSK modulated to provide a bit stream. This isn't very effective, but it has been done. It was very common in the old LOS radio/FDM days to transmit 300 to 1200 baud telemetry data on a standard 4kHz channel. OFDM or orthogonal FDM is a different beast. In OFDM, multiple high speed bit streams are CDMA encoded onto a channel. Then multiple channels are FDM'd together to make a complex signal. That complex signal is usually transmitted using something like 16 or 64 bit QAM. A brief history of FDM: In the old days of analog telephone voice channels, each 4kHz voice channel was stacked in frequency. A 12 channel "group" of 0-4kHz, 4-8kHz, 8-12kHz, and so on was a 0-48kHz bandwidth stack of channels. Each group was translated to 60-108kHz. A super group consisted of 5 stacked groups and a master super group consisted of 10 super groups for a total of 600 channels. This signal of 600 voice channels would then be used to FM modulate a radio. FSK: frequency shift keying LOS: line of sight FDM: frequency division multiplex OFDM: orthogonal frequency division multiplex CDMA: code division multiple access QAM: quadrature amplitude modulation Note: one of my first jobs was developing telephone systems using FDM multiplex. It is arcane knowledge that probably doesn't have much use these days. It was interesting engineering though.    Embed Quote
