★Can you pass any information as input data in a multiplexer?They have explained me how a multiplexer works: however, from what I've understood, it seems kind of silly to me to use tons of datas and inputs just to output one single bit. Can the inputs and outputs be larger data streams?
Thanks for asking. Yes, you can make multiplexers of any width that you want, where "width"  means the number of bits transferred in parallel. An example of this is the IDE data bus that you use to link hard disk drives together, which sends 16 bits of data in parallel: The bus can only transmit data to or from one drive at a time, so the two (or more) drives share the data bus; the data are thus multiplexed on that bus. However, a key point  of the multiplexer concept is that it makes the most sense to multiplex data in a scenario where data  transmission is serialized (that is, the data are transmitted piece by piece over time). Because of that, there is always going to be a tradeoff between width (how many bits are sent in parallel) and speed (how fast you can send data). Sending data in parallel is more expensive in terms of hardware, while sending data in series is more expensive in terms of time consumed.    Embed Quote
