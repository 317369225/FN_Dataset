★Why are food and beverage items sold at high prices above MRP at movie multiplexes?...can't they be sued ..? ...shouldn't government enforce a same pricing policy across all these chains?
Firstly, the movie halls, restaurants, etc are charged an extra tax that is not levied to other retail shops for the sale of the same food and beverage. Secondly, they are not only giving us the bottle/can, but also a glass, straw and service from a waiter for whom they have to pay. Thirdly, they need to cover up on their expenses such as rent, salaries etc. And lastly, they need to make a profit. Hence it is necessary for them to charge an extra amount.    Embed Quote
