★Why isn't Prasads Multiplex showing movies in IMAX anymore?
IMAX movies were like a fad. Popular for some time and now fading into oblivion. Making a movie for the IMAX screen requires special equipment and professionals. This increases the budget of the film many folds. When the technology was new, people invested in IMAX versions of their films as they expected people to be fascinated by it and hence more revenue. As time passed, that excitement for an IMAX movie has slowly died down and less movies are being shot in IMAX print. For a theater, buying an IMAX print of the movie is a costlier investment and probably the returns for Prasad have not been enough for it to continue to heavily invest in these prints. Secondly, seeing the current state of the multiplex (it's level of maintenance) and the deteriorating sound system in the past year leads me to believe the multiplex is not making a lot of money and thus is not willing to invest in IMAX prints of new movies. P. S. The above are my thoughts on the matter based on limited knowledge of the workings of the industry and are not be construed as facts.    Embed Quote
