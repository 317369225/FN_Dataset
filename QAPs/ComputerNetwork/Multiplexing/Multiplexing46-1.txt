★Why can't Multiplex Movie Tickets cost be regularized in Bangalore (Kar) like in other major south Indian Cities?
Only Tamil Nadu has a cap on ticket prices... That's the reason not many multiplexes existed there for a long time, they couldn't make money there. However, cinema owners have figured out innovative ways to get their money- exorbitant parking fees, expensive in-cinema food. Also, don't ignore the fact that the cinemas in other cities charge 500-600 for high demand shows only. They still sell damn cheap tickets for not-so good demand and off-peak hours (morning, weekdays) which is most of the times less than Rs100. On the other hand Chennai cinemas sell tickets at fixed price for all shows and all movies. So don't remain under confusion that govt controlled prices are good. See the whole picture.    Embed Quote
