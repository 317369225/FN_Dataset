★How do I get my wireless router to provide faster Internet access?The router operates at 2.4Ghz and the download speed is coming in at 0.70 Mbps.
I think you're confusing the Analog Bandwidth (baud rate) with the Digital Bandwidth (bit rate). Those two are not the same. The 2.4 GHz is the 'band' in which your WiFi Router (probably b or g) operates. It denotes the frequency of the radio waves these routers communicate in. Splitting of the bandwidth spectrum is a common practice to avoid interference with other wireless devices. For instance, if your mobile phone and your WiFi device operated in the same bandwidth (same frequency), the waves would either cancel each other out, or add to the noise and hence distorting the signal altogether. Both devices won't work until you switch one off, or you take effort to get one device out of the range of the other. A bad analogy to this would be-- if you have two persons talking to you at the same time about random things, you'd wouldn't be able to 'decode' any of what either one has to say. But for a moment consider you had very capable ears and could distinguish high pitch voice from a low pitch one, and now if one talked to you in a high pitch voice whilst the other in a low pitch simultaneously, you'd easily be able to 'decode' and interpret them without loss of information, or interference. When people say bandwidth, they usually mean the upper bound of the bandwidth. Of course, the bandwidth also has a lower bound. The difference between the lower bound and upper bound of the bandwidth constitutes a 'channel'. Typical WiFi channels are 22 MHz wide. OTOH, bit rates that you get (0.7 Mbits/sec) doesn't have anything to do with the bandwidth frequency or the channel. I can own a 100 GHz device with a 100MHz channel, but if my internet provider has a cap of 1 Mbits/sec on my bandwidth (bit rate), I'd only get that much speed (in bit rate), may be less but never more. That said, there's def a correlation between the two bandwidths-- the maximum amount of bits (bit rate / expressed in bits/sec / also referred to as digital bandwidth) that can be transmitted by a radio wave is directly proportional to the 'width' of the bandwidth of that wave (data rate / expressed in hertz / also called a 'channel'). This is what they call Hartley's law, if I recall correctly. That is why analog bandwidth and maximum bit rate (digital bandwidth) are inter related. Wider the channel, more the no. of bits the router can transmit. There are certain modulation techniques (ASK, PSK, QAM) that help increase the bit rate even further, but that discussion is for another day. Hope this cleared things up.
