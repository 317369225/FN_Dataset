★Is it possible to increase the range of a wireless router?
Improve the path.  Avoid obstructions, change antenna angle, etc. Increase antenna gain.Increasing the radio output power will likely not improve things, unless you do so on both ends of the link.  Unlike simplex transmissions (AM/FM radio, etc.), in WiFi there are two devices exchanging information.  For example, increasing your Access Point radio output does not have any effect on the output of your laptop.  In most cases, the lower power output is at the laptop, not the AP. Many times I have turned the output power down on an AP in order to achieve a better user experience.    Embed Quote
