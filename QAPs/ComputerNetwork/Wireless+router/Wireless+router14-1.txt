★Why is there problem in connecting mobile to a wireless router?We have been given password to connect to wi-fi on our PC (connecting through wireless router) but the same password doesn't work on mobiles. What might be the problem behind this? Thanks in Advance for your help!
As told by Usman, the Router might be configured to allow only a restricted mac addresses to log in. Also since the question lacks details, the wifi security authentication and encryption protocols should be compatible with the mobile device. It might help asking the system admin of the place how do they manage to firewall mobile phones but allow PCs. Thanks for the A2A.    Embed Quote
