★What is the most recommended way to set up 2+ wireless routers at home?One router is not enough to provide a strong signal throughout the entire house. Should I use one as a repeater? Two different SSID's? Something else? The goal is not to have to modify any settings when moving around the house - the devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops) should automatically connect to the router with the best signal.
WDS is the typical route. However it is non-standard and difficult to set up. None the less read on here: http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/w... I submit for your consideration: 2 identical routers, I heard good things about the Cisco 4200 as an example. One acting as a full router connected to your ISP (your main router) the other configured as an AP hard wired back to the main router. Both will have the same SSID and security settings. If you can't run cat5 between each, you may be able to do Ethernet over power between the main router and the AP. However for my self personally in a large home I would go with an enterprise based system with LWAPs connected to a POE switch and a controller all from Cisco or Meraki.    Embed Quote
