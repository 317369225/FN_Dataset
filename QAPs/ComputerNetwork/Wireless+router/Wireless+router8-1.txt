★What's the optimal placement for a wireless router?Mostly interested for home use. Should it be on the floor? On the ceiling? What materials will disrupt the signal? I know all routers are likely somewhat different, and am looking for some general advice.
One important factor to consider when you place an AP at high population density places like home or small office is the human body. Human body consist 70% of water so it is a huge water bag and we know water absorb electromagnetic. Therefore, when the Wi-Fi pass through human bodies, the signal will get weaker and weaker. We should place the AP in a place that avoid human body and other obstacles as much as possible between AP and Wi-Fi clients. For example, ceiling is usually one of the best places.    Embed Quote
