★What's the best wireless router for a single family home?By "best" I mean coverage.
It all depends on your needs, tech skills (or your desire to config/play around) and your budget. You can get decent ones ranging for $20 to a few hundred dollars. If you have a fairly small budget, get  TP-LINK TL-WR841N Wireless N300for 20 bucks. It works great for most purposes and is very reliable. If you want one with a little better functionality, configurability and some bells and whistles, I would go with  ASUS RT-AC66U Dual-Band Wireless-AC1750 Gigabit Router. It is an awesome router.
