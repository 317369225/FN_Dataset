★What's the steps to change the password of a wireless router?I have forgotten my password of wireless router,how can i regenerate a new one?
If you do not know the password to access your WiFi router, you need to manually reset it. Look out for small reset button on your router (usually on the back and close to AC Adapter port) and hold it for about 10 seconds. Note: You would need a pen or something to press this button. Once you have done that, you need the default password and username to access admin area of your router. If this info is not displayed somewhere on your router, you would need to find the one by yourself. However, it is easy to find default username and password combination for your router. It is usually admin - for both, username and password. If you don't know the IP address of your router admin area, go to your Windows Command Prompt utility (or CMD) and type the following command and press Enter: ipconfig This will bring up some information for network devices on your computer. What are we looking here is the Default Gateway info: Use the IP address from this line (marked in yellow) to access web administration area of your own router. When you successfully login, you should search to find an option to change your wifi connection password and probably to change the name of it (SSID).    Embed Quote
