★What's the optimal placement for a wireless router?Mostly interested for home use. Should it be on the floor? On the ceiling? What materials will disrupt the signal? I know all routers are likely somewhat different, and am looking for some general advice.
The optimal location for a single residential WiFi Access Point depends on the geometry of the home, particularly the number of levels, but in general a central location will tend to work best since it minimizes the average distance the signal must travel.   The radio signal will be attenuated by anything that blocks the 'line of sight' between the AP and the client devices; this attenuation will be more significant in the case of large dense objects and particularly significant in the case of large metallic objects such as major appliances and mirrors.  Typically a higher AP placement within a room will result in better signal propagation due to less nearby 'clutter' along the propagation paths.    Embed Quote
