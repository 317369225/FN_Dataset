★Why might wireless routers slow down internet speeds?I have a WNDR3700 Gigabit router at home. My download speeds on a Comcast cable modem internet does not exceed 10 MBPS ( Using the Cnet bandwidth meter). COmacst usually advertises over 20 MBPS at home. Anyone else facing this issue?
Additionally, firewalls, NAT and other fancy stuff implemented on those boxes add some latency to the traffic. In some cases, a security feature may actually be the cause of slow down because it is "overacting" to false positives.    Embed Quote
