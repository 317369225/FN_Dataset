★What is the most recommended way to set up 2+ wireless routers at home?One router is not enough to provide a strong signal throughout the entire house. Should I use one as a repeater? Two different SSID's? Something else? The goal is not to have to modify any settings when moving around the house - the devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops) should automatically connect to the router with the best signal.
I'm with Philipp M. W. Hoffmann - I just went Apple w/ this, tho I do not have a Time Capsule. I have a Linksys Wifi router, and I have 2 Airport Express that I set to Join Existing Network. Once connects via wifi (aka Extends) the other is via Ethernet. It's fast and painless, perhaps not uber-geek-optimal but more then god enough. One note is to make sure you devices are using the same band (n, g, etc.)    Embed Quote
