★What are some of the most secure and affordable wireless routers?I have a Cisco/Linksys AE2500. Everything in DD-WRT is setup for maximum security, including a 63-character WPA2 password. I have been the target of harassment in the past, and have been hacked, despite the aforementioned security measures. Is the following merely marketing: Blackbox Security If no, any cheaper alternatives?
The electronic device you maintain will be your best choice. Being able to install an alternative firmware is a big help and indicates you and others care about understanding that device. I have observed hacked routers and it happens but I find usually the weakest link is the user, their password habits, and willingness to install crapware. Search for good password strategies. Don't run as administrator. Don't install something just because it's shiny and new. The Backbox device seems to boast about it's security in a way that misses the points I most often care about. Maybe it could be good hardware VPN solution if you feel you cannot trust your ISP or were traveling abroad. Personally, I'm biased towards quiet confidence over loud attention getting behaviors.    Embed Quote
