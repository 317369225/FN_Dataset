★How could I turn my slightly old PC into a wireless router/NAS//VPN/homeserver?
Assuming you have wireless network card in it probably the first port of call if you want to do it on the free is to get FreeNAS http://www.freenas.org/ this should be able to turn your machine into a NAS. If you want something a little more special, for example, FileServer, VPN, Web Server, Email Server, Proxy Server again for free try ClearOS http://www.clearfoundation.com/ These should do the trick, and from what I remember once installed and set up you do all the administration through a web page so you dont even need a monitor/keyboard/mouse once running.    Embed Quote
