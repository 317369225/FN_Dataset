★What is the most important component for maximum wireless router range?Other than line of sight. Ie. Antenna decibel, a/b/g/n/ac generation, dual band, beam forming, number of antennas, etc
For the wireless router self, you can switch the channel to avoid the signal conflict lost ratio due to other wireless network nearby, because if on the same channel, multiple networks signal may result the inconsistence of the data traffic. To strengthen your range, you may use the iron pad closed to your router atenna to get better sigal. But definitely 2.4G range is larger than 5G Wi-Fi regard to the same host.    Embed Quote
