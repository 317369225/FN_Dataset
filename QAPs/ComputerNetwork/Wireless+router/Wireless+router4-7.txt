★What is the most recommended way to set up 2+ wireless routers at home?One router is not enough to provide a strong signal throughout the entire house. Should I use one as a repeater? Two different SSID's? Something else? The goal is not to have to modify any settings when moving around the house - the devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops) should automatically connect to the router with the best signal.
Use Meraki's routers.  They were designed to precisely solve this problem! These routers self-organize and create a wireless mesh that helps to extend the  range to previously inaccessible parts of your home.  Only one of routers is connected to ethernet, while the remaining ones "talk" to this main router. The secondary routers will send your packets to the main router, which will forward it to the public internet. The SSID remains the same across all the routers and a user will not notice the presence of multiple routers. Meraki also provides a convenient dashboard to help you in placing multiple routers in your home to extend the range. I have not personally used these routers, but I've heard other users rave about its performance, ease of setup, intuitive GUI.  And Cisco just bought the company for $ 1.2B, so you can be assured of the performance. :) [Edit: I do not know the costs for setting up Meraki's routers. They are popular in enterprises, but I do not know if the costs justify deployment at home.]    Embed Quote
