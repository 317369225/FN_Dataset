★What causes a low wireless signal when the device is near the wireless router?I have a laptop with Windows 8 and b/g/n wireless. When I plug the internet cable directly to the laptop I get the speed specified in the contract, which is 200 Mbps, but when I use the internet in wireless mode I get around 30 Mbps at the most even if the laptop is exactly near the router. I use a wireless router Edimax BR-6208AC Dual-Band.
When looking at speed issues, I first consider the equipment you have. #1 "The Edimax BR-6208AC router supports the next generation IEEE 802.11ac wireless standard, meaning higher data rates in the 5GHz band. With 300Mbps speeds in the 2.4GHz band and 433Mbps speeds in 5GHz" Ok. You have an 802.11ac access point. What about your wireless NIC card ? #2 "windows 8 laptop with b/g/n support" So, you may have an 802.11ac access point, but your laptop will never make use of it. 802.11 b/g/n all use the 2.4Ghz band, while 802.11ac makes use of 5ghz only. Never mind, your access point States it can support 300mbps at 802.11n .. Yes it can, as long as the wireless NIC card can also support that. I'm going to guess it can't As such the best performance you're going to have us likely to be 150mbps. I'm going to make another assumption. Your securing your connection, right? 150mbps performance is absolutely maximum theoretical performance. Remember ethernet is made up of frames containing headers, so you can normally remove about 10% straight away for overhead. You're encrypting your traffic. Take another 10% for additional overhead. Finally wireless unlike wired is a shared medium. It does not send and receive at the same time. Further if you have more than one user on your access point you're sharing that bandwidth with them 30Mbps performance ? That's not so bad after all that ... How do you fix it? Check your wireless NIC card. Does it support multiple spatial streams? Can you afford to replace the card with one that supports 802.11ac ? If not, don't bother yet .... Wait until the vendors start delivering 802.11ac wave two products in late 2015    Embed Quote
