★What are some of the most secure & "elite" wireless routers?
Any firewall is only going to be as useful as its configuration.  In general, any enterprise grade router/firewall appliance should be more than adequate for your home needs, unless you have incredibly unusual requirements. UTM ("Unified Threat Management") Firewalls will also provide additional security functions, such as gateway antivirus, gateway anti-spam, content filtering, and more. I'd recommend a basic Sonicwall device for you to start playing with.  The TZ105 (TZ105W for built-in 2.4Ghz WiFi) is within your price range, has a straightforward learning curve, and is a rock solid device for your purposes.  The really nice thing is, like Mikrotik and most other UTM firewall software, all of Sonicwall devices use the same OS.  You can upgrade to a higher level device in the future without learning an entirely new GUI. If you're serious about WiFi or have a large home, consider using external access points.  Generally, only low-end enterprise grade firewalls include WiFi, and it's often an after-thought add-on.    Embed Quote
