★What is the most recommended way to set up 2+ wireless routers at home?One router is not enough to provide a strong signal throughout the entire house. Should I use one as a repeater? Two different SSID's? Something else? The goal is not to have to modify any settings when moving around the house - the devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops) should automatically connect to the router with the best signal.
I never managed to set this up with regular routers. Mostly because these random routers don't have repeater capabilities. When I moved in with my girl-friend we got a Time Capsule (for use with Time Machine, Apples backup software) which is also a good router. Then I also got some Airport Express for my sound systems in some rooms. These work also as a repeater of the "base-wifi"-signal. With this set up you can walk around really good without ever loosing signal or waiting for re-connects. This is a bit more expensive to set up. But if you have a Mac and are looking for a good backup-solution AND want very good Wifi, then consider this solution.    Embed Quote
