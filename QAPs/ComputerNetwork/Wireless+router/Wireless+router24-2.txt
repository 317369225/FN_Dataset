★Why will a wireless router change on its own?
So many things could go wrong! - your particular mix of traffic may be an issue for the hardware or software in the router - a software bug,  or hardware that is near its limits (too little ram,  too weak a cpu)  can cause extreme performance drop or even a crash.  This is quite likely your problem if the problems are somewhat periodic,  or follow periods of high demand. Also indicative would be that the router just entirely stops working while wireless signal remains strong. - much more than you think,  especially if you live near many other people is that so many things are interfering with your wireless network: other wireless routers competing to talk on the same 3 channels (there are really only THREE usable channels in typical use!  Doesn't sound good for how common wireless is,  does it?).  Next,  the slew of other devices in the same frequency band: Bluetooth devices,  cordless phones,  baby monitors,  ***Microwave ovens*** (!!!) and finally: living things,  and everything liquid or metallic.  Human beings,  being made primarily of water are gigantic chaotic radio reflectors.  Other large collections of liquid and metal objects in homes bounce waves around,  though these are stationary and more predictable.  Human beings moving around cause unpredictable problems for wifi - your router is most likely constantly hopping between the same 3 channels trying to get the least crowded channel.....  At the same time as any neighboring routers do the same thing.  And when lots of wireless routers try to do this,  it seems to be my experience that they do so very poorly,  even when less than 5 routers are in range of each other.  Forget two dozen as one might find in an apartment complex - that becomes utter chaos.    Embed Quote
