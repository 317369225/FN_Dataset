★Why do I always have to reset my wireless router, and what can I do to stop it?
An often overlooked problem is an old, faulty line filter. A lot of people will replace their router when things start going haywire, and the new one fixes everything confirming their suspicions. However, when you buy a new router-modem, you typically get a new line filter which is also replaced. The line filter is basically there to ensure that phone calls don't interrupt your ADSL connection which is transmitted over the same phone lines. They can, however, deteriorate faster than your router-modem, causing problems like dropped connections. If you find that your router is going down around the same time every day—say, around 6pm when telemarketers like to call—it could be your line filter, which is a quick, cheap fix.    Embed Quote
