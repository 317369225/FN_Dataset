★Is there any wireless router which is impossible to hack?
No security professional in the world will declare any device "impossible" to hack. However, if you mean, "are there any wireless devices that have a reasonable chance of surviving well known attacks?" the answer is, "of course!" Any modern wireless router supporting WPA2 encryption provides reasonable protection against adversaries intercepting data. Any router vendor which provides frequent firmware updates exhibits some security consciousness. For consumers, I would recommend any modern wireless router running DD-WRT, since the firmware is maintained by an active community and not just the vendor. For business, I would employ a larger company like Aruba, Ruckus, or Cisco.  The commercial grade devices are more expensive but have a lot more security hardening by design. And remember: Even the most secure doors are useless if they are left open.  As a user, you need to employ strong administrative processes to set policies and audit usage.  Security doesn't just happen, it's a process and investment.    Embed Quote
