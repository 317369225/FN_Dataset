★How do I get a better signal from my wireless router?
Get a better router. If that's not enough, get repeaters. I have my operator's access point. It's good enough for my environment, but at the opposite corner of the apartment the iPhone 3GS had poor signal. So I bought a cheap tp-link and got signal everywhere. Because the lack of signal on that corner is only a problem if I'm trying to get the kid to "relax" on the bed, I've switched it around, the Thompson still as master, and the TPLink as a repeater (it works as AP, client and repeater). Do this way we just need to plug it into the wall when we're on that bedroom. Then I bought a time capsule. Not only it now covers the whole apparent, even the other opposite corner where I don't need network, but 802.11n devices are now properly using the promised speed, and 5ghz devices take full advantage of the 450Mbps, as all my (lot) of neighbours are still with operator's access points and all polluting the whole 2.4ghz. So, get a better router. A good brand. A good brand with well designed internal antennas (apple and TPLink in my case), or something with external antennas. If the distance or the obstacles are unavoidable, the repeaters works wonderfully. If your devices work at 5Ghz, move there. If not, scan your neighbours and see which channel is less congested - 1, 6 or 11 - and set it manually.    Embed Quote
