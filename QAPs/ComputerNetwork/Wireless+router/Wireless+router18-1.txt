★What is the highest bandwidth/throughput wireless router?Just got a beautiful fiber optic connection right into my home with a capacity of 100Mb/s upload and download, I need a Wifi access point (with router incl. if possible) in order to use all my portable/mobile devices in my home which is spread over 3 floors of concrete. Any recommendation as to the best device to make use of the super fast wired speed please? Price is irrelevant.
I'd say you should look into a strong gateway router and a wireless repeater. I'd recommended a DD-WRT Linksys E4200 (https://www.flashrouters.com/cis...) and an E1000 (https://www.flashrouters.com/cis...) set up as a repeater. That combination along with proper placement of the routers should do a good job. Having them as DD-WRT based devices allows you to boost the antenna signals as well as configure the repeater mode much more simply. I believe FlashRouters will also set up the E1000 as a repeater for free with your main router so that they work right out of the box. The best thing about the wireless repeater is that it is wireless so it can be plugged in anywhere within range of the main router and capture and rebroadcast the main strong signal you currently have. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
