★What's the best wireless router to use in an office resembling a cave?Our office is about 3000sqr feet and has loads of pillars and stuff and generally resembles a cave; hence, not an optimium environment for wifi. What's an amazing router that could cover the whole office from one corner of it?
I'd take a look at some consumer models upgraded with DD-WRT to boost range and stability. Something like the Linksys Cisco E4200 (https://www.flashrouters.com/cis...) or the Netgear WNDR4000 with a couple of secured Wireless repeaters/client bridges like E3000 or E1000. One powerful wireless gateway and 2-3 more APs should do the trick.    Embed Quote
