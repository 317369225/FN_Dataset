★What's the steps to change the password of a wireless router?I have forgotten my password of wireless router,how can i regenerate a new one?
Before trying the steps below, jump to step 3 to check if you can access the router's admin page using default access details without requiring a reset 1. You will need to "hard reset" your router. This will reset the router to factory configuration and erase all your router configuration settings, username/password and network access keys that you might have defined. The location of hard reset switch varies by model, but it always resembles a pinhole or a tiny button: 2. Switch on power to the router, and depress the reset using a paperclip for about 30s. The router will restart with default configuration. 3. Let the router restart and connect to its network from your computer. Now you will need to set up a new network name, password, key etc. For this, flip over the router to find the default access details: If you are unable to find the details printed on the router, you can search it online quite easily. Enter the URL given under default access in your browser's address bar (sometimes there is no URL, but an address like 192.168.0.0, 192.168.0.1, etc). You will be led to the router's admin page, where you can login with the given username/password (this is almost always admin/password or admin/admin) and you can configure the router as you wish.    Embed Quote
