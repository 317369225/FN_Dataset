★Where does my wireless router and wireless network belong in the electromagnetic spectrum?
Most WiFi is 2.4GHz Increasingly it might be 5.xGHz for .11n or .11ac That is more than FM radio (90-100MHz), more than TV (400-800MHz), more / similar to cellular (900MHz to 2.6GHz in various chunks) (the exact allocation can vary with country) It is a lot less than infra-red (300 GHz to 400 THz) or visible light (400 THz to 800 THz)    Embed Quote
