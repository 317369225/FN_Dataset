★How can i connect to bsnl broadband internet with belkin basic N150 wireless router?
Belkin N150 is an Ethernet(RJ45 port) router, while BSNL provides ADSL(RJ11 port) internet connection. The router that BSNL provides is ADSL Router. So in order to use the Belkin N150 either one of the two conditions have to be satisfied: 1. BSNL should provide you with an Ethernet internet connection rather than ADSL connection (like Reliance). OR 2. Your WiFi router should be an ADSL Router. Like D-Link DSL-2730U. Since you have neither you cannot use Belkin N150 with BSNL broadband. However there are RJ11 to RJ45 converters in the market (Example : Telephone RJ11 Male to 8 Pin RJ45 Male Plug Cable 1.7M) which you can try. Since I have never tried it, I am not sure if this converter will get the job done.    Embed Quote
