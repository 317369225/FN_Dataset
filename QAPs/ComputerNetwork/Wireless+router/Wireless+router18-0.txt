★What is the highest bandwidth/throughput wireless router?Just got a beautiful fiber optic connection right into my home with a capacity of 100Mb/s upload and download, I need a Wifi access point (with router incl. if possible) in order to use all my portable/mobile devices in my home which is spread over 3 floors of concrete. Any recommendation as to the best device to make use of the super fast wired speed please? Price is irrelevant.
I can relate to your question because my abode is the same as yours, 3.5 stories (concrete structure) and a large floor area (5,500 sq feet per floor), and I rely on the following solution: Core Router/Wifi - Apple Time Machine, you can opt for the Apple AirPort Extreme (http://www.apple.com/airportextr...) and it supports the 802.11n To connect the different floors, I use... D-Link Powerline AV 500 Adapter, which basically uses the electrical wiring in your house for high-speed Ethernet. Simple plug the powerline adapter in the electrical socket and you're good to go (See: http://www.dlink.com/products/?p...) and to further distribute the signal on each floor, I use... Airport Express (See http://www.apple.com/airportexpr...) and Ruckus Wireless (Zoneflex - Indoor) - See http://www.ruckuswireless.com/pr.... Though the solutions are expensive, they are well worth the price. No more dead spots or grey spots, excellent strong signal coverage and very reliable equipment. Whilst others opt for Cisco and Linksys and the equivalent, kind, the combination above has really helped me all along. To properly map the wifi in my house, I used the following two tools (free): Meraki Wifi Stumbler - http://meraki.com/products/wirel...
