★What is the best model wireless router for my apartment?I have a 300 Mbps cable connection in an apartment with lots of other visible wireless networks. There are two laptops, a desktop, a tablet, apple TV, PS3, printer, and several cell phones all sharing the connection.
You can go for any of the Linksys wireless routers which support dual band (2.4 and 4 GHz).    Embed Quote
