★Why is there problem in connecting mobile to a wireless router?We have been given password to connect to wi-fi on our PC (connecting through wireless router) but the same password doesn't work on mobiles. What might be the problem behind this? Thanks in Advance for your help!
Thank you for the Ask to Answer! Allow me to recap what I could understand: - You were given the usernames and passwords, BUT not the PCs yet. - Those PCs WILL be used to connect to the Internet, and to do your assignments, etc. - When you try to use the same Username & Password, it fails to connect your mobile to your Wireless Router OR When you try to use the same Username & Password, it connects to your Wireless Router but fails to connect you to the Internet. What might be happening is that your PC may be configured in the WHITE-LIST table, which allows only your designated PCs to connect, while making sure that other devices do not connect to the Wireless Router. MAC Address filtering is commonly used to configure a Router to make sure that only devices with a designated MAC address, can only access either the Internet, or connect to a router. This strategy is commonly used and deployed to make sure that unauthorized devices do not connect to the device; either for security purposes, or just to keep the bandwidth under control. I also use the same strategy in my office too. I am ready to help in the comments section, if you think that either wasn't clear enough in my answer, or if I need to elaborate something, and I'll edit the answer to suit your needs.    Embed Quote
