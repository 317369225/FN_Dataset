★How do I use my iPhone as a wireless router?I don't exactly understand the hotspot thing. We went with the hotspot plan from AT&T cause we thought it be easier to broadcast games & remotes. But don't you have to have a wireless connection to connect to? I'm an idiot & I need someone to explain how I can use it like I m a 5 year old.
On a jailbroken phone, you can buy (or get a free copy [read on]) a program called TetherMe. I would not recommend PDANet, as it limits ports, preventing FTP and other functionality even on the full version. There is even a free copy of TetherMe on http://apt.xsellize.com (sshhhhhhhhh, don't tell the po-po). Trust me, this is a superior program.    Embed Quote
