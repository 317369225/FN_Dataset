★How do I use my iPhone as a wireless router?I don't exactly understand the hotspot thing. We went with the hotspot plan from AT&T cause we thought it be easier to broadcast games & remotes. But don't you have to have a wireless connection to connect to? I'm an idiot & I need someone to explain how I can use it like I m a 5 year old.
Turn on the Wireless Hotspot feature. This is in Settings/General/Network    Embed Quote
