★Why might wireless routers slow down internet speeds?I have a WNDR3700 Gigabit router at home. My download speeds on a Comcast cable modem internet does not exceed 10 MBPS ( Using the Cnet bandwidth meter). COmacst usually advertises over 20 MBPS at home. Anyone else facing this issue?
The first question is what is your wired performance through that router?  That would be your baseline that you should compare to.  If your WiFi speeds are significantly less than that, it's entirely possible that you have an older laptop that can't drive 802.11n, or you have poor signal strength or interference. WiFi is not nearly as deterministic as you might imagine.  You can kill your download performance by reheating your dinner in the microwave.    Embed Quote
