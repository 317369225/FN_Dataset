â˜…What is the typical range of a wireless router?Obviously it varies, but what is the median or average?
It depends on a few factors--the protocol, the power, the frequency, interference, etcand antenna type/gain.. With most wireless switches Acess Points these days, it's using 802.11b, g, or n. The b and g varieties have a typical usable range from 100 to 200 ft (30 to 60m) in the open. The n variety can be up to 400 ft (that's about 130m). However, in an indoor environment, that can be cut in half, or more. With an urban environment with lots of interference (other wifi, microwaves), it can be cut down even more. In line of sight applications you can go many KM using the right antennas and equipment.
