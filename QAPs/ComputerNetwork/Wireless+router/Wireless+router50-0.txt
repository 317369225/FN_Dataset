★How do I get a better signal from my wireless router?
You have many options: 1. You can buy a repeater and install it by plugging it in one of the electricity sockets. It will amplify the signal and you will get higher power. 2. You can Log-in to your router and check if the power is set to maximum. I don't know what is the type of your router but you can easily know its maximum radiated power and check if it is configured to be on max power. 3. You can try to move it or move the antenna, that might work because of the position of the antenna and its polarization. I can only think of these options for the mean time, hope it works...    Embed Quote
