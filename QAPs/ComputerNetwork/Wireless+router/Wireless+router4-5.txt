★What is the most recommended way to set up 2+ wireless routers at home?One router is not enough to provide a strong signal throughout the entire house. Should I use one as a repeater? Two different SSID's? Something else? The goal is not to have to modify any settings when moving around the house - the devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops) should automatically connect to the router with the best signal.
Pretty simple... scan you area for what WiFi channels are currently active. Manually setup each router to a different channel, as far as apart numerically as is possible. Assign a different SSID to each so you know which one you are hooked up to. And then depending on where you spend most of your time, make the highest signal your preferred router (you can do this in both Win and OS X). You may have to manually disconnect that AP and reassociate to the other router when you move closer to that other router, since I don't find Windows or OS X doing that automatically. Just changing SSIDs and keeping all the APs on the same channel may reduce overall network capacity due to each AP's radio stepping on each other. Please note that for in 2.4GHz space, while you have Ch 1-11, they all overlap such that only 1, 5 and 11 are more or less separate RF channels. 11n in 5GHz space added more channels, but I am not up to date on the spacing and overlap of those channels.    Embed Quote
