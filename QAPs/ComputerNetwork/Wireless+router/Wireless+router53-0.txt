★What is the best way to extend the reach of a wireless router at home?I'd rather setup some sort of antenna as opposed to repeaters.
The first thing to do is to ensure that you've placed your router optimally. You want it centrally located within the space that you want to cover, and preferably up as high as possible. On the ceiling is good. Things that interfere with signal: Metal: metal doors, chimneys, stucco walls (chicken wire), pipes, wires, rebar, appliances. Thick walls: plaster, brick, cinder block, concrete. Microwave ovens Water: plant leaves, animals, hot water heaters You want to pick a channel that is not commonly used. Use a wireless analysis application to look and see what channels your neighbors are using. In the US, there are only three that don't cause bleed-through: 1, 6, and 11. If this still doesn't give you the coverage you want, my recommendation is to run a wire and use a second box as a pure AP. Many houses already have SOME wiring available or some way that you can run your own Ethernet. Wiring just one device can easily double the range of your Wi-Fi.    Embed Quote
