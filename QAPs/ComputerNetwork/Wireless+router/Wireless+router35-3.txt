★What are some of the most secure & "elite" wireless routers?
I would go with a mikrotik device. I don't know if they have Wi-Fi ac yet, but if they do or you don't mind having only 2.4 ghz network, it has everything a high end router has. You can configure QoS, VPN, dynamic routing protocols including BGP, firewall, IPv6, scripts, different network security profiles and most important of all, you can play the super Mario bros theme song out of beeps and impress all the girls on your neighborhood. I got mine for 79$. There are more fancy models since you have a larger budget, but they all have the same functions in the same OS, the difference being antennas, radios and processing power.
