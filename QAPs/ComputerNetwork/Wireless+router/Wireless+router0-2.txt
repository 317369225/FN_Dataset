★How do I use my iPhone as a wireless router?I don't exactly understand the hotspot thing. We went with the hotspot plan from AT&T cause we thought it be easier to broadcast games & remotes. But don't you have to have a wireless connection to connect to? I'm an idiot & I need someone to explain how I can use it like I m a 5 year old.
Non-jailbreak Route: Buy a hotspot from your provide (AT&T, Verizon). It should cost about $20 per month. Jailbreak Route: After jailbreaking your phone, go into Cydia and pay for an app called PDANet. This will allow you to create a Wifi hot-spot directly from your iPhone. It works great and will also allow you to add a password to your wireless connection. This option costs $20 TOTAL (which is why most people would jailbreak and then tether rather than paying $20/month).    Embed Quote
