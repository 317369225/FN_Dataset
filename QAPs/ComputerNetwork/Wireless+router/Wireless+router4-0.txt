★What is the most recommended way to set up 2+ wireless routers at home?One router is not enough to provide a strong signal throughout the entire house. Should I use one as a repeater? Two different SSID's? Something else? The goal is not to have to modify any settings when moving around the house - the devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops) should automatically connect to the router with the best signal.
As of current supported standards, assuming your actual bandwidth is not more than half of your router's supported bandwidth AND you're not that concerned with data transfers over the network over wifi when connected to different routers, your best bet is to set up one as a repeater. If your routers support it and you're adventurous, I might suggest going with the open-source DD-WRT router OS to manage your routers. It'll let you configure whatever parameters you might want to tweak.    Embed Quote
