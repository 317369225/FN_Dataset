★How do I use my iPhone as a wireless router?I don't exactly understand the hotspot thing. We went with the hotspot plan from AT&T cause we thought it be easier to broadcast games & remotes. But don't you have to have a wireless connection to connect to? I'm an idiot & I need someone to explain how I can use it like I m a 5 year old.
a jailbreak app that allows you to both tether your iPhone AND create a Wifi Hotspot so you can share your Internet connection with computers around you.    Embed Quote
