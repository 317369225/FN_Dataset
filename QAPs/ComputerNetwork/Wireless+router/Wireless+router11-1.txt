★What's the best wireless router to use in an office resembling a cave?Our office is about 3000sqr feet and has loads of pillars and stuff and generally resembles a cave; hence, not an optimium environment for wifi. What's an amazing router that could cover the whole office from one corner of it?
I have had great success with the Cisco WAP4410N. http://www.cisco.com/cisco/web/s... However, it is a wireless access point not a router, per se. We have them connected to switches and the switches are connected to the router/firewall. We use a separate DHCP server but it can provide that service. If you secure it by specifying MAC addresses you are limited to 20 devices.    Embed Quote
