★What is the best model wireless router for my apartment?I have a 300 Mbps cable connection in an apartment with lots of other visible wireless networks. There are two laptops, a desktop, a tablet, apple TV, PS3, printer, and several cell phones all sharing the connection.
Your question isn't that simple to answer. Do you want all your devices to be connected wirelessly? If so, if you want the highest transfer rates then go with a wireless AC router, but you devices have to support connecting to an AC client. I can't tell you what specific model is the best, because I haven't researched many AC routers in a while. I personally like Buffalo routers with DD-WRT, because DD-WRT gives me a lot more flexibility in what I need to do. As far as the other guy saying that you need a special router for handling cell phones... I never heard that before. Every phone and router will meet a wireless standard and be able to connect to the standard it was designed to. I have no idea why he says you need QoS for cell phones. QoS limits the amount of bandwidth a device has access to. So device 1 isn't capable of using all the bandwidth at once, leaving the other devices with no available bandwidth. I doubt even wireless AC is capable of transferring 300MBPS, so will always be bandwidth available. Plus you have to take into account the write limits of any of the hardware you're downloading to.    Embed Quote
