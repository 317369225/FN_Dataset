★What's the best wireless router to use in an office resembling a cave?Our office is about 3000sqr feet and has loads of pillars and stuff and generally resembles a cave; hence, not an optimium environment for wifi. What's an amazing router that could cover the whole office from one corner of it?
I pretty much have a cave like home office. If I were you, I would get  ASUS RT-AC66U Dual-Band Wireless-AC1750 Gigabit Router. Read review: The Best Home Wireless Router - What Rocks and What Sucks?    Embed Quote
