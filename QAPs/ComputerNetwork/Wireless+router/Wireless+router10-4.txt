★What is the best model wireless router for my apartment?I have a 300 Mbps cable connection in an apartment with lots of other visible wireless networks. There are two laptops, a desktop, a tablet, apple TV, PS3, printer, and several cell phones all sharing the connection.
#. Go for NETGEAR or TP-LINK. Both are cheap in price and also durable. #. The choice of router depends upon the effective area for the WiFi, you want. Choose the high or low power router, accordingly.    Embed Quote
