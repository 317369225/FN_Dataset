★What are some of the most secure & "elite" wireless routers?
Although there are some routers that have more/many security features and are better than others in terms of security.  I'm thinking (Based on your wage) maybe 2 hours spent, might blow you away with what a budget router can do. Almost all routers of any expense will not broadcast your ssid, block ports, MAC Access. A lot of these things I could potentially get around but It would add hour/hours to breaking into your network. If I were to get into your network would it be worth me spending that time to break in? Odds are if I had the skill, desire and time I would be driving down to Oracle/Sony, or some other larger target that could make my time/skills much more worthwhile. Also when it comes to networks in a residential neighborhood, I am going to be looking for a target that is easy. If your network is more difficult to break into than your neighbors, I'm gonna leave you alone. Unless I am specifically targeting you, If so you need to enact those security features. Also If I break into your network is what you have worth spending the extra time learning about security features?    Embed Quote
