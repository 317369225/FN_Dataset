★What is the difference between a wireless router and a wireless range extender?
-->A wireless router leases the IP addresses to its LAN network clients and it also act as a NAT device to provide internet accessibility to its LAN network devices. -->A wireless range extender acts as a bridge which forwards its connected devices requests directly to the router. Wireless range extender does not provide internet accessibility and it needs router device to do that. Wireless extender just extends wireless range of any router as well as it does not lease any IP  address.    Embed Quote
