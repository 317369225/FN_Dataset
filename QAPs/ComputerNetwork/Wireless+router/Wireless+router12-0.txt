★Which wireless router to buy for home?
Most major manufacturers can meet these specs. I tend to use Netgear, mainly because I hate going out and doing careful comparison shopping when I've found a reliable brand. The Belkin should be more than adequate in your situation. A few observations: With a DSL telephone line connection, which I assume is around 750K, the router is not your limiting factor; all of them are capable of broadcasting data faster than the WAN is capable of delivering it. Streaming/downloading large files will not be optimal because of this. For the ethernet legs (modem to router, router to desktop), be sure you have two good cables that you know work. Even new cables can be defective. Depending on distance, orientation and building construction, reception may not be satisfactory in all parts of the house. You might need a second wifi router to act as a repeater.  I had good luck with Netgear with this.    Embed Quote
