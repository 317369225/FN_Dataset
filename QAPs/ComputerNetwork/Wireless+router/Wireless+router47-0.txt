★What's the best way to track the performance and activity of my wireless router?I'm looking for a website or program (Mac) that will easily show me in real time how many computers are connected to my wireless router, how much data each is consuming, and how well it's performing.
Unfortunately, this isn't something that can really be done by an external program. The closest you're going to get is http://www.wireshark.org/downloa... – which is a packet sniffing program that can be used to see all the network traffic. That's really a hack solution though. The best/right way to do this is software at the router-level. I work for a WiFi company that makes top-of-the-line software to do just what you're asking. If you like, you can check out the software here: https://account.meraki.com/login... (you'll have to create a free account.)    Embed Quote
