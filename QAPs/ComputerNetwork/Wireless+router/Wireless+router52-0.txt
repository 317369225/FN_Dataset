★How can we create a wireless router using an FPGA module in Verilog?
Interesting but vague. A normal wireless router is more than what can be built on a FPGA. You can surely create rtl module of routing algorithms but you will need to interface the FPGA with a standard wireless radio module/soc. A can easily find cheap wifi or bluetooth soc's in market which have spi (though its very slow speed but for a project it's fine) interface. e.g  search for electric imp, Open source IoT toolkit You have to receive/send the  tcp/ip packets by interfacing your FPGA to the wifi soc over spi. Now big task will to write rtl module for decoding and routing packets. I am sure it will challenge you very much. Because it not only involves writing rtl module but driving the wifi soc which usually requires a firmware in itself. Good Luck and keep the passion blazing!    Embed Quote
