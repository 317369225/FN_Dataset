★Is it possible to increase the range of a wireless router?
Reposition your router or access point (AP) to avoid obstructions and radio interference. Both reduce the range of Wi-Fi network equipment. Common sources of interference in residences include brick or plaster walls, microwave ovens, and cordless phones. Additionally, consider changing the Wi-Fi channel number on your equipment to avoid interference. CAMaster CNC Routers    Embed Quote
