★What causes a low wireless signal when the device is near the wireless router?I have a laptop with Windows 8 and b/g/n wireless. When I plug the internet cable directly to the laptop I get the speed specified in the contract, which is 200 Mbps, but when I use the internet in wireless mode I get around 30 Mbps at the most even if the laptop is exactly near the router. I use a wireless router Edimax BR-6208AC Dual-Band.
That's because of the RTS/CTS procedure that wifi uses (for collision avoidance); radios have to switch from transmit to receive several times for one burst of packets. And the wifi controller chips are made with power saving in mind, not performance.    Embed Quote
