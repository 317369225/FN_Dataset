★Which wireless router to buy for home?
It all depends on your needs, your tech expertise and your budget. If you have a fairly small budget, get  TP-LINK TL-WR841N Wireless N300for 20 bucks. It works great for most purposes and is very reliable. If you want one with a little better functionality, configurability and some bells and whistles, I would go with  ASUS RT-AC66U Dual-Band Wireless-AC1750 Gigabit Router. It is an awesome router.
