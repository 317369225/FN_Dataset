★What are some of the most secure and affordable wireless routers?I have a Cisco/Linksys AE2500. Everything in DD-WRT is setup for maximum security, including a 63-character WPA2 password. I have been the target of harassment in the past, and have been hacked, despite the aforementioned security measures. Is the following merely marketing: Blackbox Security If no, any cheaper alternatives?
I am very partial to the Linksys (Netgear) (Cisco) WRT54G -- it's getting a bit long in the tooth, now, but they are rock-solid and last for years.  Be advised there are, like, seven or eight different versions of this router (WRT54G v1, v1.1, v2, v3, WRT54GS, WRT54GL, it gets ridiculous) -- they're all very similar, but some of the older/middle models have more RAM, so look up the specs and buy accordingly.  I prefer models with the metal (not plastic) antenna-connectors, so I can unscrew the plastic ones and use my own +7 dBi extenders. Also:  as has been mentioned previously, the stock (out-of-box) firmware is probably not what you want to use.  DD-WRT on a WRT54G is a very good choice.  SVEASoft used to make a variant firmware for that router, but I'm not sure if their product is still in active development.  (Both DD-WRT and SVEA will support custom-boosting wireless signal strength, private VPN from your home router to <wherever>, and strong WPA2 authentication, even including a separate RADIUS server if you're especially paranoid.) Best of all, I got my last couple of WRT54s (I buy spares) for $20 apiece on eBay.  Good luck to you, whichever solution you end up going with.    Embed Quote
