★Do wireless routers pose a health risk?
Only when taken internally. Under no circumstances should you eat a wireless router, or attempt to use one while it is imbedded within your body. Also, if you drop one on your foot, it might hurt. Otherwise, no.  You won't get cancer or any other malady just by being near one (unless you get one made with cheap plastic with lead in it and you spend a lot of time licking it).    Embed Quote
