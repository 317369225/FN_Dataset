★How do I increase the signal strength of my wireless router?I've read on a basic Google search that placing aluminium foil behind the router helps. Is this true? Detailed suggestions please.
Yes it's true that placing a aluminium foil will increase the signal strength. Tear off some foil in the shape of a rectangle, give it a curve and then place the foil behind the antenna of your router. This will reflect the wireless signals into your preferred directions. Other methods include preventing or detecting the use of other devices which can interfere with the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequency.    Embed Quote
