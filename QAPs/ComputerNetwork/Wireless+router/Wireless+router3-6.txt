★What is the difference (if any) between a wireless access point and a wireless router?
A router in general is a layer 3 device (i.e can inspect Network/ IP layer packets)  that "routes" data between devices on the same network or to devices on the general internet. A wireless Access Point (AP) is a device that is able to receive and transmit wireless signals from multiple client devices (a.k.a stations) at the same time and "bridge" that traffic (i.e sen over another interface) to an ethernet or other interface. Put simply, it allows wireless client devices (phones, tablets, laptops etc) to "Access" the internet through it. A Wireless Router is a term used to describe a device that includes both of the above functionalities in one single device. I.e Wireless Access and Routing.    Embed Quote
