★What is the most recommended way to set up 2+ wireless routers at home?One router is not enough to provide a strong signal throughout the entire house. Should I use one as a repeater? Two different SSID's? Something else? The goal is not to have to modify any settings when moving around the house - the devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops) should automatically connect to the router with the best signal.
More than one wifi router? Hmm.. I guess i can help you here, yeah a lil bit! Have ever try puting a router near a mirror..? I guess no! Okay, i may sound not so usual here, but this is what i have done with my really low signal distributing wifi box! If your under a duplex apartment, there must be a staircase, and around that stair case there must be a window, and glass inside te frame right! Okay all you have to do is, put the wifi box in such a way that the glass reflect the signal back into your home, not over the wall or into washroom, but where you use it more, i.e. your study table, your couch, your bed etc! This trick helped me in saving $150 and plus on bills and cables!    Embed Quote
