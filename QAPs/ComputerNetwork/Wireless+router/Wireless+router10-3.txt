★What is the best model wireless router for my apartment?I have a 300 Mbps cable connection in an apartment with lots of other visible wireless networks. There are two laptops, a desktop, a tablet, apple TV, PS3, printer, and several cell phones all sharing the connection.
Do not listen to either of these answers. It is not that they are wrong, it is that the answers do not take intoconsideration tha fact that you need QOS for PHONES! You will choke any standard off the shelf router that cannot / is not capable of handling phones. Look into Netgear MBR1515, MV440 units, MBR95, and a WGT624 v3.    Embed Quote
