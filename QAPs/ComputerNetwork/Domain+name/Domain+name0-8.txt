★Which domain name is preferable for a personal domain name: RobDKelly.com or RobKelly.net?
Some variation of .com   Showing your middle initial can create identity theft problems.  RobKellyCalifornia.com  RobKellyAdvisor.com might also work for you. But go with RobDKelly.com  It will work. .com is the only thing people will look for, unless they KNOW you are .edu or .mil or  maybe .org, like Craigslist and slashdot. Remember how our grandparents had to walk uphill 5 miles in the snow to get to school ?      That's what you get when you don't have .com
