★How does a small investor invest in domain names?
With four letter coms, my experience from owning a few hundred and comparing with other portfolio holders: If you have a mixed portfolio with some lesser quality domains like vxuy.com And a few brandable ones like vusu.com or bido.com Then you can expect a sale rate of 1-3%  per year At a price between 3k and 5k, Which should finance your costs And leave room for <1% outlier sales at a higher Dollar amount. So you can see that such a model really makes only sense with at least several hundred names and a very low purchase price. Not the easiest setup for a small investor, but maybe doable. Your main job is to recognize the outlier sales, in order not to sell to cheap when the right buyer comes at the right time. You don't want to sell for a few thousand profit then, like I did for example with rdio.com :).
