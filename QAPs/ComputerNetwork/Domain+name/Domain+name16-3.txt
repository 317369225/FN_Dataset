★Are domain names trademarked?I'm getting confused. I mean for example: www.myowntrademark.xyz. Does the trademark apply to the "myowntrademark" or the "myowntrademark.xyz" or "www.myowntrademark.xyz"?
Actually, you’re the owner of a trademark if you’re the first to use it; this principle also applies to a domain name that functions as your trademark. Whether or not you’ve registered the name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (or not), you can stop someone else’s subsequent use of a similar mark on similar goods and service.
