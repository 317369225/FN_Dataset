â˜…If someone has a domain name, but has not trademarked it, can I trademark that domain name and then seize the domain name?
simply put it depends on the country in which the other person has the domain name. if your countries are different you can go ahead and trademark it. trademark also depends on the wares and services. so if your wares and services are different from those of the other persons you really dont need to seize the domain name through trademarks. where the domain name is already registered you can look at other spelling variations and extensions.
