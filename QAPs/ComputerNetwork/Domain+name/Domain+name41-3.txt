★Is it necessary to acquire every variant of a domain name?For example, if you are registering foo.com, is it necessary to acquire foo.net, foo.cx, getfoo.com, etc? Given the potential variants are endless, where does it make sense to draw the line?
I'd agree with Vanessa that you don't need all of them.  Even going a step further, I'd maybe even argue you only need the one you want.  Remember that when you eventually (I'm assuming you'll do this of course) SEO the heck out of whatever url you use, it will be the one that comes up for every search and will be the only one you need to be concerned about basically online.  There's worries by people that there could be sabotage against your business or other ill intents targeting your business, but frankly, google (or whatever smart search engine dominates) should ultimately show the url you end up focusing all your efforts to market your self/company. However, I haven't thought through all the sneaky things that could happen with the other variants.  The one thing I have realized though if you're worried about others "hurting you" via other means, you should think that 1) they have literally "way too much time on their hands" if they are going to do it, but 2) abuse usually is discovered and society typically helps us weed it out.
