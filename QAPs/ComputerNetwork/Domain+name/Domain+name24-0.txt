â˜…What's worse: a long domain name or one with a hyphen?For purposes of a personal blog, what are the relevant considerations in terms of SEO and user recall? E.g., (hyothetically) comparing dot-com domains for piano-lessons vs. pianolessonsbysandra (assuming pianolessons itself is taken). Is a hyphen the kiss of death?
I'd almost always opt for non-hyphenated before hyphens. They can and do rank well, but it's much, much harder to earn links, be taken seriously, earn good branding/brand recognition, publicize anywhere offline, etc. That said, you might try some alternative, creative ways of shortening a very lengthy domain name. For example, in your case, SandrasPianoLessons.com is slightly shorter; SandrasPiano.com or PianobySandra.com could work too.
