â˜…How do I register a domain name?
Go to name.com, select a domain and open an account, pay and it's yours (for the selected duration). Please note these common misconceptions: - "buying" a domain name actually means RENTING it. The domain is rented in your name in as much as an apartment is temporarily yours when you rent it. If you don't pay your rent or cancel renewal, someone else can move in. - don't use GoDaddy. For reasons why, google "godaddy controversy" or anything regarding GoDaddy. - renting a domain does not include hosting. If you need web space to host your site as well, you need a hosting provider too. Again, don't use GoDaddy. Hostgator and Name.com are excellent cheap hosts, I've had years of grand experience with both. For beginners, it's recommended you get your hosting with the same company you'll use to buy the domain - it's simpler that way.
