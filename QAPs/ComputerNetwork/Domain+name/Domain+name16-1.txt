â˜…Are domain names trademarked?I'm getting confused. I mean for example: www.myowntrademark.xyz. Does the trademark apply to the "myowntrademark" or the "myowntrademark.xyz" or "www.myowntrademark.xyz"?
.xyz cannot be trademarked. I can't trademark biography.com and then demand that the owning entity turn over the domain name to me.
