★Why do so many Chinese websites use numbers in their domain names?For example Chinese mail services 163.com and 126.com.
In addition to aforementioned reasons, numeric websites are favored in part to avoid the negative homophonic interpretations associated with western names.  For example, Facebook.com sounds like 非死不可.com ("no choice but to die").  This, of course, goes for any western branding, i.e., Chrysler = 快死了 ("about to die").
