â˜…Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
Instead of trying to buy a great domain, invest the money to build a great product. It doesn't matter how great your domain is, if you product sucks. What is more important at this point? Domain vs Product? Focus on one and be 10 times better than your competitors. Be so good, nobody can forget you.
