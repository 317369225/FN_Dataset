â˜…What are good ways to find a good domain name?
The best way to find a good domain name in 2014 is by looking at the expired domains on auctions. Normally a good domain would go to an auction and if no one buys it, it should be released free for registering. If the domain already has some traffic and someone left it behind, the registrar would normally parked it for displaying ads. Domains on auctions cost $59+ and the price vary depends on the quality of the domain. However you can get a good domain at a closeout price ($12 or less) I've created a video demonstrating my method on how to find a good domain at the closeout price from GoDaddy auctions.
