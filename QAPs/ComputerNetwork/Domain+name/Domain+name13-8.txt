★Why do so many Chinese websites use numbers in their domain names?For example Chinese mail services 163.com and 126.com.
Imagine if you and your whole community were native English speakers, but domain names were all written in Cyrillic. You might find yourself preferring a domain name like 123.com over, say, правда.ру. Even though the first domain name would be much less descriptive, it would probably be a lot easier for you to communicate quickly to others, which is essential for things like web addresses. So, Mark Rowswell's answer seems correct to me (in addition to the fact that he has tested it out). Roman letters may not only "feel foreign" – they may also be difficult or unfamiliar to pronounce for many Chinese speakers. Whereas to "spell out" numerals, you just use the (natively Chinese) words for those numbers.
