★How does a small investor invest in domain names?
Domain names are like real estates - location, location, location. The  name itself, the category of the name, the traffic it already has and  the traffic you are going to built on top will determine the future  value of the name. The days where you flip no PR, no traffic domain names for huge profit is mostly over, just like low end real estates. Of  course, from time to time, there are domain names no one think of  because the kind of business the name is associated with is not "hot"  yet. That is similar to betting on penny stocks going teens.
