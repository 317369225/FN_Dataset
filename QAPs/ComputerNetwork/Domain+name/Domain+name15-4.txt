â˜…Should I change my domain name?
If all SEO agencies are run by snake oil salesmen, then apparently I'm a snake oil salesman, so you may not trust my advice. :-) There are a variety of factors that may be at play: Competitor's site could have strong backlinks Competitor's site could be ranking largely due to the domain name Competitor's site could be ranking due to spam, in which case they will likely get penalized eventually etc, etc. Without analyzing the websites, my general advice would be that you should not switch your domain name, for a couple reasons: Google has (for a couple years now) been steadily moving away from rewarding keyword domain names and towards rewarding brands. Switching the domain is a lot of trouble and can damage SEO. It sounds like your competitor already has the most desired domain name. Changing your domain name might not help you at all, and it could hurt you. Keyword domains may look less credible to journalists, bloggers, etc.EDIT: There is a possibility that switching domains will benefit you, but there are some strong reasons it may not benefit you. I don't want to 100% say you shouldn't, but if you pursue a domain switch, I would suggest keeping the above possibilities in mind.
