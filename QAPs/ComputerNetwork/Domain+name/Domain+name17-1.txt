â˜…What characteristics should one look for in choosing a domain name for an unnamed startup?
I believe the best bang for your buck is putting together two (one syllable) words that are loosely related to what your service does. For example (not all strictly following the rule): StubHub, Facebook, PayPal, FriendFeed, FourSquare, Salesforce, Craigslist, YouTube, LinkedIn, Groupon, ZenDesk, WordPress, BetFair, NetFlix, DropBox, FlipBoard, TellMe, MySpace, MeetUp, TechCrunch, QuantCast. You can likely figure out a "good name" and it won't be too expensive (maybe free) to secure. Common one word names are great but very expensive. Instead, get clever: Skype, Yelp, Joost, Yammer, Geni, Twitter, Loopt, Digg (but be careful with the mis-spellings).
