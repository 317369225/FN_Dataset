â˜…What's worse: a long domain name or one with a hyphen?For purposes of a personal blog, what are the relevant considerations in terms of SEO and user recall? E.g., (hyothetically) comparing dot-com domains for piano-lessons vs. pianolessonsbysandra (assuming pianolessons itself is taken). Is a hyphen the kiss of death?
From my experience, dashed domains are harder to say and on the other end, the receiver of the information may get confused. From an SEO standpoint, the long domain name present an opportunity to specify the field you're in, thus associating you with a keyword/phrase better.
