★What are the best domain name registrars? Why?Also see What companies are the worst domain registrars? Why?
My current favorite for my personal domains is iwantmyname.com.  They charge a little more than average but they've taken the time to fully automate the setup of different services for your domain.  Got to be a hundred or more services in their catalog.  Google Apps, Blogger, Posterous, Tumblr, Squarespace, MobileMe, Zoho, http://bit.ly, fastmail.fm, Github Pages, Amazon S3...  tons more, completely automated.  Great for services like Google Apps where they want you to do clunky things like add strange hostname entries to verify your ownership of a domain.  Plus every time I email them about stuff, they're always responsive.  For example, I noticed in setting up DKIM for one of my domains that their form validation was rejecting the DKIM string.  They fixed it up immediately. Very satisfied customer.
