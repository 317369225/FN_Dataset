★Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
NO WAY. I wouldn't want to invest in you guys for even considering it. (not trying to be a dick, that is honestly what I feel). I'd give them a super low bid, let them say fuck you, then go back to what you set out to do; build a product people care about. It looks like it's half of your capital with no surety of ROI. High prices like that are made by people looking for Huckleberrys. Figure out what your maximum is, and negotiate. Over 100K and it's sorta crazy IMO. Only makes sense for a big company that is just trying to increase their brand presence, or has a genius in SEO that can project a return. Typically when a profitable company does this they are spending chump change, less than 1% of the money in their bank (and hopefully profitable). You'd be taking almost half. Fuck. If you fail, or the capital dries up (the probability is high), whoever made the call to buy that domain is probably not gonna be a very popular guy. Don't get dazzled by the name. Let a good product turn a shitty domain into  SEO gold. You'll be 500K richer and can dump all that into product and infrastructure. I'd love to help come up with some names or alternative domain name and I'll do it for free. Lots of other stuff to consider like are you going to be mobile, or will you be mobile later? Domains aren't going to matter much in that case. Here's my vote: DON'T DO IT.
