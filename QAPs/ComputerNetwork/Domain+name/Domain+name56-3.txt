★How can I buy a domain name for eternity?
My entry is a bit different from an explanation of why a domain name could be similar to real estate, but I think it’s a thought worth sharing here. The thought of setting up an online a business which would allow users register domains forever once crossed my mind. Of course I didn’t go ahead with implementing (there is no such service) the idea but I remember some of the key questions anyone who might consider doing something like this would have to answer are: (i)  users would clearly have to pay a premium for such aservice, but what would be a premium price users would be willing to pay? (such funds would have to be invested in such a way that it becomes perpetually profitable to keep the domains registered) (ii) What we know as the internet today may look very different in the future and the system of domain registration etc. How would you factor this into the business model? (3) is there a big enough market for such a service (are there enough people who would want to pay to own a domainfor ever?) The fact that people keep asking about keeping a domain forever shows that there is a gap in the market for such a service. No one seems to have figured it out yet, but someone will eventually and such a service would appear on the market someday. (if you think you’ve figured it out – and wouldn’t mind collaborating on the new venture, do get in touch ;)  ) Cheers.
