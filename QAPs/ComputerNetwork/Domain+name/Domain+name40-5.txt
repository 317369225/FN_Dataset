â˜…Where is the best place to buy and park a .io domain name?goddaddy, register, and yahoo! domains service don't support .io domains, so I'm looking for the most legit way to purchase a domain and park it while I figure out services and the like.
Seems namecheap is now selling .io domains for $39.00. Just wanted to share since it's relative to this topic. :)
