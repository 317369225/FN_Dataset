★Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
In some ways, the question is like asking "is it worth it to pay $100,000 for a painting".  It kind of depends on the painting.  I spent $3 million on a domain name (CreditCheck.com) and it turned out to be money very well spent.  I've also made mistakes.  In order to get thoughtful answers, you need to give a lot more context.  Domain names can help a lot (see Diapers.com) from both a branding and a traffic generation standpoint.  It's also an asset that smart investors should give you credit for when investing.  Bottom line is you should make a decision taking in to account all the things Yishan, McClure and the others have highlighted and make a holistic decision.
