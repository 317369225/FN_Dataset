★How do you sell a brand-able domain name?After having deadpooled our web service, we'd love to know what would be the best way to sell our domain + brand, and where we could get the best price (if applicable).
I'm the owner of BrandBucket.com, a marketplace that was built specifically to sell "brandable", non-keyword domain names.  We've discovered that there is a large audience out there that are looking for this type of name, but at the same time these names get lost in large, keyword-driven domain marketplaces.  We have been successful at solving this problem by: Curating our marketplace. Our team's entrepreneurial and linguistic background moderates submissions to showcase only the best names from a spelling, pronunciation and usability perspective. Our goal is to keep the total list at a size (roughly 1000-1500 names) that can be browsed by one person in an evening. Targeting our marketing at a specific buyer type -- small- to medium-sized businesses who appreciate having a list to choose from, and a budget for a strong .com domain. You are welcome to register as a domain owner and submit you domain for consideration. If it's accepted, I can promise that it will sell faster and for more money than if you waited around for the right buyer to think of your name, type it in and then contact you. This is what we do, and we've been doing it since 2007 with a very good track record. Cheers!
