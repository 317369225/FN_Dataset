â˜…Moving a wordpress.org website to another domain name?I currently have a wordpress.org website on a server with a specific domain name. I would like to move it all to a server with another domain name as I have changed the company name. What is the best way of doing this without losing the links (Both internal links and external links going towards the site)? Many thanks in advance.
While late to this question I did speak on this topic in May at WordCamp Austin. You can check out the slides at Moving Sites and Managing Domains - WordCamp Austin 2013 - Bit51
