â˜…How do you get a very short domain name?How do some companies get very short domain names like 3.ly and j.mp when the registrars of those TLDs (top-level domains) expressly forbid 3-letter TLDs?
This question will become quite relevant as new TLD's are opened up. In short, the registries are rolling out names in phases (some of which are required to ensure trademark / copyright protections). The .pw folks are doing it well (from their perspective - all but ensuring any 'premium' names are doled out auction-style. The TLD's coming online later in 2013 will almost certainly follow a similar path, since it's bound to be more profitable.
