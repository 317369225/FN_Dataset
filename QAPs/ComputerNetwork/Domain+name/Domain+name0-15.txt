â˜…Which domain name is preferable for a personal domain name: RobDKelly.com or RobKelly.net?
Take the .com without any hesitation. For personnal "branding", .me is pretty popular too (but remember "me" stands for Montenegro) Sysadmins like the .sh (Saint Helena) and coders the .pl (Polona) or .py (Paraguay).
