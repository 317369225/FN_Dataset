â˜…SEO, buying domain name?Hi People, please help me with this, if i have a site example : Hotels.com, will buying domains like bangkoghotels.com, taiwanhotels.com australiahotels.com help me in anyway in terms of SEO? And one more thing, is hidden backlinks illegal? And is SEO anymore effective in google after panda release? PLEASE HELP! Thanks, your help will be very much appreciated.
No it wont. If you plan to redirect the traffic from all these sites to hotels dot com site, that would go against the rules of Google and do more harm than good
