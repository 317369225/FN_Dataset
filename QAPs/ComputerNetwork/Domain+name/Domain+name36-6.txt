★How do you sell a brand-able domain name?After having deadpooled our web service, we'd love to know what would be the best way to sell our domain + brand, and where we could get the best price (if applicable).
I don't see <a href="http://www.getdomainer.com ">brandable domain names</a> selling for that much ($700,000) but they do sell for quite a bit.  I agree with the comment to check Sedo and Afternic, they sold a couple of them for me.
