â˜…Is it necessary to acquire every variant of a domain name?For example, if you are registering foo.com, is it necessary to acquire foo.net, foo.cx, getfoo.com, etc? Given the potential variants are endless, where does it make sense to draw the line?
From a branding standpoint, it would make sense to purchase the common variants and redirect them to the .com. I agree with AJ Kohn on purchasing a few of the typical negative domains too.
