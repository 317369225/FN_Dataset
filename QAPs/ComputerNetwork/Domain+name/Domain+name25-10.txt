â˜…Is it possible that someone at GoDaddy stole my domain name?I was about to buy domain yesterday and its been taken already. It wasn't an easy one to remember so the chances of this being a coincidence are small, and there has been cases of domain registrars that steal domain names.
Well the same thing has happened to me on more than one occassion the domain i wanted is now owned by Skype and registered by the microsoft corporation!
