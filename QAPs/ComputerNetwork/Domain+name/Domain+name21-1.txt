â˜…Moving a wordpress.org website to another domain name?I currently have a wordpress.org website on a server with a specific domain name. I would like to move it all to a server with another domain name as I have changed the company name. What is the best way of doing this without losing the links (Both internal links and external links going towards the site)? Many thanks in advance.
Elizabeth's link is useful; Google has a lot of great tools for keeping your site up to date and not having much loss of ranking. As far as your question about losing links, I believe that you are referring to internal link structure, as well as media URLs. To save time for that (and to handle serialized data, like widgets), I use a free tool called SearchReplaceDB2. http://interconnectit.com/124/se... This is a simple program that pulls your database info for you, you choose the tables that you want to change, then you give it the strings that you want to change, and it does it for you and sends a report.
