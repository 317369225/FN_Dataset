â˜…What's worse: a long domain name or one with a hyphen?For purposes of a personal blog, what are the relevant considerations in terms of SEO and user recall? E.g., (hyothetically) comparing dot-com domains for piano-lessons vs. pianolessonsbysandra (assuming pianolessons itself is taken). Is a hyphen the kiss of death?
From my perspective, dashed / hyphenated domains are a strict no-no. It "looks" cheap It is difficult to read out Will regularly end up being mistyped and the traffic might land up to your non-hyphenated competitor Does not provide any SEO advantage over the non-hyphenated one I will recommend that you think of innovative domain names such as quickpianolessons.com or practicalpianolessons.com or learnpiano.com, which are easy to remember (even if they are longer).
