â˜…Is it very important to have the keyword in the domain name?Do you think that it has any SEO impact?
No. If your domain uses a broadly used, generic word it will actually hurt you. Build a brand with a unique name that still suggests what your site does and it will be easier to market it. Use the keywords in your metadata, blog entries, etc.
