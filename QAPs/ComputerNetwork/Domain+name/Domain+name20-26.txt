★Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
Naturally, this decision will rely heavily on your business plan.  But that's still a lot of cheddar to put into a domain name. I like the idea that you're giving up some equity.  See if you stretch that some more and be sure to include a Vesting period (2 years?) with a Cliff at (1 year?). Sounds like you've got something interesting planned.  Keep us informed.
