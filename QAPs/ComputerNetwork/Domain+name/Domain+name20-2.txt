★Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
Your startup is doomed.  I am willing to bet money on this, like maybe $50 or so. You are not in Silicon Valley or NYC (or you would have said so), meaning your chances of acquiring early-adopter consumers is exponentially lower.  One way to increase your chances of success more than any domain name could would be to spend the money moving your team to one of these two locations. Further, you believe that a "word" domain name compared to a non-name domain name is superior to branding to the degree that you are even considering spending $500k on it?  Do you know how much implementation and actual sales and marketing can be had for $500k?  Or even $220k? Let's say that you spend the first $500k on product implementation and marketing.  Is having that domain name worth twice again as much product implementation and marketing?  Not only that, but if your marketing has some viral component, doubling your spending might give you well more than 2x the return.  Is the domain name worth 2x all the rest of your work? I know that you're not forking over the full $500k now, and that it's "only" $220 on signing.  But $220k is still a lot of useful capital.  I wouldn't even say that $80,000 is worth it for a branded consumer startup - you should be spending less than $10k.  A $10k domain name and $990 of money to spend on product implementation and marketing efforts is a much better bet. The best investors will think you are dumb, but if you achieve traction you will still get some mediocre investors.  However, I think in all likelihood your startup is probably doomed because you are even seriously considering this question.
