★How can I buy a domain name for eternity?
I'm not a lawyer but here are my understandings: 1.) Domain names are not property.  They are more similar to a long term (up to ten-years) contract right.  They can be bought, sold,  and traded, etc.,.  2.) I'm not sure that domain investors should be asking for domains to be treated as property.  If that happened, then we could be looking at assessments, taxes, fees, court judgments, and all kinds of new crazy problems to the industry that are still quite simple today. 3.) Below are some interesting and timely articles that bring this argument to life.
