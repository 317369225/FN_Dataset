â˜…What companies with great domain names weren't successful?
Sex.com, now that's a failure. It changed hands so many times and nobody was able to build a successful business on it. Ironic, isn't it? Sex sells...well, not in this case. Was bought recently for $13 million and it's parked, of course....for now. Also, webvan.com was a known failure (now it's part of Amazon).
