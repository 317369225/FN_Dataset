â˜…How does a small investor invest in domain names?
Kalin Karakehayov is right. The value of a domain comes from the quality score. It's not about the actual domain name or keyword anymore. Buying and then squatting on keywords to flip is useless, a waste of time and money. It's all about the quality of the links pointing back to it. The use of Private blog networks (PBN) is increasing and is only going to increase. The real value is in making the domains you own worth more by increasing the PR, Domain Authority, MozRank, Trust Flow, Citation Flow. You can build a valid and profitable business by working on getting each domain to rank for a certain niche and then selling them as a package.
