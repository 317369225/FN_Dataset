★What are the pros and cons of a startup with a domain name that actually means something?
The positive aspects are obvious - a descriptive name enhances search optimization and ensures that potential customers can easily locate your company. The negative aspects are not so apparent - at Expertcity, we came up with a highly descriptive name that accurately described our initial business model. Unfortunately, like most startups, our go-to-market strategy evolved to match the needs of the market and we eventually developed SaaS products, such as GoToMyPC, GoToMeeting, etc. Once we revised our business model, our name became a liability. In fact, at the time we were acquired by Citrix, we were in the process of revising our company name, which was an expensive, time consuming process.
