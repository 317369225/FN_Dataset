â˜…Have all 5-character .com domain names been taken?
I believe that ~21% of 5L .com's are currently taken. I came to this number via generating 3,000 random 5L combinations and bulk searching them on GoDaddy. (My test did not include any numbers, only the 26 letters.) I am not a statistician, but I would not expect the actual current number of 5L .com registrations to deviate too much from 21%. Maybe 2 pct. points at most in either direction. My test was done in March 2015. Over time, that 21% number will climb, but it remains to be seen if one day all 5L .coms will be taken, as is the case now with 4L's. 26 to the 5th power = 11,881,376 (11.9M for short). This is the total possible number of 5L .com combinations. If 21% of those are registered (2.5M), then 9.4M remain to be registered. My guess is that less than 1% of those unregistered would be considered "pronounceable." However, because there are so many unregistered, this still means that even a tiny percentage "pronounceable" means there are tens of thousands of potential (unregistered) brandable 5L .coms. In the past couple weeks, I have hand-registered many 5L .coms that I think would make very strong brand names.
