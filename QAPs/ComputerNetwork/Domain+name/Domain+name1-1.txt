â˜…What is the best site for buying domain names?I currently buy domains from GoDaddy and I really want to switch.
Name.com (also branded as DomainSite.com) is my preferred ICANN-accredited registrar. They stand out for the following reasons: Their user interface is designed for admins to manage multiple domains, it's an extremely efficient experience Responsive & informed support - they actually answer the phone if it comes to that Not sure this is such big differentiator these days, but they were among the first to support real-time DNS propagation, as well as 1-click activation of Google Apps Extremely easy to create sub-accounts and extend administrative control to third parties (I provide naming services & this is often an intermediate step to share and hand-off domain control to less-technical clients) Great process & status updates on domain transfers Their pricing is on par with other discount registrars I'm exposed to many registrars because of my work, and I'm pleased to recommend this one because of the consistently positive experience. I used to work with a rather sizable web host (NTT Verio, also a registrar via MelbourneIT). I always try to steer people away from the usual suspects - NetSol, Verisign, Register.com, 1and1 and especially GoDaddy - all of which seem like a pain to deal with relative to the price. EDIT: As of September 2014, I was informed that the DomainSite brand is being phased out and all accounts will be managed under the Name.com brand, so I reversed the order in my response above. I was also informed that the API that would expedite transfers from GoDaddy to under an hour had been rendered inoperable by GoDaddy.
