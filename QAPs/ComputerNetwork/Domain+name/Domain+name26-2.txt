â˜…What are the pros and cons of a startup with a domain name that actually means something?
Have you ever considered that both names could sound terrible? I personally agree that Seureka sounds weird, so no wonder searchwolf is a winner. And therefore it doesn't mean that it is a good name. Btw. why have you opted for only these two names? Also why not to do a survey on one name alone to see if it is any good. Also what I think is that it might be a better idea to have something easy and short - google yahoo bing - all consist of 4 letters and people are lazy to type. Of course most people have it as a homepage or bookmarked but I think that the first 3-4 visits of your website might come out of situations when you are dissatisfied with google and there is that site you once visited or read about. I am just judging from my experience, as I sometimes get annoyed with google and there is that site duckduckgo.com that makes me type one word twice which feels annoying (its ridiculous I know but it feels that way ) comparing to bing which feels nice and easy. You likely won't get a decent 4-5 letter domain but it still might be something easy to type
