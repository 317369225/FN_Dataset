â˜…Is it necessary to acquire every variant of a domain name?For example, if you are registering foo.com, is it necessary to acquire foo.net, foo.cx, getfoo.com, etc? Given the potential variants are endless, where does it make sense to draw the line?
Domain names provide the cheapest form of brand protection so consider where your brand needs protection and what that's worth to your organisation. But as a general rule - .com, .net, .org and the relevant ccTLD variants if you are outside the USA.
