â˜…What is the best site for buying domain names?I currently buy domains from GoDaddy and I really want to switch.
I just used iwantmyname.com to get a .io domain tonight and it was a clean, quick experience. I'm still planning on using GoDaddy for "impulse" .com purchases, but iwantmyname.com had a solid selection of off-beat TLDs.
