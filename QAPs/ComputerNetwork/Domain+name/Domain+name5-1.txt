★Where can I register a domain name?
I actually use two separate websites – one to find great domain names and another to register it. For finding / generating great domain names I use Agile Domain Search and for registering them, I use DreamHost. DreamHost is not necessarily the cheapest domain registar, but all my domains are registered there for simplicity. The reason why I use Agile Domain Search for fining domain names is because, in my experience, the domain name generators found at domain registrars are not very useful. You may know a keyword you'd like to have included in a domain name, but the results they provide often seem very random.
