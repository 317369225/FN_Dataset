â˜…How should a person negotiate for the purchase of a domain name that is not parked?
My favorite tactic is to deal the domain using a different name than my own... If the seller can find stuff about you in the search engines that lead him to think that you are a big fish, then they'll ask the big price. Having purchased over 100 domains in my life, I also noticed that dealing under a woman name is driving the price down. Play the nice chic that is just starting a small business and you'll get a good deal. I use escrow.com to complete the transfer and payment.
