â˜…Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
No way man, that's insane! Instead use a lot of that money on ads and brand building. Go for a $10 domain name, and if you're willing to spend the cash, spend it on marketing. Create a Facebook page, use Facebook advertising, AND Google ads to get as many "likes" as you can. For $10,000 in ad money, I bet you can get around 200,000 likes, if not a whole lot more. That's your seed audience to bootstrap your marketing, then try to convert those 200,000 likes into users of your product (web site or mobile app). Learn and grow from this and use that cash to spend on engineering to make your product better, continue growing that marketing funnel, and keep learning and building. One day you'll be a baller, where spending that $500k to buy a fancy domain name will be a relatively small hit to your marketing budget. THEN, and only then will it be okay to spend that kind of cash on a domain name, and you can easily redirect traffic from your old domain name(s) to this new shiny one. The days of stumbling upon a website by simply typing in what you want with ".com" are loong loooooong gone. People use Google for that now.
