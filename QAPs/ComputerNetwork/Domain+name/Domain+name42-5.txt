★How should a person negotiate for the purchase of a domain name that is not parked?
Do not start off on the wrong foot by low balling, since it's a name you really like. I own a few domain names and occasionally get emails offering  $100 when they are worth between $1800 and $2700, I ignore them first, then get an email again asking me to make a counter, I direct them to websites such as buydomains.com to educate themselves about the value of domain names. Do not insult the owner by offering $100 when it is clearly a name you are interested and likely worth a lot to you.
