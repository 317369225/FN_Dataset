â˜…Is it possible to get a free domain name?
Yes. I have a bunch of .tk domains I use for temporary projects. Free Domains for All Don't let it expire! They have a bad policy on what they do with expired names. Should the domain expire, it will redirect to some ad network sites and they are simply not sites people should be visiting.
