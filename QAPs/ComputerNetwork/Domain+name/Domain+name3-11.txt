â˜…Is it possible to get a free domain name?
Yes, but there is no free lunch. For most free sub-domain sites, your site will have ads posted that you can't control. This is fine for development or testing purposes, but at that point, bite the bullet and get a domain that's suitable for your project. WordPress.com gives you a free sub-domain (http://yoursite.wordpress.com) that you can upgrade to a premium ($99/yr.) or business ($299/yr.) website. Check the prices, as they may have changed since this was posted. When you upgrade to a more elegant domain name, you may either redirect it to your WordPress site, or copy it to your ISPs server to which you've pointed from your domain registrar. Good luck.
