★Where is the best place to buy and park a .io domain name?goddaddy, register, and yahoo! domains service don't support .io domains, so I'm looking for the most legit way to purchase a domain and park it while I figure out services and the like.
I just purchased an .IO domain for $45 1-yr (all-in price/no taxes for USA customers) from http://www.onlydomains.com/ - this price includes URL redirect/forwarding, unlimited subdomains, and 24/7 phone support - but NO email forwarding (add-on email hosting package required, or use another hosting provider). Renewals are also quoted currently at $45.  There is an option to lock in the $45 rate for 1, 2, or 5 yrs.  Haven't found anything cheaper without gimmicks.  So far so good...
