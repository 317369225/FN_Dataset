★Is it possible that someone at GoDaddy stole my domain name?I was about to buy domain yesterday and its been taken already. It wasn't an easy one to remember so the chances of this being a coincidence are small, and there has been cases of domain registrars that steal domain names.
I have seen availability lookup forms break and start spitting back "available" on domains that were not.  Since I don't know the domains that you were looking at, I can't check their registration dates... but if you check and find that they were registered long ago and not at the same time...
