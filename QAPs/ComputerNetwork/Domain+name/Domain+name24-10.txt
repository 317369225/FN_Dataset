â˜…What's worse: a long domain name or one with a hyphen?For purposes of a personal blog, what are the relevant considerations in terms of SEO and user recall? E.g., (hyothetically) comparing dot-com domains for piano-lessons vs. pianolessonsbysandra (assuming pianolessons itself is taken). Is a hyphen the kiss of death?
As long as the domain name makes sense (it's the exact words in a phrase), I would go with that. By registering and using a hyphenated domain name, you risk losing traffic to the non-hyphenated version.
