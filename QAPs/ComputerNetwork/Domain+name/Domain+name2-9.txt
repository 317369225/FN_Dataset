â˜…What are some of the worst domain names you've ever encountered?
The best one by far is "expertsexchange.com" It's a bad place to get questions answered (stack overflow, quora, and even yahoo answers are better), but if you want a seriously professional gender reassignment surgery place, it's my go-to option.
