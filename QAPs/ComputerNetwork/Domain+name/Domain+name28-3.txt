I recently launched a new domain search tool that many are calling the best ever built. It's called Lean Domain Search and you can check it out here: http://www.leandomainsearch.com Lean Domain Search pairs your search term with 1,000+ other keywords and instantly shows you which are available. Check it out and let me know what you think.
