â˜…Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
I'm guessing the details have been edited because most of the answerers have gotten hung up on the $500k figure. The terms are far more modest: 1% equity (about $30k of noncash value) and $1,200 per month. At those terms, it actually sounds like a bargain if it's as good as the OP suggests. The company will find out in a year or two if the domain is good and should be able to cut losses at that point if it's not.
