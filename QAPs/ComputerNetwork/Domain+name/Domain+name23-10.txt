â˜…Is a $20,000 domain name too much for a startup?
No. Facebook bought FB.com for $8m Indian startup bought housing.com for $1m. There are many examples in that way. Domain name is quite vital for the startup. Try to buy all the domain names related to your company if you have enough money. Someone may misuse it.
