â˜…How do I sell a domain name?
The biggest US aftermarket is Afternic.com. For international and US sales, Sedo.com is good too. The most important factor is to set a low price. GoDaddy offers aftermarket services for domains registered with GoDaddy and its affiliated companies. Look at current sales data and then try to underprice your domains. DiscussNames.com has a free appraisal service for registered members (through Afternic).
