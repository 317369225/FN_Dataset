★How important is Domain name?because i think fab bought fab.com for just under 6 Million dollars but fancy only got http://thefancy.com so is it worth spending so much money on the correct domain because I think one of the reasons fab.com got so popular was because of it';s domain because it helped the brand so much. but how does a startup spend so much on a domain when it is in the early stages of development?
Domain name registration is a very important decision for an online enterprise. It is important that you get in touch with a reliable provider so that you get the best service. You should get your domain name registered in your name and not on the name of hosting provider so that you can make changes you require without any external interference. This helps you alter your website settings and add features without seeking any permission. You should have the authority to make any alteration you require. I have taken my domain name registration from Bigrock. For more details you can check at their site   http://www.bigrock.com/domain-re...
