★What are the pros and cons of a startup with a domain name that actually means something?
I've had three companies - and just named them pretty randomly. Katugas means thorn tree in Singhala - sort out your thorny problems.  Trevanian Legg is family names, and could have done anything.  Churnbar is stopping churn - a bit of a geeky joke. For the last two I read everything available on igor-international.com on company and brand naming and then went with gut instinct. So do what you think is best.
