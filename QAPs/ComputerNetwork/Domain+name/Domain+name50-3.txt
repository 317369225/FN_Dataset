â˜…Which domain name would you prefer?AllfromJordan.com or JordanianCrafts.com Struggling between simple, generic & flexible vs specific, single product type and more SEO friendly domain name.
AllfromJordan: It seems to me a multi products website at first sight and I also have thought of Jordan's news/gossip related niche. JordanianCrafts: Specific and single product related domain obviously 'crafts". Both are good names, but if you're going to target crafts market then obviously go for the 2nd name.
