★What is the best site for buying domain names?I currently buy domains from GoDaddy and I really want to switch.
I use Directnic.  Their prices are about the same as everyone else's.  They do a better job of registering foreign domains and their customer service is second to none.  Point of interest: During Katrina, they kept their data center running the entire time.  Still one of the more amazing stories from the world of tech.  I've been using them for about 10 years now and whenever I've had a problem transferring or other problems with DNS, they've resolved my issue quickly and professionally.  They don't upsell you on a whole bunch of stuff either mainly because they just don't have as many services as GoDaddy which is just fine by me.
