Without knowing the name of the domain I am afraid that no one can give you a pinpoint advice. How many characters? Is it a keyword (like cameras.com) or something which can be used as a brand name (like zynga.com)? Does it means something in other languages (if you are going international)? Can it pass the phone test (tell the name to somebody on the phone and see if it can write it down without making mistakes)? Don't rely on automated evaluation tools (like estibot.com or valuate.com), especially if your name is not a keyword name. You have better luck if you get a human evaluation from established firms which offers such service (like Moniker.com or Sedo.com). Checkout also the past domain names sales of similar domains (so you can compare). You can do that at namebio.com, dnsalesprice.com and dnjournal.com.
