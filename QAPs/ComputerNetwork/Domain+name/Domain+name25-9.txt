â˜…Is it possible that someone at GoDaddy stole my domain name?I was about to buy domain yesterday and its been taken already. It wasn't an easy one to remember so the chances of this being a coincidence are small, and there has been cases of domain registrars that steal domain names.
GoDaddy reps post quotes from CEO about how bad domain kiting is and how they don't do it. Those were all from years ago - they certainly help to screw their customers today. Yesterday, I searched a domain and it was open - less than two hours later it was snapped up by DigX in Las Vegas and registered through GoDaddy and put on auction. I have dozens of domains through GD but will start moving them as they expire. This is corrupt and should be illegal - just as Bill Parsons claimed years ago. I no longer trust Go Daddy with my business or information. They will stab you in the back - and probably make money off of your blood.
