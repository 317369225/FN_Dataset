â˜…Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
Use the $500k for better use. And I doubt any investor would want to be committed if 50% of their funds are being used for a domain. also check into the .co (the new one that came out in August 2010) and see if it's available for a lot less moolah
