â˜…Is a $20,000 domain name too much for a startup?
For 99.9% of people, I would say yes but there are some people who will do very well with a good domain name. I call this the product vs packaging issue. For most people, the product is more important than the packaging. However, good packaging can open doors for some clever marketers who don't need to focus so much on the product.
