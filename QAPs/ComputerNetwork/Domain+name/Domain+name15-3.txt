â˜…Should I change my domain name?
I think the domain name is most certainly not going to make or break your ranking. Maybe a few years ago it might have bumped you above your competitor, but today that's not likely. Plus a 6 year old non-keyword domain is worth more weight in SERPs than a new domain with keywords. Here are some suggestions though: And what search term are you referring to because when I type in "Math tutor in Harrogate" you come up before him (you're 4 competitor is 7). But one thing I do notice is that you need to update your homepage title tag: Get rid of "Home -", and then is it "maths tutor" or "Math Tutor"? I think the title tag you chose doesn't make much sense in english, which will effect click through rates & rankings. Also I notice your image file name and alt tags need to be descriptive. I see your image file name 2412_599163544660_36918172_39203033_2493_n.jpg which is not descriptive at all! Also it has no alt tag. Also having a privacy policy and/or terms & conditions page along with an about page will help your rankings as Google looks for those. Also you need more backlinks. I would try to reach out to local schools, etc. and try to become their recommended tutor. You might find that they will link to your website, which could provide not only a link but more business! This is just scratching the surface. It's what I saw in about 5 minutes. I would NOT change your domain name, there are so many other things you can do first.
