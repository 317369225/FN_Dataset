★What technology will replace domain names?Domain names are a dated and flawed way of defining and distributing content on the web.   Domain brokers and unfair use as well as legitimate conflicts regarding ambiguous names is just a fraction of the problem. Non-governmental control over domain names, technical issues and so forth makes it even worse. Something will replace domain names in the coming years - what do you think will?
Domain names are not a way of defining and distributing content on the web. Domain Name System (DNS) pre-dates the web by more than a decade. DNS is a way of mapping names to IP addresses. There isn't likely going to be a replacement for that (only upgrades in the protocol, like DNSSEC) because mapping names to IP addresses is useful and DNS is simply that. You want to map names to IP addresses so you can reference the name (static) instead of the IP address (which is hard to remember, type with accuracy, and may change due to network reconfiguration). The usage of the DNS system as a way of finding content on the Internet has long been in decline. First directories (like Yahoo!) and then Search Engines (AltaVista, Google) and finally the Unified Search Bar, and App Stores, have been the successor to people remembering and typing in domain names via URLs. At this point many Internet applications that are AppStore distributed don't even need a memorable domain name, the domain name just serves as a way to map back-end resources to servers (an original and primary function of DNS prior to the advent of the Uniform Resource Locator (URL)).
