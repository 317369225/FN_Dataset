★How do you sell a brand-able domain name?After having deadpooled our web service, we'd love to know what would be the best way to sell our domain + brand, and where we could get the best price (if applicable).
Selling a brand-able domain name is tougher than a keyword domain name. Having a keyword domain name you know pretty much to whom you can sell it because you know what those keyword means. To whom you would sell runningshoes.com? To an e-commerce company seems the right choice...and that's what the owner of the runningshoes.com did: it sold to Cat5 Commerce www.cat5.com, an UK e-commerce retailer. But the selling price was astounding: $700,000! (he used a domain broker) When you have a domain like that it's easier to make some calls/emails. A brand-able domain name won't sell anywhere near that price, being also a tougher sell. Why? Because a brand-able domain could be anything and everything and you don't know what exactly. Amazon it's a brand name...it can be anything and everything (which they become). So you don't know to whom to sell it, you don't know who needs it, you don't know who is thinking of using it. In general, a brand-able domain name could fetch from hundreds to thousands or tens of thousands. But in this case you just have to wait to see who wants it (they will contact you usually). In the meantime you could put the domain up for sale on different domain names selling services like Sedo.com, Afternic.com, Godaddy.com or Flippa.com and other platforms. Maybe somebody will see it and want it. Cityville.com, for example, was bought on Sedo by Zynga ($33,000) and used for their new game at that time. Alternatively, you could ask a domain broker to try to sell it, maybe he already knows some new companies or companies which are launching new products  which may want that domain.
