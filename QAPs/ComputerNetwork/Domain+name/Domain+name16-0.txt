â˜…Are domain names trademarked?I'm getting confused. I mean for example: www.myowntrademark.xyz. Does the trademark apply to the "myowntrademark" or the "myowntrademark.xyz" or "www.myowntrademark.xyz"?
Well, first of all, the process of getting a domain name is totally separate from getting a trademark. You are applying to different organizations. You do not have to get a trademark first in order to get a domain name, and most people who make websites don't bother. But, if you have a trademark for a name and someone else has already made a website with that name, there are conditions under which you can force them to turn that domain over to you. Why? Because domain trolls in the early days would snatch up domains for well known companies and hold out for money when that company finally made a website. So the rules had to be changed to stop this troll behavior. It does not matter what you trademarked your company name as. Any of the above examples would be sufficient to force the transfer of the domain. Coca Cola has an integral right to a website at the www.cocacola.com domain. Keep in mind that trademarks can exist with the same words used in different classes of business. Trademark owner A can't force trademark owner B to turn over their website because they both happen to use the same name. Kenner.com might refer to toys and also refer to truck parts. First come first serve where both companies have a trademark, each in a different class of product.
