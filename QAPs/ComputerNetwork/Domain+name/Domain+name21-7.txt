â˜…Moving a wordpress.org website to another domain name?I currently have a wordpress.org website on a server with a specific domain name. I would like to move it all to a server with another domain name as I have changed the company name. What is the best way of doing this without losing the links (Both internal links and external links going towards the site)? Many thanks in advance.
You'll need to do 2 things: Migrate the site to the new server, changing the domain in the database after import on the new site. This is harder with WordPress.com as you can't install useful plugins to help out (but you can pay WordPress.com $129* to do it for you). David Laietta covered that well (ICIT's plugin is great for migrating domains when you can't use other more automatic tools. See also: http://en.support.wordpress.com/... You can then point the A record (or nameservers) of the old domain to the new server (either a separate site or the same site) and use any number of redirect solutions to forward traffic and page rank to the new site. Rick Gregory's answer covers that pretty well. So, in effect, old links go to the old site, then redirect to the new site (new domain, same path). Google passes page rank and most users will never know they changed domains in the process. * http://en.support.wordpress.com/...
