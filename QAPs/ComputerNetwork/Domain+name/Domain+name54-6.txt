â˜…Does a domain name matter a lot in SEO?
Yes, it does but, not as much as it used to do may be 2 years ago. Times are changing and Google has changed. With the Penguin and Panda updates the content on the website is gaining much more importance than the domain name itself. I would suggest you to concentrate your energies and resources on the content of the website more than choosing the domain name.
