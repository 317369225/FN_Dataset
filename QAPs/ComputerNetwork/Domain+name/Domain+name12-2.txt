â˜…What companies with great domain names weren't successful?
This isn't necessarily a correct answer to your question, but I think some good domain names should have been branded and used more prominently by their respective owners (Search.com / CBS Interactive, News.com / Cnet, Tech.com / University of Illinois, Music.com / MDC Partners and so on).
