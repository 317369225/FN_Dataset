â˜…What's worse: a long domain name or one with a hyphen?For purposes of a personal blog, what are the relevant considerations in terms of SEO and user recall? E.g., (hyothetically) comparing dot-com domains for piano-lessons vs. pianolessonsbysandra (assuming pianolessons itself is taken). Is a hyphen the kiss of death?
As an experienced hyphen domain owner, I would recommend to avoid it. I have used it around 2003 for next two years but later I decided to go with non-hyphen domain. It confused when you are talking with the peoples, sometimes user forget the put the hyphen on the domain name and OTHER problems :-(
