â˜…How do you get a very short domain name?How do some companies get very short domain names like 3.ly and j.mp when the registrars of those TLDs (top-level domains) expressly forbid 3-letter TLDs?
There are plenty of ccTLDs where you can get 2 character domain names from. For example, .GL from Greenland. It's more expensive than a .COM, but a lot less expensive than a .PR, for instance.
