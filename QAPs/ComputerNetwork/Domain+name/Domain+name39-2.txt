★Is this a correct analogy for Domain Name Server?
Despite some well-reasoned answers that no, it isn't, I will confess that as a DNS guy it is usually the first analogy I turn to when explain to other people what it is that I do.  While the other respondents are quite correct that there are important differences, for the colloquial 50,000 foot view the analogy is apt.  People are much worse at remembering numbers than they are at remembering names, even for people (like me) who are not so great with names.  Machines, on the other hand, want to use numbers to talk to each other.  Both the telephone book and the DNS are tools that serve the same basic function, helping people and machines operate in their respective comfort zones.
