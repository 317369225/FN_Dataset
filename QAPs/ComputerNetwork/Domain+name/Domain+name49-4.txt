â˜…Which service offers cheapest Domain name renewal?Which service currently offers the cheapest renewal service? I paid 6$ for a .com domain for the first year but the renewal is about to cost me 40$ for the 2nd year.
Try http://Internetbs.net. They charge you $8.49 for domain registrations (common TLDs) and the same price applies for the next year. Also you get lifetime full privacy protection for free of course till you have your domain registered with them.
