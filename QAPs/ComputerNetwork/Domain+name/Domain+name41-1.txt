â˜…Is it necessary to acquire every variant of a domain name?For example, if you are registering foo.com, is it necessary to acquire foo.net, foo.cx, getfoo.com, etc? Given the potential variants are endless, where does it make sense to draw the line?
If you're a large site or brand I think it makes sense to grab most of variants. It's no fun dealing with parasites on your brand - been there, done that. Even if you're paying $10 a domain, 100 domains is only going to set you back $1,000. For a large brand that seems a small price to pay to protect your brand from affiliates, competitors or irate customers. I'd add foosucks.com to your list as well as international variants. For startups and smaller sites I'd go with the recommendation by Vanessa Fox
