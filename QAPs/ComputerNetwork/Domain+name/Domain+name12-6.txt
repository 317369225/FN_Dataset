â˜…What companies with great domain names weren't successful?
Just to throw a wrench into the mix, I'd say that many brands with great domain names are endangering their own success in favor of promoting others, specifically Twitter.com and Facebook.com. What I mean is the difference between: facebook.com/brand and brand.com/facebook Every time I see an ad or business card pushing people to the former I cringe. There are many tools that integrate Facebook and Twitter into one's own web property (provided by Facebook and Twitter, even!): use them!
