â˜…Do people remember vanity domain names or .com domain names better?e.g. would you remember Buyit.com or Buy.it better?
The world of domain names is changing and it may actually be for the better. While .com and .co.uk may be the most recognisable of domain names, more and more specialised names are being used and, if trends continue, they may start to edge out the competition. It all depends on what the purpose of your website is. A site that helps children learn about science may indeed benefit from a .science domain. Likewise, a retailer may jump at the chance to have a .shop one. The best advice is to keep up with changes as and when they happen and decide once you have all the relevant information you need.
