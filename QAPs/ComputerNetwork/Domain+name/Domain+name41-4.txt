★Is it necessary to acquire every variant of a domain name?For example, if you are registering foo.com, is it necessary to acquire foo.net, foo.cx, getfoo.com, etc? Given the potential variants are endless, where does it make sense to draw the line?
Of course you need to buy popular tlds but domain investment isn't waste of money. In the future if someone gets foo co or foo.org  and do great things or better than you they will beat you in search engines easily. But if you buy most of the variants it will be hard to deal with you.
