â˜…Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
Whoa man, I am in the wrong industry. I wish I bought one word domains in the 90's because 500k plus equity is a great deal... For the person selling the domain not the person buying it. Save your cash, seriously. You can find a cheaper domain name in the 50 to 100k range just as good if you look around. Unless you're buying internet.com it's not worth it. A good domain isn't everything, if you have a great product people love that's what really matters. 500k is a couple of decent developers for a few years in salaries, a much better investment. Sadly if this is how you are thinking of spending investment capital, your startup is doomed.
