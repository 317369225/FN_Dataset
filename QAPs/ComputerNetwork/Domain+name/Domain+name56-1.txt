â˜…How can I buy a domain name for eternity?
Keep buying rights to it every time it expires. The longest stint in which you can buy a domain name for would be 10 years. The reason you can't buy rights to it forever would probably be because up until recently, no one really thought it was necessary to have a website for more than 10 years. Probably the precedent.
