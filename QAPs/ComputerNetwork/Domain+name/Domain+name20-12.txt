â˜…Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
Think of it this way - if you spend half of your initial money on a domain name, then your idea+product+everything is worth... 2 domain names :) Just kidding, but obviously something sounds wrong here.
