â˜…How important is Domain name?because i think fab bought fab.com for just under 6 Million dollars but fancy only got http://thefancy.com so is it worth spending so much money on the correct domain because I think one of the reasons fab.com got so popular was because of it';s domain because it helped the brand so much. but how does a startup spend so much on a domain when it is in the early stages of development?
choosing the right domain name for a concern or anything else is much more important because the domain name only promoting the priority while on the promotion such as seo. the domain name must be much related to our business or product keyword. so choosing domain name is important. https://www.webmasterquery.com/a...
