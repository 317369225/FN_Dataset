★Which service offers cheapest Domain name renewal?Which service currently offers the cheapest renewal service? I paid 6$ for a .com domain for the first year but the renewal is about to cost me 40$ for the 2nd year.
Yup, that how sites like GoDaddy, etc will get you. I buy a lot of domains, and I just can't be bothered to play those BS games. That is why I use Namecheap exclusively for my domain needs. Renewals are consistently ~$10 (for .COMs) and that includes Whois domain privacy. There are no gimmick upsells, just consistent prices, and fast service.
