Quora uses NameCheap as our domain registrar. They've been good so far. Most of my personal domains are registered through Gandi; I've been trying to move everything off GoDaddy ASAP but they have bizarre policies that slow down this process. For example, if you change the contact information for a domain they prohibit any transfers for 60 days in violation of ICANN policies. Update December 2011: GoDaddy supports the Stop Online Piracy Act, which is a bill that intends to censor the Internet in the United States. Yet another reason to avoid them at all costs.
