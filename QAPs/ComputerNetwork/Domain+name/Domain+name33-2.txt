â˜…What website has the best allround domain name?
I'd like to answer this a little differently, so I Hope you don't mind... The Best domain name if it were to become a developed website: Aside from the current redirection to AOL.com (AOL being the domain owner and in itself quite a popular and good domain/website), I think love.com would be the best domain name. The Universal appeal and recognition of the word 'LOVE' perhaps overrides any other (short, memorable and marketable) word in existence.
