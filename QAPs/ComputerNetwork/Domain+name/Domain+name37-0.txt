â˜…Do people remember vanity domain names or .com domain names better?e.g. would you remember Buyit.com or Buy.it better?
Domain hacks may be going ok with tech savvy people...if that's your target market then go for it. But if that's not your main target market then stick with what common people are used to (old habits die hard, remember?). And masses are used with COM, not domain hacks.
