â˜…Is it necessary to acquire every variant of a domain name?For example, if you are registering foo.com, is it necessary to acquire foo.net, foo.cx, getfoo.com, etc? Given the potential variants are endless, where does it make sense to draw the line?
Brand Recognition. I think Pandora is a great example of this very problem. While yes, you would probably want to register at least .com, .net, and .org, as Vanessa had suggested, just for 301-redirects, take a look at Pandora (Internet Radio) and Pandora (Jewelry). Pandora.com (radio) has been around for a long time... when Pandora (Jewelry) launched their web campaign, they were able to snag Pandora.net... Pandora (radio) could have strengthened their search results by registering the other TLDs, but they didn't, giving Pandora (Jewelry) the ability to have the same domain name, with a different TLD, and if you try various searches, you'll notice that they both end up in the top two spots on Google, obviously, if you're looking for a bracelet, you're not going to click on the #1 link that says it's a radio. You'll look down at #2 that says it's a jewelry store. You could look at this the good way or the bad way... The good way is... By not staking out the Pandora.net TLD, Pandora (radio) gave Pandora (Jewelry) the ability to make their mark with an easy-to-remember and easy-to-type domain. (Whether or not the domain was registered and then sold, I have NO idea.. but even still.. that's the same premise, except Pandora Radio made some moolah off of it). If you look at it the bad way, Pandora Radio could have benefited more from registering all of the TLDs, but, they established themselves pretty much as the authority on internet radio, so it probably doesn't really matter too much. For me, I register just .com, .net, .org, and .info. I recently registered .biz for my domain, and I use that for hosting my SmugMug (photo prints) store.
