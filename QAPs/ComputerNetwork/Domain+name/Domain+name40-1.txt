â˜…Where is the best place to buy and park a .io domain name?goddaddy, register, and yahoo! domains service don't support .io domains, so I'm looking for the most legit way to purchase a domain and park it while I figure out services and the like.
http://Gandi.net is $50 per .IO domain plus they give away 1 year of SSL certificate for free... but they have issues when you try to pay with American Credit Card, http://name.com is another choice (and my preference), https://iwantmyname.com/ has a slicker interface
