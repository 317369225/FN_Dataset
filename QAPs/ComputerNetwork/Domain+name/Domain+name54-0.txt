â˜…Does a domain name matter a lot in SEO?
Yes, it does matter. If you want to rank for a search term like, for instance, "soccer equipment Minnesota" you will have a far easier time if your domain name is http://soccerequipmentminnesota.com than if it's http://harryssportemporium.com all other things being equal. In my experience .com domains are far stronger than .ca or .net, as well.
