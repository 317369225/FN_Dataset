â˜…Why do so many Chinese websites use numbers in their domain names?For example Chinese mail services 163.com and 126.com.
1. There is some history reason. At first netease use 163.com as his domain name. But Please notice 163 not just some random number, at that time 163 is the main dial number of Chinese people to connect to internet. And 263.com is a very similar story, 263 is China capital Beijing 's internet dial number. 2. Most Chinese 's English is bad. They can never remember a very long English word. Short Number is easy to remember. 3. Chinese site like use Chinese Pinyin as domain name , but some Pinyin is too long, so user number homophones can short their domain name. 4. This is some many domain trader in China, Now you can not find any easy remember domain to use, so many site use short number domain name.
