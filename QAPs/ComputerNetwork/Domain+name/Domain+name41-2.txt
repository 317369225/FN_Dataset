★Is it necessary to acquire every variant of a domain name?For example, if you are registering foo.com, is it necessary to acquire foo.net, foo.cx, getfoo.com, etc? Given the potential variants are endless, where does it make sense to draw the line?
In addition to what AJ said,  if you do have a budget for it I would recommend getting the wwwfoo.com  as that is a very common mistake and an easy one for parasites to benefit from.
