â˜…What characteristics should one look for in choosing a domain name for an unnamed startup?
Adrian Aoun and Joel Postman - Trademarkability is a good business advice from both of you. Even if you don't plan to register a trademark (too expensive, generic domain name), you should check that you are not messing with somebody else's trademark. We have just launched a free trademark similarity search for the US and European market: http://www.markify.com. You can now fast and easy test your new name there and avoid future conflicts. Make it the last check before you buy an expensive domain name.
