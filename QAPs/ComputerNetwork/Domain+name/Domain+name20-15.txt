â˜…Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
As a well-regarded designer and entrepreneur, I see two crucial aspects to this question that haven't yet been discussed. The first is "what is the value of a generic keyword in building a brand" and the second is "how well does that word lend itself to design solutions". By themselves generic words do NOT make good brands. You may gain some keyword traffic but you will be fighting an uphill battle to gain mindshare. Why? Generic words get tossed around all the time and therefore fail to rise about the noise. Brands like zazzle and zappos but those are memorable for the very reason that they are unique. Why spend a lot of money up front for a "brand" that is actually just an expensive generic word? Second, as a designer and someone who's created a lot of different brands I'll say that some word / letter combos just lend themselves to beautiful engaging design solutions and others just don't. Sure you can make any letter forms work for you but some just sing out and others you struggle with. Until you've had a designer work with a given name for a while will you discover if it's really going to be "it" for a brand energy or not. My guess is you haven't done this work so you may end up paying for something that just doesn't work out to be as sexy or sleek or whatever you're going for as you hoped. The only upside to this deal is that it's an incremental payout and if you pivot (which is likely) you can drop it, but at that point all the money you spend is gone. I'd say hire a couple creatives to build a better brand solution than the generic one you are considering and go buy that URL for free.
