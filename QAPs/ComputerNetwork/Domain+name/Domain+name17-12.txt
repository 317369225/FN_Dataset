★What characteristics should one look for in choosing a domain name for an unnamed startup?
I think a lot of good things have been covered in this thread already, so I won't rehash them.  One thing I will suggest is the "newb test." Once you and your partners have come up with a name you like, run the name by your mother (or anyone who isn't terribly plugged into Silicon Valley) and see if they can deduce something about what your startup does.  If yes, it's probably a good name.  If they think it's clever, even better.
