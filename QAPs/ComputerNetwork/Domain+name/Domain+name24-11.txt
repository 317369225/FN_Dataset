â˜…What's worse: a long domain name or one with a hyphen?For purposes of a personal blog, what are the relevant considerations in terms of SEO and user recall? E.g., (hyothetically) comparing dot-com domains for piano-lessons vs. pianolessonsbysandra (assuming pianolessons itself is taken). Is a hyphen the kiss of death?
Avoid hyphens ...a catchy domain name that best represents the brand is best...even if it is long. Adding a hyphen also adds two syllables when verbally passing on the domain...plus hyphens are generally used to get a domain name that may already be taken...so if someone leaves out your hyphen ur traffic goes elsewhere...
