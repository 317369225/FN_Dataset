★Is it possible that someone at GoDaddy stole my domain name?I was about to buy domain yesterday and its been taken already. It wasn't an easy one to remember so the chances of this being a coincidence are small, and there has been cases of domain registrars that steal domain names.
Anything is possible, but if the domain you were looking at getting was a quality name that someone else might have figured out and desired on their own, then it's most likely a case of unfortunate coincidence. That said, since front running WAS a practice that was used by at least one registrar in the past, you should simply not hesitate to buy a domain you have the intention of buying.  You will never lose out on a domain if you do that.
