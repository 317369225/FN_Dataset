â˜…Where can I buy .CO.JP domain names?Godaddy only sells .JP domain names. Where can I get .CO.JP?
I am assuming you don't have a business set up in Japan? If that's the case, you can't buy co.jp domains. Japan is pretty strict about giving out these domains. If you don't have a company over here and if you can't hand in official documentation that you do, there is no chance. However, you can still buy as many .jp domains as you want (also as a foreigner) and run businesses or whatever you want under these addresses.
