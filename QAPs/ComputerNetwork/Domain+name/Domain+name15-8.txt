â˜…Should I change my domain name?
Maybe throw an ad in the local newspaper if you have not already. This will have people from all over the local area going to the site with out clicking links and will help drive up the rankings as well. Only put the domain name in the ad as the way of contacting you, also if Google still has the free business listing get one for your business and have some of your satisfied clients write some reviews for you. If they were happy with you they will do it free of charge and that is the way to get your reviews anyway.
