â˜…Which domain name is preferable for a personal domain name: RobDKelly.com or RobKelly.net?
.com is the preferred generic TLD. However, spell in lowercase, e.g., robdkelly.com How does that look to you? Also, the issue of keywords is important and Google doesn't know what a robdkelly is, and can't parse that directly. Which means that the domain name doesn't have the keywords in them, whereas robkelly.com can be parsed by Google. This is important for links which do not have anchor text or for which the url is the anchor text. We suggest acquiring both domain names and seeing what happens with similar (not identical) content and also how people respond to and remember the domain names. In Google land, empirical testing is much better than free SEO advice!
