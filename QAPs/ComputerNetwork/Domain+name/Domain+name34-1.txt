★How do I sell a domain name?
It depends on the domain.  If it's a nice generic you should seek help from a broker.  But if it's the type of name you feel will fetch less than a couple thousand dollars I would suggest doing some research and posting at dnforum.com. Sometimes the right name will do great on auction at sedo.com.
