★What are the pros and cons of a startup with a domain name that actually means something?
Dear Questioner,   From a trademark perspective, a name that is more unique than descriptive is an easier name to maintain a trademark. A brand needs to be distinctive and let consumers know "who you are". You may or may not want a website domain name to be directly associated with your business name, but when you deal with the issue of websquatters and copycats, having a unique name with a strong trademark helps. Make sure to reserve the entire "name space" around your domain name, including common spelling errors, as well as ".com/.org" etc... A good name is probably not merely descriptive.   Take care, -Matthew
