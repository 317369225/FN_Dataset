â˜…Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
The answer also kind of depends on the product you need to build to put on that domain. How many development resources will it require? How much will it cost to market it? What will your overhead be? How many long-term employees will it require to maintain once its built? How much office space will you require to house those employees? How much will you have to pay them? Without knowing the answers to these kinds of questions, it's impossible to know whether paying 1/2 your seed money for a domain is worth it. After all, the domain may be worth millions in free marketing, but if you don't have a product to market or employees run the business, that marketing is worthless.
