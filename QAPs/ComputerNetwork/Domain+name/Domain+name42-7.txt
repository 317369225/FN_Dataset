â˜…How should a person negotiate for the purchase of a domain name that is not parked?
You should check what the value of the domain is by using one of the tools that do such assessments, then contact the owner giving him that data and making an offer in line with the estimate, but you should also address the questions he may have and take into account two powerful motivators of human behavior in business: fear and greed. So you should: - address his possible fear of you being in the same line of business as he is and therefore the risk of him loosing customers, which is probably going to be a top concern - remove the temptations of greed by stating your reasons for buying the domain and your own limitations of financial resources so as to make sure he does nsot have false hopes of becoming rich just because someone is willing to buy his domain name Hope this helps.
