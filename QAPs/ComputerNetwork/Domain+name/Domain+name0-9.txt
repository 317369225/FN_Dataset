â˜…Which domain name is preferable for a personal domain name: RobDKelly.com or RobKelly.net?
I would go with RobDKelly.com for the following reasons: It is more specific than robkelly.net. If you search for "rob kelly" there are 248,000 results. If you search for "rob d kelly" there are 80,500 It has a .com extension thus lending legitimacy It is only 1 character longer, if you're concerned about length, that's not a big deal at all. Most importantly, it already ranks #1 for the search term "rob kelly" and "rob d kelley." Why fix what isn't broken?
