★How do you sell a brand-able domain name?After having deadpooled our web service, we'd love to know what would be the best way to sell our domain + brand, and where we could get the best price (if applicable).
Selling a brandable domain can be difficult, especially if you are trying to sell the name to an end user.  Many new startups have specific marketplaces they go to to find their new unique online brand name.  Some brandable domain marketplaces that startups frequent include: BoostNames.com BrandBucket.com Namerific.com Experience has taught me that it's best to have your names listed at these marketplaces and have the buyers come to you.  Outbound marketing can be a daunting task for brandables as they typically do not contain exact keywords, do not have high monthly search volumes and can have low CPC.
