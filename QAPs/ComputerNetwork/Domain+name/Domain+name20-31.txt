★Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
That's too much.  Make your own domain and define that word (or words) as your business.  Google and Flickr didn't exist in English before these companies and now define their business categories. If you must spend a ton of $$, I have a couple of domains I'll sell you for $100,000 each (saving you a ton of $ and giving me tons of start up capital). :D
