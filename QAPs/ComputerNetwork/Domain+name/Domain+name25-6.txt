â˜…Is it possible that someone at GoDaddy stole my domain name?I was about to buy domain yesterday and its been taken already. It wasn't an easy one to remember so the chances of this being a coincidence are small, and there has been cases of domain registrars that steal domain names.
I tested this with a friend a couple of years ago on Godaddy. We specifically looked for silly, random names repeatedly, and every single one was purchased no more than 2 days later. Since then whenever we are considering a domain we only search for it once, then search for something completely different so that its not obvious we are looking around specific themes.
