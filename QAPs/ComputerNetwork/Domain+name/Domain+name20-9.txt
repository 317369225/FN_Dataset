â˜…Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
No and this is a distraction. You should be focussing on an amazing product or service. A great name ( and domain name) won't propel you into success, but a bad one can destroy your potential. Get the experience right ( and different) and the name ( so long as decent ) won't be an issue. There are so many .ly , .co , .at. , .am, .by type domains that actually you may be best thinking of a name that allows you to incorporate this and find a decent and short name that not many people wanted.
