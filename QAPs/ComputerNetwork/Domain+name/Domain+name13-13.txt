★Why do so many Chinese websites use numbers in their domain names?For example Chinese mail services 163.com and 126.com.
My Wife explained to me that it is part mnemonic, op site Kaiser Kuo's post. The other part is culture. People in China pay large sums of money for telephone numbers and licence plates.Especially sequential  (567)numbers and repeditive numbers ( 888) The same holds true for the Chinese community here in the U.S. Other notes on numbers include numbers that are avoided. Especially the number "4". Which would be a mnemonic for the word "death" . Another combination that is avoided is, if I remember correctly is "124" or "214" . I was told that the meaning would be along the lines of "go die together". An epithet. I have also come to know that there are many businesses will pay top dollar for the "best" address. For example :123 Taidong Lu  Building 8 apart. 808 Qingdao, Shandong  266000  PRC. Note that this is a ficticious address there is no such place in Qingdao. My synopsis is this, Numbers carry importants in Chinese culture and it is not limited to web sites. Numbers are considered in many other facets of daily life in China.
