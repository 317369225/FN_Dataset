â˜…Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
You are even contemplating this? You are a lucky fellow to have been funded. And you want to waste it on a domain? Yeah, mint[dot]com has an advantage. But if you want the domain name just to create traction, you can very well invest 10% of what you are planning in SEO and social media and get 100 times more attention. I could actually have successfully funded and launched 6 startups in India with $5,00,000. (yeah, I just did the calculation of yearly expenses of a couple of ideas I have.) And, business branding is not all about a domain name. Use a random word generator. Get a good sounding word and you can get that one for $50. You'd be foolish to waste half a million on domain name.
