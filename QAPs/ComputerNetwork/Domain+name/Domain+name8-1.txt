â˜…Can you register a .et domain name?.et is the extension for Ethiopia but I'm wondering if anyone can register one and if so where? Thanks
Wikipedia says: This would allow for many domain hacks, if it weren't for the fact that second level domain names aren't sold. Registrations are made at third level. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.et Another registrar who deals with domains like this says it's not offered at this time: http://www.101domain.com/et.htm
