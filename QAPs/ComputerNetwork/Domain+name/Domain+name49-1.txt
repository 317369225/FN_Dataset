â˜…Which service offers cheapest Domain name renewal?Which service currently offers the cheapest renewal service? I paid 6$ for a .com domain for the first year but the renewal is about to cost me 40$ for the 2nd year.
What I do is buy a domain from GoDaddy and go to this discussion thread on Namepros (GoDaddy Discount Codes) to find the most recent discount codes for GoDaddy every time I renew them. My experience is that the prices you pay with the most recent discount codes at GoDaddy are very hard for most companies to beat. I don't think that there are many businesses who stay in the industry for the long term who can do much better than matching these prices. This thread is the most popular thread on the Namepros forum and so there are a huge number of people who do this.
