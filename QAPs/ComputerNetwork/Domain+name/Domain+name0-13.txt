â˜…Which domain name is preferable for a personal domain name: RobDKelly.com or RobKelly.net?
I would go for one hyper if you can get it rob-kelly.com or which TLD applies to your country. I think that the middle initial will muddy the water. Have you done a search to see how many indexed pages contain you name or used any keyword research to tool to look at KEI of your name?
