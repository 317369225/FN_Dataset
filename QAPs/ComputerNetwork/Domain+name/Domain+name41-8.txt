â˜…Is it necessary to acquire every variant of a domain name?For example, if you are registering foo.com, is it necessary to acquire foo.net, foo.cx, getfoo.com, etc? Given the potential variants are endless, where does it make sense to draw the line?
There are several schools of thought involved here. Owning variants of a domain name are relevant because it give you scope and coverage but it also comes with an additional cost & work load. Many think that owning the variants mean you protect yourself from nefarious competitors who would want to piggy back on the work you've done by just using a close variation of your domain Some think that a simple redirect will waste time and effort because from an SEO perspective that doesn't really earn you brownie points from search engines anyway Overall it could boil down to your business objectives and answering some strategic questions like -- Do you intend to use the variations of the domain name? Are you in a very competitive market that demands the ownership of variants?
