★What's worse: a long domain name or one with a hyphen?For purposes of a personal blog, what are the relevant considerations in terms of SEO and user recall? E.g., (hyothetically) comparing dot-com domains for piano-lessons vs. pianolessonsbysandra (assuming pianolessons itself is taken). Is a hyphen the kiss of death?
Hyphenated domains tend to look "cheap" and unprofessional.  Whether true or not many people associate hyphenated names with SEO / spam.   I would much rather have a longer domain name, provided it was a "billboard" type name that rolled off the tongue easily and was easy to remember.
