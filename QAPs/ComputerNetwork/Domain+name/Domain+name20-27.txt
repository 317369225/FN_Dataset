â˜…Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
Dave answered this well, but your primary (and for all intents and purposes, only) foci are product development and user (consumer) or customer (B2B) traction. Nothing else really matters. Unless the domain is *really* critical to either of the above, don't waste your time and acquire a great domain when you have a lot more cash or negotiating leverage. You can call yourself whatever you want in the interim. Additionally, have you looked into trademarks around the name and domain in question?
