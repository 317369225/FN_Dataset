★Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
Not worth it. To a startup, cash is your life blood. Spend each dollar like it was your last. (It may be....) The more money/rounds you raise, you decrease the equity (money) and control that both you and your early investors own. The farther you get with fewer rounds, the happier both you and your investors will be a the end of the day. This first round is the best, cheapest, no strings money you will find on your journey.  Make it last as long as possible and ensure you gain sufficient traction to make it to another round. Use the million to: Get your product right- If you do, it will stand on its own.   Build traction- get a core following/customer base that loves the product/service regardless of its name through marketing efforts. You can throttle this cost up or down as time goes by....a choice you don't have spending a lot of money on the domain name. Prove the model works- get someone to pay you. Something.  Anything. Until then, you will have a difficult time raising additional funds. Create an asset/solve a problem- Make sure that even if your app/service doesn't go supernova, you will be able to get something from someone for it and return some money to your investors.   If you succeed with these items, you will have the money to buy an expensive name down the road.  If you fail at these items due to lack of cash, the expensive name was a waste of money. Best of Luck on your Journey my friend!  It is an incredible experience!  I look forward to seeing your site.
