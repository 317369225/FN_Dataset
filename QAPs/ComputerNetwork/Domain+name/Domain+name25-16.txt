â˜…Is it possible that someone at GoDaddy stole my domain name?I was about to buy domain yesterday and its been taken already. It wasn't an easy one to remember so the chances of this being a coincidence are small, and there has been cases of domain registrars that steal domain names.
GoDaddy is a big cheat, they steal domain name ideas, if you search a domain name on godaddy than buy it immediately don't postpone if you don't buy it and check back after an hour it will be gone they will put it in auction or sell it to thier own child company 'huge domains' etc.,
