★What's worse: a long domain name or one with a hyphen?For purposes of a personal blog, what are the relevant considerations in terms of SEO and user recall? E.g., (hyothetically) comparing dot-com domains for piano-lessons vs. pianolessonsbysandra (assuming pianolessons itself is taken). Is a hyphen the kiss of death?
I would avoid hyphens in domain names if possible, especially if you are telling people your domain name.  It's very easy for people to forget hyphens.  And in regards to SEO, it really doesn't make a difference. But at the same time you don't want a domain name that has lots of words.  3 words is ok, and I really wouldn't go to 4 unless I had to.
