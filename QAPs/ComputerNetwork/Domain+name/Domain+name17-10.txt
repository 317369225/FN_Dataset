â˜…What characteristics should one look for in choosing a domain name for an unnamed startup?
Try and make your new primary name something easy to remember and easy to spell. You also need to think about a domain strategy that might include longtails in your chosen vertical to 301 to specific pages in your site and pass authority. These longtails can be used in specific PPC marketing campaigns to help lower the CPC and drive up the QI thru an exact keyword match.
