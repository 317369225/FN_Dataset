★How do you sell a brand-able domain name?After having deadpooled our web service, we'd love to know what would be the best way to sell our domain + brand, and where we could get the best price (if applicable).
A brandable domain name is a short, memorable, non-keyword name that as yet hasn't got lucky!  How to help one find its rightful owner? Keep putting it out there. Put it on Sedo, Cax and Namepros and anyone else that will display it on their site. My advice is don't send it to anyone that wants money upfront to sell it;there are enough freebees out there to make spending money on it counter-productive.
