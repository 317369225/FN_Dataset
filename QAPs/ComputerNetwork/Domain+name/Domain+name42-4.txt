â˜…How should a person negotiate for the purchase of a domain name that is not parked?
I bought several domains before -- some were selling at 10,000 euros, others I purchased for as little as $100 (including the one selling at 10,000 euros). I also have regularly had people want to purchase my domains. My experience - dealing with domain name brokers is different from negotiating directly with the person who owns it that's a regular person who simply registered it because they had an idea. Experienced domain sellers think like business men who can back up the value of the domain; otherwise individuals have irrational thinking that isn't grounded in real value but simply an emotional attachment to it. - the cost of a domain is $10 a year, so anyone selling above that is already benefiing. I don't agree just because the perceived value is $2000 that you necessarily need to assume that's it value. - when dealing with a person, the key is to get engagement from them. Don't offer them a price, simply say "I'm interested in your domain. What would you be willing to sell it for?". The key here is that everyone has a price and you're simply starting the communication process that will enable a negotiation. - I believe $100 is a completely reasonable offer as it's 10x what the cost of a domain is. If people expect more, it really depends on if you believe the value is there. People with an existing business can justifiable ask for more, then the key is to work out what their price is. And so the key to you approaching them, is simply to get them into a dialogue where they can reveal that.
