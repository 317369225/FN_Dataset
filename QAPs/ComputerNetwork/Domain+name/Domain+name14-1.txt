★Who owns all domain names?I mean Who allocates all domains names and finally who take money charged by domain name provider for buying domain name ?
You must be thinking about "central" registrars. The biggest one for generic top level domains like .com, .net, etc... is Verisign - Internet Security and Web Domain Names. (not to be mistaken with Verizon). Second largest TLD (at least if you don't count .tk) is .de so probably one of the bigges ccTLD (country code top level domain) is Denic Godaddy is the biggest registrar but Godaddy has to resell domains from corporations and institutions like Verisign and Denic. I'd say those three are the 3 biggest players in the industry with the most meat. (So every time a Godaddy sells a .com or .de, Verisign and Denic make a profit). Now you also have new gTLD's and big entrants like Donuts Inc. and Uniregistry - Home they will try to dominate the new (and for them hopefully the future) market of the domain industry. Donuts and Uniregistry are not in the Godaddy and Directi sector, they are in the Verisign and Denic sector (only much smaller and younger) however, with big pockets. Donuts raised (I can't remember the exact ammount) $100 or maybe even $200 million for going into this. Uniregistry has Frank Schilling running the show, and even his Wikipedia page says he has a domain portfolio that's worth hundreds of millions of dollars. I intereviewed both of them, you can read more here.  WhoAPI talked with 2 biggest gTLD players - Donuts and Uniregistry
