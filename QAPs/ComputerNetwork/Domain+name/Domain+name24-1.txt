★What's worse: a long domain name or one with a hyphen?For purposes of a personal blog, what are the relevant considerations in terms of SEO and user recall? E.g., (hyothetically) comparing dot-com domains for piano-lessons vs. pianolessonsbysandra (assuming pianolessons itself is taken). Is a hyphen the kiss of death?
Moi? Putting physical space needs for marketing materials (e.g., biz cards) aside for the moment,  I wouldn't worry about length. Does anyone really type in domain names any more? And if they do, it's usually just once and then it's in the browser's suggest list. The old "don't make it too long" isn't as much of an issue as it once was. I do agree that hyphens are a pain and should be avoided 99% of the time. I'd also be sure to match the domain name with the company name. For example, if your company name is Sandra's Piano Lessons, I would not shorten to SandrasPianos.com. Nor would I drop Piano Lessons in favor of SandraSmith.com (presuming Smith is your last name). Not only does having Piano Lessons in the domain name help SEO but it also tells people what you do without having to read anymore. For example, I work with a client who insisted on taking Photography out of his domain name, and just using his first and last name. So now when someone sees Bill Jones, what do know about his business? Nuttin'. The name of the biz was Bill Jones Photography and I recommend he just stick with that. That's not to say the domain has to be informative. Typically, mine are often *not* :) But if the name of the company is informative then stick with that. Make it easy for people to remember your domain name, that's the challenge. How many characters it is isn't nearly as critical.
