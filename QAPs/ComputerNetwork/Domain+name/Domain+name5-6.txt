â˜…Where can I register a domain name?
There are hundreds of registrars and all of them are equal for the most part in terms of price and features. GoDaddy is my own preferred registrar but I've used Namecheap.com and a handful of others with some regularity as well. Another suggestion would be to turn to an domain name aftermarket like Pickoutdomains.com to secure a pre-owned by brandable domain name.
