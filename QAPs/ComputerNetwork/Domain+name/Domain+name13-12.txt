★Why do so many Chinese websites use numbers in their domain names?For example Chinese mail services 163.com and 126.com.
I think it is because of the different system of language. When all the domains are made of latin words, western people can read and remember the pronunciation of the names of the domains in their own system. But Chinese people are not comfortable neither familiar to remember the names in latin word. So it is better to make them in numbers than latin words.   When email started to get popular among western people, the Chinese began to use QQ account which is a serial of number. Even now many online services like booking flight, shopping online, the initial login account could be your phone number.
