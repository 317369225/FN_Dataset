â˜…How should a person negotiate for the purchase of a domain name that is not parked?
Read Fred Wilson's post as Mircea and Sunil have recommended, and then scale down his pricing guidelines in proportion to your seed money. Heed Fred's advice about the qualities a worthwhile domain should possess (brevity, distinctiveness); be creative and open-minded when considering alternatives (as exemplified by Zynga); and be flexible in your approach to payment (lump sum acquisitions are not the only option). If you approach the owner on your own, be honest about your situation: you like the name and would like to use it for a new project, but you don't have a lot of money to spend, and you're not sure what a fair price would be. Try to shift the burden of valuation to the owner if you can, and see if he has a particular number in mind. He may have received offers in the past, and this could be a starting point for discussions about price. Remember, the aftermarket is largely illiquid, so it's difficult to determine what the "true market value" of a given name might be. Comparable sales data in the public domain accounts for only a small portion of annual volume, and it's largely biased toward the top end of the price spectrum (as only big numbers are considered noteworthy). Template or automated appraisal services may have access to a slightly larger data set, but they are not very good at selecting appropriate points of comparison, so their estimates are not widely considered to be accurate or even very useful. Start by determining how influential a short and memorable name might be on your first year of growth, and then decide how much you can afford to allocate to this asset. If you find your first choice is outside of your price range, be flexible enough to walk away and look for alternatives. Don't let the perfect become the enemy of the good.
