★What is the cheapest domain name  registrar?
I'd have to say that when it comes to domains, you get what you pay for. Instead of looking for simply cheap domains, look at what comes with the annual registration fee. If the domain is $3 per year, are you going to be spammed and upsold? What kind of features come with it? Do you have to pay extra for support? I work for http://www.UnitedDomains.com and we are competitively priced, and all our domains come with free email forwarding and URL forwarding, plus you get an intuitive easy-to-navigate control panel for your domains, and great support.
