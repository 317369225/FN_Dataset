â˜…How do you get a very short domain name?How do some companies get very short domain names like 3.ly and j.mp when the registrars of those TLDs (top-level domains) expressly forbid 3-letter TLDs?
I think they get short domains because those companies are dealing directly with the TLD administrator and most probably pay big money (o.co was bought by Overstock.com for $350,000, for example). Sometime, the TLD administrator gives away these kind of short domain names to some companies in order to profit from the buzz it creates and that will drive up the awareness of the new TLD and the sales (t.co was given to Twitter and the press was buzzing about that, raising the awareness to the new TLD CO and its administrator...also x.co I think it was awarded to Godaddy.com).
