â˜…Is it very important to have the keyword in the domain name?Do you think that it has any SEO impact?
Not anymore, no. It used to, and there was a whole market around selling domains that were loaded with keywords (anaheimgolfcourse.com!). Google realized how dumb this was and stopped it years ago.
