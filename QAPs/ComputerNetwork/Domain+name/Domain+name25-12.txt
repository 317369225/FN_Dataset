â˜…Is it possible that someone at GoDaddy stole my domain name?I was about to buy domain yesterday and its been taken already. It wasn't an easy one to remember so the chances of this being a coincidence are small, and there has been cases of domain registrars that steal domain names.
Godaddy front runs domain names... I personally experienced it. I was searching for a certain domain name a week before. By the time i start searching the domain was available. I had to postpone my purchase because my credit card was missing. Later when i checked for the name after a few hours... it is booked by Godaddy.LLC and placed it on auction.
