â˜…Are domain names trademarked?I'm getting confused. I mean for example: www.myowntrademark.xyz. Does the trademark apply to the "myowntrademark" or the "myowntrademark.xyz" or "www.myowntrademark.xyz"?
Domain names per se cannot be trademarked. Names used in business, commerce, or elsewhere can be trademarked. What is trademarked depends on what the trademark applicant applied for. A company could apply to trademark the entire name, including the extension or just the name or both. I'm no trademark expert, but I would say that most companies do not trademark with the extension. For instance, 'Google' is a trademarked name, but 'Google.com' is not. No one could use 'Google.com' otherwise because the 'Google' trademark alone precludes that. I would say the 'www.' part is never included formally as part of a trademark. But as above, the trademark on the core name, e.g., 'Google', precludes usage by others of the www.Google.com version of the name. Hope that helps.
