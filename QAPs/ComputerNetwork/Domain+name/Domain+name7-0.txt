â˜…How do you register a .ga domain name?I'd like to know how to register a .ga domain name if you are not a citizen of Gabon. For example, http://ladyga.ga
You can register directly at their registrar: http://www.nic.ga http://www.bluesit.com/ga.htm - this company seem to be doing also that. The same for http://www.rwgusa.net/ga.htm and http://www.rwgusa.com/ga.htm If you are not citizen maybe you can partner with somebody who is...risky, of course, if you don't know the person. Or, maybe the registrars can help you (not the official registrar but the other ones).
