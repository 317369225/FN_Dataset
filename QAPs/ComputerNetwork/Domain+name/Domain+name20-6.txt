★Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
You've twisted everyones panties in a bunch with how you phrased the question.  The correct question is, is it worth it to secure a 500k domain name that is as good as mint.com, for only a few thousand a month?  My answer is absolutely and that you did a great job negotiating the terms of this deal.  After you do it will you please come back and tell us the domain name?
