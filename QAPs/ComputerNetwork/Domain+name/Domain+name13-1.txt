★Why do so many Chinese websites use numbers in their domain names?For example Chinese mail services 163.com and 126.com.
Several detailed and analytical answers have been given here, but I think Joe Yang comes closest to the truth: Chinese don't feel that Hindu-Arabic numerals are at all foreign.  Chinese have adopted this numerical system as a universal standard that is independent of language, and therefore learn it from an early age.  In fact, most Chinese now are more comfortable writing numbers as 6, 7, 8 than 六、七、八, much less 陆、柒、捌 (according to the formal full-form writing of the characters). In other words, Chinese have gradually adopted these Hindu-Arabic numbers as their own, rather than consider them to be a foreign concept. On the other hand, Chinese do consider the English (or Latin) alphabet to be a foreign construct.  Most Chinese do not learn the alphabet until a later age, and are often uncomfortable with its use. To give a personal example, I used to use the email address mail@dashan.com, but I found that many Chinese did not understand the English word "mail" and even had difficulty understanding when I spelt it out letter-by-letter.  After I converted "mail" to the number of my physical (snail-mail) mailbox, 927, noboby seemed to have any problem understanding. 927@dashan.com was very easy for any Chinese to remember.  (I have since changed the address -- no spam, please.) To conclude, these Hindu-Arabic numbers, which are now universal, are much easier for Chinese Internet users to understand than the English alphabet, which is studied as a foreign language.  It's as simple as that.
