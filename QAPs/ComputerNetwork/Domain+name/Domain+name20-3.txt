★Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
We paid up for mytrade, and it definitely helped.  I think a great domain can get you into some rooms you might not otherwise get into....and more importantly it can stick in people's minds.   $500k is a lot of scratch, and sounds like half of your loot...that's a huge amount of capital to tie up.  With the web adding more and more domain extentions, and becoming more distributed (mobile, app-based, API-based, etc), I'm really thinking that the "web page" and domains in general should become less and less of a factor in success.  I'd probably stick to 5 figures on a domain if I were you....get creative!  The bottom line is, at the end of the day---you make the brand, not the other way around.
