â˜…How does a small investor invest in domain names?
I work as a inbound marketing manager at Ninet Company. I can see every day that a lot of domains are registered because people merge 2 or 3 phrases and think that is super cool. For example: service+location dot com online+service dot com Dont to that. You will not make any serious money. Better advice is that you should find any memorable word and register .com or any other interesting domain
