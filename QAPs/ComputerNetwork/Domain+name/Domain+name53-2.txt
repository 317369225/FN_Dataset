â˜…What is the easiest way to get an .io domain name?
I just used Gandi.net to purchase a dot IO domain. The pricing was the cheapest I've ever seen, $39.00/yr and I was able to use promo code IO4LESS to get an addition 30% off, bringing the total to $27.30. I found this code on the Gandi.net Facebook page. It supposedly expired in early June but as of this posting (nearly August 2013) it still works. Less than $30 for a domain you'll pay more than twice that for elsewhere.
