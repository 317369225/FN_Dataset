â˜…Is it very important to have the keyword in the domain name?Do you think that it has any SEO impact?
Directly: No. Indirectly: Yes (still, I wouldn't do so, more on that below). Normally, at least when your links are natural (i.e. not purchased against googles guidelines), a substantial percentage of your links will have your name as the link-text, e.g. www.domain. com or domain. com or domain. This is the standard way to link to sites e.g. by News sites, directories, etc. As the linktext (or alt-text) which people use to link to your domain is a significant ranking factor to determine your relevance for that term for google, of course it is helpful if this a term you want to rank for. Basically you get "automatically optimized links", because the right text is included by default. (more on ranking factors here: 2013 Search Engine Ranking Factors) However, I would advise against it (at least in 99% of cases). Firstly, it will be extremely hard/costly to find a .com domain that is an actual word. Some people would add terms like "-online" or so to the keyword, to find a domain, so it would be "www.keyword-online. com". You probably see what I am getting at with that example. A URL like this is extremely ugly and does not convey a sense of quality to your customers, but looks rather spammy. And even if you get the keyword domain without any addition in the URL, the name in most cases sounds uncreative and boring- just because it is merely descriptive, in my opinion (there are exceptions, of course) I believe there is hardly any successful company that has their main search term as their domain*, and I would rather choose a cool, clever, high quality name for your business than worrying about this. * Of course, there are exceptions like facebook, maybe salesforce, or others but I doubt they got so big because people google these terms. Amazon got huge with their fantasy name, so did Netflix, AirBnB, Pinterest, Uber, etc.
