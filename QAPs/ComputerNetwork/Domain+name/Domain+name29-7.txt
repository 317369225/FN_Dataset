â˜…How does a small investor invest in domain names?
Buying and selling low end domain names is a pretty bad business. You could likely make a small amount of money buying/selling low end .com domains, but it probably would not be worth the time invested. You would probably be better off trying to snap up good names on all of the new generic TLDs coming out. It's risky, though, because there is sufficient selection in terms of TLDs that no specific one would likely be worth anywhere close to what a .com is worth today. As a side story, I did meet a guy one time who purchased ~60 high end domain names at a bankruptcy auction some years ago. His total investment was in the $100k's, but one of the name alone (if a sale is realized in today's market) could be worth in the millions.
