★Is it very important to have the keyword in the domain name?Do you think that it has any SEO impact?
If you can get the keyword in the domain name then great I say do it.  Google stopped giving a boost in rankings for domains with the keyword/keyphrase (also called 'Exact Match Domains' or EMD) but it is easier to remember for people to come back to your site and at the end of the day it might just get you more organic traffic simply because people went to your site based on the domain name matching the search they were looking for.  It doesn't directly impact SEO (unless your content matches the keywords) but it goes back to building your site/domain for people first then machines/algorithms second.  If your domain is easier to remember and it has the content people are looking for, most likely you'll get the repeat traffic that a site without a keyword might be overlooked.  Although it won't make or break your SEO efforts if you are doing all of the white hat things you should be doing anyway, but if you can utilize the keyword and it's still available then go for it, Big companies utilize it all the time.  Diapers.com is owned by Amazon for example.  If you don't have the content to match and your site loads too slowly, or you have too many irrelevant links, it won't matter what the domain name is.
