★Why do so many Chinese websites use numbers in their domain names?For example Chinese mail services 163.com and 126.com.
In addition to the mnemonic ease that He Shang discusses in his answer, there's another important reason that Chinese websites use numbers in their domain names, and that is that numbers are used as homophones or close homophones for other words. The number 5 in Chinese, pronounced wu, sounds like the word for "I" (wo in Mandarin, but wu in classical Chinese and pronounced close to that in some other Chinese regional dialects). The number 1 can be pronounced yao, which is a rough homophone (different tone, but same segmental phoneme) as the word for "want," so that 51, or wuyao, sounds like "I want"—thus its popularity in website URLs like 51.com and 51job.com (a job website, naturally). The number 6 is pronounced liu and sounds like the word for "stream," thus the website 56.com is a video sharing website.
