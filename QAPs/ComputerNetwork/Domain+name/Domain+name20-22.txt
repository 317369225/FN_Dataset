â˜…Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
A good domain name does not a company make. It's not worth it. If I was you investor and saw this question I would pull out of the deal. Future investors will think you are not making good decisions, and they would be correct.
