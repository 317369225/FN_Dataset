â˜…How do you sell a brand-able domain name?After having deadpooled our web service, we'd love to know what would be the best way to sell our domain + brand, and where we could get the best price (if applicable).
Seems like this is a fairly old question and there are some good answers already, but since I've been asked to contribute, here's my take: 'Brandable' means different things to different people, so it is hard to know is really in play here, but assuming in this case that it is something along the lines of a short, made-up word that sounds cool and could be used as the name for a variety of different types of companies, I would: - Transfer it to GoDaddy.com and list it as a premium domain name. GoDaddy gets massive traffic and if somebody randoms searches for the name with a registrar, they are most likely to do it there. I have had good luck personally selling a variety of names thru this. - List it with Brandbucket.com (as suggested previously). The market for brandable domain names is very diffuse, but Brandbucket has built up a good following and does seem to move a decent volume of names. I have sold here, as well. If you do list here, it will foreclose some other options. - Set up a 'for sale' landing page on the url, including a mechanism for an interested party to buy it (or at least inquire about it). - List it on the major domain marketplaces, Sedo especially. - Contact some prominent domain brokers - e.g., TobyClements.com - and see if they have an interest in pitching it on your behalf. Hope that helps.
