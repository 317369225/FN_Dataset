★Is it possible that someone at GoDaddy stole my domain name?I was about to buy domain yesterday and its been taken already. It wasn't an easy one to remember so the chances of this being a coincidence are small, and there has been cases of domain registrars that steal domain names.
Same thing happened to me too, before  1 hour exactly. I have screenshots shows that  the domain was available, after 3 minutes I try to buy it. GoDaddy did the money transfer and after 2 minutes the Domain wasn't in my control panel, no ping yet on this domain. after 5-10 minutes I ping again and domain targets at: 69.58.186.114 which is registed (seconds before me?) by this domain company 'verisigninc.com' . After 10 minutes the domain redirects to other domain...Is there any law or something we can do to stop this happening??
