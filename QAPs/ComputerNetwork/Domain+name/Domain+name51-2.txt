And one more thing, is hidden backlinks illegal? And is SEO anymore effective in google after panda release? PLEASE HELP! Thanks, your help will be very much appreciated.
Just before I answer anything, lets remember that we are dealing with a $200 billion company - Google! They will always get the better of all tactics. SEO or Search Engine Optimization simply put, are the Rules or Principles that a site must follow to be appropriately noticed! After the latest Google updates, what stands out is CONTENT! So if you are planning a hotel booking site, make sure there are enough hotels in the listing. SEO can be categorized into 2 parts i)  Onpage ii) Off PAge i) On Page SEO reflects basic 'cleanliness' of the site - eg detailed URLs, H1 and H2 tags, Image alt tags, Sitemaps etc. ii) Off Page SEO reflects how much and how well people are talking about you - Backlinks to your site, Social discussions etc Let me compare a website to a TV channel On page is the Content - both quality and quantity of programs that a channel airs. If the Channel is a Sports channel - it should reflect the same by showing sports related content and clearly demarkated content (Calling a golf program a golf program and not a Soccer program just because there are more people watching soccerr) Off page is the Advertising and Marketing done for the programs and the channel - Billboards (google ads) , program reviews on social and other channels (Backlinking) If the content of a site is good and people like it, trust me your site will rise in the Google SERPs automatically. So , pls focus on content (and basic hygiene of site) and everything else should take care of itself. Hope this helps!
