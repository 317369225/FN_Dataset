★What is the easiest way to get an .io domain name?
Update: Namecheap.com  and Gandi.net both are the cheapest at this time. This is what all of them charge now for something like dekh.io Namecheap - $33 Gandi - 35$ Hover - $49 Nic.io - £72 or 109$ . It's half that price after the first year. >> I asked Gandi on twitter to decrease rates and their CEO obliged (gandi.net on Twitter). I would go with Gandi even if it's slightly expensive because of the amazing experience I have had with them. Their tagline is "No bullshit", and that's what they are about. I have not used Namecheap before, but if you have had a good experience with them, feel free to use them. >> Do note that .io transfers are tricky and not everybody supports them. According to Hover, ".io domains are a bit tricky to transfer". They do have "valet" service for the transfers though. Namecheap says the infra is unsupported (Namecheap.com on Twitter). Gandi on the other hand supports .IO transfers (gandi.net on Twitter). So, choose your provider wisely. >> I also asked Hover for a price cut, but they declined (Hover on Twitter). Otherwise, Hover is generally my favourite domain name seller, thanks to their simple UI. -- I went with Gandi 2+ years ago. At that time Namecheap and Hover did not have .io support. There was a 9 hours waiting time b/w my card being charged and the domain being registered, though. But I guess this is a .IO thing, rather than Gandi's laziness. Their french bank also takes quite a lot of time to transfer funds to them.
