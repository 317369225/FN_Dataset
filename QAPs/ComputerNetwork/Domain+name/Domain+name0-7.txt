â˜…Which domain name is preferable for a personal domain name: RobDKelly.com or RobKelly.net?
I would go with Rob-Kelly-<insert-distinguishing-term-phrase>.com if available. While you are undoubtedly unique, the search engine will have a harder time surfacing you to those that include what makes you unique in their search query.
