★If someone has a domain name, but has not trademarked it, can I trademark that domain name and then seize the domain name?
You would have to file a URDP.  The panelist would review the domain registration date, compare against the trademark registration date.  As the registration date of the domain precedes the trademark registration date the panelist would likely find in favor of the domain owner.  They may also rule that you have attempted to steal the domain with "reverse domain name hijacking" finding. Side note:  I like your car, can I tell the police that you stole it from me and take it for free?
