★What characteristics should one look for in choosing a domain name for an unnamed startup?
Choosing key words to create your company/domain name is very common, but has drawbacks.  It tends to become very product/service focused and provides little flexibility for the future. Think of how IBM and AT&T changed to these current names. Instead choosing a domain name that can be turned into a powerful brand over time is a better long term strategy that is not tied to the vagaries of the leading search engine. Who can be certain that search will be the primary way people get to your domain name five years from now? Keyword domain names will not always have the advantage we have seen in the recent past. And your business will change. Avoid misspellings Avoid cc TLDs Avoid numbers and dashes Avoid names you have to explain (in meaning but especially spelling) Avoid current trends - think long term Keep it short ( 1-9 letters, 1-2 words ideally) Get the .com Venture into the after market. There are good deals to be had. Negotiate pre-pend or append a short word if you must (domainnameinc.com) Register it for a decade or more - store credentials with corp. papers Don't rent or lease your domain name Don't sweat it. If you turn a profit you can always buy the ideal domain later
