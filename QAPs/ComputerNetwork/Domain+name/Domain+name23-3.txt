â˜…Is a $20,000 domain name too much for a startup?
Yes, it's too much. To put things into perspective, a startup is an operation that doesn't yet have the cash flow to be a sustainable business. The length of its runway is limited by its spending. So to spend the dough on a domain name instead of infrastructure or talent is unreasonable. Also, imagine as an employee, slaving away and subsisting on instant noodles, being told the company spent $20k on a domain name. That's a recipe for animosity. A few more points: A perfect domain name doesn't guarantee traction. Using a prefix or suffix is always an option, like getsomething.com or somethingapp.com. As Surendira suggested, hunkering down to get the perfect domain name when you certainly can afford to is also an option.
