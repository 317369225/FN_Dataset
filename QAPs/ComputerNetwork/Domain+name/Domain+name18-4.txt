â˜…How do I register a domain name?
Requirements: $5 minimum debit/credit card or any other means to pay online Process: Find a domain name registrar I recommend Godaddy, Bigrock(Specially for Indians), NameCheap and there are so many others too. Select a good name and compare its prices among different registrar Google about some offers or coupons You will need a hosting also, in future to host your domain. So, you can find some good combos like a few registrars offer you a free domain name with 1 year hosting plan. Finally compare all of them and their services, use coupons and pay the final amount after registration. p.s.: I dont find this question complete, but I hope I answered what you were asking for.
