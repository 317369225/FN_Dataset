â˜…Which domain name is preferable for a personal domain name: RobDKelly.com or RobKelly.net?
For most visitors the .com extension remains the default TLD in commerce, so keep that in mind. I agree with robkelly+keyword.com choice if you are looking for a local approach to your audience in terms of your products or services.
