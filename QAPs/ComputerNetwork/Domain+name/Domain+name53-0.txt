★What is the easiest way to get an .io domain name?
Good service, supports EFF, fights SOPA, excellent support, and some of the best support on the web. And of course don't forget pricing. Namecheap wins this one for me. Simple pricing, no going through endless BS upsells you have no use for. Their .io domains are for $32.88, which you absolutely cannot beat.  It also includes a cheap ($2) SSL cert... .IO Domain Name Registration • Namecheap.com Quick and easy with Namecheap
