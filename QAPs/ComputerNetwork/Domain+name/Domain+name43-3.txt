★Have all 5-character .com domain names been taken?
To my mild surprise, I was still able to register the 5 character www.drupt.com last November (2010). It's not a proper English word, but given the similarity to and popularity of "disrupt" I expected "drupt" to be taken. So yeah, I'd expect you can still find some 5-character domains, but whether you find them marketable or interesting is another matter. Some people might think I wasted my money, especially considering I stopped blogging with my domain.  Ha ha, UPDATE I just did some quick searching and found another 5 character domain name that's free. I bet there's lots available.
