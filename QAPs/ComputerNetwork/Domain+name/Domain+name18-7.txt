â˜…How do I register a domain name?
I recommend godaddy.com for domain registration (but not hosting). Just go there and follow directions or call for phone support. While this question may seem simple, I see business owner who get tripped up by services that promise to make it easy. They buy a package that include domain name, hosting, graphics and more. The problem is that often you don't own your domain name and you give up control over your site because somebody else has your passwords. If you're just starting out, it's a mini-hassle but it's not rocket science. Register your own domain names *and* your hosting with reputable companies with your own credit card. You will save many hours of hassle later on, I promise!
