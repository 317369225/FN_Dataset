★Can I run a website with Facebook-like domain names?
You need to talk to a lawyer familiar with the UDRP (Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy). There is no simple answer to this question, as it will depend on (among other things) what you will be doing with the domain name.  If your site will be in some sense competing with facebook, that's trouble.  If your site could be confused with facebook (or appears to be somehow official or associated with facebook), that's trouble. But suppose your website is 'Facebooktutor.com' and it exists to teach people how to use Facebook, and it doesn't look like Facebook, and it has a clear and obvious disclaimer that it is unofficial and not affiliated with Facebook, then you'd be on safer grounds. So, as I said, talk to a lawyer.  But also be serious about assessing the business case for doing this in the first place.
