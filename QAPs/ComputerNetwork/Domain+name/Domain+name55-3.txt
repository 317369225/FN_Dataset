â˜…Where can I buy .CO.JP domain names?Godaddy only sells .JP domain names. Where can I get .CO.JP?
It would be best if you had a company in Japan. Then there is no problem with the registration of .JP or .CO.JP domains. However, there are ways to get around this if you have a company based in this country. However, if you are not based in Japan, there are special registrar companies who mediate the purchase of such domains. I use one of those for exotic domains, which I can't register by myself, here is the info:Register .CO.JP domain name with Local Presence They've been on the market for many years and have an established position. I've never had any problems with their services.
