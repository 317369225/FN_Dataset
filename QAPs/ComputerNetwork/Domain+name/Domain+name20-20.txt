â˜…Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
I'd spend 1k in crowdsourcing ideas for a new name that has a .com available and is easy to understand in any language. I have a hard time valuing a name at 500k, unless it's already a very strong brand.
