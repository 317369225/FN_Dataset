â˜…How do I register a domain name?
First, you should select best domain registrar on which you can trust. As per my personal experience with ZNetLive.Com they are the best Domain Registrar right now in the Domain Industry. Then choose your domain and Look for a name that best fits your website and is available too. Second, choose your extension. Based on which category your website belongs like .technology, .biz, .net, .in etc. Select in your cart and Register you domain.
