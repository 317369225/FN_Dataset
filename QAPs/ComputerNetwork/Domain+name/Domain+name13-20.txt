★Why do so many Chinese websites use numbers in their domain names?For example Chinese mail services 163.com and 126.com.
In the days of Yahoo directories, there were a lot of domain names that started with numbers.  When websites get listed in directories, and if they are listed by alphabetical order, the names with the numbers at the beginning show up on top.  This is another reason to have numbers in your domain name.  Maybe Chinese website directories are relevant to websites.
