â˜…What characteristics should one look for in choosing a domain name for an unnamed startup?
I would opt for something shorter rather than longer unless it's easily remembered/spelled. Honestly, don't worry about the name too much and just make a kickass product. If you still can't think of a clever name, you can take a look at some obscure extensions like ".io" and add them on to regular sounding words.
