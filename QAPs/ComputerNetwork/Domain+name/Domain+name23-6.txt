★Is a $20,000 domain name too much for a startup?
How new are you?  Are you pre-product and have you proven out your thesis?  Do you have product market fit? what if you find your product isn't a fit and then you pivot.  if your domain is too specific and isn't relevant to your pivot then you'll have wasted $20k.
