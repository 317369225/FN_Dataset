★What technology will replace domain names?Domain names are a dated and flawed way of defining and distributing content on the web.   Domain brokers and unfair use as well as legitimate conflicts regarding ambiguous names is just a fraction of the problem. Non-governmental control over domain names, technical issues and so forth makes it even worse. Something will replace domain names in the coming years - what do you think will?
There is bucketloads of money invested to ensuring the security of the domain name system. There is billions spent on domain names every year. The more time goes by, the more people see it as a very secure system that will not go away very soon. I doubt it will go away in a rush!
