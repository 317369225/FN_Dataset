★Should I change my domain name?
Welcome to the quirky world of SEO (and Google.)  When the best practice is NOT to use exact match target keyword as the domain name, as it will trigger Google's penalty, some people just get away ranking high in the search result pages. This happens to other things like spams.  I've visited a keyword-stuffed page thank rank #1 on a particular search term.  I was repelled in 2 seconds. But Google seems to like it :) Beats me. The best advice I've received - and will give to you - is to stick to what you have.  Your WWW is brandable and will go great with your branding materials, online and offline. Always play for the long game :)
