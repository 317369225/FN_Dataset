â˜…How do you get a very short domain name?How do some companies get very short domain names like 3.ly and j.mp when the registrars of those TLDs (top-level domains) expressly forbid 3-letter TLDs?
In relation to the new top-level domains, it is necessary to get in contact with the actual registries during a specific phase of the sunrise period of the rollout. Otherwise you'll likely be paying big bucks in an auction. I prefer to find more descriptive (and thus longer) domains over at Pickout Domains.
