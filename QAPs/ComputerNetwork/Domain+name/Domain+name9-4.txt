★What are some good domain name providers?Detalhando a questão
Looks like you are from Europe...then maybe 1and1.com suits you better (located in Europe). It's the cheapest I've seen around for .COM: $4.99/year (cheaper than Namecheap). Other established registars are: - Moniker.com ($8.99/year) - Godaddy.com ($11.99/year) - Fabulous.com ($7.99/year)
