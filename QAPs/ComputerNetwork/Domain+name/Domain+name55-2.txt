★Where can I buy .CO.JP domain names?Godaddy only sells .JP domain names. Where can I get .CO.JP?
Since there is a limit of one dot.co.jp  domain per company, you pretty much have to set up a company to hold a domain. One way around it is that there are many dormant companies in Japan, so if you know someone with such a company, you can pay them rent in order for them to hold the domain on your behalf. Not sure whether JPNIC approves of this, but it seems to be legal.
