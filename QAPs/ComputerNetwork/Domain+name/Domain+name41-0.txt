â˜…Is it necessary to acquire every variant of a domain name?For example, if you are registering foo.com, is it necessary to acquire foo.net, foo.cx, getfoo.com, etc? Given the potential variants are endless, where does it make sense to draw the line?
I would generally get the .com, .org, and .net and then 301 redirect the .net and .org to the .com. I would do this in part for the few people who might type in the wrong address but mostly so that in case the site gets really popular someone else doesn't register one of the others and try to outrank your site/trick users. Others might disagree with me, but I think that unless you're a large brand, you probably don't need every ccTLD.
