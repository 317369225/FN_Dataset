★What's worse: a long domain name or one with a hyphen?For purposes of a personal blog, what are the relevant considerations in terms of SEO and user recall? E.g., (hyothetically) comparing dot-com domains for piano-lessons vs. pianolessonsbysandra (assuming pianolessons itself is taken). Is a hyphen the kiss of death?
I'm going to disagree with a lot of people. Hyphened domains can be useful, but they're not user friendly. A domain like choosespain.com can easily be read wrong by a search engine. I would never say take a hyphenated domain over one without, but would recommend using both. It's not difficult to have choose-spain.com direct to ChooseSpain.com which covers both bases. It's also very easy to get stuck on just one solution.  As has already been mentioned, you see your option as pianolessonsbysandra.com, but through brain storming and some domain searching, you might be able to find one you like better. You might try playing around with a site like http://domaingroovy.com/  and see what you come up with. Usually if a domain makes sense and isn't overly difficult to spell, your customers will be able to find you.
