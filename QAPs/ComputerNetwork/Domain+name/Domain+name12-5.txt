â˜…What companies with great domain names weren't successful?
Auctions.com - I was looking at them in the late 90s for a partnership. I did the math and figured out that if you were an eBay seller, you would be much more likely to sell it and to sell for a higher price. Even if Auctions.com charged no fees, you'd net more on eBay. The domain is now owned by a domain parker. Books.com - They were so early to market that I remember having to "telnet books.com" I'm guessing my first online goods purchases were from books.com. The domain is now owned by barnes and noble. Cars.com - Not a failure like the other two, but not as successful or well know as Edmunds or Kelly Blue Book.
