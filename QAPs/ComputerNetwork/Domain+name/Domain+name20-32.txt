★Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
"Great names" sound great because they're already embedded in people's psyches and make for tempting purchases. But remember, they weren't always great; they were made great.  I hated the names Exxon, Verizon and others when I first heard them; over time you get used to them and they acquire value in proportion to the perceived value of the underlying entity. Five years ago, almost any expert would have said that a fellow named Barack Obama could not become president simply because he was named Barack Obama.  That should tell you whether it's worth spending piles of cash on a "great name." It ain't about the name;  it's about the acquired cultural reaction to it;  that's the business you're in.
