★Is it possible that someone at GoDaddy stole my domain name?I was about to buy domain yesterday and its been taken already. It wasn't an easy one to remember so the chances of this being a coincidence are small, and there has been cases of domain registrars that steal domain names.
WOW!  I was going to register a domain name for a business I'm starting.   The name is pretty unique.  We looked it up using  Go Daddy and it was available so we agreed to use this domain.  I went to register it 3 days later and it was taken.  I looked at the whose who and it was registered the same freaking day we were looking it up on Go Daddy. More importantly I went to the site and it has go daddy ads all over it.  Could this seriously have happened?  I was going to use Go Daddy for our hosting, but now it seems like you shouldn't even use it to look up available domain names.  There is no way this happened by chance...which makes me wonder how the heck did it happen?
