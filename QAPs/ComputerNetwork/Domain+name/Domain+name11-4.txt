★What technology will replace domain names?Domain names are a dated and flawed way of defining and distributing content on the web.   Domain brokers and unfair use as well as legitimate conflicts regarding ambiguous names is just a fraction of the problem. Non-governmental control over domain names, technical issues and so forth makes it even worse. Something will replace domain names in the coming years - what do you think will?
I'm certain you are right for the most part. I'm ambivalent about government vs non-government control. To paraphrase an old saw, the only two authorities I trust are you and me and I'm worried about you. Great question. Thanks for asking
