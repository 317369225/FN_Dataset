â˜…Which domain name is preferable for a personal domain name: RobDKelly.com or RobKelly.net?
I know this isn't the question you asked (you wanted to know which one either/ or), but just to give you something else to think about, maybe neither. Look at all the brands out there that are taking advantage of new domain suffixes. mom.me is a great example. about.me as well. There is also visual.ly...all playing on the domain suffix as part of their branding efforts. What does this accomplish? It makes it super easy for people to remember the domain. As far as search goes, as long as your site is properly SEO'd (title tags have your name in them mainly) you should be fine. The content will end up being far more important to your branding efforts anyway.
