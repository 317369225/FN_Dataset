★What are good ways to find a good domain name?
Here's a novel way: Ask 50-100 target customers what they would Google if they desperately needed your product or service and had no idea that you provided it.  Take the most frequently appearing (ideally two word) answer and buy "thatthing.com" -- all one word, no hyphens or numbers, dot-com TLD only. Very often thatthing.com will be taken, but if you go through a broker like BuyDomains you can acquire it.  That's how I acquired AnalyticsJobs.com and EcommerceJobs.com.  If the domain is expensive, BuyDomains will let you put it on your credit card. SEO-friendly generic  domains are a fantastic investment and will credibalize your concept in ways you cannot imagine. They also have a salvage value if your business runs aground.
