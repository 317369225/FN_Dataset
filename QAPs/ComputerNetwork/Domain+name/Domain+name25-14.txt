â˜…Is it possible that someone at GoDaddy stole my domain name?I was about to buy domain yesterday and its been taken already. It wasn't an easy one to remember so the chances of this being a coincidence are small, and there has been cases of domain registrars that steal domain names.
I have curious situation happen like this too. I recently made a namecheap or cheapdomain purchase for a domain. I purchased alot so I kind can't keep track which ones I got so I could be wrong with my suspicions. I coulda sworn I had this domain so I just did a url check and there was a full website on it! I'm like I thought I owned this domain???? but after checking the registration info and it's a domain registered at godaddy but it SAYS it was registered since 2007. But I swear I registered this on 2013? am I just being paranoid here? Could Namecheap actually be a subcontractor for Godaddy and stealing domains? but if that's the case the main argument against this would be how in the hell could they show the registration date as 2007 instead of 2013? is that even possible? am I being paranoid or just remember things differently?
