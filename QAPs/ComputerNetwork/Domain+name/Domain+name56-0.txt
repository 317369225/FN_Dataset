â˜…How can I buy a domain name for eternity?
If you were to describe the internet as real estate, then it would be worth specifying that it is an entirely leasehold rather than freehold market. ICANN need to generate income for a variety of reasons, so if you consider them "the government", then the annual renewal fee is a property tax. A small, automatic renewal fee each year, I think, works just fine. It makes the registration of a domain more accessible to everyone rather than one significant financial outlay (almost everyone can buy a domain but not everyone can afford a "house" - in keeping with the real estate analogy).
