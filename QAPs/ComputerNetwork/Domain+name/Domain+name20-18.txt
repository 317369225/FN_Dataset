★Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
A name is important, and, it's not THAT important, it's what you make of it. Honestly, gambling with 50% of your capital for a domain is not very sound.  The concept for your startup would have to be awfully discreet for it to only work with a single name. Thinking outside the box convinced someone to give you $1M, do it again and save yourself $499,993.00.
