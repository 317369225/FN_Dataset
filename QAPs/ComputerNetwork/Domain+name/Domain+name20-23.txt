★Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
I think your question is based on some flawed examples... yelp did not mean food review to me ten years ago... I had barely heard of the concept of a facebook before I signed up for thefacebook.com because all my classmates told me about it... and the connection between mint and money was tenuous in my head.  I 100% think you need a domain that can be branded.  I also 100% concede that not every combination of letters can be so branded. But with a little creativity you can easily find an unclaimed domain you can brand (or certainly one that uses up way less of your funds).  Use those funds on SEO and other marketing and you will get the desired return.
