â˜…What is the best site for buying domain names?I currently buy domains from GoDaddy and I really want to switch.
I love Namecheap - they have clear, fast ordering process with with no additional offers. Their prices are good and they also would give you a free one year domain WhoisGurad, which normally costs you 3,99. Compared to GoDaddy they are the heaven of domains.
