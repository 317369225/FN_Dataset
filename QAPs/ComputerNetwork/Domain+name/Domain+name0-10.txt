â˜…Which domain name is preferable for a personal domain name: RobDKelly.com or RobKelly.net?
I am going to break away from the either/or choice and just say that it would a good idea to get both domains. For the purposes of using either one of the domains, I would suggest using the .net TLD for your ACTUAL domain (i.e. the one used for your hosting) and then use the .com TLD as the 301-REDIRECTED domain that will automatically go to the .net TLD. Once this is done, you will probably be able to figure out which domain is drawing the most traffic directly, and then make any potentially necessary changes. But I also agree with the points made by Scott Krager: The domain won't matter when it comes to ranking. When in doubt, go with the .com TLD. It confers a certain level of internet credibility that beats all the other TLDs. Hope this helps.
