★Who owns all domain names?I mean Who allocates all domains names and finally who take money charged by domain name provider for buying domain name ?
Short answer: individuals and organizations pay for the use of a domain name and its entries in the domain name system. Registrars pay registry operators for the right to register particular TLDs and they also pay a contribution to ICANN. The system works because of a complex set of agreements between various entities. No one actually owns domain names. Check out my recent blog post for a longer answer.
