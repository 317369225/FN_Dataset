★What are some of the worst domain names you've ever encountered?
I worked at a company that offered domain purchasing and web design as an upsell to small businesses.  We had a client who had an air conditioning and heat company who wanted us to build a website for him.  Our customer service agent chose the domain name (which the client approved, so it wasn't totally our fault.)  Changing his name to David, his company name was David's AC and Heating Company, and the domain we bought for him was davidsacheat.com.  Woops.
