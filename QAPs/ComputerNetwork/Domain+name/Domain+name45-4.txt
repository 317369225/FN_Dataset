★Is it very important to have the keyword in the domain name?Do you think that it has any SEO impact?
Does it make a difference? Surely it does. Google uses Google.com and goo.gl, so you must assume it makes a difference and has an impact, but I would say it's a very auxiliary and dependent impact. There are many more things you can do to increase your SEO more readily and more permanently.  Also, take into account the meaning of your keyword and the meaning of your domain name. For example, what on earth does a 1 followed by one hundred zeros have to do with searching the internet, or the exclamation yahoo!, for that matter? If they weren't so widely known and advertised, no one would have the first clue about their website's goods, services, or content. In terms of basic SEO principles, this ranks extremely low on the list or not at all.
