★Where is the best place to buy and park a .io domain name?goddaddy, register, and yahoo! domains service don't support .io domains, so I'm looking for the most legit way to purchase a domain and park it while I figure out services and the like.
You can buy nice names on the aftermarket like [ VirtualWallet.io, ForexMarket.io, Holograms.io or 3dcasino.io ] For as little as $200 each.  Names like that will not be available to be hand registered.
