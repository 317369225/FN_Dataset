â˜…Is it possible to get a free domain name?
1. if you mean .com or .org or .... some host give you a free domain when you buy a host package 2. if the post-fix of domain is not matter some other sites give the option to use their domain and have a sub-domain, such as google site 3. BEST free sub-domain in my opinion is Free Domain Registration + Free DNS Service. but plz dont use it much and dont put its tutorial on your blog, and use it as a secret!!! good luck.
