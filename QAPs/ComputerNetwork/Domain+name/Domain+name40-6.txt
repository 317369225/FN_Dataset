â˜…Where is the best place to buy and park a .io domain name?goddaddy, register, and yahoo! domains service don't support .io domains, so I'm looking for the most legit way to purchase a domain and park it while I figure out services and the like.
Just purchased .io from Gandi and went through instantly with an American Visa card. Got the free SSL that can be used on any site all for $39 inc US. I'll let you know if we have any problems getting our site launched. Have the reciept in inbox - recieved immediately.
