â˜…What characteristics should one look for in choosing a domain name for an unnamed startup?
I would say that your domain would depend on what type of business you're in. Like Mike Russell suggested above, if you have a specific type of customer in mind, you could register an entire phrase like "iwanttonamemystartup.com" or "adviceonnamingstartup.com" for example, and you'll be the top on Google's page when someone searches for that phrase. If you're aiming for short 2 word domains, I would suggest using the following websites to help you find something unique. 1.) http://poets.notredame.ac.jp/cgi... Find similar words using this Thesaurus on steroids. 2.) http://domai.nr Type in a potential word or phrase, and it'll give you some inspiration. Their "domain availability" check is slightly inaccurate however... 3.) http://www.morewords.com/ends-wi... Need to find out what words end in letters similar to those obscure country level domains? *.io, *.re *.ly etc.. Replace the last 2 letters at the back with whatever country domain that you like. 4.) http://iwantmyname.com Run your word and cross check with multiple domain extensions. 5.) http://brandstack.com/logo-design/ Buy a logo along with a domain. Some of the designs have an accompanying domain name which would complete your branding in one swift step. Looking at the logos would help you get some ideas too. 6.) http://www.dotomator.com/ A domain name generator. Helps to combine different words together. You might actually come across something useful.
