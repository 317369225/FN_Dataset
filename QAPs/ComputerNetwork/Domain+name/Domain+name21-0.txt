â˜…Moving a wordpress.org website to another domain name?I currently have a wordpress.org website on a server with a specific domain name. I would like to move it all to a server with another domain name as I have changed the company name. What is the best way of doing this without losing the links (Both internal links and external links going towards the site)? Many thanks in advance.
Wait... why do you need to move servers? Unless you're doing it for some reason other than the domain name change, you can leave the site on t hat server. All you need to do is a) update the database, b) point the new domain name there and c) redirect the old domain URLs to the corresponding new ones. To do (a) you *should* be able to simply update the options under Settings. However, what I usually do is to export the database as a .sql file, open that in any PLAINTEXT editor and search/replace the siteurl variable. That is, I find the siteurl option, then find/replace the string there with the new one. So if what's there right now is http://oldcompany.com and you want to replace it with http://newcompany.com do that. NOTE that you don't want a trailing slash on this. Once this is done, save it then truncate the tables in the database and import this file. I use phpmyadmin for this usually. On the domain front, you can simply point the domain's A record to the server IP and have the domain resolve to that server. Then you need to account for redirects so links work. If you do the above process you'll have the same URL structure (you'd have this even if you move physical servers actually), so you need to globally redirect everything that comes from the old domain to the new one, IIRC, this should work: RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^olddomain.com$ [OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.olddomain.com$ RewriteRule (.*)$ http://www.newdomain.com/$1 [R=301,L]
