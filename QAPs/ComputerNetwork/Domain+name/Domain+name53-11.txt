★What is the easiest way to get an .io domain name?
I purchased my .io domain (port80.io) from dnsimple.com. The signup process is very straightforward, no gimmicks and the user interface is well designed.  Pricing is $70 per domain.  You'll have to pay an additional $3/month for DNS hosting, unless you decide to host this elsewhere. The DNS hosting plan includes up to 10 domains at that price, and again the user interface for managing DNS records is very nice.  You can add records with just one or two clicks for popular services such as Google Apps.  There is also an API for making DNS changes to your account for dynamic DNS updates or integrating DNS instrumentation into your application architecture. Bottom line: not the cheapest option, but possibly the easiest to use and very powerful.
