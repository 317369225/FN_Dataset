★Can I run a website with Facebook-like domain names?
Don't do it. I had a friend of mine had a url very similar to that of travel republic. They ran a blog on it, which wasn't a dedicated travel blog. Travel Republic got in touch, and despite being very rude and flippant, were threatening legal action, claiming that the travel Republic name was being used to try and gain extra traffic, extra ad revenue, etc. In my eyes, they didn't have a leg to stand on, but I can only hope that they at least had some guidelines from solicitors before going round making (what would otherwise be) empty threats. The worst thing is, the site had been going for almost a year and was starting to gain popularity and search engine rankings for some arcane keywords. That's most likely how they were found. My friend would have been just a little bit less "inconvenienced" if she was asked, nay forced -  to give up her site right at the beginning, before she had invested time in developing the site. Do you want to be met with the same fate? It's very hard to even contemplate giving up everything you have worked for over a period of months... Last but not least, I cannot imagine what possible reason you have for needing to run a site with facebook in the url. You can rank for various keywords that are related to your business, even if these keywords contain facebook as a word (such as facebook trainer) without needing facebook in the url. Search engines have moved on from ranking sites based on the homepage url.
