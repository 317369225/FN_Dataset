★Which service offers cheapest Domain name renewal?Which service currently offers the cheapest renewal service? I paid 6$ for a .com domain for the first year but the renewal is about to cost me 40$ for the 2nd year.
Cosmotown renewal pricing is the same as their registrations. .COM w/ privacy is 8.99/yr out the door.  .net is 7.99/yr out the door w/ privacy.  If you do a 5 year plan, a .com is 7.99/yr and .net is 5.99/yr.  No ICANN fees, free whois privacy, and prices never go up.  If you find a lower regular price in 12 months, they'll refund 2x the price difference.  If you renew, they renew the guarantee too!
