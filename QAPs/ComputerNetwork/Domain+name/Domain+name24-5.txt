â˜…What's worse: a long domain name or one with a hyphen?For purposes of a personal blog, what are the relevant considerations in terms of SEO and user recall? E.g., (hyothetically) comparing dot-com domains for piano-lessons vs. pianolessonsbysandra (assuming pianolessons itself is taken). Is a hyphen the kiss of death?
I agree with the other responders, avoid the hyphenated domain name if possible. It's unprofessional looking, hard to remember and annoying to enter. Get creative with your naming and you may find something that is short, non-hyphenated and still meets your needs for being memorable and descriptive. Good luck.
