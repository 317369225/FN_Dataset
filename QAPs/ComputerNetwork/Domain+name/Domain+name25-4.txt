â˜…Is it possible that someone at GoDaddy stole my domain name?I was about to buy domain yesterday and its been taken already. It wasn't an easy one to remember so the chances of this being a coincidence are small, and there has been cases of domain registrars that steal domain names.
It is not possible. However, we do have periodic events where pieces of our domain system break, and the number of false results of "taken" rise. The business has not prioritized this issue to be fixed, for years. Sometimes the domain may look taken, but if you wait and come back a week later, it will be back to available. There is a default GoDaddy page for these false "taken" names, but it doesn't mean that anyone at GoDaddy saw your request and decided to take it. A coworker here has described this issue when he was trying to buy a domain at GoDaddy and complained. However, our teams are very siloed, so the likelihood of it being fixed is very small. Anyway, there are millions of requests that come in, and no one at GoDaddy has time to look through them and "steal" them. On top of this fact, very few people have access to those requests.
