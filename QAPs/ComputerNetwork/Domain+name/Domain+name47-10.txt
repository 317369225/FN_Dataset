★Is it very important to have the keyword in the domain name?Do you think that it has any SEO impact?
SEO impact, yes of course. For branding purposes, if you sell ebooks and you have a domain named "xyswx.com" or worse you named it  "jaguar.com" people will find it hard to be able to connect and remember your product. It is not really friendly for your marketing team.
