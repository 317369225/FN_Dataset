â˜…What characteristics should one look for in choosing a domain name for an unnamed startup?
Having just gone through this exercise I found that no matter what name we came up with, if the URL wasn't easily obtained that name shouldn't be considered- no matter how clever we got or off the wall the name seemed. My order of things to consider: 1. Name connotes or indirectly describes the service or product providing a feeling of understanding to the user or will require minimal description in conjunction with the name. 2. URL is available or within your budget to obtain desired URL. 3. 1 - 3 word phrase should make up the domain (provided the three words aren't that long).
