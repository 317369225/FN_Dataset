â˜…Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
If you're wondering about throwing away 1/2 a mil, you should have gotten 1/2 mil investment in the first place, and never bother about this question. 6 months from now, this question will seem to you one of the dumb things you've done along the way. This question is a results of you're high you're riding on. I don't blame you. Though, you're focusing on the wrong things. The name is not your product, it's guts are. Your product will give meaning to your name. Look at "Google". Stop wasting your and our time, stop wasting your investors money, there is a better domain waiting for you, get to work, and ship in less than 3 months.
