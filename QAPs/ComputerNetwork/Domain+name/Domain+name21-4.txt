â˜…Moving a wordpress.org website to another domain name?I currently have a wordpress.org website on a server with a specific domain name. I would like to move it all to a server with another domain name as I have changed the company name. What is the best way of doing this without losing the links (Both internal links and external links going towards the site)? Many thanks in advance.
As far actual transferring the site content is concerned I would recommend using xcloner (http://wordpress.org/extend/plug...) plugin. I have tried it a few times and it has worked. The plugin takes away a lot of the problems and easy to use and it is free. From the SEO perspective the best and clear guidelines are at http://support.google.com/webmas... as Elizabeth Jamieson mentioned. These two actions should have you covered.
