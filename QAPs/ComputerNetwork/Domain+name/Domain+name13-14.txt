★Why do so many Chinese websites use numbers in their domain names?For example Chinese mail services 163.com and 126.com.
Good answers are out there already. Sometimes it is because the use of numbers in proverbs/idioms in China. For example, there was one website called 3721. It is not because Chinese people are good at remembering multiplication tables. It is because a saying " Bu Guan San Qi Er Shi Yi” , literally, " I don't care if 3 7s will make 21.", or , I don't give a fuss and just do it.
