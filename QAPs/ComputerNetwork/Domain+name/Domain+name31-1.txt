â˜…How do you get a very short domain name?How do some companies get very short domain names like 3.ly and j.mp when the registrars of those TLDs (top-level domains) expressly forbid 3-letter TLDs?
Each registry has its own rules about domain length. ccTLDs, such as .ly, .mp, .co, .me etc., often, but not always, offer 1 or 2 character domain names. How they assign the names will vary. .co, for example, has only assigned a handful of single character .co domain names so far and they've all gone to big companies that were able to show the registry that they'd use and promote the names. However there are over 250 country codes, so it is still possible to get a very short domain name in a lesser known extension.
