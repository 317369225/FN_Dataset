★Is it possible that someone at GoDaddy stole my domain name?I was about to buy domain yesterday and its been taken already. It wasn't an easy one to remember so the chances of this being a coincidence are small, and there has been cases of domain registrars that steal domain names.
Recently I experienced this nasty act by GoDaddy!! No words to say..just happened few days back!! Now I am 100% convinced you people are into bad practices of stealing domain names searched by customers. I am seriously looking for better registrar for my  new domains. Not only this, I'd also make the incident as much publicity as possible through all networks and make the public alert..shame on you Bob!!
