â˜…Is it possible that someone at GoDaddy stole my domain name?I was about to buy domain yesterday and its been taken already. It wasn't an easy one to remember so the chances of this being a coincidence are small, and there has been cases of domain registrars that steal domain names.
It is possible that you were on a phishing site that looked like GoDaddy to you, but was feeding your searches elsewhere. Maybe. It could also be possible that the traffic was somehow intercepted by a third party who immediately registered the domain. I use GoDaddy and have not seen this happen with any of my searches, nor do I believe it would be good business for them.
