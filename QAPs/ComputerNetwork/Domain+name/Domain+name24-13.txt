â˜…What's worse: a long domain name or one with a hyphen?For purposes of a personal blog, what are the relevant considerations in terms of SEO and user recall? E.g., (hyothetically) comparing dot-com domains for piano-lessons vs. pianolessonsbysandra (assuming pianolessons itself is taken). Is a hyphen the kiss of death?
Long domains are better, I hope! Our domain name yourhiddenpotential.co.uk is pretty long but it looks a lot better than one with hyphens in it. Hyphenated domain names also tend to put people off when seen in Google for example. Also when telling someone your domain they are likely to forget the hyphen and end up on another site, but it also doesn't sound as professional.
