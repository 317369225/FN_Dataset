★Have all 5-character .com domain names been taken?
There will always be some available and if they fit your need, then they're a bargain.  Generally speaking, all the good ones are sold and to acquire them the prices would be between $500 and $50,000 depending on the quality.  The average might be around $6-8,000.  There are lots available in the re-sale market but remember this is one-off real estate, never ever available again, so good names are worth grabbing.  Other suffixes come and go but the dot com will always rule.  The best prices I know are at 5LetterBrands dot com.
