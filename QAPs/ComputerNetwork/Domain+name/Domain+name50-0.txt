â˜…Which domain name would you prefer?AllfromJordan.com or JordanianCrafts.com Struggling between simple, generic & flexible vs specific, single product type and more SEO friendly domain name.
I encourage you to use a short name that people can remember. long names don't work. Words in the domain don't weight as before. Look at the biggest websites, their names don't say anything about their content: Amazon.com isn't bigelectronicshop.com Google com isn't bigsearchengine com cnn com isn't greatmagazine com twitter isn't privatemessageforall com And so on Now, when you have a domain name like allforjordan since it is not your brand people will perhaps think it is spammy because it uses gimmicks that spammy domains use. Think about branding when you choose your domain name. For instance, AFjordan would look more classy.
