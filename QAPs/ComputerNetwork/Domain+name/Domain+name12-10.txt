★What companies with great domain names weren't successful?
India.com lost out to lesser lights Rediff, Sify and bumbling spam-factory IndiaTimes.com. Why? No revenue model, poor strategic positioning, poor management, and owners who didn’t understand or appreciate that it takes money to make money.  Last but not least, they were unable to implement their own technology, which is the worst thing that can be said about a technology company. India.com was not actually a technology company. They were a media and entertainment company but never realized it.
