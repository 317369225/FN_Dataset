â˜…How important is Domain name?because i think fab bought fab.com for just under 6 Million dollars but fancy only got http://thefancy.com so is it worth spending so much money on the correct domain because I think one of the reasons fab.com got so popular was because of it';s domain because it helped the brand so much. but how does a startup spend so much on a domain when it is in the early stages of development?
What keywords will you search for online when you are searching for Walmart? Walmart.com? Wal-mart? walmart? martwal? Suppose you go to walmart.com and realize that it is not same as what you've known Walmart to be? First impression, in the negative! So what does Walmart have to do then? Either a) Change their name from Walmart to The Walmart if thewalmart.com is available and register that OR b) Pay an high amount from the owner of walmart.com if he/she is willing to part ways with the domain name What else would Walmart have to do after doing a) or b) (Say Walmart opts for a) i) Register all the domain names walmart.* whether it is.org .com .net or whatever, especially if it is an International brand or business. ii) Register wlmrt.*, walmrt.*, wallmart.* and so on to ensure none exploit the spell-challenged folks Ummm... Replace Walmart by whatever company name you are planning to setup
