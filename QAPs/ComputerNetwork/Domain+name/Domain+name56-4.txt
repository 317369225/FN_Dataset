â˜…How can I buy a domain name for eternity?
Set up a fund that automatically pays your annual fees once a year and reinvests the rest of the money. If you put enough money in the fund, you will probably have the domain name for a long time. Real estate does have annual service fees like domain names and if you don't pay them you are also at risk of losing the real estate.
