★What is the easiest way to get an .io domain name?
Use  http://iwantmyname.com/ to buy .io domains, reasons : 1) http://iwantmyname.com/ is cheaper(they have a special promotion running till 31st March,2012) The cost of io domain on  http://iwantmyname.com/ is 79$, whereas the cost of buying io domains on http://nic.io is 60 Euros nor Non EU=~ 90$ 2) As mentioned in the comments above, the registration form of  http://nic.io doesn't exude a lot of confidence, on the other hand the process of registering a domain on  http://iwantmyname.com/ is just 3 steps.
