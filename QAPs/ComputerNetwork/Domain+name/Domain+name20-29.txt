â˜…Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
What is the ROI on the investment in the domain? When do you expect a payback on this investment (if at all)? Will the investment in buying or branding your product from day one help you in anyway? Or do you think it might be a better investment to be made at a later stage. Considering you are paying $500K just for the domain and not counting the cost of branding in total. Will the brand really be an asset? People buy a good product - not a brand. Brand initially is of no use. What do your investors think about this?
