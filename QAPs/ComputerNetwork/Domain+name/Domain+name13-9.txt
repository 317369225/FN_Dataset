★Why do so many Chinese websites use numbers in their domain names?For example Chinese mail services 163.com and 126.com.
Numeric domain name is used on the earliest website in China. Meantime, Chinese is sensitive on numbers.  Additionally, I would say it results from the unbalance in Chinese education. So that the numeric domain name can make the most visitor strong in memory.
