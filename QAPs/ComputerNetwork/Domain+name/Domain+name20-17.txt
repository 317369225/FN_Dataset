â˜…Is it worth it for a startup to buy a great domain name for $500,000, given an initial $1M investment from an angel?
Aside from budget mechanics, no one can effectively answer this question without knowing the domain and your industry. Since we all haven't signed NDAs and realizing you do have opportunity costs by investing half of your funding into the domain, three things to consider on the naming: - delightful products, content and services trump names. "Quora" as a name doesn't mean anything, but people find the product useful so it's growing. Instagram is delighting audiences and growing and its domain is not a .com - depending on your business, generic isn't always the best way to go e.g. amazon.com vs. bookstore.com. Marrying a great site with a memorable name is a winning combination and generic names sometimes get lost, especially if the name is specific to your industry - Is it a name you that would appreciate in value? If your venture didn't work out, could you sell the name and recoup investment or make a profit? Logo.com & IPO.com both sold for $500K last year. Logo is going to have to sell lot's of graphic design to recoup that money, but without seeing their business plan, maybe $500K was cheap. Dirt.com, Prize.com, Copies.com, Huddle.com and Idol.com all under $150K.
