★Why is DNS Pollution considered so bad?
Look at this Page on Sigcomm (copying the conclusion section from the paper) abstract of the paper: Some ISPs and governments (most notably the Great Firewall of China) use DNS injection to block access to “unwanted” websites. The censorship tools inspect DNS queries near the ISP’s boundary routers for sensitive domain keywords and inject forged DNS responses, blocking the users from accessing censored sites, such as twitter and facebook. Unfortunately this causes collateral damage, aﬀecting communication beyond the censored networks when outside DNS traﬃc traverses censored links. In this paper, we analyze the causes of the collateral damages and measure the Internet to identify the injecting activities and their eﬀect. We ﬁnd 39 ASes in China injecting forged DNS replies. Furthermore, 26% of 43,000 measured open resolvers outside China, distributed in 109 countries, may suﬀer some collateral damage from these forged replies. Diﬀerent from previous work that considers the collateral damage being limited to queries to root servers (F, I, J) located in China, we ﬁnd that most collateral damage arises when the paths between resolvers and some TLD name servers transit through ISPs in China.
