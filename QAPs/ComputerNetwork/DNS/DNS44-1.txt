★Who is the best and most cost effective managed DNS provider?
(I posted this in another answer as well) UltraDNS is the original managed DNS provider, they created the market over 10 years ago.  They used to have the biggest DNS network.  There are some newer players in the enterprise space like Dyn, DNS.com etc. Verisign is a newer player in the managed DNS market (disclaimer: I now work there).  They have the biggest network and we utilize the same infrastructure that has powered .com and .net for all these years which has always had 100% uptime. For recursive DNS, OpenDNS is the leader, hands down.
