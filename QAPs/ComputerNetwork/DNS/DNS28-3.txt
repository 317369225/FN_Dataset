â˜…What are some experiences with the Zerigo managed DNS service?Need a cheap, reliable managed DNS provider with a simple (preferably Ruby-compatible) API. Other alternatives very welcome!
I used Zerigo because it comes free for a limited number of queries per month and is easy to setup with Heroku. With my NodeJs app deployed on Heroku, it randomly created weird Sinatra errors that prevented the user's from signing up. With Heroku Support, I was eventually able to figure out that it was because of Zerigo but never saw what the problem was and lost a lot of potential users. I immediately switched to Route 53 which is cheap as well and haven't had problems since.
