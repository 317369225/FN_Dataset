â˜…Should I get premium DNS hosting for my website?I registered my website using Domain.com but not I'm wondering if I should consider a premium DNS hosting like Amazon Route 53 or Godaddy Premium DNS. Will it make any real difference vs. my current situation, with my DNS handled by Domain.com?
Short answer: if you have to ask, then you don't need a premium DNS service. Longer answer: DNS is a simple protocol, where even older equipment can serve thousands of requests very fast. Most Registrars and web hosts have large numbers of records to serve, so they have properly sized DNS clusters. They will give you all the basic tools to publish and modify A, CNAME, MX, SRV, TXT, and other records as well as tweak the expiry/refresh times for a record. If this is all you need to do, this will be sufficient for your needs. Premium [paid] DNS services usually offer advanced features, such as DNS load balancing, anycast service, advanced reporting capabilities, and often an API for programmatically updating records based on application availability. These are beneficial when you're building complex/distributed/web-scale applications across multiple service providers and need to perform advanced DNS adjustments based on criteria other than simple records publishing. For what it's worth, I don't consider GoDaddy Premium DNS to be a "premium DNS" service. Nothing they do (except maybe the reporting) is "premium" to me. I consider DynDNS, No-IP, and NSONE to be premium providers. And Route 53, which you've already considered.
