â˜…How does AWS DNS works?Are they using single public IP address to map many urls (http://ec2-50-17-10-232.compute-... ). If so how did they manage same ports on different server??
The external DNS names of AWS resources are basically what you see is what you get, with one twist: an EC2 instance from the same region as the requested address will resolve it to internal IP (in your case 10.117.49.117 instead of 50.17.10.232). To recap: they are using 1 to 1 mapping of external IPs to compute*.amazonaws.com. These addresses resolve to the external IP encoded in the hostname or to the internal ip if requested from the same AWS region as the instance in question.
