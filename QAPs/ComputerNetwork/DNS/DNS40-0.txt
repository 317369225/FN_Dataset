★How can Internet speed be increased by hacking through DNS?I am using Point - Point Internet Wireless Connection with the speed of 1mbps(120kb/sec) .. Can i able to get more speed than what i currently got ..
Using DNS functionality, you can use your computer's "hosts" file to redirect slow and/or unnecessary servers to localhost (your own computer).  For example, if there's a website you go to with  large ads or a slow metrics server, you can create entries for the server names in your hosts file so your PC won't be able to send or receive data from them.  (For example, Spybot S&D does this to block known malware and tracking servers, which will speed up browsing by reducing traffic to and from your computer and those specific servers.) You can also cache DNS lookups locally, however many browsers already do this.  If yours doesn't, or you want to use this speedup across all the computers on your network, try using your router's built-in DNS if it has one. Some, for example those running DD-WRT firmware, can be made to cache DNS lookups improving speed.  (Your PCs use your router for DNS, the router uses your ISP for DNS.)
