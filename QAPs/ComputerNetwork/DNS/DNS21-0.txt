â˜…Why are underscores not allowed in DNS host names?It is not a valid character according to RFCs 1034 and 1035, but why? (Apparently, according to those sources, it goes back to ARPANET host names.)
Because we (the Internet Engineering Task Force, standards body of The Internet) defined it that way. There is a lot of ancient History of the Internet bound up in this question: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc606 (1973) http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc608 (1974) The keyboard of the Teletype (TTY) ASR-33 (a very common terminal interface of the period from whence this standard hails - I cut my computing teeth on one in grade school) doesn't have underscore on it: http://www.pdp8.net/asr33/pics/k... which gives one a nasty problem: how do you type (input) a hostname if the hostname in question contains a character that your terminal interface can't generate? This is also a much discussed problem for International Domain Names. You could ask Jake Feinler (I think she's still around), or Vint Cerf. As someone who has written a somewhat similar standard (the UUCP map specification), I'd surmise the odds are good that it was done as combination of: software precedent (what the software of the day would accept), simplification to avoid confusion (it's very easy to confuse dash and underscore), and personal preference of the standards author (accepted by the community without objection).
