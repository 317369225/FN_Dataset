â˜…What does "Everything is a freaking DNS problem" mean?
Everything is a Freaking DNS problem is of course the blog of Kris Buytaert, one of the pioneers in the devops* movement. You could see it as an illustration of the typical issues that the devops movement aims to address: You need collaboration between different organisations to make name services work well. I've been active with UNIX since '85 and name service issues have always been there. The Domain Name System (DNS) was actually created to solve a real problem, and considering the requirements, we still don't have anything better. Ask anyone in operation if they've ever been bitten by a DNS problem and you'll get a positive answer. There's a lot of information and misinformation about DNS, and there's a lot of software and systems running that software. A lot of that software has bugs or design flaws, and even if the software is perfect, there's people like me who have to configure it and may make stupid mistakes. Heck, I was in charge of a major region of the DNS namespace of a major company, and at that time I did not even know the difference between authoritative and caching servers. The problem with DNS is that it is a network of loosely coupled services that are supposed to work together. That requires a lot of technology, a lot of coordination and collaboration and a lot of politics, depending on where you live. Ultimately, you can't hide from DNS, so you can't hide from the issues that come with it. The service and the underlying protocols and the supporting organisations have survived now for almost 30 years, and probably will for a while. * Using the original spelling for devops ;-)
