â˜…Why isn't DNS centralized?
To a large extent, DNS is centralized. There is one top registrar for the .com. All other sellers of .com domains send new updates to that registrar, which sends regular updates to fixed list of top level DNS servers (the a through m servers in the root-servers.net domain). The same thing exists for the other top level domains. Each country has single top level root. The very top level (the final .) is manged by one company, ICANN. It decides on which new top level domains can come into existence and set DNS domain policy. Just because there are hosts distributed to load balance and provide redundency, doesn't mean the system can't be said to be "centralized." Just look at federal governments, they are both said to be central governments and often central stuff while still have lots of distributed parts. Now, when I said to large extent, it is not fully centralized because there are other roots that are fully independent of ICANN and the main DNS root, but very few people use those. Also, many centralized system setup monopolies that prevent by force of law (or power) anybody else from competing with them. That is not the case with the ICANN DNS system. To better answer your question, what do you mean by centralized? Do you mean politically or technically? Are you asking about why we don't one single/central DNS host as the other answers are talking about or something else?
