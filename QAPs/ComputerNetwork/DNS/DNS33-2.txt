★Amazon Route 53: How flexible is AWS (DNS example)?If we wanted to host a DNS server, which probably has very little traffic, do we only pay for when it's responding to a request?  Or do we need to always have at least one instance listening for requests?  Or does the "W" in AWS mean port 80/443 only?
For a DNS server you would have an instance running to receive requests. Being that it is DNS you would need two NS servers perhaps one on east coast and another on west coast. In terms of pricing it would probably make more sense to use a manged DNS provider like DYNDNS or another which would be way less and more redundant than two AWS instances that you are paying for monthly.
