★What does "Everything is a freaking DNS problem" mean?
If all you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  Despite all of its flaws, DNS is an amazingly successful way of distributing small but critical pieces of information.  That's why it has been so ubiquitous for so long.  Some people see this, and think DNS would be a great way to distribute other small but critical pieces of information besides name/address pairs.  That's where all of these other record types - MX, SRV, SPF, and many more - come from.  Most of the time, people who make this statement aren't saying so much that a problem should be solved by DNS as it exists in the real world, but that it's the same kind of problem DNS solves and should be solved using the same approaches.  Sometimes they're even right.
