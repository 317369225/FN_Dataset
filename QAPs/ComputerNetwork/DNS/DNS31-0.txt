★How does DNS tunneling work?
Disclaimer: I do not recommend to download software from link I'm posting, I don't know what's out there. If you talk about modern idea to sneak any traffic over special DNS software,  I found link to explain it to you. TCP-over-DNS tunnel software HOWTO My personal opinion is that such technique misuses DNS Protocol and you're in better shape if you use VPN or other secure ways. Note that you also could be spotted on Recursive DNS Server as one who sends odd queries and generates negative effects on that server: cache pollution (even if there is no TTL, records go to cache and sometimes evict other good entries) buffers congestion (your dns-tcp proxy unlikely to be quick, packets would be sitting in buffers a little bit and recursive sysadmin might get mad investigating UDP packet loss on server) Sorry for this rant but I work with DNS every day and don't like extra features that people add there without consulting with experts and IETF. :)
