★What is dns delegation?
Here a tool that shows you graphically how DNS delegation works: http://www.buddyns.com/delegatio... Just choose a domain and hit enter. And here's how you read the graphical elements into DNS concepts: "zones" are the circles. Each zone is delegated by some server to a set of servers. All delegated servers should provide the same answers when queried for the zone. "delegations" are the arrows. Although many servers could be delegated to answer for a zone, the delegation tool need to query only one. This one is the black arrows. the "Authotity" – the final answer to your query is the gray "Authority" node. That is, which servers are declared available to provide an answer for any subdomain *.yourzone.com. The tool also shows you the concrete trace at the bottom of the page. Notice that you can get apparent "zone jumps", e.g. you query a "uk" nameserver and obtain a delegation for "bbc.co.uk" directly, without one step for the "co.uk" label. This shows you that DNS clients traverse the delegation tree by repeating the full/final question to each server: only servers are aware of delegation and the client figures it out down the road. This also allows servers to point clients to the "most relevant zone" for the query. Here's an example for the resolution of www.bbc.co.uk . The DNS initiates these steps: ask one "." (root) name server: "what's the address for www.bbc.co.uk?" server reply: "I don't know, but ask these servers, they administer the "uk" zone." ask a "uk" server: "what's the address for www.bbc.co.uk?" server reply: "I don't know. but ask these servers, they administer the "bbc.co.uk" zone" ask a "bbc.co.uk" server: "what's the address for www.bbc.co.uk?" this server is authoritative and provides an Answer, without further delegation: "The address for www.bbc.co.uk is 1.2.3.4"
