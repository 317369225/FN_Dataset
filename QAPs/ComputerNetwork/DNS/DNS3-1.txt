★Why does DNS use UDP?
In addition to the other answers, I'll add that UDP is often now used for a complete transaction even when the message size exceeds 512 bytes.  The Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0) draft originally specified a mechanism whereby a resolver can signal to an authoritative server that it is able to handle longer packets.  EDNS0 is in common use on the Internet now, and although there  are occasionally problems with middleware interfering with accurate signalling, the vast majority of answers up to at least 1280 bytes, and a great many of them up to 4096 bytes, go through without needing to fall back to TCP.
