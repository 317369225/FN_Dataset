â˜…What are some experiences with the Zerigo managed DNS service?Need a cheap, reliable managed DNS provider with a simple (preferably Ruby-compatible) API. Other alternatives very welcome!
I address the "welcome alternatives" part. Just like Zerigo had a global outage just a few weeks ago, no single provider can guarantee you that won't happen. If that happens, all your services go down like dominos. Whether with Zerigo or with any other provider, the only sensible way to go is to have TWO or more independent providers running your DNS. does your website host provide DNS service? does your domain name registrar offer DNS hosting? do you own a server or VPS to serve your domain(s)? If any of these answers to YES, host DNS at one of those, then replicate it with a secondary DNS service. This comes for free in most cases and gives you double redundancy. If either one provider fails, the other one takes over. Free DNS hosting and replication services: BuddyNS FreeDNS Afraid Xname
