★Is NAS Dlink DNS-320 working with OSX Yosemite?I've got an old NAS (hardware version A1, firmware 2.03) working  with OS X Mavericks. Because I had a lot of problems with it in the past (recently I had to downgrade the firmware because it hanged the system) I'm not in a hurry with upgrading to OS X Yosemite. Has anybody tested such a set?
Definitely not working with OS X Yosemite on my setup. Mac doesn't even see it when connected directly via ethernet. On the occasions you see the the drive in Network Browser entering correct default credentials doesn't allow you to connect.
