★Who manages/runs/maintains DNS servers?I was wondering over who oversees the functioning of DNS? who owns, pays for and maintains these servers?
The answer is... it depends! I assume you're familiar with the basics of the DNS zone system and authoritative nameservers. If you're not, here's the 30,000 foot view: You want to browse to www.quora.com, which has the IP address 50.17.246.73. How does your browser know that's the correct IP address? What happens if that changes? Originally, there used to be a single hosts file that contained a list of every single server on the internet, along with the corresponding IP address. Every time something changed, you'd have to download a new copy of the file. For obvious reasons, there is simply no way this could scale beyond a few thousand hosts at best. So a group of internet gurus sat down and came up with a system that breaks things into more manageable chunks. Going back to our example, "www" is a sub-domain in the "quora" domain which is part of the "com" top-level domain, which is part of the root domain. Each of those can be (and in fact are) handled by different authoritative nameservers, which will know essentially two things: the DNS records for its particular level of domain, and which nameserver is responsible for knowing the DNS records for one level lower. That's a little bit abstract, so I'll make it more concrete. You enter www.quora.com in your browser. A browser happens to be a recursive DNS client, so it goes to the servers in charge of the root DNS zone. These are 13 of them, listed below along with their IP address and operator: a.root-servers.net     198.41.0.4            Verisign b.root-servers.net     192.228.79.201     USC-ISI c.root-servers.net     192.33.4.12          Cogent Communications d.root-servers.net     199.7.91.13          University of Maryland e.root-servers.net     192.203.230.10     NASA f.root-servers.net      192.5.5.241          Internet Systems Consortium g.root-servers.net     192.112.36.4        Defense Info Systems Agency h.root-servers.net     128.63.2.53          US Army Research Lab i.root-servers.net      192.36.148.17       Netnod j.root-servers.net      192.58.128.30       Verisign k.root-servers.net     193.0.14.129         RIPE NCC l.root-servers.net      199.7.83.42           ICANN m.root-servers.net     202.12.27.33        WIDE Project Each of these operators provides the service for free, and provide uninterrupted uptime - after all, if any of these nameservers went offline, entire portions of the internet would temporarily stop working. So your browser asks one of the root nameservers, "what's the IP address for www.quora.com?" The root nameserver will respond, "I don't know, but this is the nameserver for the "com" TLD." The .com TLD used to be run by the US Department of Defense, but is today operated by Verisign under the authority of ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). When you registar a .com domain, you are required to list the nameservers that you will be operating to serve DNS records for your particular domain. So when the browser asks the .com nameserver "what's the IP address for www.quora.com?" The .com nameserver will respond, "I don't know, but this is the nameserver that the person who registered quora.com listed as being authoritative for the domain." Your browser will then finally query the authoritative nameserver and receive a response with an IP address. As with just about every other aspect of the internet, there are a lot of distributed pieces working in tandem to keep the DNS system going. Obviously Verisign is responsible for a surprisingly huge chunk of the most commonly used parts of the internet, but even if they were to disappear tomorrow, the functionality of the internet wouldn't disappear entirely. That's pretty cool, if you ask me.
