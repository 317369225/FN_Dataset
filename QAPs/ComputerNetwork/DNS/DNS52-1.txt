★How do I do a reverse DNS lookup on an IP address?Is there a way to write a C program to perform reverse DNS lookup without using resolver function?
For the c programming part: man 3 getaddrinfo For your old question: depends on your utility, but in general you want to look up the PTR resource-record located at D.C.B.A.in-addr.arpa. (reverse byte order!).  This "loosely" follows for ipv6, although PTR records are stored in a subdomain of ip6.arpa. and need to be transcribed to nibble format (BLUGH!). 1

Note that some utilities make this more or less easy, though THIS is how it's stored in the dns namespace.  Oh also, the +noall +answer just suppresses all of dig's default bs and only reports the answer section.
