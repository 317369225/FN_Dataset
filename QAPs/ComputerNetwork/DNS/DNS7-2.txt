â˜…What is the best free authoritative DNS service?What companies provide authoritative DNS free for reasonable numbers of domains and queries.
I think we're getting to the point where the only companies that provide free authoritative DNS are domain registrars that use it as yet-another-feature to get domain registrants to transfer. Hosting DNS servers cost money, period, and unless you're using it as a loss-leader there is no justification for offerring it for free. Having said that, if you're still interested in a free authoritative DNS provider, perhaps try http://freedns.afraid.org/ or http://www.zoneedit.com/
