â˜…What is the best dynamic DNS service provider?I've used dyndns.com and no-ip.org in the past, but I'm curious if there's anything better.
If you are looking for a free service with powerful features I would recommend Dynu Systems. They offer free dynamic DNS service for yourname.dynu.com and yourname.com. It has a simple API(update URL) and offers free update client software. Other free features include + IPV6 support + web redirect(port 80 redirect, URL forwarding) + subdomains + MX record + round robin DNS (multiple IP addresses for 1 hostname) + offline settings(redirect to offline message or offline URL) + custom DNS records(TXT, SPF,HINFO,SRV etc.)
