★Why Hadoop force using DNS?
A lot of it comes down to the fact that just using IP addresses is not a very good practice for running production services. Properly administered infrastructure (Hadoop or otherwise) will have working DNS and/or hostname resolution.  (Cue the virtualization argument in 3... 2... 1... ) Internally, the use of hostnames is used for the obvious display-side stuff and of course Kerberos.  But things also get tricky when multiple interfaces are on a machine.  You need to be able to map that machine/process to many different IPs.  Thus hostnames are pretty much required.
