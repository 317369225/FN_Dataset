★How does DNS work?
DNS stands for Domain Name System. It's kind of like having a phone directory that lists names next to numbers. Computers identify themselves by IP addresses. Which is a problem if humans want to tell each other what computer to look for online (a URL). A DNS server acts as the intermediary. You tell your ISP the URL you want to find. The ISP asks a DNS server which IP address matchs that URL, and returns the correct result to you. There are many DNS servers in the world – in order to speed up access. This is why it can take a day or two for your URL to propagate across the internet.
