â˜…How are DNS servers optimized?
There are many ways to optimize for DNS queries, including basic techniques like increasing time-to-live values on domains to much more advanced configurations at the network level like anycast. Many companies with significant traffic outsource their DNS service to a provider that supports anycast, such as UltraDNS or DynDNS. It's important to keep in mind that these services tend to be significantly more expensive than DNS services that are not anycast based but are often not going to result in a massive performance boost. I'm sure that plenty of companies still use BIND. There are plenty of alternatives though including djbdns and PowerDNS. As for Facebook it appears that some of their servers are outsourced to UltraDNS and some are in-house. Finally, regarding the last statement, the reality is that once a name is cached after the first request the DNS lookups essentially become a non-issue. So many sites have much more serious issues than DNS that squeezing an extra 50 milliseconds out of their first DNS lookups is not likely where they should be focusing their energy.
