★Amazon Route 53: How flexible is AWS (DNS example)?If we wanted to host a DNS server, which probably has very little traffic, do we only pay for when it's responding to a request?  Or do we need to always have at least one instance listening for requests?  Or does the "W" in AWS mean port 80/443 only?
Route53 is a no-brainer, imho. Their pricing structure is such that you pay an amount for hosting each zone (per month) and then for the number of queries made against that zone (per month). They recently lowered their prices, but see this schedule: http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pr... $0.50 per zone and $0.50 per million requests, up to 1B. Prices drop from there. We've had two BIND servers up and running for years with a few thousand domain zones, but frankly with the available tools and redundancy of Route53, I've slept better at night with all our important zones in Route53. You can also use a tool like cli53 to import your zone files pretty quickly, or to script nightly backups of the zones if you like.
