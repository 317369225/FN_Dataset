â˜…What are some experiences with the Zerigo managed DNS service?Need a cheap, reliable managed DNS provider with a simple (preferably Ruby-compatible) API. Other alternatives very welcome!
Zerigo does a good job at DNS hosting at a good price. I used to use them whenever I created a new site on Heroku since it was easy and free. The downside to the free account is that you are limited to a small amount of records and, when coming from Heroku, each zone is going to be under its own account and thus you really must go through Heroku to make it manageable. The other downside is that their per month query limits on the free account are 50k (although this is more than sufficient for a low-traffic site). Alternatives with an API include: DynDNS - $30 for 600k queries per month Amazon Route 53 - $1 per month + $0.50 per 1 mil queries DNSimple (my service) - $3 per month, currently no query limit Both DynDNS and DNSimple also provide domain registration, whereas Amazon Route 53 and Zerigo do not at this time.
