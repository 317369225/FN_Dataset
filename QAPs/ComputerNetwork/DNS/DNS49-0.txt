â˜…Should I get premium DNS hosting for my website?I registered my website using Domain.com but not I'm wondering if I should consider a premium DNS hosting like Amazon Route 53 or Godaddy Premium DNS. Will it make any real difference vs. my current situation, with my DNS handled by Domain.com?
Andrew Boring pretty much nailed it. I'd add that if your site/application is relatively small and you expect it to grow there's really no reason not to use a premium DNS service these days. Several of the high end providers will offer a free tier anyway. Even if you aren't going to be using any of the fancier features like load balancing or failover, you still get the benefits of using any anycasted DNS service -- specifically reduced latency and some additional redundancy on the DNS level. As a plus, when you've grown to the point where load balancing, DR, and traffic routing make sense, you already have an option you're familiar with in place. Here is a good list of managed DNS providers (Wikipedia) If you're only looking to host a tiny website for something like family photos and don't really expect it to grow or care about uptime, I'd say it's not worth the effort. In that scenario Domain.com's DNS should be fine for you. Full disclaimer: I work for NSONE.
