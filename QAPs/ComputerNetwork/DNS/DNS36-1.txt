★What problem does Dynamic DNS solve?
Computers work with numbers not names; but people find it easier to work with names. So there has to be a facility to match a name to a number (in this case, an IP address).   The number of IP addresses is a finite resource; and to make the most use of this, IP addresses are assigned as required, then when no longer needed by one host the number can be assigned to different host.   However, to match the name to the correct number, the DNS system has to be capable of being updated when the changes occur; otherwise, it would return the wrong IP address to a name request.
