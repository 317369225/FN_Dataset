★Who is the best and most cost effective managed DNS provider?
This is obviously subjective, however, there are a few significant players in the industry that are worth looking at. The key thing is to go with a provider that has an Anycast network. An Anycast network is going to have the best performance and the highest reliability. The providers that I know decently well that fit this bill include: UltraDNS:  As Sean mentions they are the original and probably the largest dns service provider. Overall they are reliable, however, they have been effectively DDOS'd which can cause the sites that use them to go down.  This last happened in April of 2009: http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/dd... Dynect from Dyn Inc:  They are probably the second largest player in the market and are fast gaining momentum.  They are used by a lot of sites that you might use including Twitter, Trulia, Meetup.com, Oyster.com (company I co-founded) and others. I tested their service against others and they are rock solid. We have been using them for the past 1.5 yrs and as far as we know they have never gone down and have always had excellent performance. DNS Made Easy:  I dont know much about them, however, they do run an Anycast network and they are the low cost provider in the space: http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/ Here is a great article that actually does an in depth comparison of some of the major DNS providers (two of which I mention above): http://dns.nuvvo.com/lesson/1162.... I hope this helps.
