â˜…How does Amazon's Route 53 compare to Google Public DNS and OpenDNS?
There are two types of DNS service. Authoritative and Recursive. Recursive is the part of DNS that translates domain names into IP addresses, e.g. type www.bbc.co.uk into a browser and it's a recursive DNS service which translates it to 212.58.246.91. Type that IP address into a browser and you'll arrive at the same website. Authoritative is the part of DNS that holds the information about which domains point to which IP addresses. In the above example, a Recursive DNS service would search Authoritative DNS to find out that www.bbc.co.uk points to 212.58.246.91. Domain owners publish their DNS information to authoritative DNS. Amazon Route 53 is an Authoritative DNS service. OpenDNS and Google Public DNS are Recursive DNS services.
