★Is there an alternative to IP & DNS?This question comes from the current legislation of SOPA.  In case of its passage, it seems that's it's time to institute a new means of domain name resolution and communication such that it's more challenging to be regulated / blocked by a central institution or government.  I'm very curious if anything is in the works or already available?
It's possible that https://github.com/namecoin/name..., which is a name service based on the bitcoin protocol may someday become a viable alternative, however there are plenty of hurdles in the way of it and ultimately if something like SOPA passes it may become a felony to work on software that circumvents government control.
