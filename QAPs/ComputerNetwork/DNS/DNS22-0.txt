★How does Amazon's Route 53 compare to Google Public DNS and OpenDNS?
Amazon Route 53 is an authoritative DNS service (with a really GREAT name).  It competes with folks like UltraDNS.com, Dyn.com and DNSMadeEasy.com. It does not compete with OpenDNS or Google Public DNS, both of which are recursive DNS services.  Recursive is the part of DNS that helps end-users resolve domains on the Internet.  Authoritative is the part of DNS that helps domain owners publish their DNS records.  Route 53 is offering tight integration with AWS and will be tying the APIs directly in the AWS load-balancing and other AWS services.  It's a natural evolution of AWS and a continued kick against the companies building on top of EC2, AWS and friends. People will say that this move won't impact the authoritative DNS providers because they are independent and people like having a 3rd party authoritative DNS service, but it will.  As more code is developed that tightly couples AWS and Route 53, people will start with what is easiest which will be Route 53 and then if Route 53 scales as it claims, they will end up sticking with it.  People talk about wanting heterogeneity in cloud service providers in theory, but in practice most people pick a vendor and stick with them exclusively.  This move will further cement AWS as the leader in cloud infrastructure.  IMHO, of course.
