â˜…Domain Name System (DNS): Which is better, Bind or PowerDNS?
I've used both for about 12 years, although these days I try to avoid BIND. I do like BIND but by comparison PowerDNS gives you much more choice and some cool features. The main ones are: Choice of back end - you can use BIND-like flat files if you want, but there's also sqlite, mysql, postgresql, ldap and more Choice of replication - you can use master/slave like BIND does, but you can also just replicate across your back end, e.g. by replicating your mysql database between your various nameservers Ability to make alterations without restarting - this is very useful if you have a large number of zones and anticipate a lot of changes, as BIND has to load these in every restart Customisation of caching - you can cache queries and packets - increase if you want less load on your back end, decrease for more responsiveness. Supermaster - one of my favourite features - you can say to a slave "That host there is your supermaster" then whenever a new zone is added to the supermaster the slave will create the zone on itself and request an AXFR. In Bind you have to create a new slave zone on every secondary. Some negative things I've heard people say about PowerDNS: "I don't want my data in MySQL - that would slow it down" - in that case use caching or use a flat file format - PowerDNS gives you the choice. "I don't want to have to replicate my databases to update my secondaries - that sounds unreliable" - in that case use regular master/slave replicate or setup a supermaster - again you have the choice with PowerDNS. "X,Y or Z is so easy with BIND" - really, then try PowerDNS with SQLite3 or MySQL with PowerAdmin (web based admin tool). It really doesn't get a lot easier.
