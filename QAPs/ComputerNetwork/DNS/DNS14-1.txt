★Is there an alternative to IP & DNS?This question comes from the current legislation of SOPA.  In case of its passage, it seems that's it's time to institute a new means of domain name resolution and communication such that it's more challenging to be regulated / blocked by a central institution or government.  I'm very curious if anything is in the works or already available?
I don't think the problem is DNS or IP here.  It's easy to configure around broken DNS servers that return the incorrect (censored) response for a given hostname. The problem is that using or providing such DNS servers would be illegal.  If there were some alternative to IP / DNS, presumably using it would be similarly illegal.  This is a people problem, not a technical one.
