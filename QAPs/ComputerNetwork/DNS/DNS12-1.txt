★Why isn't DNS centralized?
Amplifying William Emmanuel Yu's answer: pre-DNS, as "hostmaster" - the person on site responsible for keeping the hosts.txt file up to date on all on systems connected to the ARAPnet gateway, it was a giant pain in the ass. There was  a single source of authority - SRI NIC. So if you added a new host, you would email them and let them know. Updates were not instantaneous, but batched. So every couple of days (eventually every day) you'd get a new hosts.txt file that you had to distribute to all of the systems under you authority. In the meantime, you might have added more local hosts - part of your network, but not hosts you wanted to advertise to the world - and would have made local hosts.txt modifications. Or you might have systems administrators who added their own local hosts.txt modifications to allow their system to access other such obscured systems in other networks. Once personal workstations such as those from Sun Microsystems arrived, and with the advent of John Romkey's MIT LCS IBM PC TCP/IP package, all bets were off about keeping consistency across the board. It was bad as it was; if updates HAD been instantaneous I probably would have shot someone. DNS - as primitive as the first implementation I wrote was - was a GIANT step forward over that. Hence my motivation to start coding as soon as Paul's paper hit my inbox.
