★Why does DNS use UDP?
Performance is a big reason.  By comparison, TCP connections are very "expensive" with the whole SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK chain of events.  Generally a dns response can fit within a single packet with lots of room to spare, so using TCP for DNS really is killing the proverbial rabbit with an h-bomb. If you're interested in more DNS nuts and bolts, Steve Gibson has covered it over the course of several podcasts.  Take a look at the episodes listed at http://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm and just look for DNS.  In particular, episode 155 (http://www.grc.com/securitynow.h...) is worth checking out.
