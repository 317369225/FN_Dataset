â˜…What is the difference between URL Forwarding and attaching with DNS?One is URL forwarding to any other website and another means to attach directly with server using DNS settings.. Is there any difference? If not then why there are two different terms?
URL redirection, also called URL forwarding, is a World Wide Web technique for making a web page available under more than one URL address. When a web browser attempts to open a URL that already has been redirected, a page with a different URL is opened. Similarly, Domain redirection or domain forwarding is when all pages in a URL domain are redirected to a different domain, as when Wikipedia and Wikipedia are automatically redirected to Wikipedia. URL redirection can be used for URL shortening, to prevent broken links when web pages are moved, to allow multiple domain names belonging to the same owner to refer to a single web site, to guide navigation into and out of a website, for privacy protection, and for less innocuous purposes such as phishing attacks.
