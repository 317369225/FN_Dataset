â˜…What are some experiences with the Zerigo managed DNS service?Need a cheap, reliable managed DNS provider with a simple (preferably Ruby-compatible) API. Other alternatives very welcome!
Currently there is a global outtage at Zerigo, affecting all the services which hosts DNS there. This lasts for a good few hours already already and there is close to none response from Zerigo. All we know, this might be DDOS related, but no ETA or further explanation whatsoever. I guess this pretty much sums up the service as a whole. Its was fine while it worked, but the reaction to the issues is horrible, so I am not even considering using it anymore.
