â˜…Should I get premium DNS hosting for my website?I registered my website using Domain.com but not I'm wondering if I should consider a premium DNS hosting like Amazon Route 53 or Godaddy Premium DNS. Will it make any real difference vs. my current situation, with my DNS handled by Domain.com?
I would recommend a DNS Hosting service like Cloudflare (which has free and paid tiers; all include goodies like CDN, etc.) or Rage4 DNS, which is stable and secure, and has useful things like Uptimerobot integration and GeoDNS support. Rage4 is free for under a certain # of lookups per month and its fairly cheap for more.
