â˜…What is DNS Poisoning?And how can we protect ourselves from it ? Does it mean everything we know about security is flawed ? http://ketil.froyn.name/poison.html
DNS Poisoning also known as DNS Cache Poisoning is an attack where the attacker tries to insert false DNS records in your DNS cache. Usually you will use the DNS resolver of your ISP. When you try to connect to another computer by name, the application (browser, mail, ...) will ask the resolver to translate the name to an ip address. The attacker will send bogus DNS responses to the resolver. If successful the resolver will translate the name to a wrong ip address. And because the resolver will cache the answer, the faulty answer will be used for a longer timeframe. The Kaminsky bug is the best known DNS poisinong attack and it works. There is no work around. There are some mitigations but the problem can not be fixed with backwards compatibility. The one true solution to the problem is DNSSEC. Which after the Kaminsky bug has been deployed in the root and many top level domains. Lately even some of the largest ISPs have started to run validating (DNSSEC responses) resolvers. So in case you run your own resolver, DNSSEC is worth looking into. And if your banks domain isn't DNSSEC enabled, you should ask them why.
