★What is the best dynamic DNS service provider?I've used dyndns.com and no-ip.org in the past, but I'm curious if there's anything better.
If you need a dynamic DNS for both IPv4 and IPv6, i also recommend Free Dynamic DNS - Managed DNS - IPv6 for LAN: 1. nice and secure website (dnssec, https, ipv6 support) 2. large variety of clients (gui, console, windows service) for basicaly all kind of OS-es, including home router's firmwares like openwrt, rasberry, tomato, dd-wrt, etc.                                                                                3. technical support open to features request.                            4. ipv6 for lan feature for free.
