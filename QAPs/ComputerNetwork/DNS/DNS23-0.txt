★What is the most reliable DNS service provider?Like openDNS, EasyDNS, etc ... there are several, I am looking for reliability.
(Based on the providers you mention, I'm assuming you are looking for DNS lookup provider for a home/work internet connection rather than a DNS hosting provider to manage DNS for your domains and websites) For most cases the DNS provided by your ISP is usually fine - sure a 3rd party service might be able to resolve lookups 5ms faster than your ISP, but is that really noticeable?  By using a 3rd party DNS provider you trade in the value of having everything beyond your modem/router managed by you ISP and thus if a support issue occurs then it's totally theirs to resolve.  Suddenly you are dealing with 2 different parties with your ISP able to palm you off to confirm your DNS is working correctly before they will deal with your support issue. If you do want to explore using a 3rd party, try NameBench (http://code.google.com/p/namebench/) a free tool from Google that will tell you wish DNS provider is fastest based on your ISP's peering agreements etc. I believe strongly in open, net-neutrality oriented internet connections and so I don't feel that companies should be filtering or blocking websites at work (if people are looking at porn at work, it's a training/disciplin issue not a technical issue) but if you must go down the route of using DNS provider to provide monitoring and filtering, OpenDNS is probably your best bet.
