â˜…What are some experiences with the Zerigo managed DNS service?Need a cheap, reliable managed DNS provider with a simple (preferably Ruby-compatible) API. Other alternatives very welcome!
Zerigo is very competitive for the price/features. I've been a customer for a few years now, and I have all my non-critical DNS hosting with them. They have a nice API, functional web interface, good support. I started with free domains (which you can make stretch a long time if you manage your TTLs properly), and have since upgraded to one of the lower tier pay plans. Taking a quick look at DNSimple, I like that DNSimple has an iPhone app, but I don't like their jump to $120/yr after 10 domains (Compared to 20 domains for $19/yr that I pay Zerigo) For more critical sites, you should go with an AnyCast DNS provider - I use DNSMadeEasy. See a little blog blurb I did about my DNS services I use: http://www.mikeschroll.com/blog/... I also just did a little writeup of DNS Providers: How does zerigo compare to pointhq? - my thoughts were that Zerigo is superior.
