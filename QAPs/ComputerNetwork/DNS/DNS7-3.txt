â˜…What is the best free authoritative DNS service?What companies provide authoritative DNS free for reasonable numbers of domains and queries.
http://www.zerigo.com offers a limited free service, which I recommend. You can also find a more thorough comparison of providers, including those offering free tiers here: http://socialcompare.com/en/comp... Keep in mind that you can leverage free services and their limited monthly queries by wisely choosing your TTLs: Set them as high as you're willing to tolerate, particularly for records which change most in-frequently, such as MX records. Update: I now use http://www.namecheap.com and http://www.cloudflare.com more than zerigo. Update 2: Zerigo has discontinued their free DNS offering.
