★Amazon Route 53: How flexible is AWS (DNS example)?If we wanted to host a DNS server, which probably has very little traffic, do we only pay for when it's responding to a request?  Or do we need to always have at least one instance listening for requests?  Or does the "W" in AWS mean port 80/443 only?
AWS now offers Route53, Amazon's DNS solution.  It's backed fully by a programatic API, a suite of tools (Python, command-line, etc.), you pay per lookup or usage, and it's very cheap (no instance hour costs).  I just gave it a test spin today, and liked (both through their web console and via the Python boto Route53 module).  It may still not fit your special-case needs, but it does for example support weighted or latency-based load balancing - very cool stuff.
