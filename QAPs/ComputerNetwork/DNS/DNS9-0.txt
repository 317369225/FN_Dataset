â˜…Who owns the DNS root zone?
Let us reframe the questions to "who controls the root zone?" Even that question is still a very infected discussion between countries. And on a very high political level. Arguments over the root zone staled DNSSEC for over a decade. Right now Verisign runs the root zone as contractor to ICANN. But changes have to be made through the IANA function at ICANN. When changes are excepted by IANA, ICANN will approve changes and henceforth send them to the US department of commerce. When approved the changes will be made in the root zone and distributed to all root servers. As you can see, right now the US have actual control of the root zone. That is a point of irritation for many countries.
