â˜…How does DNS resolving work for Tor Hidden Services?How does one register a new "hidden service domain"? Do you pay someone? If not, how is spam prevented? Related: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Namecoin
Hidden services don't have human-readable addresses. The actual .onion address is derived from the hidden service's public key. There is a distributed hash table mapping .onion addresses to hidden service descriptors. Hidden service descriptors don't actually contain the address of the server running the hidden service. They contain the service's public key, and a list of a introduction points. The client requests a connection to the hidden service through one of the introduction points. Note that connections to and from introduction points are through Tor circuits. The introduction points don't actually know the identity of the hidden service, they only know how to create connections that will reach them. This means that the person hosting the hidden service is (in theory) anonymous as well. A slightly more in-depth explanation is here, if you want it: https://www.torproject.org/docs/...
