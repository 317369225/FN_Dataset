â˜…Who hosts your .io DNS?.io domans require at least one of the name servers to be located in the Indian Ocean. GoDaddy, my normal registrar/DNS host doesn't have that. I can't find any info on whether AWS does either. Who do you use for hosting .io DNS?
I'd vouch for Gandi too. They're great in many aspects: good prices, great support, an honest company, good admin interfaces, etc.
