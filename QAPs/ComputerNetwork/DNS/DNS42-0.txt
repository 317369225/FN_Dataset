★How does Google Public DNS work?How Google Public DNS works where other DNS failed to load a website?
DNS does not load websites. The DNS is a distributed database designed to store and retrieve Resource Records (RR) about the Internet (e.g. IP addresses). One such resource record is the A RR (or in the case of IPv6 the AAAA RR). When your browser attempts to connect to a website, it first must "resolve" (query the DNS)  the domain name to a corresponding A RR (the IPv4 address of the website) or AAAA RR (the IPv6 address, if any).   What happens is that due to either connectivity problems, different paths, misconfiguration, load, caching (and the list can go on) your ISP may or may not be able to retrieve the appropriate information so as to guide your browser to retrieve the page you wish it to load from the server you want it to get it from.  Remember the the whole URL notation is just a query in the form:   how://where/what   with how most of the times equal to http.   Now due to the fact that Google is pretty well connected, it can have the infrastructure to cache DNS information effectively, sometimes more effectively than many ISPs. So by having users from many ISPs ask the same DNS servers for name resolution, it can offer a single view of the web (and the rest of the Internet) to users from many providers, regardless of the state of the ISPs (caching) DNS servers. So how does Google do it? By providing the same DNS view to everyone that queries their Public DNS infrastructure, while at the same time being well connected  on key parts of the Internet (Tier-1 providers).    Note that Google is not alone in providing such services. OpenDNS provides a similar service.
