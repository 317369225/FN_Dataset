★What is dns delegation?
When the authoritative name server for a domain receives a request for a subdomain's records and responds with NS records for other name servers, that is DNS delegation. Essentially it is saying "I am passing on authority for this subdomain to another collection of name servers, go ask them for the details." For example, "com" is a domain that delegates all (or perhaps almost all) of its subdomains to other name servers. When a request is received at a "com" name server for "google.com", the "com" name server responds with NS records pointing to Google's name servers. The dig command with the +trace option will demonstrate. Try `dig +trace google.com` and part of it will look like this:     google.com. 172800 IN NS ns2.google.com.     google.com. 172800 IN NS ns1.google.com.     google.com. 172800 IN NS ns3.google.com.     google.com. 172800 IN NS ns4.google.com.     ;; Received 164 bytes from 192.31.80.30#53(d.gtld-servers.net) in 150 ms Those NS records indicate that those 4 Google name servers are authoritative for the google.com domain.
