★How does my mobile phone network operator know that I am using my data plan for tethering?Are they analysing packets or ports to identify tethering, so that they can block it?
Your  laptop's packets are forwarded through your cellphone to the network.  In the HTTP headers, information is passed from your laptop to the server and back. This is  how the server knows what characters you can display, what browser you  are using, how large or small your display is, etc, Take a look  at the HTTP header information ... it gives you an idea of what all is  passed from the client (your laptop or cellphone) to the server, and  back: List of HTTP header fields User Agent is one of the key fields used to determine if someone is tethering their cellphone. When you initially register your phone to the network, your phone's number (MSISDN) is mapped to a group of phone users.  All users in that group are allowed and not allowed certain services, features, data rates, a connection to the Internet, to certain cloud servers, etc. etc. Policies are enforced in the network using DPI or Deep packet inspection    Embed Quote
