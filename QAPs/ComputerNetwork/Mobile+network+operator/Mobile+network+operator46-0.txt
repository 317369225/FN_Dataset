★Why do mobile virtual network operator (MVNOs) such as SIMYO or Pepephone.com in Spain charge a fee for establishing the call in some of their packages? Is this common in Europe?What is the economic rationale behind this decision?
It depends on the market. In the Spanish market, yes, it used to be customary to charge a call setup fee when plans are billed based on voice minutes usage. This is standard in mostly every Spanish carrier, not only the two you cite. The reasons for this are unclear, possibly due to the existence of a former oligopoly of just three carriers (Movistar, Vodafone, Orange) which made price structures quite rigid, or possibly related to the old call termination scheme imposed by the CMT (now CNMC). This is the way in which carriers compensate each other for calls to/from clients in different carriers. In the past, this scheme mandated either a call setup fee, or that they bill each other a whole minute for all calls under 60 seconds. My guess is that it comes from the price structure first set by Telefónica/Movistar in the early 2000s with other carriers simply replicating it. Other European countries may differ. As of 2014, however, plans are increasingly billing data usage and forgetting about voice calls (some even giving them away), and plans billed by the minute are becoming less and less important in carriers' revenue, so setup fees are more and more irrelevant.    Embed Quote
