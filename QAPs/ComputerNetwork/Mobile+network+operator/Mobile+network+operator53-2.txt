★What are the recent trends that are revolutionizing online and mobile Payments?
An interesting trend, especially given the retail planning for the upcoming holiday season, is that consumers are beginning to expect the ultimate online shopping experience from everywhere and on every device. The ultimate online shopping experience on a laptop is different than that on a tablet, or a mobile phone, and still different on an iOS or an Android. Retailers are coming to understand that with the rise of smartphone penetration and mobile payments, consumers don't just expect for the payment process to be quick and easy while using a store app. The ability to continue shopping whether at the mall, at the park, at the grocery store, etc. has risen the consumer expectations of the shopping experience, and that phenomenon has begged the demand for adaptive checkouts, that are optimized across all types of devices. In turn, even when a consumer logs into an eCommerce store from their laptop, and they could technically use their keyboard to fill in a form, they still expect a quick payment option. This is why Zooz recently released its exciting Web Checkout 3.0  (Read our blog about Web Checkout 3.0 - All About User Experience), enabling eCommerce sites to optimize the payment process on any device. *I work at Zooz.    Embed Quote
