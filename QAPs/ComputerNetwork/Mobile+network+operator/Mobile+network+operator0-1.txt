★What are good tools for identifying mobile network operator based on IP address?Mobile analytics, categorizing mobile traffic by mobile operator/carrier
As Ben Dowling said below, the best way is likely by doing a lookup on the ASN the IP belongs to. I haven't looked much into it, however you can likely obtain an offline copy of ASNs and the ranges they announce to check against. This can cause false positives in the case of users who use 3G/4G for their home Internet (mainly people in rural areas with low broadband penetration). One way to prevent that is to check the user agent string the browser presents. If the string matches a mobile browser then the person is more likely than not connecting off a phone or mobile device. If it's a desktop UA string, they're likely tethered, using a USB 3G/4G modem, or using a mobile hotspot of some kind.    Embed Quote
