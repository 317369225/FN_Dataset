★What are the recent trends that are revolutionizing online and mobile Payments?
With reference to Indian market: All prepaid instruments (web, mobile, card) will tie up with NPCI and offer interoperable funds transfer. This will be next.  NPCI's IMPS will eat away Mastercard and VISA. Smart card, credit card, debit card, POS everything will go away. Mobile Payment companies will make money not out of transaction fees from consumers but from data analytics on purchase behaviour (loyalty programs/coupons) from retailers.    Embed Quote
