★How can (if possible) a mobile network operator or an ISP distinguish between a data over VoIP vs a different transport protocol for differentiated billing?How will a telecom provider determine that user used x MB for downloading a Youtube video while he used y MB for voice call over internet? Yes, they can read all packet headers, but is that a legal thing to do (with reference to provider like Airtel India charging consumers for use of Skype, Line, Viber like application for making voice calls)?
Looking at the headers of a packet will give you a good idea of what the payload is (but can still be a false positive). DPI (deep packet inspection) isn't really a violation of privacy because it only reveals meta-types, not actual content. Where it gets dubious is when they are tracking content. Fortunately we also have SSL when you are actually concerned about privacy.    Embed Quote
