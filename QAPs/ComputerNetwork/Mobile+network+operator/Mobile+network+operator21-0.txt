★Is the rolling out of 3G/4G by mobile network operators considered product innovation or simply a diffusion?
There is an interesting thesis looking a Product Innovation by operators. It is very hard and very rare. Deploying someone else's technology (eg 3G/4G networks developed by someone else) doesn't count. That is diffusion. But a more worthwhile discussion would be to see which carriers have done something innovative.    Embed Quote
