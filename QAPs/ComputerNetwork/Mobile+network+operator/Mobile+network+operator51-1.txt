★How can (if possible) a mobile network operator or an ISP distinguish between a data over VoIP vs a different transport protocol for differentiated billing?How will a telecom provider determine that user used x MB for downloading a Youtube video while he used y MB for voice call over internet? Yes, they can read all packet headers, but is that a legal thing to do (with reference to provider like Airtel India charging consumers for use of Skype, Line, Viber like application for making voice calls)?
I have yet to hear of a single instance where DPI was considered illegal, in any jurisdiction. And given the precedent of the NSA, I think it's only fair to assume that everyone has the capability.    Embed Quote
