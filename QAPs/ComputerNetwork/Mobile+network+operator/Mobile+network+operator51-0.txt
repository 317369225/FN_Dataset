★How can (if possible) a mobile network operator or an ISP distinguish between a data over VoIP vs a different transport protocol for differentiated billing?How will a telecom provider determine that user used x MB for downloading a Youtube video while he used y MB for voice call over internet? Yes, they can read all packet headers, but is that a legal thing to do (with reference to provider like Airtel India charging consumers for use of Skype, Line, Viber like application for making voice calls)?
This has been a common practice in the wireless industry since at least 2006. I had a startup building mobile VoIP services blow up when AT&T figured out that the "mobile data only" MVNO I'd contracted for was really mostly VoIP with a little web thrown in for UI. As to how, it's dead easy to pick out SIP, RTP/SecureRTP, RTCP, ENUM and the other protocols used to set up and operate a voice session. And as others note, it's all completely legal. Think of it like this: it's illegal to open a physical letter and read the contents, but if you don't read the envelope, it can't be delivered. Pretty much the same standard applies to network traffic. DPI gets to be a little dicier, and in the end, is generally deemed legal if it's being used for "internal network operations" functions. Using it for say "law enforcement" functions is being litigated but is likely to have the same standards as wiretap applied.    Embed Quote
