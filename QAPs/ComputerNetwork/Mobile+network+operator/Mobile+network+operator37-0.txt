★How does my mobile phone network operator know that I am using my data plan for tethering?Are they analysing packets or ports to identify tethering, so that they can block it?
This varies between operators, but typically the traffic will be marked with a different APN if you use the native or the provided tethering feature. Occasionally, traffic might use that APN if you have both Wi-Fi and 3G interfaces up, capturing any Wi-Fi tethering. (FYI: my company makes an app that can be used for mobile Internet sharing.)    Embed Quote
