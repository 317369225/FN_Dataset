★How does a Mobile Network operates thru signals Are the signals continous clusters of bits 0's and 1's? Pls explain in simple terms
I am by no means an expert but I've taken a few courses which have given me a detailed look at how things like this work. The simplest answer is yes.  Bits are just an easy representation of hi and low signals. 0V is typically referred to as ground, and 3.3V, 5V, whatever voltage based on the system, could represent a 1. Negative voltages apply as well for different coding schemes (known as line coding). I'm not exactly sure any more on the frames that are sent for mobile technologies, but for computer networks the TCP/IP model has a consistent framing structure. Many headers are added to the original data (your voice lets say) which contains information on where the data is going. All of these headers and data is all translated into 1s and 0s which is then sent out to other computers using combinations of sine waves. Communication Systems, Telecommunication Networks, Computer Networks, RF Circuit Design and Principles, Electromagnetic Engineering, Analog Integrated Circuit Analysis and Design, ... The list goes on. These are all classes I've taken to get my degree and the beginning courses seemed very different, but each was fundamental in understanding the courses I listed above, and each of those courses play a role in understanding how the mobile phone works. For something just about everyone takes for granted these days on ease of use, it takes A LOT of learning, understanding, and hard work to truly respect the power we hold in our hands. Hopefully this answer if fairly accurate, and if not someone can supply a better, simpler answer or edits, and implores you to dig deeper on the understanding of networking, signals, digital systems, circuits, and more!    Embed Quote
