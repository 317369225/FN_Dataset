★What are the recent trends that are revolutionizing online and mobile Payments?
Using mobile money to make online payments. This is what my start-up VirtualBank Africa is into. In Africa, where few have access to credit cards, VirtualBank Africa is working to allow people without bank accounts to make online payments. We will achieve this by leveraging the mobile money infrastructure which is now very popular there. VirtualBank Africa will also use the same technique to make it safer and cheaper to send remittances to people without bank accounts. We are starting off in Zimbabwe (with http://www.virtualbank.co.zw) where only 30 percent of the countries population have access to bank accounts this figure is declining as the people there are losing confidence in the banking sector. But there is 80% mobile peneration rate and the leading mobile money provider there: Ecocash, for example is growing at a rate of 200K subscribers a month.    Embed Quote
