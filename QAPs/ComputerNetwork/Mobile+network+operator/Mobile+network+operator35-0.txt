★Mobile Virtual Network Operators: What does it take to set up an MVNO?
There are a few platform providers that can provide you everything you need to get a MVNO started for much less than it would have cost a few years ago.  These platforms provide you with provisioning, billing, call details, and some of them provide customer service for a flat fee per month per customer.  You would still need an agreement with a MNO and the only one that will deal with you directly is Sprint.  The cost of a full implementation of Sprint is pretty expensive, so you would want to go through an agregator that would provide lower upfront costs and in some cases would have a lower per minute fee than you could get directly from the carrier due to the volume they are bringing to the MNO.    Embed Quote
