★Wireless Technology: Would it makes sense for a mobile network operator to offer phone plans for just data and ignore voice and texts?The cost for a person to send a text or make a phone call are much higher than if that person used Skype or similar software and only paid for the data. So would it be cheaper to have a system where you only use data and can opt out of any additional minutes and texts?
It makes perfect sense. Because for packet switched connection the capacity of the network is higher (from network operator perspective). From user perspective, as with the keyboard typing a message is as fast as talking to a person (who also has a smartphone as well). Obviously, here I am assuming the operator is blocking services like Skype etc. Finally for instant messenger services, the operators can only use common channels (as the data rate is low), hence they can save the dedicated channels for heavy lifting like file download etc. for circuit services like voice, they have to allocate the precious wireless resources to the call for the whole duration of the call.    Embed Quote
