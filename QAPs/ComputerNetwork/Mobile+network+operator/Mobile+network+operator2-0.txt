★What new alternative services, ideas would you like your mobile network operator to offer?
Wifi, wifi wifi! I think it's quite clear that most operators cannot keep up with the demand for bits that their users are generating. Operators are being strained to keep up with the demand and as a result are capping usage and/or charging very high prices for larger amounts of data usage. With a fixed amount of spectrum and an ever-growing number of applications and smartphone uses this problem will not be going away anytime soon. A good solution to this is for operators to deploy and operator is thousands of hotspots around urban areas that can be easily accessed by their subscribers. (TrueMobile in Thailand has approx 100,000 hotspots and AIS has approx 70,000 hotspots) It would be ideal if users' devices could seamlessly connect to these hotspots without logging in, therefore majority of the day would be spend on the hotspots without any additional effort from the user. I think this could be done by broadcasting one seamless network or with additional software on the handset (pretty sure this could be done on Android phones, unsure about other platforms).    Embed Quote
