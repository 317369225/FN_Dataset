★What are the recent trends that are revolutionizing online and mobile Payments?
Following this thread, it would seem that trends revolutionizing online and mobile payments revolve around smartphones, at least in the US.   One can break it down into two categories that end up intermixing to some degree: "Remote" payments - consumers paying directly on their smartphones through browsers and apps "Proximity" payments - consumers paying when their smartphones connect to contactless payment readers at a physical retail store Remote payments are following the trajectory of e-commerce, it's just that consumers are shifting more of their online activity from PC to tablet and then to smartphones.   Proximity payments are driven by trends that are finally pushing mass-market availability and acceptance of contactless payments from smartphones instead of payment cards: EMV payment adoption, which will harmonize US payment acceptance with ther rest of the world over the next 5 years Industry consolidation around NFC as the leading technology standard to drive secure, short-range payments at points-of-sale NFC smartphone uptake, not just the availability (which is finally starting to happen) but also the consumer purchase and usage of such devices Comprehensive solutions connecting EMV payments with NFC smartphones and security standards, such as Isis I believe we will continue to see a revolution in proximity payments over the next 2-5 years, particularly as merchants and consumers realize the value of mobile commerce going beyond payments.  From targeted coupons to loyalty redemption, mobile wallets will continue to expand what proximity payments have to offer.    Embed Quote
