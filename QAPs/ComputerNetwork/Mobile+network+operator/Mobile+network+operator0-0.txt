★What are good tools for identifying mobile network operator based on IP address?Mobile analytics, categorizing mobile traffic by mobile operator/carrier
Given an IP you can lookup its ASN, which will usually correspond to the carrier. When I visit http://ipinfo.io from my mobile device you'll see that it shows the network as "AS20057 AT&T Wireless Service". If you've got a mobile IP and I want to find the carrier you can look up up on http://ipinfo.io, or another approach is to do a whois query from the command line. Simply doing "whois <ip>" will give you the ASN along with a bunch of other information, but there are specialist whois servers who provide detailed ASN related information, including shadowserver.org and cymru.com. Here's an example: $ whois -h whois.cymru.com 166.137.209.150 AS      | IP               | AS Name 20057   | 166.137.209.150  | AT&T Wireless Service    Embed Quote
