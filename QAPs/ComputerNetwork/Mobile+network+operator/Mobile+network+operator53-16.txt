★What are the recent trends that are revolutionizing online and mobile Payments?
Lots of good comments, the way I would structure the disruptions is: Mobile devices: Mobile phones and tablets are increasingly ubiquitous and change people's shopping behaviour. Mobile commerce turns into the connecting point between online and offline commerce Contactless Point of Sale: Contactless payment methods (e.g. NFC) enable mobile payments using an eWallet in stores. They replace cash & card wallets and integrate added value services such as coupons, vouchers and loyalty programs (closing the data loop) Emerging markets: Emerging economies (BRIC) represent 20% of the global economy. They are fast growing (5-10%), heavily cash based and show rapid mobilisation. This creates a significant growth opportunity particularly for mobile payments  Digital goods: Real world services like movies, music, games, books and news are replaced by online services. They require different monetization models and shift offline payments into mobile or online. Think recurring payments, micropayments, etc.   This report goes into detail about the disruptive trends in payments: http://www.uniqloud.com/beta/pay...    Embed Quote
