★How can I reasonably estimate the ARPU uplift from the introduction of 3G and/or 4G by a mobile network operator?
Why would you want to estimate? If you have the data of the charges made to customers, you actually get the increase in ARPU! If you are an outsider to the company, you many not have enough data to definitively attribute the change in ARPU to a new service offered. The split of ARPU, or the different revenue sources like Call, SMS, Data and VAS will be required to make a good estimate. Insiders can have access to this info, and even segment the market and drive better insights. Also, one gotta have a qualitative understanding of how the user behavior changed in the markets where the new services are introduced. Shift to Data, larger Data plans, more VAS services, etc.    Embed Quote
