★How can I become an intern for Jimmy Wales?
I live in London and my primary day-to-day job, as of quite recently, is building the social networking software for The People's Operator mobile virtual network operator. If you can legally be in London for an internship, we can talk. There would be other options for both Wikimedia (both the Foundation and local chapters) and for Wikia - but  you wouldn't be an intern for me personally in that case.  Still, would be quite fun and cool I think!    Embed Quote
