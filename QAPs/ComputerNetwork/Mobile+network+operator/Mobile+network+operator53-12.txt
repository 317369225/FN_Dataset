★What are the recent trends that are revolutionizing online and mobile Payments?
There are a lot of interesting trends that are affecting the online and mobile payments space, but I think on the whole the most interesting one is that banking is divorcing itself from banks. Consumer trust in banks is at an all time low and thats really helped social networks and web apps move into the payments space. They offer more flexibility and better experiences than banks do, which is why we're seeing so many no companies in the payments space.
