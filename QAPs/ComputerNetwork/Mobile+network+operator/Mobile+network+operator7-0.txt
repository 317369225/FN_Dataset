★Why don't UK mobile network operators offer 12 month contracts any more?In the UK, a phone tariff used to typically be 12-18 months. When and why did 12 month contracts get dropped in favour of 18-24 month offers?
Most consumers prefer a 'cheap' or 'free' handset coupled with a high long-term monthly contract over paying up for the handset today with no long-term commitment. What's changed is that consumers now want a 'cheap' or 'free' smartphone and the only way the operator can afford that is by doubling the length of the contract. It takes AT&T 18 months to earn back the difference between what you paid for your iPhone and what Apple charged AT&T.    Embed Quote
