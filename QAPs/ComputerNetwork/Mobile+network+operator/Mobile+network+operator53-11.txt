★What are the recent trends that are revolutionizing online and mobile Payments?
Not sure this counts as a 'recent trend' given only one country has done it yet, the others that want to will take 3-5 years and the US is not even planning to join the trend at this time. In the UK the national retail domestic settlement infrastructure (think ACH in US) is built on a system that moves funds in seconds, once in destination account funds are final irrevocable cleared funds immediately. Cost is a flat price of a few pence. Many other national central banks, regulators and central clearing houses around the world have seen and decided they want that too. The US at this time views there is not sufficient business case to even plan to build it.
