★I get online with a dongle (branded with the name of my local mobile network operator) on a laptop that runs Windows 8. How can I share my Internet so that I can get online with my other devices through this connection?
There are several ways to share your internet connection with other devices, but I'm assuming you want to create a WiFi network to do so. The most simple way to do this is to use a software, which creates a WiFi network from your laptop. Although this is the easiest way, many of the software which allow you to do this are paid. You might find free versions of them, but they are highly restricted. So if you are going to be doing this often, you should get a proper license for the software. Also, this requires you to have your laptop with you always and connect the dongle to the laptop.

These prices vary from mid range to expensive, so depending on your usage, you should get the appropriate one. I've provided a link under this text for the routers. Note that many of them include an option to insert a SIM card inside, whose data plan you can use.

Depending on your network operator, most of them have an option called MiFi. Its basically a portable WiFi hotspot device. Looking at your requirements, this seems to be the best option. I've listed a couple of them below. You can contact your network operator and ask them to switch your connection to one that gives you this option. Since you already seem to have a dongle, you might want to consider the first two options, but its always good to invest in a MiFi device. Check out the MTS MBlaze Ultra WiFi    Embed Quote
