★Is there any profit sharing arrangement between mobile network operators and Facebook on Facebook mobile data bundle plans?
There might be, never heard of any. However, most of the time I'm never able to finish the special pack. Maybe they offer it cheaply because Facebook.com is not bandwidth heavy and you can't finish off a lot of data in a small time. (profit for them) They are always profiting anyway, so their might be no reason to offer separate packs.    Embed Quote
