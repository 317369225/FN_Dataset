★Why are MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) mobile plans so cheap compared to actual network operator mobile plans?
They are able to get whole sale rates from their host MNO and resell them. They are free to mix and match them in anyway they want. In some cases, the MVNO already has an existing retail channel and marketing machinery. The costs of these two are very substantial for a host MNO. This gives them the flexibility to pass some of their potential margins to customer.    Embed Quote
