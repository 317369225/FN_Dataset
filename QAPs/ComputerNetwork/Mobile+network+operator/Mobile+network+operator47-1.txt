★How have third-party OTT mobile VoIP services impacted upon network operator services?
If by network operator services yo mean the MNOs, remember that VoIP is just another data packet and the size of those packets depend on the CoDec used (Codecs are used to convert an analog voice signal to digitally encoded version). An uncompressed VoIP CoDec like G711 can take as much as 68Kbps where G729 about 18Kbps (including header). I have thoroughly tested various types of CoDecs on different type of networks in order to determine which CoDec works best at any given access (MNO data network, wifi). The way we set up our VoIP Mobile apps is to use G711 for the MNO data network whereas if the customer is on a wifi connection , G729 is preferred. You would frown upon why am I going to put more strain on a less controllable environment like that of at&t 4G or LTE or T-Mobile's HSPA networks and it is totally valid: an internal test we made determined that using G711 consumes as much as 1.5Mb of transfer rate per minute so if you make a one-hour call, well, you have put down 90Mb off your data plan; ouch. Like everything else, it has its logic and I will use the ruler analogy: We agree the 68Kbps transfer rates is higher consumption than 18Kbps, simple math, 68 > 18. We also agree that a 24-inch ruler is bigger than say a, 8-inch ruler. if you chop out 3 inches from each ruler, whos has the propensity to loose the most compared to its size? Exactly, packet loss which is very common on a MNO data network on top of the fact that we are double-compressing G711 for VoIP, and that data packet over the MNOs compression, would affect much more a smaller packet compressed into 18K rather than one at 68K. This is the explanation I would give to the girl seating next to me on a LGA-SFO flight after she asked me what is it what I do because if it were a guy, the technical explanation is so much complicated that he would request a seat change on the spot. Exactly!    Embed Quote
