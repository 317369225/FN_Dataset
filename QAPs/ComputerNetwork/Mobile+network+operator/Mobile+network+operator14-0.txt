★What are the mobile network operators available in the Andaman Island area, specifically Port Blair?
BSNL: present almost everywhere. Airtel: present at most places. Vodafone: limited reach, has a tie up with Tata Docomo, hence Docomo is available on roaming. P.S: there is no Andaman island, there is the Andaman group of islands. Port Blair is located on South Andaman.    Embed Quote
