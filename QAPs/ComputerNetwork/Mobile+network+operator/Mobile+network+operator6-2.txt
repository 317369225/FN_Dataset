★What most annoys people with mobile network operators?
* SIM locking phones and making it slow and expensive or impossible to unlock even if you're willing to pay a reasonable fee. * customized firmware with lots of bloat, and even spy ware, then not providing updates * only having the cheapest variant of a model with less flash storage etc * the whole contract and subsidy model which means you pay for the phone twice over    Embed Quote
