★How can (if possible) a mobile network operator or an ISP distinguish between a data over VoIP vs a different transport protocol for differentiated billing?How will a telecom provider determine that user used x MB for downloading a Youtube video while he used y MB for voice call over internet? Yes, they can read all packet headers, but is that a legal thing to do (with reference to provider like Airtel India charging consumers for use of Skype, Line, Viber like application for making voice calls)?
Hi, Being a Solution Architect for Packet Core Networks, I may be in a good position to explain this .I saw a lot of related question, The answer to this question would be by packet inspection at L3/L4/L7 and heuristic bases in the PCEF. I had written and article to explain this process. If you want a detailed understanding to this please refer Service Aware Policy and Charging Control in Modern ISPs    Embed Quote
