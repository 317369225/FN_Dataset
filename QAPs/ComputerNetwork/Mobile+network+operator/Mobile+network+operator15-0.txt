★Will the mobile network operators become just ISPs in the future?
Yes.  Mobile phones are just computers that move around.  And if you think about it, ISPs don't offer any apps - they just provide transport (hopefully fast and reliable).  Why would mobile be any different over time.  Having said that, there might be some value in bundling real-time apps that have impacts on quality (e.g., voice, video, TV, fast downloads for shopping) where controlling the bits adds value.    Embed Quote
