★What are the recent trends that are revolutionizing online and mobile Payments?
Disappearing transaction fees. The classic commission-percentage-per-transaction model is giving away to newer methods for Financial institutions to make money. Startups like LevelUp are already doing it. Mobile Network Operators, Point of Sale Terminals and Banks possess a treasure trove of information about you, albeit in silo-ed chunks. Imagine a coherent attempt that combines this magnitude (and multitude) of data. Thereon, I have the knowledge of where you shop, how often you shop, what's in your basket and what you might purchase next (hello, Big Data!). It clearly is an indication that most financial institutions will lean towards 'advertising models'. It will be the most contextual model of advertising you'll get to see and even, enjoy. To paint the bigger picture, we are headed towards a less-cash, if not a cashless economy. It's a textbook case of creative destruction, that will leapfrog lazy Governments, slow moving banks and monopolistic card companies.    Embed Quote
