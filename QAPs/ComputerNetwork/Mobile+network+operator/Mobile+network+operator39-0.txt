★Mobile Virtual Network Operators: What technical equipment is needed to organize full MVNO? How much does it cost?The MVNO implied in the question is the one which has full ownership of the subscribers and has its own brand. But, it would be nice to have listing of equipment for both the MVNO which provides only voice service, and MVNO which provides voice + VAS services. MVNO provides Prepaid service and balance loading is arranged via scratch cards.
Below is a sample business/operational model followed by the MVNOs. Depending on the business model, one can determine the list of equipment which the MVNO will provide. So a MVNO which provides only voice service, would fall under the Brand Reseller or the Service Provider category with no ownership of the VAS module, which usually comprises of the  Voicemail, SMS and IN-Platform services. If the MVNO falls under the Service Provider model, then it would probably have it's own CRM (IVR & Number Portability services) and Online/Offline charging servers. On the other hand, a MVNO providing voice + VAS services would be either be Full or Light MVNO. So in order to setup a full MVNO, the operator would require the following almost every element except the Radio Access Network, like :- Switches - MSC/Softswitch, GMSC, STP's/Routers VLR HLR GGSN/SGSN Media Gateways (MGW) Media Resource Functions (MRF) SMSC IN (SCP and SMP) Online/Offline Charging Systems IVR Voicemail Voucher Servers EIR/AuCConsidering all these network element, I personally feel that the MVNO would incur a lot of cost (can't quote an exact or ballpark figure). Or it could simply employ the services of a MVNE and not spend much money on infrastructure setup.    Embed Quote
