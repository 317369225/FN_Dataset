★How do mobile network operators price their "special" numbers?I mean cell phone numbers which has an attractive and easy to remember patterns like 933 333 31 or 742 742 742 ..etc Maybe they are called VIP number or Golden numbers... I know answer will differ between companies and countries. But want to know how your mobile operator price them? Or maybe clients get them only by chance, so there are no special prices for special numbers..?
When numbers are allocated ALL operators take the pretty numbers out of rotation so that they are not randomly given out. They are priced at what ever the company feels they can get away with. A really memorable number could run you upto $100k while one ending with 3 of the same number could be as cheap as $50.    Embed Quote
