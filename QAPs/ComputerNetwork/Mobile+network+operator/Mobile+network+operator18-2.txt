★How can (if possible) a mobile network operator or an ISP distinguish between a data over VoIP vs a different transport protocol for differentiated billing?How will a telecom provider determine that user used x MB for downloading a Youtube video while he used y MB for voice call over internet? Yes, they can read all packet headers, but is that a legal thing to do (with reference to provider like Airtel India charging consumers for use of Skype, Line, Viber like application for making voice calls)?
There are many ways but simple protocol header analysis can be used to determine thing like destination hosts and ports that can be used to determine target services. Some go to the extent to looking into the payload itself via deep packet inspection (DPI).    Embed Quote
