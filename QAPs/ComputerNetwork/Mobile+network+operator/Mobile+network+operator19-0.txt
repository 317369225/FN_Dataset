★How can a mobile network operator find out how many smartphones are on their platform?I would like to work with a mobile network operator to find out how many smartphones there in our country. Is there an easy way of accurately getting that information?
http://www.gsma.com/technicalpro... The IMEI database can be used to see what devices are on a network and by what manufacturer. At any time an operator can deny non approved devices, for instance, should there be a faulty implementation by a manufacturer. This is the source of how many iPhones there are on  T-Mobile US or China Mobile. That is how an operator can get the devices on network, but how does a developer find out is a different question. CDMA has ESN which is similar.    Embed Quote
