★What are the recent trends that are revolutionizing online and mobile Payments?
Accessibility and simplicity of being able to link your credit card or bank account to mobile apps best fitting your lifestyle and purchasing decisions. I think this is an area where the market will inevitably become saturated but simplicity and user experience offer advantage. Additionally, the sociability aspect of some apps is an interesting development. Apps like Venmo that have interconnectedness to existing social networking sites differentiate themselves somewhat. By posting to their site or Facebook a purchase is open for discussion amongst a users online community- this is somewhat unique and speaks to the direction of our digitized society.    Embed Quote
