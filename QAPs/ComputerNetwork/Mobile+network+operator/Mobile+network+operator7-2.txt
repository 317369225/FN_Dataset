★Why don't UK mobile network operators offer 12 month contracts any more?In the UK, a phone tariff used to typically be 12-18 months. When and why did 12 month contracts get dropped in favour of 18-24 month offers?
Mobile operataros are paying a large part of the cost of the mobile phone. For a phone at 500$, you will pay when you subscribe only 50$. In exchange of this gesture, they locked you with a 45$ contract on a longer period, so at the end, you will have reimbursed the whole cost supported and they will also make a profit.    Embed Quote
