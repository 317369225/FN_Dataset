★Any feedback/recommendation on SMTP/mail providers you currently use?I have tried/currently usingSailthru, authSMTP, Kobemail.  Please also comment on how support, API integration and reporting experience with your provider.  Thanks.
I have recently started to use email marketing for my online shopping company & I am using SMTPProvider.com to support my marketing. It not only provides me with a hassle free promotional bulk email delivery, the round the clock assistance guides me to track bounces, deliveries, clicks, unsubscribes, spam reports, opens, category tracking, email requests and many more. So from my personal experience, I can say that it is certainly a refined email provider.    Embed Quote
