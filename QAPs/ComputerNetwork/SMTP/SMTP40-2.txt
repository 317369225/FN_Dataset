★Any feedback/recommendation on SMTP/mail providers you currently use?I have tried/currently usingSailthru, authSMTP, Kobemail.  Please also comment on how support, API integration and reporting experience with your provider.  Thanks.
Test out Elastic Email as well.  Pay as you go.  Slick dashboard for statistics/reporting.  We support both SMTP Relay as well as a REST API.  We have lots of documentation for our API here - http://elasticemail.com/api-docu... Elastic's support site is very responsive as well - http://support.elasticemail.com, like Jon, I'm also the main support guy for our company and we use TenderApp as well! There are lots of options to choose from and this is a great starting place to compare.  At the end it will come down to price and features. http://socialcompare.com/en/comp... Hope this helps!    Embed Quote
