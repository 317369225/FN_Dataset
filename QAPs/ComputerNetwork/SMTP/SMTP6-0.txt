★FROM Address at the SMTP Level?Is it possible to have an SMTP server change the FROM address of an email, masking the master account? POBox told me that it was possible with their service, depending upon "how you set up your email client".
You could use an email forward or mailing list feature of your smtp server if you have that. For example if you Google best smtp server, that server actually has the feature of mailing list and you can set up a mailing list with just one person in it so when you send an email to that list, its going to be forward to that person and “From:” email address is going to be changed to the From: email address of the list owner.    Embed Quote
