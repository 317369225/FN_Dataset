★Do you use the Mandrill HTTP API or SMTP API and why?Mandrill offers the ability to send using a HTTP based API and also as a simple SMTP Relay. Do you prefer to generate emails on your own server and then just relay them through Mandrill or do you make use of the Mandrill HTTP API. Your reason for choosing that option would be helpful.
For the project I'm using Mandrill for we ended up using the WordPress plugin wpMandrill (which uses the API) because the project used WordPress for the framework. If you only want to send emails, I'd say use whichever option is easiest for you to setup. The API offers other functionality outside of sending emails. If you want/need to do any of that, then you'll need to use the API.    Embed Quote
