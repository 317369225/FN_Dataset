★SMTP Servers: Is there any effective and affordable mass email campaign software?
I'm the co-founder of Oempro (Octeth - Oempro - Email Marketing Software - Email List Managment Software - Auto Responder Software) and you can definitely build your own email marketing service business with Oempro's powerful features and using a third party email relaying service such as SMTP, Mailjet, Mailgun, Sendgrid or others. You can learn more about Oempro and its pricing here: http://octeth.com/#purchase On the other hand, if you don't have technical knowledge/experience to handle email delivery or manage your servers, choosing a hosted email marketing service will be a better option. In this way, you will focus on growing your business and marketing activities and experienced service provider team will handle all technical details for you. I would recommend our other company Sendloop http://sendloop.com if you prefer a hosted solution. Cheers    Embed Quote
