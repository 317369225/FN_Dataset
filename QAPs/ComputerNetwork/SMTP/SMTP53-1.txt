★What are the steps to do before launching a web startup apart from the programming, choosing the right vendors for payment gateways, smtp server etc etc?please also help me to know who are the people to be involved like lawyer (for paper works), accountant etc
I realize this is an older question, but an even more basic question before answering, why are you starting this "web startup?"  Here's a great TED Talk you should watch by Simon Sinek ...from his book "Start With Why": Once you've watched the video, do a "start-up self-assessment"... are you beginning this entrepreneurial journey for the right reasons, and are you the right fit (necessary skills, resources, resourcefulness, and network of partners to help you launch?  If the answer to all of the above questions are given a green light, then you should ensure you're picking the right location and have accomplished a thorough market research analysis of your competition.  Understanding the competition will help you assess if you have something unique to offer or maybe your presentation/service is better, before committing your time & resources.    Embed Quote
