★Why would an IT department disable POP3, IMAP & SMTP?quoting "security reasons" - what are these?
These three protocols all operate without any encryption -- i.e. your password, as well as all your messaging content, travels across the Internet in a highly eavesdroppable format. Each of these protocols also has modernized variants that fix this -- with a TLS encryption wrapper, and in some cases with strong authentication as well. Maybe your IT folks have disabled the legacy versions, but you're able to use the new and improved ones?  That would be pretty reasonable.    Embed Quote
