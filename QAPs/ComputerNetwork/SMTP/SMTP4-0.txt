★What hosted SMTP services are available to outsource your outgoing email delivery to increase deliverability?Especially if you send a lot of email. How do they compare? This is a follow-up question to What techniques can I use to prevent emails sent from my web site from being marked as spam and increase deliverability?.
I'm currently using http://critsend.com. They have been doing e-mail deliverability for several years for individual clients but are only now releasing a self-serve platform. I'm in the beta and the deliverability has been good, though their web analytics interface leaves a lot to be wanted. SendGrid is a competitor coming out of TechStars that has a much more polished user experience, but is slightly more expensive for things like white labeling. AuthSMTP I've heard many people have been using for years, but there pricing is somewhat frustrating, since you have to buy monthly subscription packages of e-mails as opposed to just paying for each e-mail sent. Your other option is to do it yourself which may seem cheap, but to get good deliverability on your own you probably want to get white listed\reviewed by Return Path, which gets expensive.    Embed Quote
