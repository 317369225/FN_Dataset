★What are some tips for setting up an outbound SMTP mail server?
Setting up an SMTP server is not a simple task: First you need to choose what software to use, the server itself. Commonly these are Postfix, Exim or a Windows IIS Mail. Make sure you have enough space on the server to suit your emailing needs, in today's era a lot of data gets stored quickly. Next you need to get yourself a clean IP, make sure that when you assign an IP to a server check the blacklists to ensure the IP is not in one of them. Next ensure to monitor your log files, there are a lot of information in there that explain why some emails might be bouncing (throttle or worse, hard bounces due to inexisting email addresses). This will help you to learn email practices of each ISP (gmail, outlook, etc) and will help you optimise your outbound email Finally it is imperative to install a Spam Filter like the open source one SpamAssassin and add email authenticity verification tool that ensures the domains from which you are receiving emails or sending are set up using SPF and the DKIM best practices. Or..you could use a cloud based SMTP provider such as SMTP server, bulk & marketing email service  (DISCLOSURE: Im working for Mailjet) or other similar providers! In this case you only worry about the content of emails that you send and not worry about all the technicalities, although exciting to some email geeks like myself :)    Embed Quote
