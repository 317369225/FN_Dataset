★Is it possible to use a different From: address and SMTP server with Mac Mail?I currently have Mac Mail set up to use my gmail account but I want to use a different smtp server (i.e. allow me to send email from my gmail.com address and my school email address).
I figured this one out.  In the "Accounts" tab in Preferences, add all the emails you want to send from in the "Email Address" field, e.g. Email Address: foo@bar.com, foo@baz.com.  When you compose the email, you can select the "From" address as well as which SMTP to use (if you added multiple SMTP servers).    Embed Quote
