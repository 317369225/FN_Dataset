★Has anyone implemented a fully-featured email server (i.e., SMTP, IMAP & POP server) using Node.js?What are some of pros/cons when you come to Node.js and it's ecosystem?
We've built our own SMTP stack from scratch (http://www.smtplogic.com) using a high-level compiled language. This was a multi man-year effort, even with very experienced engineers working on it (we've shipped code in Windows Server, Exchange Server, etc.). As Joran suggests, the scope of the work gets huge if you want to account for all the features - MIME processing but also SPF handling, RBL lookups, DNS caching, DOS Protection, reliable message queueing, etc. Some RFC specifications are full of surprises (as well as real-world server implementations of these RFCs).    Embed Quote
