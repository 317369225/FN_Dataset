★What percentage of email flowing around the Internet is secured using SMTP TLS?SMTP TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the mechanism by which two email servers, when communicating, can automatically negotiate an encrypted channel between them so that the emails transmitted are not in clear-text. I was wondering how many emails servers support TLS and what percentage of email flowing around the Internet is secured by TLS?
I don't have an exact number. But if you are referring to server to server SMTP email transfers then I would guess it is less 1%. This is the Internet's dirty little secret. This is why you cannot just rely on providers exposure secure interfaces. You need to use end to end encryption yourself.    Embed Quote
