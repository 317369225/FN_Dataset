★Why doesn't a social networking protocol (like SMTP or FTP) exist yet?It seems that it would make sense to make something similar to Twitter a standard protocol that can be installed on any machine and accessed by front end software (like an email client or an FTP client), so why hasn't it happened yet?
I think you question should should ask why a social networking API does not exits. Plenty of protocols already exist that could transfer social networking data if anybody would provide it. I also think there are obvious resons why a API does not exist, the companies profit and a lack of a consistent definition for "social networking" being the most obvious.    Embed Quote
