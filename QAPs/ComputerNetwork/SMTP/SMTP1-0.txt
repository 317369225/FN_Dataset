★How does the SMTP protocol actually work?What does a protocol look like? What does an info package on SMTP look like? Does it have specific data fields like Date, To, From, CC, body, etc?
Basic SMTP is documented in Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.  There are more extensions that you can Google if you're interested after reading this. The protocol is very straightforward and is just ASCII on top of a bi-directional TCP connection.  Be sure that you understand the difference between the mail transfer, the mail envelope, and the body of the email itself.  SMTP does not worry about the details of the envelope, such as who is cc'ed.    Embed Quote
