★Email Protocols: Why use SMTP for sending E-mails instead of HTTP POST?
Http post sends data to webservers. It doesn't work well when trying to reach a destination like an email address. Unless they set up their own server. Also another person could intercept your messages. It would also be very easy to fake an Ip address. I could use the basic http dev tools in firefox and fake an email from Barrack Obama saying that your family is going to die. I could also easily embed applications onto peoples emails, and intercept all of their mail. I could also edit their messages, and just hack everything, anywhere. All I need is the ability to tracepath (There's a powershell command for that) Then I could just send around http POST requests. Also, if peoples computers were their mail servers, I could hack into their computers. For starters, my post request could be an HTML file. That html file can parse javascript, python, and such. So that I could easily just send you a virus and I could hack your computer without you ever knowing.    Embed Quote
