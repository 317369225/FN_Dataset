You can find a good comparison table between EXIM, PostFix, QMail and SendMail here: http://shearer.org/MTA_Comparison. Check out the MTA suitability table.

If you're looking for email automation that's compatible with those open source systems, check SMTP Logic (http://www.smtplogic.com). It's plug and play and you can add email archiving, routing, message tracking, reporting, workflow, etc.    Embed Quote
