★Do you use the Mandrill HTTP API or SMTP API and why?Mandrill offers the ability to send using a HTTP based API and also as a simple SMTP Relay. Do you prefer to generate emails on your own server and then just relay them through Mandrill or do you make use of the Mandrill HTTP API. Your reason for choosing that option would be helpful.
Strange behavior when sending via the API, or delayed e-mails, or it seems to me by some and not send it. Using SMTP (using phpmailer) is somehow safer, but I get the impression that you send via SMTP, e-mails can go to the spam mailbox    Embed Quote
