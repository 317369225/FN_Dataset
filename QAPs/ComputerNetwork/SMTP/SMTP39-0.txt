★How does email verification via SMTP work?What are factors affecting verification process. I am getting invalid results on local machine, but when verified on a online service such as Verify Email Address Online I get correct results.
What they do is basically simulate email sending SMTP commands. These commands would tell them if a mailbox is for real or not. There are some which don't and basically accept anything you give them and then bounce back but thats a different story. They disconnect just before the mail server says...give me the message. Instead of providing the message, they disconnect. You can read more about it in these two articles - verify email and email address verification I hope that helps you in your search.    Embed Quote
