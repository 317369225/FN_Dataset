★How do I fix gmail SMTP issue in Outlook?My gmail has stopped working in Outlook. I am receiving an error that Outlook cannot contact the SMTP server; I can receive new emails but cannot send. I have tried changing the outgoing port number, deleting and re-adding the account, and setting it up as a POP3 account. I have also tried unlocking captcha. I do not understand code, and am looking for a step-by-step solution.
Sometimes you have to do the unlock thing two or three times before it works. Try using port 465 (SSL), 587 (TLS), and 25 (SSL). Sometimes just locking the port instead of the client choose it automatically works, so try it even if Outlook is already using that port.    Embed Quote
