★How can I use SMTP to send bulk text / SMS (Number+CarrierDomain) messages to my legitimate subscriber base without getting blacklisted?I already have my users mobile numbers and mobile carrier messaging domains - ie: messaging.sprintpcs.com etc -
I can suggest that you check out Hypermedia's HG-7000: SMS Gateway Device. You'll be able to send the texts from our box, in-house and you won't have to give your subscriber-base list to a service provider, and also, you will not be blacklisted! If it's still relevant, take a look at our One SMS Box - A Thousand Possibilities promotion... Special Offer - February 2013    Embed Quote
