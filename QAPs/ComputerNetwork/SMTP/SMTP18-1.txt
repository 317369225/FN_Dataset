★What is a scanner/MFD that can email its scans through GMail's SMTP server?My current scanner (Dell 1815dn) can email its scans, but its SMTP authentication does not support the settings needed for Gmail's SMTP server (port number etc). Ideally I'm looking for a laser MFD with WiFi network connectivity.
I believe the Brother MFC-7840W supports Internet Fax, which is basically scanning to e-mail - and from the looks of it, it will support SMTP authentication. Further reading: http://www.brother.ca/en/product... http://welcome.solutions.brother...    Embed Quote
