★SMTP Error: Could not authenticate....What does it means?
SMTP is a type of mail delivery server, it is like a mail courier for the internet but it isn't normally a store of mail mostly only the transport for it. It means that the mail server has been unable to verify that the user name or password used to connect is not correct. Or it means that the system is blocking unauthorised connections. If this message is seen when you are sending mail you should check the user name, password and connection details you are using to connect to the server. If you see this in a bounced mail then you should speak to your mail provider for advice.    Embed Quote
