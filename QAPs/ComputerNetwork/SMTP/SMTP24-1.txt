★Do users have to opt in to receive SMS messages through SMTP? What is the typical time delay for receiving SMSes when they are sent using SMTP?The messages would deliver PIN numbers to US and UK users, as a user requests it online. I want to use SMTP to send out SMS to users of my company.  Do they have to opt-in through their carrier first to receive messages this way?  What is a typical time delay when using SMTP?
This question could be understood in a few different ways. Opting in to receive messages for marketing purposes would be necessary, however, since you state that you would be sending SMS with pins to the users, I assume these are not marketing messages but users who already have an existing relationship with your company and have consented to receive the pin this way. In this case, no opt in is necessary. I think your question is referring to opting in to receive SMS if the SMS is sent using  SMTP - sending a email directly to the carrier with the user's phone number (E.g. mobilenumber@txt.att.net) This is only possible in certain countries and for certain operators. In the US as long as the user has enabled and registered SMS with the carrier then they should be able to receive a text message in this manner too. There is a second option which you could use for countries where you can't send an email directly to the carrier.You can use a provider that offers SMTP as part of their product range. For some providers you would just have to send an email to the provider's email address which is hosted in a server that will convert the email on a text message and then forward it onto the carrier network. In this case again, as long as the user has enabled/registered his phone to receive text messages then they should be able to!    Embed Quote
