★Do you use the Mandrill HTTP API or SMTP API and why?Mandrill offers the ability to send using a HTTP based API and also as a simple SMTP Relay. Do you prefer to generate emails on your own server and then just relay them through Mandrill or do you make use of the Mandrill HTTP API. Your reason for choosing that option would be helpful.
I prefer to use the smtp API. With python, remote SMTP is very easily accomplished with mandrill in only a few lines of code. Where as with the http API you would be forced to work with their library or write your own http request and parse the response    Embed Quote
