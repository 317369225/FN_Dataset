★Is it possible to use a different From: address and SMTP server with Mac Mail?I currently have Mac Mail set up to use my gmail account but I want to use a different smtp server (i.e. allow me to send email from my gmail.com address and my school email address).
Go to Mail..Preferences and select the accounts tab.  Highlight the gmail account and under Account Information you should see "Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP)".  Either select a different mail server that you have already configured or click on the drop down list and select "Edit SMTP server List". In that dialog you can set up another SMTP server by pressing the + button and adding the appropriate information.    Embed Quote
