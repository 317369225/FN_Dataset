★How might an SMTP email account be compromised?We get occasional events where an attacker logs straight in to an SSL-protected SMTP server and sends spam. The account holders deny they fell for phishing or have malware-ridden PCs or weak passwords, and it's rare enough that a server-side compromise seems unlikely. I'd say about 0.2% of accounts per year. There is no recurrence after changing passwords.
One thing to consider is that spammers will seldom try to re-use something once they have used it, so changing the password and not seeing them again may be a red herring. Do your logs actually show a successful login for the user account prior to sending? Quite often we assume that an account has been used but there is another way fro the spammer to get in and use the service another way. What other services do you have that make use of this server? Do your web servers send via it? Does your CRM system have access? Is is a simple gateway relay server that allows anyone inside the network to send as long as the from address is a valid local domain? In order to understand the threat properly you will need to go through a pretty exhaustive process :(    Embed Quote
