★Why would an IT department disable POP3, IMAP & SMTP?quoting "security reasons" - what are these?
First of all - WHERE did they disable it? If they disabled those ports on your company mailserver, they may want you to stick to using the approved mail client (Outlook or Notes don't need those ports talking to their server, they use special protocols). If they disabled it in the firewall, this means they want you to stick to the company email system instead of downloading your private mail from external servers. Both are ways to enforce security rules - for example a typical corporate email client will have a virus scanner and maybe a mail encryption system pre-configured for users. Very few companies will allow you to bypass this and use for example Mozilla Thunderbird instead.    Embed Quote
