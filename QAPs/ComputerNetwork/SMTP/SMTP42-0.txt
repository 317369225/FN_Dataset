★Email Protocols: Why use SMTP for sending E-mails instead of HTTP POST?
SMTP predates HTTP by a decade or so, and it is purpose-built for E-mail, and it is better suited to E-mail than HTTP. You may note, in fact, that some portion of HTTP uses various elements of the Internet Email Protocols, e.g. Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions headers, Domain Names, etc. One generally wants to design new application protocols for each new application, rather than attempt to shoehorn a new application into an existing protocol, because the semantic mismatch is very likely to be troublesome both in design and operationally. That is if one's application really is something new and different, of course. See also my answer to Why do we still use separate protocols for Email instead of HTTP?    Embed Quote
