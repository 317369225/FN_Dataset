★Why are there so many SMTP servers that are vulnerable?After developing a PHP application with PHPMailer, I found that there are SO many SMTP servers allowing anonymous emails with no authentication. Why do people set up their mail servers like that??
There is a lot of old software out there that does not support authenticated SMTP sessions, and some people continue to use that software to send messages for important (to them) purposes. They need an SMTP server that will accept connections from that software. If they keep this server inside their firewall, with port 25 connections to it blocked for all others - or use settings internal to the SMTP server's software to achieve the same effect, they are fine. Unfortunately, they don't always get this right and port 25 is exposed to the outside world, or they get it right at first and forget about it - but then change something in their configuration or in their firewall (often by way of an upgrade that loses their configuration so they have to rebuild it from scratch), and as a result port 25 is exposed again.    Embed Quote
