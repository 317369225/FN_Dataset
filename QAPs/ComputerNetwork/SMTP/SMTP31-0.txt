★Is there a tool or mail client that can automatically switch SMTP server based on location?Many ISPs allow using only their SMTP servers, so the tool should detect the LAN I'm connected to and use appropriate SMTP server, so that I don't have to retype it manually. Win7 solution preferred. Thank you.
You  don't actually need to do that you can use the same mail server all the  time from any point in the world. If you connect on port 587 or 465,  and especially if you encrypt your email using SSL or TLS you don't have  to change your server based on location actually it would be a bad  thing to do it because your email will come from different IP addresses  different "From:" addresses and nobody will recognize it and get you  into spam box.    Embed Quote
