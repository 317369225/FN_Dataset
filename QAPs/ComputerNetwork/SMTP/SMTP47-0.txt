★Does SMTP relay process need any authentication from server to server?
Historically SMTP communication was open and anonymous: anybody could connect to any SMTP server and ask for external relaying of the submitted messages. This openness was initially abused by spammers which would hide behind those open relays therefore the first restriction which had to be imposed was on restricting delivery to addresses within the network of the SMTP server. So generally SMTP relays nowadays accept messages from everywhere but deliver just to own networks. User authorization is nowadays common practice for SMTP servers when accepting messages from clients: this is eased by the fact that generally those clients are used by users who signed a contract with the ISP hence credentials can be easily assigned to them.    Embed Quote
