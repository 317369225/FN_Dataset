★What SMTP server implementation does Google use for Gmail?
Looked at the following to determine what SMTP stack Gmail was built on: 1. Response to valid SMTP requests such as EHLO 2. Responses to invalid SMTP requests (ex: error messages) 3. Legal attributions to open source projects Nothing clear. While they might originally have used an open source library when working on Gmail, it's been a few years and at this point it must be mostly custom (ex: custom authentication to work with their own account management logic, etc.). There aren't a lot of companies capable of building their own SMTP stack (that includes us: see http://www.smtplogic.com) but Google is definitely part of that club.    Embed Quote
