★How can I use SMTP to send bulk text / SMS (Number+CarrierDomain) messages to my legitimate subscriber base without getting blacklisted?I already have my users mobile numbers and mobile carrier messaging domains - ie: messaging.sprintpcs.com etc -
You can send SMS messages via SMTP, however carriers watch this very carefully and if they see too much traffic they will just shut you down.  Plus you get no reporting and messages come thru funky. You are ok if you are sending SMTP messages on a transactional basis for things like confirmation messages. Bulk messaging is not advised. I would use a short code (dedicated or shared).    Embed Quote
