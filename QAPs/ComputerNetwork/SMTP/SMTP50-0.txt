★What are the differences between using SMTP Mandrill and Mandrill APIs for sending mail?
The difference is that the Mandrill API allows you to configure your applications to react in different ways. An API is a way to a set of programming commands for accessing a Web-based software application, once you've accessed it through your own software you can make the remote platform do things. I work for Mailjet.com  we also provide an API. Users can connect from their app or webplatform to our servers and configure it so that emails are sent out when a certain user on their platform does something. (For example someone forgets their password, they'll receive a triggered email to reset the pass). Basicaly with an API you can make your platform and the remote platform talk together and do things.  That means that you can code within your platform when emails are triggered, who they're sent to, etc. Using the SMTP you basically just over-ride your platform's settings forcing all email to be sent by Mandrill Servers but you don't actually get your hands in the workflow.    Embed Quote
