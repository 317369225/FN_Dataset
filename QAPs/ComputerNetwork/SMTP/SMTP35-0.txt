★How do you set up a local email account on an SMTP server?This is a follow-up question to How we can set up an E-mail account?.
Whether you can set up an E-mail account "in the local system" depends upon what the "local" system actually is: UNIX? Microsoft Windows? OS X? If I interpret your question correctly, I believe you want to run your own Internet E-mail server. There are several things you need: a computer with an Operating System (OS) that supports running an SMTP server and a POP or IMAP server for access. a domain name for the Domain Name System (DNS). a fixed IP Address for your E-mail server from your Internet Service Provider.These are the minimal requirements for operating an Internet E-mail server; this presumes that your domain name servers will be handled by whatever service you register your domain name with. The individual E-mail accounts are created in the usual administrative fashion for whatever OS your E-mail server is running. E-mail clients for the various desktop computers you'll actually read the E-mail on will use either POP or IMAP to access E-mail on the server (I recommend IMAP in preference to POP). If your server is running UNIX, your users can also SSH into the server and read/write E-mail using the traditional text-based command line programs for that.    Embed Quote
