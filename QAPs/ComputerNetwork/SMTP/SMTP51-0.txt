★Why doesn't a social networking protocol (like SMTP or FTP) exist yet?It seems that it would make sense to make something similar to Twitter a standard protocol that can be installed on any machine and accessed by front end software (like an email client or an FTP client), so why hasn't it happened yet?
Simply because the early protocols on the Internet weren't written with a single company's profit in mind.  No one imagined that an internal (to a company) email or other protocol could achieve critical mass.  Part of this is because the early stages of the Internet were simply much less commercial, many of the people who wrote the protocols and designed how things would work, were in fact researchers. The same thing happened when companies started building their own "chat" (really instant messaging solutions).  There were, and are, open standards like XMPP (called Jabber back then) but because of marketing muscle the adoption from consumers revolved around ICQ, AOL Instant Messenger, and Windows Messenger with networks from Yahoo and others also in the mix.    Embed Quote
