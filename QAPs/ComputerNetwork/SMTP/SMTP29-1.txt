★How do I fix gmail SMTP issue in Outlook?My gmail has stopped working in Outlook. I am receiving an error that Outlook cannot contact the SMTP server; I can receive new emails but cannot send. I have tried changing the outgoing port number, deleting and re-adding the account, and setting it up as a POP3 account. I have also tried unlocking captcha. I do not understand code, and am looking for a step-by-step solution.
Did you check your outgoing server settings? From Online Services in Outlook: Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, GoDaddy Outgoing mail server (SMTP):  Use Port 587, Use TLS (More Settings, Advanced tab)  Require Authentication (Outgoing Server tab)    Embed Quote
