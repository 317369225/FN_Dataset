★What percentage of email flowing around the Internet is secured using SMTP TLS?SMTP TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the mechanism by which two email servers, when communicating, can automatically negotiate an encrypted channel between them so that the emails transmitted are not in clear-text. I was wondering how many emails servers support TLS and what percentage of email flowing around the Internet is secured by TLS?
For me, a large majority of emails in/out are TLS-encrypted because large companies are very security-aware these days.  We attempt to deliver via TLS first, then fallback to unsecured SMTP if recipient server does not support TLS.  It is true that you cannot guarantee encryption because if TLS fails, you still want to deliver the email unencrypted because not every company's IT dept has the staff to manage this.  That's why lots of companies use web-based SSL email solutions instead.  Guaranteed encryption every time.    Embed Quote
