Hi there, My name is Jon Lim, Product Manager of PostageApp as you can see! With PostageApp, we make it really easy to design, send, and manage your emails. Our APi is clean, simple, and robust. We have official integrations with Ruby on Rails and PHP, and many third-party offerings for Python, Django, Perl, and ExpressionEngine. For support, you can take a look at our TenderApp (http://help.postageapp.com/) to see that we answer requests rather quickly. And of course we would, I am the main support guy! Our reporting on the backend is great - very well designed and intuitive. You can easily see which of your emails have gone through or which have failed, and if they have, why? Of course, you can easily check for yourself by signing up for an Egg account, and I would be happy to answer any questions or comments you may have!    Embed Quote
