★How might an SMTP email account be compromised?We get occasional events where an attacker logs straight in to an SSL-protected SMTP server and sends spam. The account holders deny they fell for phishing or have malware-ridden PCs or weak passwords, and it's rare enough that a server-side compromise seems unlikely. I'd say about 0.2% of accounts per year. There is no recurrence after changing passwords.
Several venues of attack exists. I could compromise your computer from where you access the mail account. This would be the easiest approach and potentially give me the option to read your password and even change it removing your access to your own mail Depending on the server I could find a vulnerability on the actual mail server and hack this If you are using web mail I might hijack your browser sessions or steal session cookies. The specifics depends on what software on the server and on your client    Embed Quote
