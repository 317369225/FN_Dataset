★Corporate (non-bulk) SMTP service provider with a great reputation, recommendations?
Check this out for some information - http://socialcompare.com/en/comp... Our service http://elasticemail.com sends both so we may not be what you are looking for however we have MANY clients that use us for transactional emails only.  The link above shows which providers support transactional only or bulk only or both - so I think the link will be helpful.  Good Luck!    Embed Quote
