What is the typical time delay for receiving SMSes when they are sent using SMTP?The messages would deliver PIN numbers to US and UK users, as a user requests it online. I want to use SMTP to send out SMS to users of my company.  Do they have to opt-in through their carrier first to receive messages this way?  What is a typical time delay when using SMTP?
