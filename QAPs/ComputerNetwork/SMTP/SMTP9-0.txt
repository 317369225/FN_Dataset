★What is the advantage of using SendGrid SMTP over Gmail SMTP servers?
Well, there are a ton of questions on Quora about the advantages of SendGrid over X or Y, so I'll leave that part to you.  The real question here is "why not Gmail?", so I'll address that. The main issues with Gmail are: There is an arbitrary limit of 500 emails sent per day The from address is rewritten to be the one listed on the gmail account SendGrid gives you 200 emails per day for free right of the bat, but if you wanted to send out 500 emails per day's worth, it would cost you $1.50 for the month. Also, SendGrid doesn't rewrite your from records. Hope that helps.    Embed Quote
