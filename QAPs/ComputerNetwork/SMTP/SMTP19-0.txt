★How to build best smtp server that is trusted?
This is a pretty open ended question, but the easiest way to do this is to use a service such as MailChimp.  From there, to make it trusted, you need to set up an SPF record and a DKIM record.  Normally, SPF is easy to set up while DKIM takes a little more effort, but with Mailchimp, both are very easy. How to set up DKIM and SPF for Mailchimp. If you are going for something that can more easily send email from a web app, use SendGrid.  They will have similar steps to setting up your SPF and DKIM records.  As far as setting up your own server, I highly discourage doing it.  SMTP servers are not easy to configure and usually have a lot of vulnerabilities because of this.  Plus, making your server 'trusted' becomes a lot harder.  Make it easy on yourself and go with a company that does all the heavy lifting for you.  It is worth the little extra money. I hope this helps!    Embed Quote
