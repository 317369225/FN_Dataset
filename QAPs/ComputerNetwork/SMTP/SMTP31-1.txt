★Is there a tool or mail client that can automatically switch SMTP server based on location?Many ISPs allow using only their SMTP servers, so the tool should detect the LAN I'm connected to and use appropriate SMTP server, so that I don't have to retype it manually. Win7 solution preferred. Thank you.
You should be able to set up your mail client to use the same settings regardless of which LAN you are on.  First, you want to turn on authentication when sending mail, which will make it possible to use the ISPs mail server even when you aren't using the ISPs connection.  Second, if you send messages on port 587, which is the message submission port, then you can avoid problems where the SMTP port is being blocked.  If your ISP doesn't support these features, then you can always sign up for Gmail and use Google's SMTP server.    Embed Quote
