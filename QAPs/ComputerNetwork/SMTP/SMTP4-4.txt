★What hosted SMTP services are available to outsource your outgoing email delivery to increase deliverability?Especially if you send a lot of email. How do they compare? This is a follow-up question to What techniques can I use to prevent emails sent from my web site from being marked as spam and increase deliverability?.
I've had only positive experiences using AuthSMTP.com for SMTP Relay. It's saved me a ton of effort sending emails from Amazon EC2, as basically all Amazon IP's get flagged for spam. They force you to sign up for an annual account though, which is kind of annoying, but you can start with a lower one and upgrade as needed.
