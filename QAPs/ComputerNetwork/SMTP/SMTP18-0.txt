★What is a scanner/MFD that can email its scans through GMail's SMTP server?My current scanner (Dell 1815dn) can email its scans, but its SMTP authentication does not support the settings needed for Gmail's SMTP server (port number etc). Ideally I'm looking for a laser MFD with WiFi network connectivity.
I ended up getting the Brother MFC-9970W, and it works really well. From just reading manuals online, it looks like some of the Brother MFC devices require a PC client to do the SMTP scan. I wanted something that emails straight out from the printer without a pitstop at the PC. This is easy to set up on the the 9970. The 9970 handles GMail's SSL setup nice, and has the added advantage of being wireless, so physical placement is really flexible. Recommended!    Embed Quote
