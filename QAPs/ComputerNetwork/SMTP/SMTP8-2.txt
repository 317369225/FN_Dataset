★SMTP Servers: Is there any effective and affordable mass email campaign software?
If your mailing list is gotten to clean and has no bounce backs or people have not subscribed to receive your e-mails you could considerably minimize your spending using a standalone software called "Advanced Emailer" in conjunction with Amazon SES. Amazon has low-cost costs on sending huge volumes of email. It's something in the array of a couple of cents per thousand messages, but they have a great deal of automated filtering system. If you're sending out outcomes in more than 5 % bounce backs your account may be automatically closed depending on your regular sending volumes and depending on your great standing with them. Nevertheless, because you do it every day, your list needs to be okay.    Embed Quote
