★Why use " Allow users to send mail through an external SMTP when configuring a "from" address hosted outside your email domains."?
This is a feature that most top email providers support. Say you have a domain X and your user has a domain Y that they'd want used as their from address. If you don't support this option, your @X.com address is used in the Sender: mail header, which means: 1) any delivery reports will come back to @X.com instead of  @Y.com 2) many clients will print the sender as "@X.com on behalf of @Y.com" This is also considered as spam/junk signal in many clients If you select that option, the mail system uses Y's SMTP Servers to send the mail and the issues mentioned above can be avoided.    Embed Quote
