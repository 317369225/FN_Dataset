★Who invented SMTP (email)?What organization? - was it the Information Sciences Institute                   University of Southern California? And if so who from there was on the research team?
Strangely, I met him.   SMTP grew out of ARPANET and BBN in Cambridge, and it was Ray Tomlinson at BBN  who really put it together (he put the @ sign in email.).  I was aquainted with him there, in 1996. He said to me, "I still have yet to meet somebody with an at-sign in their name." I gave him a floor lamp when I left. Hi Ray, if you're out there..   I never did meet anyone with an at-sign in there name, either,.    Embed Quote
