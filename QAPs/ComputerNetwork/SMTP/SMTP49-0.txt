★Do ISPs typically filter outbound (SMTP) email for spam?Recently it came to light that Apple's MobileMe had been occasionally blocking outgoing messages on its service. I wondered if this was typical on other large ISPs…
Yes, several tier-1 carriers filter outbound (SMTP) email for spam in order to maintain a clean IP reputation. Some ISPs develop their own 'homegrown' solution while others simply purchase commercial software that transparently filters outgoing mail traffic without users ever knowing. Outbound spam is a security problem because customers have been compromised by botnets or customers have fallen to phishing tricks on sites containing malware. Once compromised, these accounts can be used to send spam on behalf of the spammer. The result is it tarnishes an ISP's IP reputation to the point where the receiving ISP begins blocking messages from the sending ISP. This has become a hot-button issue in 2012 for ISPs and web hosts - particularly VPS providers. Service providers are usually not aware of an outbound spam problem until it's too late. Once an entire subnet is blocked, email grinds to a halt, users experience bounce-backs and the ISP receives a spike in support tickets and customer attrition. In short, ISPs use outbound mail filtering to protect them from users sending spam. This level of security is more common in companies based in North America and Westernized countries at the time of this writing.    Embed Quote
