★SMTP: Is there a tool to 'properly' check whether an email address will bounce?
VRFY is a part of SMTP spec and a feature of every mail server. And then spammers started using it. So it's always turned off now. According to Exchange Server 2007 VRFY, Microsoft has hard-coded Exchange server to always respond with a string and removed the functionality from the system. http://cr.yp.to/smtp/vrfy.html explains how it was supposed to work when we still trusted each other on the Internet. I will not contribute a technical answer to your problem because I disagree with your business model.    Embed Quote
