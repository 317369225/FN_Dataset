★Do users have to opt in to receive SMS messages through SMTP? What is the typical time delay for receiving SMSes when they are sent using SMTP?The messages would deliver PIN numbers to US and UK users, as a user requests it online. I want to use SMTP to send out SMS to users of my company.  Do they have to opt-in through their carrier first to receive messages this way?  What is a typical time delay when using SMTP?
No opt-in would be necessary in this case, but carriers do not support (allow) commercial uses of the SMTP email gateways for SMS. The Mobile Marketing Association's best practices on this read as follows: The carriers that support such gateways do so with the intent that they are not utilized for any commercial traffic. To that end, carriers actively monitor and filter against these connections to protect subscribers from unsolicited messages (spam) and utilize a variety of mechanisms to do so. http://www.slideshare.net/sellph...    Embed Quote
