★What is the best contact form with SMTP support Wordpress plugin?
Gravity Forms is the best WordPress plugin, although I am a bit biased as I am one of the developers.  But it's a full featured forms plugin that provides functionality as good as FormStack, Wufoo, etc. with a visual form builder.  It is available at http://www.gravityforms.com. It itself does not provide SMTP support as it relies on the built in WordPress wp_mail() function.  HOWEVER if you want SMTP support all you need to do is install and activate the WP Mail SMTP plugin that is available in the WordPress.org plugin repository.    Embed Quote
