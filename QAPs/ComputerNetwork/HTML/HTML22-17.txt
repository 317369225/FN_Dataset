â˜…What are the differences between HTML5 and HTML?
HTML is a markup language that is used to build static (non interactive and nonanimated) webpages. In HTML, audio and video requires external software support. In HTML, finding correct GeoLocation is impossible. HTML5 is the latest revision of HTML containing much better support for media like video and audio tags. It also defines detailed parsing rules (including "error handling") for this syntax which are largely compatible with popular implementations. In HTML5, audio and video has internal specifications and has separate tags ie <audio> and <video>. In HTML5, JS GeoLocation API helps in identifying location. HTML5 has got some advance features such as to develop the ability of the browser to be an application platform, via HTML, CSS, and Javascript whereas HTML is old version so it don't have ability to develop the Website via CSS and Javascript. HTML5 is the latest revision of HTML.
