★What are the differences between HTML5 and HTML?
HTML is a document markup language. It's specification is presided over by the W3. HTML5 is the latest specification of HTML. It aims to add more semantics to markup by introducing tags which describe the content they present - eg. <header>, <footer>, <aside>, <nav> and so on, as semantic (i.e. they describe what they are) replacements for some uses of the generic <div> tag.  It also adds tags related to media presentation, and this is where the term starts to blur... ...Because HTML5 is also commonly used to refer to the range of new technologies which browser vendors are creating for and alongside HTML5 such as native video and audio playback, new Javascript APIs like localStorage, IndexedDB, WebWorkers, and so on. Even the advances in the CSS spec are often embraced by the term so that HTML5 can sometimes refer to technologies introduced by CSS3 and 4 such as hardware accelerated CSS animation and transitions, CSS variables and functions, etc. So, as a term it both has a very specific meaning  - a version of the HTML specification - and a much more general meaning: new toys!
