★What is the difference between HTML and JavaScript?
HTML is a static markup language.  It is used to prepare text so that it can be displayed in a web-browser.  It has no constructs of a language. JavaScript is a programming language.  It runs in the context of a browser on the user side.   However, there are some people who have been playing with server-side JavaScript.   It is Object Oriented.
