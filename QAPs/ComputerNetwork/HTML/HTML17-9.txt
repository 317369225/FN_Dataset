★Is a web browser just an HTML interpreter?
The first web browsers such as Erwise, Mosaic (Netscape) were built with providing an ability to retrieve resources from the World Wide Web (Please note that HTTP is not just designed for Web browser and it can also be used via other clients)  Over the years Web Browsers have heavily evolved into an equivalent of an operating system. If you look at some of the modern browsers such as Chrome, Internet Explorer 11 of Firefox, they pretty much do many more things than just parsing HTML. Chrome has built Web Apps that run on the browser and those are not necessarily doing HTML parsing.  So, its definitely beyond parsing (I wouldn't call it interpret)
