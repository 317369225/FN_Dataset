â˜…HTML: What is HTML?
HTML is the "language" that web pages are written in - in fact, HTML stands for "hypertext mark-up language." Hyper is the opposite of linear. Old-fashioned computer programs were necessarily linear - that is, they had a specific order. But with a "hyper" language such as HTML, the user can go anywhere on the web page at any time. Text is just what you're looking at now - English characters used to make up ordinary words. Mark-up is what is done to the text to change its appearance. For instance, "marking up" your text with <b> before it and </b> after it will put that text in bold. Language is just that. HTML is the language that computers read in order to understand web pages.
