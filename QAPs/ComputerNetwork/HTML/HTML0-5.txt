★HTML: What is HTML?
HTML is a way for your browser to display text and images so you can actually read and see them in the layout and style that you created.  HTML (Hyper Text Mark Up Language) instructs your web browser how you want your webpage to look by telling the browser where headings stop and start, when to use which font and what style (bold, font size, italic) to show for text and more importantly when a word or words are hyperlinks which,  when clicked, can take you somewhere else on the internet.   Using HTML only the page layout is often controlled by using a table - content is placed in individual or merged cells to get the desired effect.  Images can also be used to control text placement. The most important thing to remember when using HTML is for every opening tag there has to be a closing tag and whichever order you opened tags you must close them in reverse order.
