â˜…Can CSS and HTML code be copyrighted?
Case 1 is definitely infringing the copyright. If you copy whole website and put it inside your hard-drive or host it someone, you are infringing the copyright. For Case 2, you are still violating the copyright if you don't spend the time to create the HTML/CSS yourself. Changing the class or ID name of the CSS/HTML will not make a difference. But unlike Case 1, you won't stand a good chance taking legal action against Case 2 and Case 3 depending on the argument ground used by the one who copied the code. Fair Use (by claiming he reverse engineered your website) and Coincidence (majority of websites look alike in terms of looks and codes, especially if you are using frameworks and things like HTML5Boilerplate) can be used as an argument.
