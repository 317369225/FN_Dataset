★What is HTML Elements?
Have you ever accidentally opened a Word document in notepad or TextEdit? It looks like a mishmash of symbols. That's because it is a mishmash of instructions like "bold this, indent here .." AND the text/content you typed. It's unreadable except by Word. HTML is a "markup" format.  This means the markup (bold ,indent, add image ...) is written right next to your text. It's readable by all web browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome...)  AND by humans.  It does this by surrounding the piece of text you want to  "markup" in some way with HTML tags or elements <h2> Hi </h2>     This says make "Hi"  a heading (bold and large )
