â˜…Difference Between HTML and CSS?
HTML is the code that makes a website. I learned HTML back in 1997-1998 when I created my first website from a software publisher app and a book. (back in my AOL dialup days) HTML uses the older markup method of assigning attributes to a page like WordPerfect and Wordstar. If you are familiar with "reveal codes" method of peeking at mark up codes in WordPerfect then you understand how HMTL works. MS-Word hides its page attribute codes so you never see that unless you try to open a page in Notepad. HTML is designed to be read and interpreted by your browser. This can vary by browser and platform so one important skill of a web designer is creating a page that your visitors can load and read. CSS is something you learn in later chapters after you learn to create HTML pages. CSS are not necessary but helpful if you want to be able to change your site to new formats in the future. CSS can also provide features not in standard HTML like boxes, headers, footers and designated spots for plug in content (like blogs or ads). I first learned CSS when I started using pre-made templates to create a site about 10 years ago. I developed my skills over time with each feature I wanted (like boxes). Today, it's best to start with both a web design and style in mind when creating a new website or upgrading one that you have. CSS is what defines your page structure and lets you create variations to allow more platforms (like mobile, tablets) access your site.
