★Is a web browser just an HTML interpreter?
It's main function is yes to render HTML + CSS and to interpret JS, but it also has a ton of other small features which help make navigating the net user friendly. Modern browsers: memorize what pages you've been into so you can see your history memorize your passwords if you let them as to make password management less of a hassle have options for when to not render css + js for whatever reasons allow the user to modify the browser aesthetically  so as to be more pleasing to the user allow certain pages to be marked as important (bookmarks) for programmers to modify the html/css/js on the fly as it were allow other entities to build and install plugins for the browsers and this is a huge point allowing things like video streaming and avoiding advertising allow other languages except JS to run in the browser (flash,silverlight,java) although this is running out of favour Primary gateway to your search engine, yes you can type the url and navigate to the engine and use it but I think the vast majority of people just stick with the one their browser comes with chosen as default see Google creating Chrome and there are probably others I've missed So a modern browser is much more than a html renderer, as evidence html renderers have become such of a known quantity that they've become drag and drop components in some programming environments (VS+Winforms,Matlab). As another evidence just see how many browsers use the webkit renderer most notably Chrome and Opera but you wouldn't call them identical despite them sharing webkit.
