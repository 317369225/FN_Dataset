If you include CSS, then it looks like what it is now. Hence, CSS is the skin of a website. 2. Javascript in simple words is a technology used to make a website interactive. Based on user actions the controls or look of the page may be changed. You must have seen pop-ups on many websites like this one from w3schools: Hence, javascript is in action here.
