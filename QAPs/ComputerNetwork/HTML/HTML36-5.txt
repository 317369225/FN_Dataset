★How do I send a html email?I have an img tag, like this:  <img src="someImageLink.jpg"/> When I just type that in the body of gmail, the text gets displayed, not the image. How do I do this? I want to embed the image in the mail his body.
A quick easy way to do it is to create a web page (like create an HTML file on your desktop or something and edit it using a simple text editor). Then open that file and copy everything in the web page. When you paste it in the email it should work. I do this a lot for a monthly periodical I edit and post. Be careful not to link to anything that is saved on your own computer, all links need to be available online (i.e. "http://somewebsite.com/someImageLink.jpg").
