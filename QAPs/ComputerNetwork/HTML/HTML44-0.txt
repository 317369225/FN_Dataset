â˜…Can CSS and HTML code be copyrighted?
Copyright subsists in CSS, HTML or any other code (assuming there is a sufficient amount of code to constitute a work of authorship) as soon as the code is created in a fixed form. Please see "Copyright Protection in One Easy Lesson" at http://dana.sh/afM75p. Cases 1 and 2 constitute infringement of the copyright in the code, because the infringing party created an unauthorized copy or derivative work of the code. Please see "What is Copyright Infringement?" at http://dana.sh/grPwXf. Case 3 would not constitute infringement of the copyright in the original code, even if the new code is similar to the original code, because it was not derived form the original code. However, if the new site has a look and feel similar to the original site's, there may be trademark infringement.
