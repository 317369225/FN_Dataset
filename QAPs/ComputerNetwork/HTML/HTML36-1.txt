★How do I send a html email?I have an img tag, like this:  <img src="someImageLink.jpg"/> When I just type that in the body of gmail, the text gets displayed, not the image. How do I do this? I want to embed the image in the mail his body.
As Ke Huang wrote, MailChimp is a good solution for this. Another option is Constant Contact. These will also handle your mailing lists. The key thing regarding images in HTML email is that they aren't actually embedded in the message. Instead they are uploaded to a Web server and the code references the link to display them. I have an old blog post that explains HTML email in greater detail, including how to send it yourself using Thunderbird, an email program that allows you to paste in HTML. 5 Tips to ensure your readers can read your HTML e-mail messages
