â˜…What are the differences between HTML5 and HTML?
HTML is referring to the language as a whole. There are different versions of HTML. Html5 is the latest most recent release of the language. HTML1 was released in the year 1991. HTML2 was released in 1995. HTML3.2 was released in 1997. XHTML was released in 2000. HTML5 was released in 2014. (I'm not sure about that last one, I think html5 has been around longer than that). When you say 'HTML' you are referring to the language as a whole. If you say 'html5' then you are referring to what is currently the latest version of the language. Does that make sense?
