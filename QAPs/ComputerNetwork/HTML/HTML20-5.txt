â˜…What is HTML?
Whatever text u see displayed on a website is HTmL. The styling i.e the colors, fone etc is something called CSS(cascading style sheet). And the animations and other effects are a result of Javascript. All the input and login fields are mostly based on php. So basically a website or a Web page is a result of 3-4 scripting languages working together. Like a person understands some language such as hindi or English or any other language. A Web browser understands text i.e what to display thru html. The way the person understands something conveyed to him can vary. For example sign languages or visual aids can help him understand the message conveyed thru the language better. Css does a smiling thing to a we page. And the process of interaction with some other person is where php pr other languages such as ruby on rails and python kicks in. Php mysql and other languages are for the backend support. I hope this helps :)
