How is H.265 so much more efficient than H.264?The general idea is that for H.265 we can now do more calculations per video, thanks to the Moore's law. There's a whole bunch of techniques that yield more efficient coding. To list a few:
H.265 introduces Coding Tree Blocks, which allows for encoding of larger macroblocks (Coding Units)
It uses more precise transform matrices
It uses better motion estimation
