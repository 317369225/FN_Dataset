★Why do we have MAC protocols and routing protocols?
First lest look at the beginning of the osi layers, witch is a standar for communications between computers,The three fist ones are the ones that we are going to focus Physical or electrical or just the cable and or repeater, Data link layer witch includes the MAC address and the hub, And network layer witch includes TCP/IP address, MAC address is a unique address for each device, witch the hub  all what it does is the parquet that it receives it sends to all the ports, Now the computer that sends the pa quote writes the destination MAC address the hubs sends it to all the computers and all the computers discard the plaques except by the one with the MAC address, now you can spoof MAC address so you can received both computers the plaques Now the TCP/IP sends the Mac adress and the ip adress, to the router, and the router sends it to the specific computer, who is the receiver of the paquets Even if you spook the Mac adress and the ip adress. So the TCP/IP and routers create the networks and subnetworks, and the Mac adress just create one network  as a regular water piping    Embed Quote
