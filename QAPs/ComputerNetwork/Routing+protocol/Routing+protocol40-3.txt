★Can the Internet ever be shut down?
Of course it could, and people saying otherwise are ridiculously naive. There are only a few people who could do it, perhaps; it not be easy, perhaps - but it would be possible, The vast majority of servers that people think of a "the internet" are in the USA. Disconnect them and there is no Google, no Facebook, no Office365. iTunes won't work. No Quora. No Paypal. No Wikipedia. (There may be mirror sites but they are controlled by USA companies and hence the USA) For most people that qualifies as "no internet" Then there are the DNS servers. Turkey tried to switch off internt by stoping DNS, but it was easy to workaround by typing 8.8.8.8 -- but that is Google and it stops working. No DNS = no www Those are controlled by ICANN The Internet Is Actually Controlled By 14 People Who Hold 7 Secret Keys Of course, even without DNS & most website there is the "raw connectivity": email will still work, ftp will still work (as long as you do not need to use any US companies or US servers, of course). So finally you have DDoS. And Trojans. Ad backdoors. And killswitches And The USA has one of the biggest and smartest cyberwar resouces on earth. USA wants to shut things down, it will do so. I'd bet that Cisco, or Apple, or Juniper or Apache or Micosoft WebServices or IBM Domino or...  will have backdoors, or kill switch *somewhwre*. They can shut down anything they want. It might not be easy, and I can't imagine why people would want to do it -- but it would be very possible.    Embed Quote
