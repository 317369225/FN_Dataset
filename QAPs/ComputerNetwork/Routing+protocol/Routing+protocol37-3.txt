★What are some of the great projects implemented using the concepts of Graph Theory?Real Life Products or Projects that involve the usage of graphs for  implementing them.
Just adding few more applications to Cosmin Negruseri list: 1. Planar graph are used to determine whether a circuit can be implemented on a planar circuit board or not (As in a CPU Mother board, no two connection lines cross each other). 2. Graph coloring is used to color map of regions so that minimum no of colors are needed with no two adjacent regions having the same color. 3. Graph coloring is used for frequency assignments for Radio /Television/Telephone networks. 4. Many operating system/Database system use Resource-allocation and Wait-for graphs  for deadlock detection and deadlock avoidance. 5. Many Transaction Processing systems use Precedence graphs to determine  Serializability of transactions (So that they can be scheduled to execute concurrently or serially). 6. Graphs are used in ecology to model the interaction of different species of animals to depict niche overlap. 7. Isomorphism in graphs is used in chemistry to model structure of  compounds. One application is to determine Isomers (Different compounds having same molecular formula but different structure). 8. Eulerian circuit can be used to solve puzzles which ask a particular picture to b drawn in a continuous motion without lifting a pencil so that no part of the picture is retraced. 9. Last but not least graphs can be used to model and solve the Jealous Husbands Problem :-).    Embed Quote
