★Why do we do error checking at both the TCP layer as well as the data link layer through Checksum and CRC respectively?In TCP/IP stack, we do error checking at transport layer through checksums as well as data link layer through CRC. My question is that if we have checked our data through CRC, why do we re-check it through checksum at the transport layer?
There are a few reasons, but the primary one is that TCP/IP runs over various datalink protocols, of which some might not provide this service. As well, the datalink mechanism only looks at one end of a broadcast domain to the other, while TCP will give you an end to end check of a reliable transmission.    Embed Quote
