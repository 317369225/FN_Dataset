★What is the difference between MAC and routing protocols in general (or in WSN)?
MAC addresses? Mac addresses are layer 2 addresses. They are used by layer 2 devices like switches to make a forwarding decision. They are 'universally' unique, in a way, they are unique in the world. But an exception can happen when your mac addresses can be change, i heard some OS allows you to change mac addresses which defeats the purpose of being universally unique. Another thing, in a mac addresses, the first half is called OUI, organizationally unique identifier. I forgot what's the next half is called. Routing protocols are in a different layer. They are layer 3 technologies that uses layer 3 technologies to make forwarding decisions. This layer 3 technology is the IP address. Routing protocols is a vast topic but to give you an overview routing protocols can be grouped into three: distance vector, link state, and hybrid. Distance vector uses hops as metrics technologies under this is: RIP, and RIPv2. Link state are OSPF (not sure though), hybrid EIGRP(not sure too, hihihi). Routing protocols are also used to exchange routing information between layer 3 devices (routers). Every time all of the routers has the complete routing topology in a network they can be considered as a converged network. To sum up, MAC addresses for switches, IP addresses for routers. Routing protocols help exchange routing routing information between devices. If you want more in depth information, I can give you links to my fav books in these topics. Trust me, you'll learn a lot.    Embed Quote
