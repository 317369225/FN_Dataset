★What are the pros and cons of using ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing protocol instead of link state and distance vector protocol?
Ad-hoc networking normally implies a mobile network, typically continually in flux, usually with somewhat questionable link quality and low bandwidth. Under these conditions, the general result was that link state performed poorly.  Every transient failure between any two notes results in flooding of a link state change and a forced SPF by all nodes.  The amount of traffic generated by the flooding can be enough to trigger subsequent perceived link failures, resulting in further traffic and enough positive feedback to drive the system into collapse. For this reason, distance vector has been the preferred, if imperfect solution.  A more sophisticated solution is definitely an open research topic in this area.  I suspect that the right answer will be an entirely new type of protocol that is neither distance vector nor flooding based.    Embed Quote
