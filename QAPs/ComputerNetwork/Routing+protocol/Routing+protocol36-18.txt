★What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
That the reason we don't see more horrible, hilarious failures in the software we all use every day is not because the software is free of such flaws. It's because we haven't reproduced the conditions that lead to their manifestation. Maybe those conditions are just so unlikely that they'll never occur. There are thousands of such "latent" bugs everywhere, all around us, but we just can't see them. This is probably best summed up by the following bit of programming lore: The only program without bugs is the program that has run for the last time.    Embed Quote
