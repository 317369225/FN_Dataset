★Can the Internet ever be shut down?
To completely shutdown the Internet, you would have to shut down all the routers in the world, so that networks cannot connect to each other. In addition to this, you will need to disable all the DNS services/servers world over, including the 13 Root Name Servers. This would shutdown the Internet in its entirety. What would be left, are pockets of individual networks, that would not be able to connect to other networks, hence no "inter" net. You would still be having a network that might/might-not function by itself, depending on what services, etc. might be running on it. But all in all, if you shut down all the routers and DNS services, you will have a network, that cannot be called an Internet any longer.    Embed Quote
