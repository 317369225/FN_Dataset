★Why do we do error checking at both the TCP layer as well as the data link layer through Checksum and CRC respectively?In TCP/IP stack, we do error checking at transport layer through checksums as well as data link layer through CRC. My question is that if we have checked our data through CRC, why do we re-check it through checksum at the transport layer?
I'd like to add to all these good answers that the networking equipment in charge of the data link will raise an alarm or even bring down a link when there are excessive errors reported, regardless of what is being transported on the upper layers. Layer 2 CRC is used for this.    Embed Quote
