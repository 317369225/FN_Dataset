★Why do we do error checking at both the TCP layer as well as the data link layer through Checksum and CRC respectively?In TCP/IP stack, we do error checking at transport layer through checksums as well as data link layer through CRC. My question is that if we have checked our data through CRC, why do we re-check it through checksum at the transport layer?
I've run TCP/IP over differential current drivers on barbed wire, and over pulses of mud. Hey, it's what I had, OK? Vastly different from nearly lossless fiber optic connection enabled Ethernet. Thing is, TCP/IP doesn't KNOW what it's running on. And the routing protocols will glibly vector your packets off onto whatever looks "shortest" from a hop-count and policy perspective. So, belt, and suspenders. Because when your pants fall off, you want to be wearing clean underware.    Embed Quote
