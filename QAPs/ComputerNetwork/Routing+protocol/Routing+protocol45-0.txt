★How does Internet work with respect to routing?
Well, a full answer is a book that I should write someday. In a nutshell: each ISP runs a protocol within its network. This is usually either OSPF or IS-IS. These are link state routing protocols that build out a full map of what is going on within that network. This is enough information to route traffic within that network, but not between networks. To get traffic between networks, ISPs use BGP. Each network injects information into BGP, and networks that are willing to deliver traffic to that network pass it along. Each router only passes along the routes that it is actually using, and the entire path to the destination is carried to prevent loops from forming. Traffic now flows in the opposite direction of the routing advertisements.    Embed Quote
