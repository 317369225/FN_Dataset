★Why do we have MAC protocols and routing protocols?
By "routing protocol", I think you mean "IP protocol". With MAC address, each node can select address by themself. (yes, MAC address is setuped by hardware manufactory, but can be changed by administrator) Everyone wanna communicate with it should broadcast "Who is this guy", and get a response. So as the network get larger and larger, more and more broadcast packets send in net. So, the first improve we can imagine, is to setup some "supernode", which know everyone's MAC address nearby, and which MAC address they should looking for if some address not nearby. So other nodes just send packets to those "supernode" and they will delivery. Those "supernode", we called "router" now. Next problem, every router must remember who is responsed for which MAC address. As internet growing so fast, router's memory will exhausted quickly. So there comes subnet. User can not select address by themself. They got an address from NIC, so NIC can arrange all users with same perfix under same router. Other routers just have to remember this prefix. This will save a lot of memory. This solution, we called "IP protocol". The problem next, will be "How to arrange address and update routers automatically?". That's the work of real "Routing Protocol", like RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP. And the story not ended yet. Internet moving so fast that network protocol still evolving quickly. New problem coming everyday, like IPv6, etc.    Embed Quote
