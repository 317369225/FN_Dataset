★How do Bellman-Ford Algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm work differently in routing protocols?I would like to know the different rules they apply to choose the shortest paths to destinations.
For the complete algorithms, you better go through the text. You'll have a better understanding. Now, in Bellman ford or distance vector algorithm, the routers know only about the their neighbors and their costs from the neighbors to different subnets that they have to reach. Every 30 seconds, routers exchange these so called 'distance vectors' with their neighbors and thus keep themselves updated. In Dijkstra Algorithm, all the routers in a network have knowledge of complete network. This algorithm is also called link state algorithm and the link state information is maintained by all the routers. Eg- say you are in new city and want  to go from point A to B. Bellman Ford will tell you that you can go from A to C with  cost of $5, and from C you can get to B. There might be other stops (routers) between B and C. Whereas, Dijkstra will give you a map of the whole city and show you that this is how to get to point B from point A. In other words, it gives the routers information of whole network topology and let them decide how to get from A to B the fastest or cheapest.    Embed Quote
