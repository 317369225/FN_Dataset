★Can the Internet ever be shut down?
If you could figure out a way to cause the outermost devices to be overloaded with electricity, and work inwards from there, you could effectively destroy the entire Internet. All the devices are connected to power and/or ethernet, so you send surges through those and poof, no Internet. It would be quite the undertaking but it is absolutely possible. Consider a fantasy world where it is feasible to create a mass of micro-drones with EMP capabilities, that were themselves shielded from the effect of EMP. Put them on auto-pilot and give them a map of the Internet. If they were small enough, they would be hard to detect and hard to stop. If they were 2" x 2" they could fly right into NOCs and wreak havoc.    Embed Quote
