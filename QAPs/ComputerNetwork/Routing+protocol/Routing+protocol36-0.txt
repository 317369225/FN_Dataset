★What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
That the key to being good is knowing how to solve problems not in having encyclopedic knowledge. Something I have to try to explain time & again when a non-technical person asks me “how do I do x on my computer” is that I don't know. I can't explain to you step by step over the phone how to make an image bigger in your document or how to print on both sides of the paper or how to switch between the internal and external speakers. I can probably – given the computer in front of me, some opportunity to explore the problem and accurate information about what you're trying to do – figure it out. I'm familiar with the language of user interfaces and can use intuition and experience to explore an unfamiliar tool. I'm also less afraid of accidentally breaking something. Programming is more like that than one might think. Sure, there's knowledge involved but a lot of it comes down to familiarity with concepts, recognizing similarities in problems so you can apply similar approaches, probing the problem space with different techniques to see what works and when you get stuck knowing how and where to look for guidance.    Embed Quote
