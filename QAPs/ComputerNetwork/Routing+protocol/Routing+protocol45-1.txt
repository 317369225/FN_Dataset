★How does Internet work with respect to routing?
One-Line Answer: Longer Text Answer: No single place on the Internet knows "how to get all the way to any other place."  Instead, each place keeps a list of next-hops to get one step closer to {wherever}. Example: BOSTON knows (to NEW-YORK, next hop CONNECTICUT) BOSTON knows (to MAINE, next hop NEW-HAMPSHIRE) BOSTON knows (to NANTUCKET, next hop ATLANTIC-OCEAN) BOSTON knows (to NIAGRA-CANADA, next hop NEW-YORK) And, in turn: NEW YORK knows (to DELAWARE, next hop PENNSYLVANIA) NEW YORK knows (to MICHIGAN, next hop LAKE-ERIE) NEW YORK knows (to KENTUCKY, next hop WEST-VIRGINIA) So, even though BOSTON can't get to (and doesn't know how to) get to KENTUCKY directly, it knows the "next hop" is NEW-YORK, and, when it gets to NEW-YORK, NEW-YORK knows its "next hop" to KENTUCKY is through WEST-VIRGINIA.  BOSTON figures out the travel one hop at a time, stopping at each step to ask "hey, where do you think the next hop is?" Now, let's assume that NEW YORK sinks down 500 miles into the earth, and no longer exists (can't be reached from surface, can't be driven/traveled through).  Obviously, the old methods of navigating (driving through NEW YORK) will need to change. So BOSTON updates its list-of-next-hops.  Two entries need changing: BOSTON knows (to NEW-YORK, next hop NULL-IMPOSSIBLE) ** BOSTON knows (to MAINE, next hop NEW-HAMPSHIRE) BOSTON knows (to NANTUCKET, next hop ATLANTIC-OCEAN) BOSTON knows (to NIAGRA-CANADA, next hop ST-LAWRENCE-RIVER) ** Do you see what happened there? BOSTON updated its routing table with next-hop information.  And it's not just one change -- other locations will depend on BOSTON for their next-hop (e.g., RHODE-ISLAND needs to go through BOSTON to go most places north), so, as BOSTON updates its routing table, other locations around BOSTON update *their* routing tables with next-hop information, and so on, and so on.  The routing tables "ripple" outward like a stone dropped into a pool of water, as one change affects other locations' next-hop information. That, in a nutshell, is how Internet routing works.  For more info, read up on Dijkstra's Algorithm, or (if possible) find a YouTube video showing it (Dijkstra's Algorithm), and the "routing table ripples" ('routing table updates') I discuss above.    Embed Quote
