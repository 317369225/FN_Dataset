★What are network routing protocols?
Routing protocols are essentially how routers determine source-destination links throughout the network. Routers can be described as the traffic managers of the Internet. Although, this may sound as a vague description; it's in my opinion easiest to understand. To give you an example, most of the application on your computer use a technique called packetisation to transfer data over the Internet. Let's suppose you're trying to send and some data from a computer in Sydney, Australia to a computer in Arizona, USA. Each data packet that leaves your system is prefixed with some additional data, also known as packet header. Imagine that as you leaving your home with only the address of your final destination in your hand and have no idea how to actually reach there. As soon as your packet arrives to the nearest ISP router, the router correlates the destination with the something known as a routing table to determine which port/interface should the packet be forwarded to next. Think of it as you stopping 3kms down the road after leaving your phone and asking some random stranger for the way towards your destination and he points you towards the right road. Now, routing tables are usually not static except in some secure networks and hence router need to generate these themselves. The way they do that is through using routing protocols. These are pieces of software that tell a router how to find those routes. Route determination can be based on anything ranging from link quality to geographical distance.    Embed Quote
