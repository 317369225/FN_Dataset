★What would be the network topology/design/parameters that would be a real nightmare to any routing protocol?
In my experience, the biggest nightmare for any distributed protocol is dealing with malicious nodes.  By a malicious node, I mean any node that deliberately tries to seize control of or disrupt the network, by injecting false data, impersonating other nodes, and so forth.  Designing a distributed protocol with "bounded trust" so that nodes are able to interoperate with trustable nodes but also identify and reject untrustworthy ones, is one of the most challenging things to do.  The use of shared secrets or of cryptographic methods for authentication control is not sufficient, because of the possibility that a node might be hijacked or become effectively malicious through a software defect.    Embed Quote
