★How do ARP and routing protocols actually work?
This is actually very simple: The routing table contains a set of prefixes as computed by the routing protocols. They all perform the shortest path calculations and inject their results into the routing table. The result for each prefix (ignoring multi-path situations) is a "next hop". In most implementations, this is the IP address of the next router to go to, and maybe which interface should be used to get there. If the interface isn't there, then a second lookup can tell you that. Once you have an interface, if it's Ethernet or other 802.3 network, then it's time to look in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache. If the next hop address is in the cache, you're good to go. If not, then the router needs to generate an ARP request for that address.    Embed Quote
