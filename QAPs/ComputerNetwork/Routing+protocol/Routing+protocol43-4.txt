★Why do we do error checking at both the TCP layer as well as the data link layer through Checksum and CRC respectively?In TCP/IP stack, we do error checking at transport layer through checksums as well as data link layer through CRC. My question is that if we have checked our data through CRC, why do we re-check it through checksum at the transport layer?
As well as other good answers, occasionally corruption can occur either before the cro is calculated or after it is checked. Of course, in a well-performing system, it won't. But not all systems are well performing.    Embed Quote
