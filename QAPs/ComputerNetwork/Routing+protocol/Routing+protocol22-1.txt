★How do I differentiate methods of routing and routing protocols (static vs. dynamic)?
Static routing means that there exists a fixed configuration of routes in the equipment, usually edited by hand, but it can also be generated by a script or some other application. It means that the routing configuration never changes. If anything changes on the external world, the host will never know it and may end up forwarding packets to a black hole (or nowhere). Dynamic routing means that the host learn its routes from its neighbors. For it to work, the host has to exchange information about the routes available with the said neighbors. This exchange occurs via some routing protocol, from which there are several examples like RIP (a really simple one), OSPF (a more complex and realistic protocol), and BGP (the protocol used to exchange routing information about the Internet as a whole). The main advantage of routing protocols is that whenever something changes in one part of the network, this change is propagated through the network, which allows hosts to adjust their own routing tables and forward packets through the best known existing path. There are many types of dynamic routing protocols, but I think that's a little bit beyond the scope of this question.    Embed Quote
