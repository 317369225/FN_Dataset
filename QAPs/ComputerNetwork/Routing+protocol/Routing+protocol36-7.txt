★What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
On average we spend 10 times the initial cost of developing a program just to keep it working. Why? Because programs "rust". They may be coded in discrete zeros and ones but the environment in which the program runs changes e.g. Windows upgrade, new web browser technology, new hardware (like tablets), or people start using an old program to do something new. This means that programs can't work forever and that there is an ongoing cost to keep a program working properly. This is why Gartner finds that only between 2 to 16% of overall cost is spent on initial development, the rest on ongoing maintenance. This freaks out those in charge of budgeting, because they don't understand this / don't allow for this.    Embed Quote
