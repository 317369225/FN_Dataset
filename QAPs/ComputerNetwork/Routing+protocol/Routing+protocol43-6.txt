★Why do we do error checking at both the TCP layer as well as the data link layer through Checksum and CRC respectively?In TCP/IP stack, we do error checking at transport layer through checksums as well as data link layer through CRC. My question is that if we have checked our data through CRC, why do we re-check it through checksum at the transport layer?
There are a number of secondary reasons, which have to do with various error conditions that arise as packets are transmitted. The primary reason, as I understand it, is that it is a consequence of the layered design of our communication stack. The link layer, as an abstraction, is not obligated to provide data integrity, and TCP/IP do not restrict themselves to running over the layer 2 protocols that do. TCP and IP were designed together, but not together with the link layer. The number of assumptions that they can make about what is happening below them is fairly restricted, and in practice a single segment or datagram may be processed by several different devices and link layer protocols as it travels the world to get to its destination. It is very interesting to note that UDP and TCP both use a segment (full message) checksum, but IP provides only a header checksum. A perfectly valid question, similar in spirit to yours, would be: why doesn't every layer perform an integrity check?    Embed Quote
