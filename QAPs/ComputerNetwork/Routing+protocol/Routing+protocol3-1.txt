★What is a routing protocol?
Hi friends, I am not an expert in networking  but based on the knowledge that i have on Routing I would say that one has to chose the protocol based on the scenario. First, are you looking for an interior gateway protocol  and your network size is small (less than 8 routers in Intranet), you can very well go for RIPv2 or if your network is little bigger than that and you don't have expertise, you can go for EIGRP. These two are distance vector routing protocol. Second, you want faster and reliable routing, than OSPF is the best. I used the shortest Distance algorithm to forward packets and it have many added features when compared to others. OSPF is a link state routing protocol and its very dynamic in nature. There are few others out there about which I dont have much idea, so i m not going to speak about that.    Embed Quote
