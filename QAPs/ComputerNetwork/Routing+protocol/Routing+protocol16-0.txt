★Why do link-state routing protocols converge faster than distance vector protocols?
A link state protocol maintains a complete topology database of an "area"[1] in every node and monitors aggressively for state changes. Upon detection of a state change, each node can decisively conclude what happened and take quick action to adjust forwarding accordingly. By contrast, distance vector protocols exchange periodic announcements (and route poison events) only with neighbors, out to the boundaries of some defined "autonomous system" [2].  As a result, each node has to infer a lot of information about the surrounding network.  Since each node has limited information, routing table updates will happen more slowly in order to prevent incorrect routing or routing loops.  You can speed up convergence time by increasing the frequency of announcements (causing wasted bandwidth) or reducing hold down time (increasing the change of routing loops).  By default, the timers get set very conservatively to allow for most worst case topologies. [1] An area is an arbitrary grouping of nodes that agree to keep a complete picture of the topology of all the nodes in that area.  [2] An autonomous system (AS) is analogous to an area, although an AS is only used to determine whether or not a node listens to an update.  Each node knows nothing about other members of the AS other than its immediate neighbors.    Embed Quote
