★How do I differentiate methods of routing and routing protocols (static vs. dynamic)?
There are two major classes of dynamic routing protocols, "link state" and "distance vector". Distance vector protocols include RIP, which is described in RFC 1058 and RIPv2 in RFC 2453 (STD 56). A key algorithm is the Bellman–Ford algorithm, which describes to each router how to update their routing tables when they get updates. Another distance vector protocol is Cisco's EIGRP. Link state protocols include OSPFv2, which is described in RFC 2328 (STD 54). All routers in OSPF networks maintain an identical database containing the autonomous system's topology, and they compute a routing table using a shortest-path tree. A key algorithm is the Dijkstra algorithm, which solves the single-source shortest path problem. A contemporaneous link state protocol is IS-IS, which originated with DECnet. The other major routing protocol that is different from these two is BGP, the Border Gateway Protocol. BGP is designed to be a routing protocol that connects various autonomous systems together, and handles routing on the global Internet. To accomplish this, especially in core routers that take in a full routing table from the whole Internet, it has a lot of policy routing knobs that enable different network managers to maintain diverse policies for what traffic they will accept and how they will route it while still maintaining something like global reachability. BGP completely replaced EGP, which served the same function but was limited to routing on tree-structured networks.    Embed Quote
