★What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
Computers aren't smart. By default, they don't do what you want them to do. If a computer does what you want it to do, it's because somebody has worked very hard in telling the computer how to do that. This came up all the time when I was in charge of the point-of-sale system at a small cooperative grocery store. We had a minuscule budget for IT, so our point-of-sale system was some combination of open source code and code that I had written myself. It wasn't optimal, but it got the job done. On one occasion, I was in the store and a customer presented a manufacturer's coupon. I told the cashier that she'd have to apply a discount manually since the point-of-sale system would give an error if she tried to scan the coupon with the barcode scanner. The cashier said, "I'll just try it anyway." She scanned the coupon, and sure enough, an error popped up. I knew what would happen because I had written the code that processed input from the barcode scanner. Of course, I understand that the cashier wasn't familiar with the codebase. What was eye-opening to me was that she thought there was a chance that the system would somehow know that this barcode was a coupon, how much it was worth, and which products it could be applied to, even as I was telling her that it hadn't been programmed to do any of that.    Embed Quote
