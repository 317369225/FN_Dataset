★Routing Protocols: Do Cisco or Juniper routers log LDP state changes?  In other words, is there a log file that tracks all label state changes on a {label,next hop} granularity which can provide a change history?
I'd answer your question with another question. Why? By default, routers don't track state change for LDP or many other protocols unless you configure it otherwise. But most deployments don't as it's usually not helpful information unless you're trying to track down a bug. What is the goal? Is it to understand routing at a particular instance in time? Then maybe looking at IGP or RSVP state would be useful. Is it to understand the amount of traffic to a destination? Then maybe netflow or SNMP polling of LDP stats could be the answer. Start with the goal, and maybe another solution will reveal itself.    Embed Quote
