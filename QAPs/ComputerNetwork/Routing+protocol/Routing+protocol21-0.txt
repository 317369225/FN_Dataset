★How do I write a review paper on network routing protocols?
I think asking the following questions to yourself before/after writing a review paper on any topic will help you write a better paper: Does it trace the evolution of the subject over time, starting from the earliest efforts? Does it give a comparison of different views on the subject matter of interest? Does it point out existing shortcomings and future directions? Does it give an overview of the subject as well as the tools and skills required to venture into the subject?    Embed Quote
