★Can the Internet ever be shut down?
It's worth remembering that there is no such thing as "the internet". The "internet" is in fact a collection of many networked networks. If you disconnected these networks, the disconnected pieces would continue to work perfectly well... ... as long as the servers you were trying to connect with were on the portion of the network you happened to find yourself on. In this sense, the "internet" can't be shut down. If, however, we disconnected the portion of the internet holding, say, the Quora servers, then you would not be able to use Quora. It's also worth noting that many, many services are now highly distributed, for both scalability and fault-tolerance. So there is no longer a "Google" server, but instead there are tens of thousands of machines which act as Google. As long as some of those machines were on the same portion of the internet as you, then you would be able to continue to use what you saw as "Google".    Embed Quote
