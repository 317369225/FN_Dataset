★Why do we do error checking at both the TCP layer as well as the data link layer through Checksum and CRC respectively?In TCP/IP stack, we do error checking at transport layer through checksums as well as data link layer through CRC. My question is that if we have checked our data through CRC, why do we re-check it through checksum at the transport layer?
If the probability of the fault is very high at that lower layer then it is worth putting additional correcting at that layer. Catching them and fixing them early is cheaper than catching them and fixing them later. This is because many more lower layer PDUs have been collected to assemble a higher layer PDU. So if a higher layer PDU was rejected due to a single fault in one of its component lower layer PDUs then the entire collection of lower layer PDUs in that higher layer PDU is rejected as well. As many point out, in the early days of computer networking and the Internet, there were many data link and physical layer protocols that are not as reliable as the ones we have today. So the probability of a fault was high.    Embed Quote
