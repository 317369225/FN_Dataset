★What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
Programming is best done "in the zone" - a (pleasant) state of mind where your focus on the task is absolute and everything seems easy. This is probably much like "the zone" for musicians and athletes.  Programming scales very poorly. A lone programmer can be extremely productive when you compare him/her to a team of ten programmers. Ten programmers will still seem very productive when you compare them to a team of a hundred programmers. This is why large software systems built by big companies are so expensive, and why so many lone "geniuses" build wonderful pieces of software.    Embed Quote
