★What is the difference between MAC and routing protocols in general (or in WSN)?
MAC protocols gets mesh nodes to talk to each other on the *same* shared (if its WSN, wireless) channel. My adviser used to say that MAC protocol is just like talking etiquette, when people are speaking there are visual cues that prevent us from speaking over each other. For machine these cues are codified in the MAC protocol (i.e. dont speak if you hear some one CSMA, but if you still collide back off with a window that doubles every time etc). Routing protocol  mesh nodes that are not on the same *shared* channel to still talk to each other. This is like the protocol that gets your mail envelope from your home to a home in timbuktu --- the post office implements a protocol which determine who picks up the envelope and where does it go next to *finally* reach the home in timbuktu --- you dont care how as long as you can write down an address that the postal system understand (the destination routing address)? Makes sense?    Embed Quote
