★What would be the network topology/design/parameters that would be a real nightmare to any routing protocol?
The biggest problem that I know of is a full-mesh topology and a link-state protocol. Consider the messaging implications when doing flooding of a link state change: A link breaks between two systems, A and B. A and B each reflect this by changing their link state advertisement packets. This they then flood to each of their N neighbors. Each of their N neighbors then floods that to its N neighbors, where it is promptly discarded as a duplicate.Total messages: N + N^2 Many implementations have been known to collapse while doing this. This was christened the 'exploding chrysanthemum' problem by Mike O'Dell. To make it worse, you run two overlapping levels of SPF. This becomes the 'double exploding chrysanthemum'. Been there, done this.    Embed Quote
