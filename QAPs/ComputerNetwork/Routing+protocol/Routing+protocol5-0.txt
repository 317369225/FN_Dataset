★How do routing protocols work?
In general, routing protocols are an information distribution mechanism.  They need to distribute enough information so that each node in the network can compute paths through the topology. There are varying ways of doing this, but the two most common approaches are known as "distance vector" and "link-state" protocols.  Distance vector protocols distribute, as the name implies, a vector of distances to destinations.  From that nodes can trivially select the shortest distance. Link-state protocols distribute the state of each link in the network.  With a complete view of the topology, nodes can trivially compute a path.    Embed Quote
