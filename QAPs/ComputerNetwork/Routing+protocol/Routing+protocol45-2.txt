★How does Internet work with respect to routing?
I use the "hot potato passing" analogy. Think of the Internet as a bunch of people that are only aware of other people in their general vicinity. They don't know about all people in the system. Internet packets can been seen as a hot potatoes being passed from one person to another within this group of people. A potato simply enters the system with a destination and is passed to a person. When a person gets a potato, he simply passes it to the next neighboring person that he feels brings the potato closes to it's destination. Since the potato is hot, the people is passed as possible. This happens until the potato gets to its destination or is dropped after its TTL expires. TTL is the maximum number of people the potato can be passed to before it is dropped.    Embed Quote
