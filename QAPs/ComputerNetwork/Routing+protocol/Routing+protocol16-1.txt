★Why do link-state routing protocols converge faster than distance vector protocols?
Link state : I follow - act then think. There is a change, I need to tell everyone. shout and tell all the neighbors which in turns tells its neighbors and so on. Now we all can think and compute the new route (parallel processing). Time taken = change propagation (Flooding) + 1 unit Thinking Time (SPF computation) Distance Vector : I follow - think before you act. There is a change, ooh. let me think what has changed. Alright I know what has changed.. Hey neighbor this has changed. Neighbor does the same (thinks and then propagates the change) and so on (Serial Processing) This even with the faster converging 'triggered update' mechanism. Time Taken = change propagation + n unit Thinking Time    Embed Quote
