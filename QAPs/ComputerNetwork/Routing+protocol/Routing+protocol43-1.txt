★Why do we do error checking at both the TCP layer as well as the data link layer through Checksum and CRC respectively?In TCP/IP stack, we do error checking at transport layer through checksums as well as data link layer through CRC. My question is that if we have checked our data through CRC, why do we re-check it through checksum at the transport layer?
The first thing that comes to mind is that not all data link layers that are used for TCP/IP use checksums at the frame level.  Yes, Ethernet frames have a CRC on them, but there are plenty of transports that don't (SLIP comes to mind), and thus might pass defective packets up the stack.  Therefore, the checksums are needed to ensure that damaged packets are rejected, which is why there are checksums in both the IP packet header and TCP/UDP datagram headers.    Embed Quote
