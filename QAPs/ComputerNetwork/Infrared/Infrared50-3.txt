★Is it possible for you to convert the infrared energy from a stove to electric energy so it can be useful for home electrical purposes?
Not really.     The efficiency of a heat-engine is proportional to the temperature change over the absolute temperature.   With a stove you will have maybe 10 degrees of difference divided by about 300, so the absolute maximum efficiency is like 3%.    It's really hard to make a heat engine cheaply enough to run at 3% efficiency to even pay back the interest cost on the amount of money tied up in building it.      For example most gas home furnaces have an outlet gas temperature of around 40 degrees C.   That isn't high enough to make it worthwhile to add a heat-exchanger onto that to extract that amount of heat.   A heat-exchanger and fan would cost an extra $100 or so and there is no way to even pay back the $10 or so per year that borrowing that $100 would cost you.     Same thing with capturing the heat difference between surface and bottom water in the ocean, too small a difference to ever get close to paying back the interest, much less the capital investment.    Embed Quote
