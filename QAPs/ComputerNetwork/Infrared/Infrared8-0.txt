★Is infrared light or heat?If it's both, then is heat just another form of light? How is that possible, if heat is related to temperature?
Both light and infrared are electromagnetic radiation.  There is a band of the electromagnetic spectrum (wavelengths between about .4 and .7 microns) to which the human eye responds, which allows us to see; we call it "light". Wavelengths longer than .7 microns and shorter than that of microwaves are called "infra-red" which means "less than red" and here "less than" refers to the frequency (the longer the wavelength, the lower the frequency).  Greatly simplifying the explanation in order to render it immediately accessible: infrared has the property that it causes atoms and molecules to vibrate faster.  This increase in vibration is what causes (or is, if you like) heat. Similarly, substances which are particularly hot, and have their atoms vibrating particularly quickly, will emit radiation at the speed at which they are vibrating.  That radiation will (at lower frequencies) be infrared, but if you heat the substance up more, and the atoms vibrate even faster, then the radiation emitted becomes of a wavelength shorter and shorter, and eventually becomes so short (i.e. shorter than .7 microns) that it becomes visible as light. This is why when you heat up a piece of iron, it starts by radiating heat, and then more heat, and eventually you see it glowing red, then yellow, then eventually white.  The light is white because at that point it is emitting EM radiation across the whole light spectrum. In answer to your next question: "If you heat it up even more, does it radiate ultraviolet?" I will leave you to investigate on your own.    Embed Quote
