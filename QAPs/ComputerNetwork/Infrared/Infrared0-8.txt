★What would we see ultraviolet or infrared light as?if an object reflects only ultraviolet light and absorbs every other what  would it look like? what about of it only reflected infrared light? how would a normal person see those objects?
If it reflects only UV light (and transmits everything else in and around the visible region), it will be transparent. Glass reflects in the IR region. If it absorbs everything else, it would be black. We can't see UV/IR light, as our eyes don't have the ability to do so, and our brains don't have a color for it anyway.    Embed Quote
