★Is it possible for you to convert the infrared energy from a stove to electric energy so it can be useful for home electrical purposes?
Since most stoves run by a form of electrical energy (even a gas stove uses electric igniters and electricity to control it electronics) even if though this can be done, the question has to be what type of situation would make doing this the most efficient use of energy? Transforming heat into electricity is possible as Kevin Dwyer notes. However, if one has electricity in the first place, why wouldn’t they then use that electrical power as an energy source to power a dedicated heating unit?    Embed Quote
