★Is it possible for you to convert the infrared energy from a stove to electric energy so it can be useful for home electrical purposes?
The stove radiates its infrared energy into a 360 degree sphere so the stove would literally have to be surrounded by converters to capture and convert 100% of the heat leaving. Its also not very efficient to convert convected heat or radiated heat into electricity. Even if we were to incercept 100% of the radiation leaving the stove, using available means only a few percent can be converted. Heat is best converted in large concentrated quantities like a steam boiler from a combustion process, the use the steam to turn a turbine. The heat can be concentrated and the steam concentrated to make it most efficient. capturing lost energy off a stove is not going to be worth the effort.    Embed Quote
