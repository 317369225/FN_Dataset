★Where can I buy infrared color film?I'm looking for infrared color film (not b/w).
This is unfortunately near impossible. There are few people who manually cut aerial film rolls into 35 or 120 but even that film (Aerial EIR) as been discontinued (by Kodak). The main guy for this is named Dean and you can get on his waiting list here: http://www.tarquinius.de/    Embed Quote
