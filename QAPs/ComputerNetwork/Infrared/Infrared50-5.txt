★Is it possible for you to convert the infrared energy from a stove to electric energy so it can be useful for home electrical purposes?
What follows is still not practical in the case cited by the questioner but an interesting other way to go is to use Gallium Antimonide (GaSb) photovoltaic cells like the JX Crystal's folks do: Thermo PV | JX Crystals This avoids the Carnot Cycle. But you better have a use for heat because conversion of the IR waves is a low voltage affair and lots of heat is going to get away/through the gear. They report 100 watts of electricity and 25,000 BTU of heat. (the 100 Watts would be about 1400 BTU) so 26,400 BTU in gets around 5% out as electricity. Pretty neat, and the JX folks have some ideas about waste heat recovery opportunities, as well as cogeneration schemes that benefit from a zero or nearly zero moving parts solution.    Embed Quote
