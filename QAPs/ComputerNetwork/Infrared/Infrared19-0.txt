★Why does the Hubble use an infrared camera?
Astronomy is about collecting information and that information comes in the form of electromagnetic radiation.  Our eyes reveal very little of the electromagnetic spectrum - just that little sliver called visible.  So, astronomers use special cameras and sensors to gather light in other parts of the spectrum, such as infrared. Everything with a temperature above absolute zero emits infrared radiation. That means there is a lot of information available by looking at the infrared. Compare these two images from Hubble:      And these two: Look at all of the information that is visible in the infrared but not in the visible. Infrared allows us to see through clouds of gas to examine what is behind them.  It also allows us to see cool objects that don't radiate much in the visible spectrum. Another very important use of infrared astronomy is that it allows us to see objects that are so far away that the expansion of space has redshifted their light out of the visible and into the infrared.  Those objects aren't visible in the visible spectrum.    Embed Quote
