★Is it possible for you to convert the infrared energy from a stove to electric energy so it can be useful for home electrical purposes?
Technically yes. Practically, you're building a heat engine which is limited by the Carnot cycle to a certain efficiency given by where TH is the heat reservoir temperature (the stove) and TC is the temperature of the cold reservoir (which will be the temperature of whatever is picking up the energy, which will probably be the boiling point of water). How hot do stoves get?  Depends on the type of stove, but 350F (449K) is a reasonable guess for the high setting on most stoves.  Wood burning stoves can get hotter.  Given the boiling point of water is 212F (373.15K), that gives you an efficiency of 1 - 373/449 = 17%. That is, less than 1/5th of the energy it takes to heat up your stove is possible to extract as electrical energy, and in practice you can probably only suck out 1/5th of what is possible, giving you closer to 4% efficiency. I'd rather conserve energy and just use the residual cooking heat to reduce how hard my furnace has to work.    Embed Quote
