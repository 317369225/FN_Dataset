★How is audio transmitted using infrared light?
Audio signal is analog signal which is amplified and converted to digital data via Analog to Digital Converters(ADC) . This digital data is padded up with additional bits to comply the infrared protocol and then transmitted via IR LEDs. On receiving side, IR sensor picks up the signal , amplified, decoded to get the audio data, then fed to Digital to Analog Converter(DAC) , amplified via power amplifiers and fed to speakers. This is how audio is transmitted using IR light. However if you want to play any audio using this communication channel the challenging parts are: 1. Knowing the IR transmission protocol. you need to design a IR receiver , listen to data , store it in a computer.Simultaneously record the audio over microphone also. Using  IR protocol analyser software(available in internet) decode the signal , compare with the recorded audio signal , if it matched. Eureka!!! 2.You need to design a transmitter powerful enough to override the actual transmitter. Since the communication is light medium, focussing lens for transmitting the data.(a separate arrangement incorporating 3 or 4 LEDs with focussing LEDs gives more reliable communication. But choice is yours). 3.Write an app that encodes the audio data you are choosing into the one compatible to IR protocol which  you analysed  in point 1. Execute it. If anyone have better idea than this, please  answer.    Embed Quote
