★Where can I buy infrared color film?I'm looking for infrared color film (not b/w).
I used this some years ago.  I happen to prefer the B&W over the false colors so I stopped using it.  Anyway, I looked to see if I had any in cold storage.  Sorry, I don't.  It's no longer made.  See Alexandra's answer for the wait list. A couple months ago, Photo Techniques magazine did an article on digital approaches with and without camera modification.  To me the look obtained from the digital approach is better than the EIR film.  You may want to look into it.    Embed Quote
