★Is it possible to heat something with an infrared laser while simultaneously measuring its temperature, again using infrared?Let's say I wanted to heat my fingertip to 42 degrees celcius and keep it there.  All without touching it.  Is it possible to do this?   I have heard that infrared detectors can image temperature.  Could I pulse the laser to heat, then detect, then heat, then detect?
Absolutely most IR thermometers look at wavelengths between 8 to 20 microns. Since IR lasers start from 0.7 microns, you can easily purchase a laser between 0.7 um to 8 um which can be used to heat your object which it is being measured simultaneously.    Embed Quote
