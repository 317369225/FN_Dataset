★Is it possible for you to convert the infrared energy from a stove to electric energy so it can be useful for home electrical purposes?
In theory, this is possible; however, in practice it's not going to generate much electricity at all. There are viable implementations for cogeneration of heat and electricity, in which natural gas powers a combined hot water heating system (which can provide premise heat and domestic hot water supply) and a generator.  The heat generated by a stove is just too low to make cogeneration from waste heat viable.    Embed Quote
