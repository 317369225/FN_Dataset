★Yoga: Is infrared yoga dangerous?There are studios in Bangkok offering yoga classes in rooms with infrared light. They say the benefits are faster fat burn and improved complexion but I want to know if it is 100% safe.
Safe or not safe, more the point is that this is such a sales gimmick and not even worth contemplating. Sounds like the marketing of someone like Srinivas Kamal. Find a school that is not so gimmicky that can pass to you the real meaning of yoga.    Embed Quote
