★What tools are needed for digital infrared photography?
The 'tools' that you need for YOUR own IR photographs would depend according to the option you exercise: 1.  Permanent conversion of your DSLR camera [As already explained,  reverting back to get colorful images (once again) will be impossible] -  In which case you'll only need your camera and tripod; or 2.  If you're an amateur/beginner/novice; and/or would not like to convert  your camera permanently, I'd recommend you to do what I've been doing -  Buy a good quality IR filter [I have Hoya 720nm (there's another 900nm  variant, but 720 is good enough for 'normal' IR photos]. In this case,  you'll be requiring a good photo editing software (personally would  recommend Photoshop), alongwith your camera, tripod; and filter. Since  the photo which you'll click will come out in pure RED in this case, the  image editing software shall be used to play with the image to give  that artistic and pleasant appeal of IR. Though  photos clicked in the second option consumes more time to develop than  the former (even if you know the 'technique'), I prefer it still owing  to financial economy; and also to keep the normal colourful photograph  option available to me. And lastly, ONE WORD OF CAUTION: SHOULD YOU DECIDE UPON THE SECOND OPTION, CLICK YOUR PHOTOS INVARIABLY IN RAW FORMAT! Hope this helps :) P.S.: This is one such pic which I edited after clicking through the IR filter. Though this is NOT strictly IR, yet such effects are available only in the second option; and it is good enough for beginners like me ;) EDIT: Oh! And a quick note: Try to capture the IR of any remote (which is in a working condition) before you buy the filter. Most probably your camera WILL capture it, but nothing wrong in making sure, right? ;D (And obviously, please capture it in a dark room.)    Embed Quote
