★Would a sheet of aluminum or sheet of stainless steel reflect more infrared radiation?I am making a solar oven.
I spent several years as a metal polisher and James is correct that aluminum is a "whiter color."  However, Stainless does not lose its luster as fast as aluminum does.  Aluminum also dissipates heat much faster as it is a higher conductor. The two forms of heat transfer involved are Conduction and Radiation. The ability to radiate heat is measured in emissivity. (1) The emissivity of non polished aluminum is around .09 (2) Stainless steel 304 is .6 The lower the value the more that heat will be reflected.   The conductivity of aluminum is about 145W/m-C Stainless steel is 16.26W/m-C.(3)   (1) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emi...
