★Is it possible to heat something with an infrared laser while simultaneously measuring its temperature, again using infrared?Let's say I wanted to heat my fingertip to 42 degrees celcius and keep it there.  All without touching it.  Is it possible to do this?   I have heard that infrared detectors can image temperature.  Could I pulse the laser to heat, then detect, then heat, then detect?
Yes, lasers have a specific wavelength, you just need to filter that out, and then you can still tell temperature by the distribution of other infered wavelengths an object emits.    Embed Quote
