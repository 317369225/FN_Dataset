★What are the ways to make a infrared line follower robot without a micro controller?
The simplest one can be made with just a motor driver like l298 or l293 and 2 pairs of ir diode - photodiode pair along with pot. Make a potential driver circuit by connecting the photodiode and pot and feed it to the to the IN1 and IN2 pins of the motor driver. After a bit of careful adjustments, we are good to go.    Embed Quote
