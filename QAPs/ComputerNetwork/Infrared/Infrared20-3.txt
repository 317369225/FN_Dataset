★How is an infrared signal generated in a remote controller of a TV?What kind of circuit does it use?
IrDA and ZigBee are mostly for data transmission. (although Zigbee which uses radio instead of infrared also has a remote control profile). Remote controls use very low data transmission rates for simplicity and because it's all that's needed for transmitting knob pushes. An infrared LED is hooked to a microcontroller just like an ordinary LED. The whole timing and modulation can easily be done in software. There are many protocols around that vary between manufacturers. Although there have been attempts to standards. You can easily sample a foreign remote controller and store the signal into rather few memory. (cheap universal remote controls that can be programmed) The infrared is amplitude-modulated at a frequency around 30-40 kHz to minimize noise from environmental IR sources. Each knob on the remote has it's own code that is transmitted in very slow bitrates continuously as long as the knob is pressed. See here for info about some protocols: IR Remote Control On the receiver side there is a phototransistor with an amplifier and filter circuit that filters out the moulation frequency of the IR and rectifies it. This is integrated into an integrated circuit like for example the very common SFH506 that can directly interface to a microcontroller input pin.    Embed Quote
