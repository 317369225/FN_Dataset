★Is it possible for you to convert the infrared energy from a stove to electric energy so it can be useful for home electrical purposes?
I'll take your question literally; assuming you are referring only to infrared radiation and not heat transfer due to convection and conduction; solar cells do, in fact, operate in the near-infrared band and could create tiny amounts of electricity from stove-top radiation. It would be an interesting experiment to see how much could be generated, but I doubt it would be a "useful" quantity, but you never know; give it a try, you might be onto something. But if you have a solar panel anyway, you'd be much better off charging a battery during the day than burning oil/wood during the night.  Spectral Response Given that you don't have any electricity and only a flammable fuel source, there are better ways to generate electricity, such as the aforementioned thermionic/Peltier/Seebeck devices and microturbines using steam, or any other heat-engine (there are many types, like Stirling engines).    Embed Quote
