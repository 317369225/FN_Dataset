★What allows animals to see in different light spectrums, like infrared?
Actually, infrared vision is pretty rare among animals. See Why haven't most animals (including humans) evolved infrared vision to see in the dark? Though there was an article a few months ago about a species of fish that does see infrared: http://www3.uni-bonn.de/Press-releases/infrared-vision-in-a-cichlid-fish They didn't elaborate on the mechanism. It's known that some snakes can use IR-sensitive pits near their noses. This isn't actually all that much different from what you do. You can feel a warm fire with your hands from the IR it gives off, and you can use that to tell which direction the fire is. Snakes just have a far more sensitive version of that. It may be that these fish have actual vision in the IR, in which case it's presumably the same as with visible light vision and ultraviolet vision in those species that have it: they have dyes in cells in their eyes which are excited when light of a certain frequency falls on it. When it gets excited, it stimulates the nerve, which carries the signal to the brain that something has given off a color. There's nothing special about visible light, beyond the fact that your eyes have dyes which respond in that range. Dyes for ultraviolet certainly exist, in a variety of species. There's no reason such a dye couldn't be made for IR, though as the answer above shows there's so much noise that IR vision is less useful.    Embed Quote
