★Where can I find infrared LED strips?A la http://www.environmentallights.c..., but I'm looking for a brick-and-mortar store (no time to order online).
Check out Gescan, they are the largest wholesale factory in Canada.  Strips retail there for $240 for a 5 metre roll.  We are a manufacturer in Canada, we have strips ranging from 7w-17w per metre, depending on your application.  If you want more information on our company go to Industrial, Hospitality, Commercial, Residential - JP LED Lighting  .  We have a standard 5 year warranty on our strips.    Embed Quote
