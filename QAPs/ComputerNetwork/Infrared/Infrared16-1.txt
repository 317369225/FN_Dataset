★How is audio transmitted using infrared light?
As a previous poster pointed out 2.6 and 2.8 MHz are not IR frequencies they are RF frequencies commonly used for short range (100 meters or less) data transmission.  While there are IR protocols for transmitting audio they are most common for headphones, not PA microphones.  I suspect the system you are interested in is RF not IR.  In any event the best you can likely do with any external transmitter is jam the signal not override it. With an FM modulated signal you can get a receiver to lock onto a more powerful signal in the same band and override the transmission.  You will hear this effect with distant FM radio stations as you drive around.   More powerful signals will replace weaker ones as the receiver locks onto the changing frequency of the strongest signal in the band.  With most other modulation schemes you simply degrade the original signal by broadcasting on the same band and little or no data gets through.  Listen to an AM radio at night and try to tune far off stations then turn on some fluorescent lights or us a dimmer nearby.  Modern digital data transmissions on the 2.6 or 2.8 GHz bands can be intefered with (not legally) but it is not generally possible to override them with a cell phone or any other transmitter.  So the best you can hope for is silencing the PA system by transmitting noise or a competing signal in the appropriate band.  You likely won't be able to make bogus announcements unless you modify the microphone used by the PA system.  A small FM receiver hooked to a speaker hidden inside the PA microphone could accomplish your goal especially if you rig a way to remotely activate the PTT (push to talk) switch or power switch.  Better still use a relay to switch the microphone out and the FM receiver in whenever the FM transmitter is on.  I'll leave details of construction and implementation as an exercise for the student.    Embed Quote
