★Would a sheet of aluminum or sheet of stainless steel reflect more infrared radiation?I am making a solar oven.
You'll have to be careful with the emissivity values. The values may not take into account that you're likely to have an oxide layer or dust or whatever that builds up on a surface that would change the emissivity. Your effective emissivity may be less or not what you expected. Also, infrared is less sensitive to surface roughness than is visible light, because it is a longer wavelength. That is, the surface might be not perfect in visible light, but be pretty good in effectively concentrating infrared. We did this experiment once in my Heat Transfer class where we used a plate of cold-rolled steel as a "mirror" for an infrared camera. The image was the same with the plate of steel when compared to a regular optical mirror.    Embed Quote
