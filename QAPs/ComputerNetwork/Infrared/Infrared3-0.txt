★Do mirrors reflect ultraviolet and infrared light too?
There are different types of mirrors. Your bathroom mirror is probably aluminum covered by glass.  Aluminum has good reflectivity fairly deep into the infrared part of spectrum.  It is reflective but increasingly lossy at UV wavelengths.  The glass coating will truncate the reflectivity more severely, as it is only transparent between ~300-4000nm (visible wavelengths are roughly 400-700 nm). In lab setups, the most basic (and most versatile) mirrors are polished metal mirrors.  These are like your bathroom mirror but without a glass coating and (usually) with a smoother surface.  These mirrors can be made out of aluminum, gold, silver, and sometimes copper.  Other than aluminum, these have better reflection at IR than UV wavelengths. image source: Page on www.layertec.de A more complicated type of lab mirror is a Dielectric mirror, which is engineered to reflect a specific wavelength or a specific band by controlling the refractive indices of different layers in an optical stack.  These can reflect UV and IR light if they are designed to do so.  Off-the-shelf options are available roughly between 300-2000 nm, but custom coatings can extend this range. image source: Page on thorlabs.com
