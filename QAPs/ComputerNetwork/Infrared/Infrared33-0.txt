★Will infrared heat speed recovery of injuries?Are infrared saunas, infrared heating pads, etc junk science or has their use been proven to show an increase in how fast people recover from injury?
To a degree, in a substantial number of cases.  Healing depends substantially on the flow of blood which carries oxygen and nutrients to the site of the injury; and heat increases blood flow.  So for near surface injuries, infrared heat will promote somewhat faster healing.    Embed Quote
