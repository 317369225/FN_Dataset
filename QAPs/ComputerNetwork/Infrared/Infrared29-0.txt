★Is there an optoelectronic device whose output can sweep between optical visibile, near infrared and infrared?Does one exist? If they don't exist any tips on how would you fabricate one?
I don't know of any material or device that can selectively output a single wavelength based on varying inputs. However, you can selectively filter so conceivably you could have a wide spectrum source (or sources) which emit the entire required spectrum and combine it with a tunable filter. Something as simple as a prism which can rotate combined with a slot would fit this purpose. Obviously the narrower your selection the less intensity you will get so there is a practical limit to the precision    Embed Quote
