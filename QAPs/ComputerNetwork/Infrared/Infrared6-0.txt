★Optics: How are bones translucent to infrared light?It turns out that for an optical window of 650-1000 nm , bones are translucent to IR light. Hoping for some insightful explanation to this counter-intuitive optical property of bones. Thank you!
The short answer, the structure and composition of bone.  (Your thinking: yeah no duh, right now.) Your detailed answer: [1] Near infrared (NIR) can penetrate relatively deep into biological soft tissues. The NIR absorption property of tissue varies with tissue constituents especially water, fat, collagen, and their combination ratio. Therefore, combination ratio of tissue constituents can be evaluated by decomposing the absorption spectrum to determine the light path length in each constituent. Standardized absorption spectra of tissue constituents are required in order to carry out decomposition. Since water, fat, and protein are the major contributors at NIR spectral region. While this article is referencing SOFT TISSUES the key point to take away is water, fat, collagen, and combination ratios determine IR absorption and scattering. Bone is comprised of the following in the skull, which is where a lot of IR is utilized to monitor blood flow etc.. [2] The collagen content is 25%, water 12% and carbohydrate is 5%.  Hydroxyapetite is 58%.  However this is for compact skull component, and as noted later, tubercular bone has a very different composition and a very different absorption/scattering spectra. [2] The difference in bone compartment structure changes the absorption in the near IR as well, in particular,  the porosity comes into play and changes the scattering and absorption.  In addition, the tubercular bone has a different composition and a different lattice structure than the compact bone skills, this also changes the absorption spectra.  Further, the water/fluid component of the bone also change the absorption spectra. The dominant scatters are "large" collagen fibers and Apatite nanocrystals. To summarize the above paragraphs, water and lipids are the primary absorption peaks in the near IR with one at 978 and 1192.  The type, structure, and prevalence of the collagen fibers[3], the lipid content, and the water percentage and location, heavily modify the absorption/scattering properties of bone.  i.e. the structure and composition.
