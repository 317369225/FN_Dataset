★What could one use at night to see infrared lighting?I need to look for hidden cameras which are using infrared lighting.
How about an infrared camera of your own? Many consumer-level video cameras have a "nightshot" mode which makes them infrared sensitive, producing that greenish monotone image you have probably seen on TV. In this mode both normal lights and infrared flood lights appear as bright light sources. Compare with your normal eyes and anything that appears bright to the camara but is missing a normal light source must be an infrared source. Now this will not help you find low light cameras which use passive lighting (such as the video camera in your hands). Cameras that are just very sensitive and don't use extra lighting will still remain invisible.    Embed Quote
