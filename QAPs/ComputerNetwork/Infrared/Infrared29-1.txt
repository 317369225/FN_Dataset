★Is there an optoelectronic device whose output can sweep between optical visibile, near infrared and infrared?Does one exist? If they don't exist any tips on how would you fabricate one?
Strictly defined, there isn't an optoelectronic device that has that capability. There are Dye lasers that can be very broadly tuned, provided you have a good external feedback mechanism.  The tuning is done by adjusting the feedback so only the desired wavelength gets the desired oscillations, but I don't know how broadly they can be tuned as I haven't worked with them. Another option would be to use a set of discrete tunable lasers and switch between them.  Typically solid-state tunable lasers have a range within which they can be tuned by changing the temperature, and some amount of tuning can be achieved with an external cavity, but only a range of a few nanometers for a given laser.  Most of the tunable lasers you find will be tunable by switching lasers for large steps and making small adjustments with a temperature controller.    Embed Quote
