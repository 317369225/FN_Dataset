★Is infrared (IR) light bad for you?
Ultraviolet light is much more energetic than infrared, enough so that it actually tears some molecules apart, causing what we experience as sunburns and sometimes setting the stage for cancer. Infrared light simply warms us -- it is how energy from a fireplace reaches our bodies. Infrared warms but does not do cellular damage unless there is a great deal of it.    Embed Quote
