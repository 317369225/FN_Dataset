★How is audio transmitted using infrared light?
You can directly transmit the analog signal through the infrared light using Infrared LED. If you can convert sound in an electric signal then you can definitely transmit the sound signal using Infrared. See the following circuit I implemented this but using Infrared light as a transmission medium has drawback that it will operate when both the transmitter and Receiver are aligned properly. Transmitter:- here UM66 is melody IC followed by two amplifiers. Receiver :- Here phototransistor receives the signal and it will followed by two amplifiers.    Embed Quote
