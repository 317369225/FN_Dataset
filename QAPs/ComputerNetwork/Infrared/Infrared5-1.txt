★How does an infrared thermometer work?
An infrared thermometer is a laser thermometer which infers temperature from a portion of the thermal radiation sometimes called blackbody radiation emitted by the object being measured. They are sometimes called laser thermometers if a laser is used to help aim the thermometer, or non-contact thermometers or temperature guns,  to describe the device's ability to measure temperature from a  distance. By knowing the amount of infrared energy emitted by the object  and its emissivity,  the object's temperature can often be determined. Infrared thermometers  are a subset of devices known as "thermal radiation thermometers". Infrared thermometer    Embed Quote
