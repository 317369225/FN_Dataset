★Where can I find infrared LED strips?A la http://www.environmentallights.c..., but I'm looking for a brick-and-mortar store (no time to order online).
Sadly I do not think you will find decent quality at a decent price in local stores, online is the best resource, like digikey.com...and many others, but on a whim fry's might have some but more than likely they will be junk...    Embed Quote
