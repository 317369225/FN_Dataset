★For wireless mice, which is best: infrared, radio, or BlueTooth?I have a Logitech MX1000 with my Home Theater PC (HTPC) right now, and it periodically skips and loses overall accuracy.  I'm only sitting 5 to 10 feet away from the dongle.  The dongle is behind the computer, so it's a bit out of sight.  This has been driving me crazy over the last few days.  Suggestions?
I prefer Bluetooth. Not many experiences with mice, always have used Bluetooth mice, but a had a microsoft keyboard that connected via IR. It drove me crazy cause it always had to be line of sight. And this is especially annoying with an HTPC when all you want is to turn down the volume as you fall asleep    Embed Quote
