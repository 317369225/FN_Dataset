★Is infrared light or heat?If it's both, then is heat just another form of light? How is that possible, if heat is related to temperature?
Infrared is the form of energy that is emitted by a heated object. The energy emitted by something that is hot and cannot emit visible light, is called infrared. Therefore, we can say that Infrared is a form of energy that is obtained by heating. These are light waves that travel at a higher wavelength than the visible light. Hence, this light is invisible to the human eye. For more details about infrared Light you can go through this Link :http://axtontech.com/about-ir/    Embed Quote
