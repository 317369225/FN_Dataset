★Does infrared sauna really help me lose calories and/or fat?
Sauna does help you to eliminate toxins but wont help you burn fat or lose any calorie what you will lose is some water but it will come back after you drink a glass of water. If you want to burn calorie instead going in a hot room you could go swimming in an semi-olympic pool where the water is cold, that will make your heart pump a little more therefore you will burn fat to heat the body.    Embed Quote
