★Is infrared light or heat?If it's both, then is heat just another form of light? How is that possible, if heat is related to temperature?
Infrared light is emitted by hot bodies as they chill radiatively. Also, it heats up bodies as it hits them. But heat is mechanical, no relation to light in its nature.    Embed Quote
