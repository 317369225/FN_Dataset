★What would we see ultraviolet or infrared light as?if an object reflects only ultraviolet light and absorbs every other what  would it look like? what about of it only reflected infrared light? how would a normal person see those objects?
Your sensitivity for IR and UV don't just stop absolutely at some wavelength. Instead the sensitivity starts getting bad, but can be overridden at higher powers. You see IR as deep red at 808 mm and then white at farther frequencies all the way to at least 1064 nm. UV can be seen as white at least to 260 nm and looks increasingly white below 280. In both cases this is undoubtedly due to cone dropout with only sensitive rods left. UV dropout is mostly due to lens absorption by protein, and extends farther in people with lenses removed for cataract.    Embed Quote
