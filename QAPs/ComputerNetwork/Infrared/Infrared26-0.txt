★How inefficient are electric infrared parabolic dish heaters?More specifically, how much energy is emitted in the "cone" of IR vs. losses due to convection, conduction and IR radiation outside of the cone? (either or both halogen or traditional)
Most parabolic heaters run at about 80%-90% efficiency depending on the actual implementation. The good news is Electric heaters in general are highly efficient in converting electricity to heat (afterall 'heat' is a form of 'waste' energy and it is always easy to waste ;) ). The problem with heat is that it is always leaking out into the environment. Parabolic heaters work well if you want to focus heat generated on a specific area (ex: onto a person as opposed to the entire room). So, in the big picture, if you want very efficient room heating, you should think about proper insulation for your room and probably a different heater design. (especially if the room is large and the desired temperature difference between the 'environment' and the room is high).    Embed Quote
