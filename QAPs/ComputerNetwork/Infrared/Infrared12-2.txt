★Is infrared (IR) light bad for you?
It depends on how powerful it is. I have two infrared laser pointers and an infrared flashlight. The flashlight has an output of 5W, wavelength 940nm. It's harmless unless you stare directly into it for more than a few seconds. The 300mW 808nm laser pointer is dangerous enough that you can injure your eyes just looking at the dot for more than a few seconds. The reflection off of brushed metal, even at 5 meters, can cause measurable eye injury. It's safer than a visible light laser of the same power, but 300mW is a lot of power. You just can't see how powerful it is because the dot looks pretty faint. Then there's the 980nm laser pointer advertized as 5mW but tested at 81mW. You can see the light only if shined directly into the eye. Unfortunately 81mW can cause serious eye injury when you do that, even for one second.    Embed Quote
