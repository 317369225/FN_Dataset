★How does infrared radiation cook food?
The same way that almost all infrared radiation cooks (or heats) any sort of matter. That is, unless you are specifically referring to how human food is cooked. The small amount of intimate contact transmission (or microwave), heating can be dismissed because infrared still rules the day (as with most of the universe).    Embed Quote
