★How is audio transmitted using infrared light?
Almost all wireless microphone technologies are RF based. It is very very unlikely that they would be using IR. Think of the technical limitations to an IR based system (Line of Sight!!!). Additionally most commercially available wireless microphone systems are one of two persuasions - Analog - Most of these operate in around the 500-900Mz bands (This varies by state and country due to FCC or other governing body regulations on usable bands) Digital - This systems range from digital encoding systems broadcast over the same 500-900Mz bands (either encrypted or unencrypted depending on user settings) or in the traditional wireless frequencies of 2.4 Ghz (or there about) In many of the encrypted digital systems you would be unable to break in on the channel and in the unencrypted digital streams your interference most likely would not be an intelligible type of interference (I.E. not the same digital transport scheme - thus unintelligible by the receiver) and would merely show up as attenuation of the primary signal (potentially to the point of reducing intelligibility) In an analog system you could potentially get some usable audio over the primary transmission if you could over power it (read bump up your transmitter power - in many cases commercially available wireless microphones can broadcast at a strength of 100mw - which would be hard to beat with your phone)or create the multi path interference necessary to depower the primary signal in the local vicinity of the receiver. Another consideration is the fact that your phone doesn't have native wireless hardware to broadcast in that range - so it would be tough. You need to know a lot more about the hardware involved in order to even properly consider going about what you've proposed.    Embed Quote
