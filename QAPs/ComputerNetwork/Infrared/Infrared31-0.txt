★Can I get the benefits of an infrared sauna using infrared LEDs? Are regular red LEDs the same?
Sort of. What you should be looking at are pre built infrared heaters. LED would be to costly (high price pet LED, about $.5 a watt). Red would not be as efficient otherwise we would be using red instead of infrared. I don't know the actual reason.    Embed Quote
