★What would we see ultraviolet or infrared light as?if an object reflects only ultraviolet light and absorbs every other what  would it look like? what about of it only reflected infrared light? how would a normal person see those objects?
If it doesn't reflect visible light it will look black regardless of anything else it might reflect. Ultraviolet and infrared aren't visible and so the objects you ask about will look black.    Embed Quote
