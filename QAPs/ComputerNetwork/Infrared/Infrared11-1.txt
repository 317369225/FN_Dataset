★What is the relationship between infrared and heat?
Let us first see connection between radiation and Temperature. Temperature makes one Emit Radiation: Moving Charges emit radiation. Temperature loosely related to the vibration of  molecules of a system vibrate. More vigorous the vibration, higher is the temperature. Now since molecules are made up of electrons and protons which are charged, at any temperature a system emits radiation in the surrounding (except if you coat it with reflecting surface like a Thermos). Radiation Increases Temperature: If radiation of "correct" is absorbed by molecules of a system, they move with higher vigor leading to raise in temperature. Thus radiation is a means of Heat transfer between 2 systems. Although Thermal radiation happens over a range of frequencies of light, it follows Wien's displacement law where is the wavelength at which the intensity of thermal radiation is maximum. Now for most of temperatures we see around, the radiation peaks at wavelengths much higher than visible ones, or the infra-red ones.    Embed Quote
