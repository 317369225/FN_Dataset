★What are the ways to make a infrared line follower robot without a micro controller?
A few years ago I came across what I believe is the simplest possible light-following or light-fleeing circuit for a skid-steer or two-wheel robot: It's based around an LM386 op-amp and a pair of photo-diodes acting as photovoltaic cells. The motors will never turn off, so the robot will always be moving forwards. The voltage ratio between the motors is controlled based on the voltages generated by the photodiodes. To make it line-follow you may need to add some external illumination, but I found that by keeping D1 and D2 close to the surface and pointing slightly forward in a well-lit room then it could line-follow without any trouble.  If you want to follow a white line on a black background, you may need to swap D1 to the right and D2 to the left. I build a few of these things of various sizes, and usually mounted the photodiodes on solid-core wire so they looked like antennae. That let me bend their position around to do what I wanted with the circuit. I would love to acknowledge the source of this schematic, but I can't remember it at the moment. If anyone can give a primary source for this design, that would be much appreciated.    Embed Quote
