★Are there any infrared receivers for the Nikon D3100?Looking for just an IR receiver I can hook up to my Nikon D3100 (does not have integrated receiver). I would like the receiver to read the same IR codes as Nikon official remotes transmit so that it can be compatible with my existing gear.
Well if you are just looking to click a picture, you can go ahead and try using a radio triggers for this purpose. They hook up with your camera using cable release and can can trigger the shutter. Moreover they dont need to be directional :) One example is : YougNuo RF603. Costs a max $30.    Embed Quote
