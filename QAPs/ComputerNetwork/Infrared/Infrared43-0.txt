★Can amethyst crystals emit or increase far-infrared light?
No. They cannot. Like everything that's warm, they emit far-IR light. This can be seen with a thermal imaging system. However, they cannot increase or amplify light - this would not conserve energy. As an example, put two amethyst crystals next to each other. Do they constantly reinforce each others' "Rays" and explode? Referring to the website you linked, I quote directly from the front page. This made my brain hurt, so I'm going to break it down - interstitial comments in bold type. The Richway I'm sure it made them rich Amethyst Why is this capitalized? Bio-Mat Not really a mat, do not wipe feet, with grammatical non-sequitur over one and a half million sold to satisfied customers worldwide show me the evidence, you more grammar argh! can enjoy the soothing of course 3-part synergy what is 3-part synergy? of quantum energetics what is quantum energetics? from deep penetrating heat of Far Infrared Rays Far IR light is not deep penetrating, Negative Ion Why is this capitalized? therapy How are negative ions therapeutic? for cellular activation cellular activation sounds like cancer and renewal buzzword!, and the healing properties of Amethyst Didn't realize amethyst, which is chemically identical to sand and most of the rocks in the earth, has healing properties. In summary, anything that has the words quantum in it is 100% bullshit, unless it's in a scientific journal specifically to do with quantum physics. These papers generally contain equations that look like: No equations, no cigar.    Embed Quote
