★How is an infrared signal generated in a remote controller of a TV?What kind of circuit does it use?
In my opinion, the LED at the front of the remote emits IR. For it to emit radiation in the IR band, there is a certain threshold voltage or current that must be fed into the LED and that is generated by the circuit of the remote. I am not 100% sure :)    Embed Quote
