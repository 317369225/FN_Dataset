★What tools are needed for digital infrared photography?
You need to make a permanent modification to the camera body in order to shoot in infrared. Existing CCD sensors are already sensitive to this wavelength of light. Cameras have a filter built-in over the sensor to cut on this distracting light so you get the expected visible light photos. This filter is replaced with one that will allow IR light through and cut the visible light. Additionally, the focal length when switching over to IR (much more so for UV) is slightly different, so to get properly focused pictures another minor modification is made. These two modifications together make this a permanent change for the camera body. It would be possible to go with a "clear" internal filter and then use external filters to switch between IR and visible (and UV, technically), but you will be tethered to always using an external filter, which gets pricey if you have a lot of different lenses you want to use. And there is still the focusing issue, which the modifying shop can help you deal with.
