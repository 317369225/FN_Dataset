★What would we see ultraviolet or infrared light as?if an object reflects only ultraviolet light and absorbs every other what  would it look like? what about of it only reflected infrared light? how would a normal person see those objects?
I think it would depend what your brain told you it looked like. Consider the old philosophical question: "Do you experience the colour green the same as I do?" Well, the same would work with UV or IR, although I would think the former would seem to be at the blue end and the latter at the red end. You can already distinguish between uncountable shades of colour, so a few more would be no problem. How to imagine a shade of colour you have never seen before is another deep question.    Embed Quote
