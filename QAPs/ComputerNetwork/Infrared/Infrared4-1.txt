★Yoga: Is infrared yoga dangerous?There are studios in Bangkok offering yoga classes in rooms with infrared light. They say the benefits are faster fat burn and improved complexion but I want to know if it is 100% safe.
I doubt they are dangerous as far as infrared saunas are quite popular and beneficial without any ill effects that I have heard of. I personally have spent much time in an infrared sauna and enjoyed the benefits. As with all yoga, you must be aware of how you are and take rest when needed, particularly in a heated room. The heat, while doing physical activity, can get suffocating quickly. With heated yoga, it is best to go on an empty stomach (as I can attest that eating prior to hot yoga can cause vomiting.)    Embed Quote
