★What would we see ultraviolet or infrared light as?if an object reflects only ultraviolet light and absorbs every other what  would it look like? what about of it only reflected infrared light? how would a normal person see those objects?
A team at Wash U School of Medicine actually figured out a way for humans to be able to see infrared light. The human eye can see ‘invisible’ infrared light (albeit, not technically sensed as infrared light) tl;dr - Light is sensed by receptors on retina (@ the back of eyes). Different receptors are activated by photons of different wavelengths (inversely proportional to Energy). Single photon of infrared light does not have enough energy to activate the receptors. BUT sending pulses of infrared light fast enough, 2 photos can hit receptor and combined energies will activate it. Total energy of 2 infrared photons = energy of a single hit of a 500-nanometer photon. 500nm = green light on the spectrum. Thus, we will sense the double pulses of infrared as green light.    Embed Quote
