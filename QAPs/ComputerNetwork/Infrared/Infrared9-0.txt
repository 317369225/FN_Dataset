★What is "far infrared"?
The electromagnetic spectrum is very large, and light takes up only a small piece of it. The "next-door neighbors" of visible light are infrared and ultraviolet. Or, to be more specific, in order by most energetic to least energetic: Far ultraviolet Ultraviolet Near ultraviolet Violet Other visible light colors Red Near infrared Infrared Far infrared The labels are a bit arbitrary, in that the frequency ranges associated with the non-visible terms are not always agreed upon. But of this group, far infrared carries the least amount of energy, and it is emitted by colder objects.    Embed Quote
