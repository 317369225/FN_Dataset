★Vision (eyesight): How safe is infrared laser?
I guess its pretty dangerous depending upon the power output and if we dont know what we are doing. I hv a couple of them lying around from cd burners. The main problem is the fact that its invisible so its pretty easy to get our eyes in the path and by the time we realise something is wrong, the damage will be done. So if you happen to play with them , always remember to mount it firmly on a stand.    Embed Quote
