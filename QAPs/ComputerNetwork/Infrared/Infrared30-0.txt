★Why are astrophotographs in the infrared and X-ray portions of the spectrum blurry?
I think the reason it's blurry is because you're not seeing it with the full light spectrum, which all objects are colored, so the colors that you are not seeing are blurred out and averything around the object blurres wih it because you're also seeing those in that certain light.    Embed Quote
