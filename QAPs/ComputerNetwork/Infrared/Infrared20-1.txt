★How is an infrared signal generated in a remote controller of a TV?What kind of circuit does it use?
The IR circuit used in a TV remote controller is based on the IRDA standard. TV remotes are typically little more than a micro controller and the IR LED. Most TVs use IRDA's 4MB/s NRZ encoding standard. The vast majority of micro controllers used are (motorola) 6805 microcontrollers (at least the after market controllers). The value added in the microcontroller is the huge database of TV codes programmed into the PROM of the microcontroller. Although motorola (now Freescale) have long ago dropped the 6805 microcontroller as a product, there is still an aftermarket addressed by third parties. Newer TVs are using RF4CE, which is a version of ZigBee. It is specifically set up for controlling consumer equipment.    Embed Quote
