★What is the relationship between infrared and heat?
The first relationship you ought to know is Black body radiation. Any object at non-zero temperature will emit black body radiation.  The peak wavelength of that radiation and the intensity of that radiation will depend on its temperature. At normal living temperatures, the peak of this radiation occurs in the infrared region.  Things that are hot emit both more intense and more energetic (shorter wavelength) infrared radiation.  When things get very hot, they start glowing red -- but they are still emitting plenty of infrared.  Hotter, they get more orange and yellow, then blue-ish. But why do we feel hot when exposed to infrared radiation as opposed to other wavelengths? This has to do with absorption.  In the visible range, a lot of energy is scattered rather than absorbed.  But infrared is absorbed quite strongly by many organic molecules because they have molecular resonances that correspond to those energies. Microwave radiation happen to correspond very nicely to rotational modes of water molecules (or rather, microwaves were designed to emit a frequency that corresponds to water molecule rotation), so the water molecules strongly absorb the radiation and heats up.  Many organic molecules absorb strongly in the infrared, so infrared radiation will be absorbed and cause the object to heat up.    Embed Quote
