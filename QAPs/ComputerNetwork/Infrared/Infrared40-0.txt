★What is the best way to meter for 35mm infrared film?I have an ancient roll of Kodak HIE 135 (36 exposures, expired in 1996) that I want to shoot, and although the roll might be completely pooched, I'd like to try getting at least somewhat reasonable exposures out of it.
The film speed setting for your meter depends on which filter you use for exposing the film, which filter you use for metering, which meter you use and how you develop the film. Exposing and metering through a Wratten 87 equivalent filter, with the meter in a Leica M6 and developing in Diafine, I use EI 800 as the meter setting. Others use a Wratten 25 equivalent and set the meter to EI 400. If metering without a filter (but exposing with one) you can try EI 50. The Wratten 25 is popular with SLR users because you can see though it. Remember focus shift (although focusing through a 25 helps), and be prepared for a significant loss of IR sensitivity in that old film. Develop it as soon as possible after exposure.    Embed Quote
