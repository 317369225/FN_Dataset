★For wireless mice, which is best: infrared, radio, or BlueTooth?I have a Logitech MX1000 with my Home Theater PC (HTPC) right now, and it periodically skips and loses overall accuracy.  I'm only sitting 5 to 10 feet away from the dongle.  The dongle is behind the computer, so it's a bit out of sight.  This has been driving me crazy over the last few days.  Suggestions?
IR requires line of sight (think your TV remote control) so it is not a viable option. Note when mice are advertised with infrared, they usually mean the technology used to detect mouse motion. Bluetooth on the other hand is the connectivity technology. It is the what is used to connect (i.e cable replacement) the mouse to the keyboard. In addition to Bluetooth proprietary 2.4Ghz based radio technologies are also used. Given that BT & other 2.4 Ghz operate in the same band interference is similar. However using BT would be better, because it has better co-existence since other BT devices follow the same protocol.    Embed Quote
