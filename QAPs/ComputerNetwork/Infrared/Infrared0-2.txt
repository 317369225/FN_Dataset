★What would we see ultraviolet or infrared light as?if an object reflects only ultraviolet light and absorbs every other what  would it look like? what about of it only reflected infrared light? how would a normal person see those objects?
Most people have 3 kinds of cone cells....red sensitive, blue sensitive, and green sensitive.  Therefore our color perception is basically 3 dimensional, as shown in this "color solid": If someone can see into ultraviolet or infrared, whether or not they see "more colors" than the rest of us really has to do with whether or not they have more kinds of cone cells (that are differentiated by the brain) or not.  If they don't, but there three types are simply sensitive to a wider range of frequencies....they'd see the same colors we see -- presumably -- but they would just see different things illuminated.  So you could perceive what they perceive by looking at a photograph taken with a camera that is itself sensitive to infrared and ultraviolet....and which maps the colors to colors we can see.  So...no big mystery. On the other hand, if they actually had 4 types of cone cells, each of which is sensitive to a different frequency range, and that the brain could differentiate.....well they could probably never really describe to you what it looked like.  Just like you could never explain to a red-green colorblind person how green is different than red. This would be the case whether or not their vision extended into infrared and ultraviolet, or whether it was contained within the range visible to the rest of us.    Embed Quote
