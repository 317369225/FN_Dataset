★Is it possible to turn Deep Space Radiation (infrared light, gamma and X-rays) into electricity?
Not on any worthy amount. But the solar wind can readily be tapped for electricity. So there would be no motivation to go after deep space radiation for the purpose. In a sense the solar wind IS electricity. Electricity is moving electrons or ions. A proton could be described as an hydrogen ion.    Embed Quote
