★What could one use at night to see infrared lighting?I need to look for hidden cameras which are using infrared lighting.
You may want to take a monochrome (Black/White) camera and point it around your area where you want to find these cameras.  Black/White cameras can see infrared light. If the IR lights are on the cameras you should be able to see any IR light they are emitting.    Embed Quote
