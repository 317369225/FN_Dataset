★Vision (eyesight): How safe is infrared laser?
It's as safe as a visible laser in terms of how much power it puts out, but it's a lot more dangerous because you can't see where the laser spot is.  The actual danger is in energy delivered to the eye, and it will be noted by the "class" of laser. Class I:  No danger.  Point the thing at your eye and there's no way it will damage it, but it will be uncomfortable if you hold your eye open. Class II:  It won't damage your eye under normal conditions.  Your blink reflex is too fast for it to deliver enough power to your eye to damage it, even under magnification.  However, if you have your eye held open to inhibit your blink reflex, it will do damage. Class IIIa:  Your blink reflex is fast enough that it won't damage your eye without magnification or having your eye held open, but with magnification your blink reflex isn't fast enough to prevent damage. Class IIIb:  Your blink reflex isn't fast enough to prevent eye damage.  This one can shoot your eye out.  But reflections will be low enough in energy that they won't shoot your eye out. Class IV:  It's powerful enough that the scattered reflection of it can shoot your eye out.  The reflection is equivalent to a class IIIb. I knew someone who had his eye shot out while he was working with a Class IV Nd:YAG pulsed laser.  Because it's an infrared laser, he couldn't see the beam to verify that it was on, so he thought it was off.  He put his hand in the setup to move something, and the beam reflected off his ring and hit his eye. It makes a "pop" sound as the rapid heating of a spot on the retina creates an air bubble.  When you do something like that, you don't get to use that eye ever again.    Embed Quote
