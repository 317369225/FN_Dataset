★Is it possible to turn Deep Space Radiation (infrared light, gamma and X-rays) into electricity?
The amount of electricity is so small as to be not worth the technological efforts.  You would have to be out in space anyway, as a vast amount of the deep space radiation (especially the higher energy gamma and x rays) are blocked by our atmosphere.  So to get any type of usable flux of radiation, you would probably need to be in space away from the atmosphere and the Van Allen belts.  The radiation flux is a concern for an astronauts who go to Mars, but that is more due to the long amount of time they would be exposed, rather than a higher level of radiation to begin with. The actual level they would be exposed to at any given moment is quite low, but long term exposure can be detrimental to your health. One thing is for sure, if you could turn the deep space radiation into electricity, they would be figuring out how to use it on the Mars mission.  The fact that NASA is not even investigating this points to the technological limitations that make it useless to try to generate electricity this way.    Embed Quote
