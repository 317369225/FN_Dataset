★What are the ways to make a infrared line follower robot without a micro controller?
1) LOGIC GATES + MOTOR DRIVER IC 2) COMPARATOR IC + MOTOR DRIVER IC A line follower can be made using any of the two combinations mentioned above. No micro-controller is needed for implementing these methods. I would suggest to go for the second option as its easy to implement and if you decide to use microcontrollers in future, more or less you will be using the same principles. The only difference would be that the processing of the input signals from the sensors will be done MCU. For the second method, you can use analog IR sensor for line sensing, LM324 IC as comparator, LM7805 IC for 5V power supply and L293D IC for driving the motors of your bot. Connect the sensor's output to the LM324 and select suitable referance voltage. If the input is more/less (depends on your logic) than the threshold voltage selected by you, then drive the motors accordingly using L293D IC. :)    Embed Quote
