★Would a sheet of aluminum or sheet of stainless steel reflect more infrared radiation?I am making a solar oven.
First of all, to have good reflectivity in the IR part of the spectrum, you need to have very flat surfaces, so you will need a polished surface. Stated that, Aluminium has far better reflection than steel. When not oxidixed. You can have reflectivities of up to 97%, with 92-95% easily attainable, while with steel a reflectivity of 90% is a very good value. Unfortunately, the reflectivity of oxidixed aluminium can be as bas as 70% and unprotected aluminium oxides much faster than stainless steel. The ideal solution is a properly treated aluminium foil (or a plastic foil with deposited aluminium). The only place in which I'd use steel is for a second of a two stages concentrator, in which temperatures could rise so high that you need a metal alloy without any plastic (either substrate or varnish). For that applicaiton, I'd go for stainless steel sheets.    Embed Quote
