★How would you convert Longitude/Latitude to a physical address?This is a follow-up question to Where or how does a company, like foursquare, get a directory of all locations and their addresses?.
The easy answer: Use a reverse geocoding service from someone like Google or Yahoo. The long answer, if you want to roll your own service: The US Census publishes a corpus of data known as Tiger Data annually.  Tiger data contains an enormous amount of geospatial data ranging from borders of municipalities to school district zones to road segment data.  This is gathered from a variety of methods, namely the thousands of Census employees conducting surveys.  Google recently switched from using 3rd party mapping providers like Navteq (which are expensive) to entirely a combination of Tiger Data and StreetView. Using the Tiger Data shapefiles you would want to build an index that maps a latitude and longitude to nearby streets.  Depending on your infrastructure you would most likely want to use some sort of either quad tree or R-tree or potentially abstract this lookup into MySQL with geo-extensions or PostGIS. Due to federal law it is illegal for the federal government to publish coordinates of specific private addresses and thus the highest precision data you will find from these data sets is a straight street segment and the range of addresses that span each side of the street.  So you will end up finding the closest street segment and looking at how far along the point is along said street segment and interpolating the address given the address range associated with the corresponding side of the street. Note that other levels of government (i.e. municipal) may be able to legally provide more precise data such as parcel maps, etc. The shapefiles can be downloaded at http://www.census.gov/geo/www/ti...    Embed Quote
