★I've registered a C Corp in Delaware (IT company). I need to fill in the Statement and Designation by Foreign Corporation to register in California (my physical address is Cali). I already have a Delaware agent, but do I need one from Cali?
Yes.  Your agent for service of process needs to be a California resident or a corporate agent registered in California.    Embed Quote
