★Is there a service that allows you send a letter through email to a physical address?This service would be like the many of "mail-a-letter" services but this one would allow you to send an actual document or letter by actually scanning it. It would then probably have to be printed, stamped and then posted to the recipients address. Is there any services out there that fulfils this?(Or do I need to make one!)
Well. The new Cards app by Apple effectively does that, though you don't need an email address. Awesome quality cards, too.    Embed Quote
