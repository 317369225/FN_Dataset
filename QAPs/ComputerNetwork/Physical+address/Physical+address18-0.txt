★Can I register a .cn domain name without having a physical address in China?The Chinese authority has changed the rules several times. Is it currently possibe to register (and renew registered) .cn names without an address in China?
Yes. At least the renewal part. I have a .cn domain and am grandfathered. I had to provide my real name and some other identifying info last year. I believe there are some loopholes for a foreigner to register a .cn domain today, but I haven't tested them.    Embed Quote
