★If I check my MAC address in cmd I can see two physical addresses, but manually I found only one MAC address. What is the meaning of second MAC address?
Firstly, YES! you will get only ONE connection to be shown in the settings as you have only ONE adapter! Using that one adapter I can connect to the Internet say at my place and my parents house, and even more! What you see in the Command Prompt, those Local Area Connection [13 and 14] => these denote the different networks you've configured using Ethernet connection "On your system" Edit: What you are seeing in the Cmd "Media Disconnected" is not a connection at all. It shows Tunnel Adapter! Do you have any virtualization wares installed ? Like VMWare or Virtualbox coz to interface with virtual machine the system needs drivers to communicate. Simply try this in Cmd ifconfig OR ifconfig /all    Embed Quote
