★How can I open a business bank account for my US startup if we don't have a physical address in the US?We are based outside the US and we are not residents of the US.
Paul's answer is partially correct so lets clarify.  To have a bank account for your company, you need to have a legal entity that is not you (unless you want to run a sole proprietorship) Every state has different regulations for creating a legal entity Most state's require that you be "doing business" in that state, which means either (1) having an employee, or (2) having an office.  Many companies that form in Delaware must use a "Service Agent" to register their entity, where the agent provides your local address.  This address is just a way for the State to find you if you do not pay your entity's taxes. Regus and Plug & Play help with "having an office" by providing you an address. * Know that a "paid employee" is different than a contractor or freelancer.    Embed Quote
