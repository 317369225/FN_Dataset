★Is there a service that allows you send a letter through email to a physical address?This service would be like the many of "mail-a-letter" services but this one would allow you to send an actual document or letter by actually scanning it. It would then probably have to be printed, stamped and then posted to the recipients address. Is there any services out there that fulfils this?(Or do I need to make one!)
For the UK, there's also CFH: http://www.cfhdocmail.com/index.....  Here you format your document, usually in Word and upload it, add the address and they send it for you.  Its normally cheaper than a stamp itself, let alone the paper, envelope and labour.  Good for direct mail campaigns.    Embed Quote
