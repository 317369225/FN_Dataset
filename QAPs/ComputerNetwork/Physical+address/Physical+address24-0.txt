★What is the least expensive way to provide a physical address on domain name registrations?
When did/does ICANN prohibit the use of PO boxes? Never had a problem with that, sounds like something that could be the issue with a particular registrar rather than ICANN. However there are new requirements coming down the pipe where registrars have to verify the phone number or email address used for a domain and later own the addresses as well - the level of verification isn't still quite clear yet, but this is where ICANN bowed to pressure from the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC).    Embed Quote
