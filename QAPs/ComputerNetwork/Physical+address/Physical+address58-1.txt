★What is the difference between physical memory and address space?
Address space in multiprocessing operating systems is actually virtual in nature. i.e. A page in address space can be in one of the following states: 1> Not paged in (applicable for text pages) 2> Has a valid physical page 3> On swap 4> Belongs to device memory Each page in address space that has physical address allocated has a presence in page table and can also be in TLBs. Processor MMU takes care of maintaining the map. When an instruction is issued on the processor, MMU converts the virtual address into physical address before sending it down on system bus. Depending on the preconfigured (usually by boot loader) address ranges, one of memory controller or device controller (of various types like USB controller, PCI root hub etc.) respond to the address.    Embed Quote
