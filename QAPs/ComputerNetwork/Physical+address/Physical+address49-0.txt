★I've registered a C Corp in Delaware (IT company). I need to fill in the Statement and Designation by Foreign Corporation to register in California (my physical address is Cali). I already have a Delaware agent, but do I need one from Cali?
As Bennett Yankowitz noted, you need to identify an agent for service of process. It is similar to, but not quite the same as, a registered agent - e.g., the agent for service of process does not need to commit to availability or promise to do anything. The agent for service of process is identified in field 3 of the Statement and Designation form.    Embed Quote
