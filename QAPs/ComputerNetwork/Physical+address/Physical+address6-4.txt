★Has the time come when physical addresses on business cards are obsolete?
I don't know. There is a lot that a business address can say about you. If you don't have one at all, people might just assume that your business is on the rocks and you don't have the budget for an office. People like the security of a address even when they never plan to visit. Simeon YourCityOffice.com    Embed Quote
