★Is there any negative consequences for excluding a physical address on a resume?
Depends on where you are based, the current job market in that area for your skills and the local culture/ego of the recruiters and hiring managers. Generally speaking, leaving out your exact street address will not diminish your job prospects. Recruiters and hiring managers want some assurance that you are locally based and that you will show up regularly and reliably for the job, if hired. In the old days, phone number used to provide some indication; These days (2014), this is no longer true. On the other hand, candidates don't want to have their home address widely advertised and attract some undesirable and unrelated attention (such as stalkers, nosy recruiters or other mischief makers). When I am giving guidance to new grads in preparing their resume'/CV, I suggest including general area as part of the summarized address: For example: "San Jose, CA" or "Silicon Valley/ San Jose Region".   If your resume' is targeting a specific job (your resume' should be customized for each individual job) that is outside of the commute distance, please indicate in your cover letter and/or highlight with the recruiter when speaking that you will make arrangements to find a place near your job location.
