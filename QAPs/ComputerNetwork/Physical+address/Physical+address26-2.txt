★My teacher said that an 8086 Intel microprocessor has a 16-bit address and a 20-bit physical address. What is the difference between an address and a physical address?
It means that in 8086, the addresses used in programs (the logical or virtual address as you call it) are 16 bits but the actual address that 8086 sends to the RAM is 20 bits. Why? Because 16 bits = 64 KB of address space where as 20 bits of address = 1 MB of memory. Thus you can address more memory than what is possible with a plain 16 bit addressing (16 times more memory in this case). How? Recall the real mode segmented addressing scheme. In 8086 , address sent to RAM  = segment register * 16 + offset (replace segment register and offset with cs:ip, ds:si , es:di etc) Thus, though the segment registers and offsets are 16 bits, we could have a physical address that is 20 bits long. (If you notice, multiplying by 16 is same as shifting left by 4. A 16 bit address left shifted by 4 becomes a 20 bit address (offset not added yet))    Embed Quote
