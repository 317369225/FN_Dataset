★Is there a way to see a process physical memory address in Linux?
Do you mean the memory map (aka which module is loaded at which address?) You can read process map from following files: /proc/<pid>/maps /proc/<pid>/smaps /proc/<pid>/numa_maps For reading page offsets /proc/<pid>/pagemap (Page on kernel.org) In case you want to read process memory, you should use ptrace with /proc/<pid>/mem.. EDIT All these steps will give only virtual address. To convert them into physical address, have a look at How to translate virtual to physical addresses through /proc/pid/pagemap    Embed Quote
