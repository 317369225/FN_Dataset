★Should I provide my physical address when selling digital goods online?I'm selling digital goods online mostly with PayPal and recently a purchaser has requested me to provide my physical address. He claims that he needs it for taxes or something. Should I give him my address? It's going to be my home address. I'm wondering if it's safe or not.
There are many legitimate reasons for a customer to request your address and it certainly helps to have a physical address in establishing trust regardless of the request. But "best practices" don't really apply when they bump into your personal privacy; giving out your home address is probably not a good idea. Instead consider getting a PO box or a PO box from a facility that sells "regular" addresses masked as suites / units. For the few dollars you'll spend a month you gain professionalism, safety and a place to dump all all the marketing mailings from services you sign up for.    Embed Quote
