★".re" domain requires a physical address in Reunion Island. How do you satisfy that requirement?Does slidesha.re have a physical address there? This is a follow-up question to How do you register a vanity TLD domain like .re in http://slidesha.re?.
Hi the rules have changed now, and you can register if you're an EU citizen. I've just registered manifesto.re and I'm in the UK. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
