★".re" domain requires a physical address in Reunion Island. How do you satisfy that requirement?Does slidesha.re have a physical address there? This is a follow-up question to How do you register a vanity TLD domain like .re in http://slidesha.re?.
A lot of the registrars who handle .re domains offer trustee services so that anyone around the world can own and operate .re domains. The service usually costs $25-$35. Since 2011 there is no requirement to be based in Reunion, and the EU address requirement can also be managed through trustees or by using any valid EU address upon registration.    Embed Quote
