★What is the best API for geocoding a physical address?I'm developing an app that requires a user to tag a location. The user simply type the address of a location and adds that location along with lat/long cordinates. What is the best API for geocoding a physical address? It has to be a scalable solution and have good coverage and also give addresses suggestions.
Hello, in my humble opinion and based on our experiences so far with MNVR(MNVR connects people around places to help each other by providing insightful answers to questions that matter to them) Google Places in the best answer to your question, here's why: 1. Scale-able 2. Excellent Coverage (especially if you are looking to expand to non US geographies) 3. It has an excellent autocomplete api that provides pretty good address suggestions.
