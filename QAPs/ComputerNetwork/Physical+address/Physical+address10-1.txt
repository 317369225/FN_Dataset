★What is the physical address for Amazon's HQ in Seattle?I'm trying to deliver a surprise package to a friend for his birthday!
How nice of you! There are many buildings at Amazon's HQ, so it's hard to answer without knowing specifically where your friend works. You could start off here: http://g.co/maps/ynqjm (The Amazon buildings are on the West side of the street) Enter any of the buildings on that block, go straight to the security desk, and explain your situation. Keep in mind that Amazon is a pretty high security zone, so be polite and discreet.    Embed Quote
