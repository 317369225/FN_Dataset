★How do purely online companies get listings in Google Places, Yext, or any of those systems which help so much with link ranking? The difficulty being that online companies wouldn't necessarily have a physical address
from my experience at Touch Local and Qype I can advise that adding virtual businesses with fake addresses is very bad - it's clearly misleading and spam. It's better for the advertiser and the consumer to interact with the correct ad formats to support non locational businesses.    Embed Quote
