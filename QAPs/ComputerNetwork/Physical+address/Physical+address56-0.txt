★Can I make a UPS rental box my physical business address?I have this startup thats in need of an address now, I don't want to use my home address because of privacy.
I have used a UPS box for my business for about 8 years. One of the best decisions I ever made.  (ok, maybe that's a bit generous, but it was a good decision) Cheap. Convenient. Etc. That said, for some purposes, it is not allowed and you are supposed to provide a physical address.  For example, incorporating in MA you are not supposed to use a US Post Office Box or a UPS box.  I did it anyway and nobody complained (I no longer have that company so don't come after me...). Banks and brokerage firms require a physical address and my brokerage firm actually cross references addresses against UPS store locations so they asked for a physical address. So for those that require a physical address (and knew that my UPS box wasn't one)I made sure I was clear that mail should never go to the physical address and I gave them the UPS store as the mailing address.    Embed Quote
