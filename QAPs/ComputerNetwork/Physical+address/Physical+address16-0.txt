★Why doesn't Facebook ask for my physical address?Why doesn't Facebook prompt users for a physical or mailing address?  Nextdoor dot com is the largest community based social network I've found, but I don't understand why Facebook doesn't bake that into their platform, or why someone doesn't build a Facebook app for that.
Facebook doesn't ask you for a physical address, because they have other ways of finding out where you hang out most. In the about section, they ask for your current city. It doesn't matter if you fill it in, or leave it blank; they find out after they exhaust this laundry list. If you haven't turned it off, it automagically (geolocates) checks you into a city/neighborhood. If you have turned it off, your friends check you into places as well. If you've turned that off, it still knows where you are now, so much so, that if you travel, it shows neighborhood specific ads.    Embed Quote
