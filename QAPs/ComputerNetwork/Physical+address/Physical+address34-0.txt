★Are there any services available to verify physical addresses by sending out postcards with PIN numbers?Ideally something scalable that will automatically send postcards.
Take a look at https://www.kite.ly as we have a REST API for printing postcards and native mobile print SDK's that includes Postcards. If you're a developer you can be up and running sending postcards for verifying addresses in minutes! Full disclosure: I'm cofounder of the company so a little biased, but our products and offerings also happen to be really really good (especially from a developer integration point of view). As of the beginning of 2015 we also have millions of users accessing our services every month so you'll be in good company! Beyond postcards we offer other high quality, beautiful personalised products as well as more traditional paper/letter printing. And we're adding new products all the time: A4 Letters, Photo Prints, Magnets, Postcards, Posters, Stickers, Canvases, Greetings Cards, Phone cases, etc, etc...  - REST Print API: https://www.kite.ly/docs/1.1/  - iOS Print SDK: https://github.com/OceanLabs/iOS...  - Android Print SDK: https://github.com/OceanLabs/And... Our mobile print SDK's also include a robust product selection, photo editing and payment experience that's proven to convert well with users. It can take care of everything for you, no need to spend time building any user interfaces (unless you want to).    Embed Quote
