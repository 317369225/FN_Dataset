★My company is incorporated in State A. If I use my home address in State B as physical address to get Federal EIN, do I have to register my company in State B?The company is operating virtually. However to get Federal EIN one needs a physical address. If I give my home address in state B as the physical address does that mean we have to register in state B.
Thanks Dana...this was very helpful. I will do some more research for my specific state (PA)... this gives me enough to look for..    Embed Quote
