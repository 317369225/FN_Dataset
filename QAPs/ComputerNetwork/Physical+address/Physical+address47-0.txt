★My company is incorporated in State A. If I use my home address in State B as physical address to get Federal EIN, do I have to register my company in State B?The company is operating virtually. However to get Federal EIN one needs a physical address. If I give my home address in state B as the physical address does that mean we have to register in state B.
The various states have different requirements for the activities that require registration as a foreign (out-of-state) corporation. E.g., California and New York are discussed in When “Doing Business” isn’t “Doing Business” at http://danashultz.com/blog/2011/.... While I have not examined this issue with respect to all states, I believe I can say with confidence that no state would consider use of an address on an EIN application to be an activity that, by itself, requires registration as a foreign corporation.    Embed Quote
