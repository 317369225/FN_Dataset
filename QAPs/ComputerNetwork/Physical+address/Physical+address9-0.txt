★Is the address of variables printed in a C program Physical address or a Logical address?
It's the logical address. The virtual protection mechanisms will not allow you to work with real, physical addresses [Later edit] Note that this happens in the 'common' case of normal applications in an environment with MMU, assuming that your application runs in user-mode, not in kernel mode. On a MMU-less machine, you will get the physical address; but then again, you might not have support for processes, so probably you won't be able to modify 'main' as above. As Joe Byrd said, the type of address is not a property of the C code, but of the hardware and software capabilities. In the vast majority of cases, however, you will have there the logical address, as initially stated.    Embed Quote
