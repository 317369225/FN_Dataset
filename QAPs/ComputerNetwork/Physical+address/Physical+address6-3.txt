★Has the time come when physical addresses on business cards are obsolete?
Totally depends on your business.   Question forums like this tend to get a skewed audience and tend to overlook location-based business - like retail. Sure, I do marketing for a living and thus, my physical address is irrelevant.  I haven't had my physical address on my cards for years, but my recommendation to clients depends totally on whether they rely on walk-in traffic etc. Now if you have an address that carries weight and feel the need to impress people, go ahead regardless of what you do for a living.    Embed Quote
