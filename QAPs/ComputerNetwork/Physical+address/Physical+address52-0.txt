★I live in a motorhome full time and do not have a physical address, only a main forwarding service. Is there some public library where I can get a card so I can access 3M Cloud and Overdrive?
EDITED 11/30/2014 based on more information from the OP You  can use the resources of any public library in the county and state  where you reside, which would be determined by the address on your  driver's license. If  you're a "continuous traveler" and only have a PO Box on your driver's  license, some libraries may refuse to give you a card. Without knowing  which county your PO Box is in, I can't tell you if your library will  issue a card or not. Another wrinkle to consider:  it's likely you will have to go in person to apply, which might be  inconvenient if you're not currently in that state or county. Another  option is to get a non-resident library card. While it's not free, it's  going to cost less than buying three  current best-sellers from the book store, and a lot of large library systems offer this  option such as the Free Library of Philadelphia and the New Orleans  Public Library. Often times you will need to go into the library to  apply and pay for the card, but here are links to two libraries (both  have Overdrive) that will allow you to apply online: Charlotte Mecklenburg Library, North Carolina - $45 per year/$35 for people over 65: Catalog -Get A Card Non Resident Fairfax County, Virginia Library - $27 per year: Non-Resident Library Card Application    Embed Quote
