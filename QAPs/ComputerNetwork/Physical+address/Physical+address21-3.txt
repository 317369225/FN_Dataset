★How can I open a business bank account for my US startup if we don't have a physical address in the US?We are based outside the US and we are not residents of the US.
In my experience, you need a business entity and an EIN (employer identification number) from the US IRS. Plus you need whatever local licenses are required to operate in the city or county in which you are located. My bank required: Articles of Incorporation Board of Directors Motion to open the account (bank provided the form) EIN Business License (got it from City Hall) Cash for initial deposit    Embed Quote
