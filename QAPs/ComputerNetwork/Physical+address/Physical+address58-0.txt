★What is the difference between physical memory and address space?
What you probably are asking about is the difference between physical memory and virtual memory. An address space is the set of addresses accessible to a process. Virtual memory gives a process the illusion that it is the only process using the memory. So the address spaces of different processes have the same address values but they must refer to different physical memory registers. This is where the Memory Management Unit steps in. Memory Management Unit of a processor takes care of translating the virtual address for a process into the physical address so that it can be accessed through the memory access lines that the memory chip provides.
