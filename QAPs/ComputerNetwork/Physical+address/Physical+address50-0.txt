★How do purely online companies get listings in Google Places, Yext, or any of those systems which help so much with link ranking? The difficulty being that online companies wouldn't necessarily have a physical address
Strictly speaking, Google doesn't want an online company to have a Google Places entry. In fact, in the past, they have made it clear that they don't want, say a mobile locksmith company, to have a Google Places entry for each city they offer service to. They would like Google Places entries only for businesses that have a real physical address. You can sometimes deal with that by using the street address of one of your employees or something similar. Do that at your own risk.    Embed Quote
