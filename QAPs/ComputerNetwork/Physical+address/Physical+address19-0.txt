★When you load a program, is the program loaded into the virtual address space first or physical address space first?or both at the same time?
On a modern virtual memory system—Android, iOS, Linux, Mac OS—the relationship between virtual and physical memory is tightly coupled and nearly all (if not all) memory accesses go through virtual memory. On load, the entirety of your program's binary image is mapped into virtual memory. Then, as you access your program, a mechanism called demand paging loads the binary image into physical memory from disk, page by page. Virtual memory doesn't physically contain any data. You can look at it as an abstraction. Data is mapped into virtual memory, but only with physical memory is it physically loaded and thus present. At this point we say the virtual memory is backed by physical memory. Thus, to answer your question, your program is first mapped into virtual memory. Physical memory comes later, if and when you access a given page.    Embed Quote
