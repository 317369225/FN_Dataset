★Why do businesses use P.O. boxes instead of having mail sent to their physical address?
P.O. Boxes are easier to set up than an entire physical property, making them useful for micro-companies or start-ups to look more professional and established, and can serve as a permanent 'communications' or 'contact' address even while the company itself is not in a permanent physical location, due to moving, building, operating out of home, etc. They are also a good way for a company owner or entrepreneur to do business securely without being physically found, if the case is that they owe a substantial amount of money, have had liens or other financial judgments against them, and are seeking to put some distance between themselves and those that they owe.   Personally, though... I think it's just an excuse to get out for bit. ;)    Embed Quote
