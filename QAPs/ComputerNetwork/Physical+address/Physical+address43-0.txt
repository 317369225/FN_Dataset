★My company is incorporated in Delaware. If I use my home address in Illinois as the physical address to get Federal EIN, will there be any negative implications?I used a registered agent for IL incorp. My home isn't considered an asset of the corporation so I would assume that separation means I wouldn't lose my home in a worst case scenario.
A lot of companies do this in their home states.  In most cases, the downsides amount to getting some extra junk mail, potentially affecting the equation of where the company is doing business and having to update addresses if the address changes.  The alternatives are getting a permanent office and getting a virtual post address.    Embed Quote
