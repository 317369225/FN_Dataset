★Has the time come when physical addresses on business cards are obsolete?
It depends on the industry and what you hope to gain by handing your card to someone. I work in an almost exclusively digital world, and it makes no sense for me to print out a card that only has my email address and Twitter ID on it. That information is going to be input into a digital contact manager, and the card is going to collect dust. Also, while it's iPhone specific, technologies like Bump are going to become more and more common, where users can share contact data instantly. You can even send contact profiles as text attachments now. However, the card itself is becoming less and less prevalent as a physical branding object, and people are growing more clever about what they choose to hand out. Some make the object usefu,l like a custom USB drive, so it will have multiple impression opportunities in the future, while others simply make it memorable by how cute or fun (sometimes nostalgic for my generation i.e. Rockem' Sockem' Robots) it is. Again, I think it comes down to the industry and the what you hope to get out of the "business card" interaction.    Embed Quote
