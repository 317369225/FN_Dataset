★Has the time come when physical addresses on business cards are obsolete?
My business card only has my e-mail address on it. The people I do business with don't need anything else. And if they want they can derive my website from the address. But this is probably not a very smart thing to do for most businesses. Partly because my business is very very small, I don't have an office and I don't want them to call me :) So, if your business profits from radiating a healthy dose of trust onto your customers, it's not a bad idea to have something on there that says you are here to stay and that they can reach you in all manner of ways. yeah,.. what Warren Fauvel said...    Embed Quote
