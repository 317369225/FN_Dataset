★Where can I get a database of small businesses in the US (under 50 people) with their IP addresses and/or physical addresses?
There is tons on information at Statistics about Business Size (including Small Business) from the U.S. Census Bureau. But you do have to parse the data yourself, or else you could pay for a service like SalesGenie to do the filtering work.    Embed Quote
