★Can I make a UPS rental box my physical business address?I have this startup thats in need of an address now, I don't want to use my home address because of privacy.
It depends on your business goals. In the short run, it may not hurt you to have your UPS rental box as your business address, especially if you’re just getting started. But if you plan on having a website and competing in local search, you have a few things to consider: 1.    If potential clients find that your “business address” syncs up with a UPS Store, it might hurt your credibility. Any address that’s not truly your address is not transparent—it might even be considered spammy by some, even if you have a legitimate business. 2.    Google Places requires an address where your business physically exists. Even though The UPS Store issues a physical address for your rental box, it’s considered misleading and could get your listing removed from Google Places. 3.    You can choose a service area for your business but keep your home address private in your Google Places listing (http://www.google.com/support/pl...). You can be competitive and still maintain some level of privacy. At the same time, Google will be looking to verify your address at other local search directories (CitySearch, Local.com, etc.) as a means to rank your business locally, which makes it tough to mask your home address if those other places don’t have similar privacy features. I had a lively discussion with one of my LinkedIn Groups about a similar subject some time ago (http://www.linkedin.com/groups/H...) that might provide you with more insight.    Embed Quote
