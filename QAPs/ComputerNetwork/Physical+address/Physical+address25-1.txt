★What are some good services to create a "virtual" physical address for a new business?In other words, it has a street name, etc. but will forward mail onto another address. Thanks!
What you are looking for is actually called a virtual office. Even if you just google that name, you will come up with a ton of results. If you live in a city, then your area should be very well-served. Of course, you could always live in an outlying area and just get a virtual office address in a city. My friend is in business with virtual offices at http://www.yourcityoffice.com. I don't know where you live, so I don't know if he could help you, but I have no doubt you'll be able to find them in your own area anyway.    Embed Quote
