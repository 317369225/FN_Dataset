★".re" domain requires a physical address in Reunion Island. How do you satisfy that requirement?Does slidesha.re have a physical address there? This is a follow-up question to How do you register a vanity TLD domain like .re in http://slidesha.re?.
Use a service like http://www.safenames.net which specialize in this type of service.  It is very expensive though.    Embed Quote
