â˜…Has the time come when physical addresses on business cards are obsolete?
I've had this debate several times with my team. I think the answer comes down to the preference of your customers and the fundamental issue is trust. From a user point of view: In your industry, with your businesses profile, would you trust a business who's whose address you didn't know? I personally still have an address on my cards, but in the shortest format possible. However, I do see a day soon when an email/web address will be sufficient, as most of the potential clients I've talked to about this check our website for directions anyway. I'd recommend you run off a few cards with (and a few without) the full address and ask your clients which they'd trust more.
