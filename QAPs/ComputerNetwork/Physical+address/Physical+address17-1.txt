★In a computer, if a physical address is incremented, will it reference the next bit or byte?
No computer architecture I've ever known has bit-addressable memory because there's no need for it. In a limited address space, wasting 3 more bits for the bit address is not very good. For example if your computer has 16-bit address, would you use it for 64K of bytes or you'll use that to address 64K of bits which is only 8KB? In 32-bit architectures, addressing each bit will limit your space to only 512MB and we'll have to move to 64-bit architectures soon. Also, most modern systems load memory and processing them by words, not bits, so using bit-addressable memory would slow down the process. In embedded systems, the 8051 architecture has a special zone of memory which is bit-addressable but not for the whole memory space    Embed Quote
