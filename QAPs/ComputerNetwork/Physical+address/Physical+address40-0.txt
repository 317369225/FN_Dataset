★Is it necessary to have a SSN and physical address in order to file for a EIN (Employer Identification Number) in USA?
Generally, the responsible party must have a SSN, ITIN, or EIN - see Understanding Your EIN, Publication 1635. If you provide a mailing address which is a PO Box number, you must also provide a physical address which is not. The only time that an ID number (SSN, ITIN, or EIN) is not required is when the entity is requesting an EIN for the sole purpose of making an entity classification election filing Form 8832, or filing Form 2553 to elect treatment as an S-corporation, and the responsible party is a nonresident alien who has no effectively connected US income. That cannot be done online.    Embed Quote
