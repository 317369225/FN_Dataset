★How can I open a business bank account for my US startup if we don't have a physical address in the US?We are based outside the US and we are not residents of the US.
There are office rental business as Regus and Plug and Play Tech, which have small packages of about US$100-200 for new startups, and which include providing a business address, along with basic secretarial services. You can sign up for a basic plan with them, get an address, and use this when you are getting started. Then, when you get a real office and workplace, just change your address.    Embed Quote
