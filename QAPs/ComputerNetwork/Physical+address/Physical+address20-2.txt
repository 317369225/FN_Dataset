★Should I provide my physical address when selling digital goods online?I'm selling digital goods online mostly with PayPal and recently a purchaser has requested me to provide my physical address. He claims that he needs it for taxes or something. Should I give him my address? It's going to be my home address. I'm wondering if it's safe or not.
