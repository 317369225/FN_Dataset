★My company is incorporated in Delaware. If I use my home address in Illinois as the physical address to get Federal EIN, will there be any negative implications?I used a registered agent for IL incorp. My home isn't considered an asset of the corporation so I would assume that separation means I wouldn't lose my home in a worst case scenario.
No you would not, however just to be safe do not write off home office space on your taxes.  That may (unlikely) create a link but you would also have to reduce your basis on the home when calculating capital gains on the asset at the point of sale.    Embed Quote
