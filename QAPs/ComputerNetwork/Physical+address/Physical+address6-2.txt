★Has the time come when physical addresses on business cards are obsolete?
In my company we still handout our business cards to each of our clients on first meeting. Mostly, it is just a curtosy because most of the communication is through the project managers. But our clients do expect it. Our address is on the card, but that seems unnecessary. We travel to them and our deliverables are either sent digitally or they and given in person.    Embed Quote
