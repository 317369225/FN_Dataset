★Facebook can't find or confirm's client's physical address location?
First time on Quora.... It didn't ask me for a question! But here it is:  I have a fb page.  At some point I thought, "I don't want my physical address on there" and deleted it.  Now I want it back so my recommendations will show up again (I hope!), but I can't seem to enter it.  I'm down as a Local Business.  The Address shows "No physical street address" and isn't an enterable box.  What do I need to change to be able to reenter this?  Facebook    Embed Quote
