★Could using a different domain for Google Adwords purposes affect my Google Places listing if the website will have  the same physical address?
The short answer is yes: having 2 domains in AdWords both using Google Places extension can affect the Google Maps listing. Google Maps will combine multiple business information if companies share the same physical address. http://www.google.com/support/fo... It's important to note Google considers having multiple listing on Google Maps for the same business an attempt to "spam" search engine results. For example, I could create multiple shell businesses at the same location for the purpose of stacking the listings in my favor. This is why Google combines listings with the same address and/or phone number. You can have 2 domains in your AdWords account just not under the same ad group. http://adwords.google.com/suppor... You do NOT need to hide your 2nd domain using a robot file.  You do not have to have your second site linked to Google Places. If you do want the new site on Google Maps, consider replacing the1st URL in Google Places with the 2nd site since the 1st domain is not being used in the new campaigns.    Embed Quote
