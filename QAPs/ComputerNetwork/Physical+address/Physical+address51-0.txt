★Is there an online tool which allows you to enter in physical addresses which you are delivering goods to and then have it return which addresses are adjacent to one another and should be delivered by a single driver?
You can probably build it yourself along following lines: 1) You enter a physical address. 2) Using Google Geocoding API you calculate the coordinates of the address ( The Google Geocoding API ). 3) Then, you use Google Places API to find out addresses close to the coordinates ( Introduction ).
