★Is it important to have a prominent physical address to promote a business? Why?
While a prominent business address can indeed contribute to the perception that people have of your company, I would strongly encourage you not to focus on this as a core reason for establishing your company in one place or another. The Silicon Valley, for example, is well known for incubating many tech startups and companies. What's important to pay attention to is that they did not move to the Valley in order to benefit from a physical address and a "I'm located in Silicon Valley" bragging right. They moved here in order to benefit from a like-minded forward thinking culture, talent-base, and networking opportunities with venture capitalists and investors. If not for the actual, bottom-line driving benefits listed above, it would make no sense to move a business here - land value is extremely high and rental spaces are expensive.    Embed Quote
