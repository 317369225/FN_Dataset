★U.S. Postal Service: Is there a way to set up a string of forwarding addresses to make it harder to have letters tracked back to your physical address?
Mail forwarding to defraud is a federal offense. Just wanted to get that out there.... You seem to be overthinking this one.The woman simply could: Put a fake return address on the letter Mail the letter from outside postal box in  nearby city or town Put no external return address on the letter Put no external return address on the letter and then place instructions inside of the letter detailing a return address not her own. Put no external return address on the letter and then include an email address inside the letter asking the recipient to send an email asking for a return address. None of the above will allow a letter to be returned (or to be easily traced back to) its original sender    Embed Quote
