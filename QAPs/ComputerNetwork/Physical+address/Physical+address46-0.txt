★Is there a personal contact management system that understands how families and relationships work? I'm looking for an address book for my personal relationships that understands that individuals may have their own e-mail address and phone numbers but share a physical address.
I believe you can try Pintact - The Future of Contact Management. It does allow you to create labels like "Family", "Smith Family" and so on. And all contacts within such a label or group can be viewed easily. Being a contact management app which focusses on efficient networking and better organization of contacts, it does not yet allows explicit relationship labelling between different connections.    Embed Quote
