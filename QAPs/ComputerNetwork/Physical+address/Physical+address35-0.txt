★What is the difference between virtual address, logical address and physical address?
Physical Address: This is something which is hard-coded on the chip. Best example is the MAC address on the NIC (Network Internet Card). These addresses are unique. Logical Address: This is logically assigned address (software) for accessing a host/node from another software across a connected network. Best example is the IP address. Virtual Address: This is another logical address on top of logical "addresses", this type of addressing/configuration is found in load balancing and redundancy environments. Best example is the VIP (virtual IP) in Cisco HSRP.    Embed Quote
