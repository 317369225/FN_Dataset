★Is the address of variables printed in a C program Physical address or a Logical address?
In simple terms, when a prog is loaded in to memory (RAM), it is assigned a address space which is nothing but mapping of logical address for that prog with the physical address of actuall memory (RAM). This address space is managed by MMU (memory managment unit). read about base register and limit register for more details. So just to have an example, let say our prog A is loaded in to memory and is assigned a logical address space from memory address 0 to memory address 5000. Simillarly porg B is assigned logaical address from address 0 to address 800. Both of these are actually pointing to different actual address (or physicall memory address). assuming that our RAM has physicall address ranging from address 0 to address 100,000..... Prog A might be present in physical addres 7,000 to 12,000 and prog B in 2,000 to 2,800. I would suggest reading PAGING, swap in & swap out for better understanding    Embed Quote
