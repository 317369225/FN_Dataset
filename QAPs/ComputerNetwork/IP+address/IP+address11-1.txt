â˜…Does Quora ever ban IP addresses?I've noticed at least one particularly persistent troll who uses more than a few sock puppet identities. His first user account appears to have been banned. Considering that he's gotten around that, would Quora ever ban the IP address he uses?
Most likely not, because people can already block other people on here.
