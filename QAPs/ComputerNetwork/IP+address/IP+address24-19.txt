â˜…Why do we need domain name if IP address does the same thing?I was asked this question and I replied "To make life easy it is easy to remember names than huge set of random no's" what could be better technical reply
2 Main Reasons: 1) To remember addresses without any problem. 2) If you are hosting multiple websites on same server then all of them cannot be accesses via same IP. It's the domain name and sub-domain name which allows this to be done. For more information see setting up of Virtual Hosts in Apache
