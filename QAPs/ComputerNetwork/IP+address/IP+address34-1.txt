★What is a good speed VPN with many IP addresses?
I had the same question when searching for a good VPN Providers, the best offers I could find was the following three service.   1.      OverPlay VPN with 12000+ IP Addresses 2.      IPVanish with 14000+ IP Addresses (mix of static and dynamic) 3.      PureVPN with 77000+ IP addresses (mix of static and dynamic) Also try Express VPN and HideMyAss, while express do not give an exact number of IP addresses they offer, HideMyAss has close to 35000 IPs to offer.
