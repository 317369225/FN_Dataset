★Why do we need domain name if IP address does the same thing?I was asked this question and I replied "To make life easy it is easy to remember names than huge set of random no's" what could be better technical reply
Domain names are easier to remember for people than numbers.  When you think to buy something at Walmart, you think Walmart, not some long string of numbers. Domain names can be load balanced or redirected to different IP addresses. Domain names are portable, but IP addresses are usually tied to an ISP or hosting provider.  So, you can switch a web hosting provider and keep a domain name, but it is harder to keep the same IP address. IP address provide a routing structure for a network.  Domain names provide a lookup service; a phone book, so to speak. IP addresses can be shared with multiple domain names, where the domain name tells the server what resource to use.
