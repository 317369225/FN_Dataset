★How do I do fast local geolocation of an IP address?I need to determine a city, state, and country from an IP address very quickly, in a matter of milliseconds.  This speed requirement demands that I do it based on a local database.  I've downloaded the hostip.info database but I can't find any instructions on how to do lookups in it.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  A free option would be ideal.
Try  GeoIP: http://www.maxmind.com/app/bench..., http://www.maxmind.com/app/geoli..., http://www.maxmind.com/app/c also check out http://www.ip2location.com/c.aspx I think a good option would be downloading raw geolocation data and then importing to a fast in-memory key-value store, like Redis (http://code.google.com/p/redis/w...) for sub msec access and high throughput (40-140K GETs/sec depending on your hardware, number of clients and the data size/value size in bytes)
