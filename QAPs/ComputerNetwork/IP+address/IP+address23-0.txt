★What can you learn from someone's IP address?
You can get an approximate location for an IP, usually down to the city level. Once you have a location you work out other details, such as the timezone, zipcode and dialing code, and even demographic information (such as the average ages, employment status, race etc) from government census data. In addition to the location and location related information you can lookup the associated hostname, and the organization that owns the IP (which for smaller organizations will actually be be the ISP or network provider of the organization that uses the IP. You can also detect if they're on a mobile network, and if so which carrier they're on. Much of this information is available on the http://ipinfo.io website, or via their API: $ curl http://ipinfo.io/67.188.232.130 {   "ip": "67.188.232.130",   "hostname": "c-67-188-232-130.hsd1.ca.comcast.net",   "city": "Mountain View",   "region": "California",   "country": "US",   "loc": "37.4192,-122.0574",   "org": "AS7922 Comcast Cable Communications, Inc.",   "postal": "94043" } All of that information is available passively, but you can also actively probe the IP address. Using tools such as nmap you can work out what services the machine is running, and usually what operating system too.
