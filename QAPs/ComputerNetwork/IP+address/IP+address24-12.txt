★Why do we need domain name if IP address does the same thing?I was asked this question and I replied "To make life easy it is easy to remember names than huge set of random no's" what could be better technical reply
In local area network, network admin can activate , Domain DNS , Dynamic IP DHCP , using Static Ip, Netbui etc etc... One significant advantage and the main reason why using Domain name is "make it easy to identify a network" Let me give you an example Which one is easier to remember ,  Benoninetwork or 192.168.1.1 ? You definitely know which one is easier to remember. Even some people very good in memorizing numbers, Giving domain will likely reduce mistakes and forgotten. This also applied to Wide Area Network Like internet domain.
