â˜…How can I exclude external traffic from Google Analytics without an IP address?I want to exclude my current clients as traffic to my site which they use daily. Their are over 200 so filtering their IP addresses is not practical.
I think that Carol's solution will exclude only visits where the user did visit that specific page. If a logged in user had a visit to the site without logging in, he will still appear in your profile. Rob's solution is great but there are several reports you cannot filter using an advanced segment (like the funnel visualization report or unique visitors or when you break down your data by two dimension). I would go with a combination of both Rob's and Carol's suggestions: When a user logs in to your system, "mark" him/her as "Client" using the user defined variable Create two profiles: - On one profile, exclude all visits from marked users (User Defined field = "Client") - On the second profile, include only visits from marked users
