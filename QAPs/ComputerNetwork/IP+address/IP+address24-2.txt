â˜…Why do we need domain name if IP address does the same thing?I was asked this question and I replied "To make life easy it is easy to remember names than huge set of random no's" what could be better technical reply
Randall Greer mentioned redirection. Since I used to work for Akamai, I am going to point out the Internet works immeasurable better because of this redirection. Check out some of the info at Content Delivery Networks: How does Akamai CDN work? Not perfect, but gives you an idea. EDIT: I forgot to mention the premise is incorrect. A domain name is not the same thing as an IP address. And IP address is globally unique (we'll ignore things like anycast, RFC1918 space, etc.), and therefore exists in one place. A domain name (really a "hostname", not "domain name", but I digress) is a way to find an IP address as others have mentioned. But the important point is a hostname can point to many IP addresses, or point to different IP addresses at different times, or point to different IP addresses based on who asks / where they ask / randomly / whatever. Etc., etc. While you can turn one into the other (and sometimes, not always, vice-versa), they are not the same.
