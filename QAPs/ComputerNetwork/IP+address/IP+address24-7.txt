â˜…Why do we need domain name if IP address does the same thing?I was asked this question and I replied "To make life easy it is easy to remember names than huge set of random no's" what could be better technical reply
Many people have weighed in with good answers. Let me add another. It is often case that one web server will handle sites on the same IPv4 address. The web browser tells the server what host/web site it wants. This is very useful because IPv4 addresses are in short supply. It's also useful since it means you don't have to configure a server with possibly many hundreds of addresses. Actually, on reflection, the question has a fundamental mistake. A domain name and an IP address are completely different things. Whilst a domain name often has an IP address, it's very often not the case; for example, domains with AAAA records (IPv6 addresses), domains without either A or AAAA and only some other DNS record (NS, MX or other). It's like asking why do you have an address book in your phone when all you need to know is someone's phone number.. how about if you're using a smartphone and you want to record their name, phone numbers for work and home, email address, instant messaging username etc.
