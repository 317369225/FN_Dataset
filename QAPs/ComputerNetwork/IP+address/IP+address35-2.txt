â˜…How can I exclude external traffic from Google Analytics without an IP address?I want to exclude my current clients as traffic to my site which they use daily. Their are over 200 so filtering their IP addresses is not practical.
I think that 200 IP addresses isn't too many to block when you consider that alternative solutions are either less reliable or so technically intricate that just blocking the IPs would still be more efficient. You may be able to reduce the number of IP filters needed just by looking for the clients where self-contamination is actually a problem. First, look at the Service Provider dimension. If the client is listed in the top ten referring service providers, then get the IP address and exclude it, or build an advanced segment that excludes them. (This only works if the client's firm is very clearly listed as the service provider. If it says Comcast, AOL or somesuch, it isn't a good option.) Second, look at direct traffic. Is it more than 40% of site visits? Is the bounce rate really high or is the time on site really low (both indicative that it may have been set to the home page in every browser in the office)? Those would be worth excluding too. Those won't catch all of it, but it will help you understand where data contamination is actually a problem. However, I'm guessing that going to that much trouble is still less efficient than just sucking it up and blocking the IPs.
