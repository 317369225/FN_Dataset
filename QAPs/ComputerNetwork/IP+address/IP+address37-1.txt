★Could a computer security expert trace an 'untraceable' IP address?There are programs which masks a users IP address.  Are these methods foolproof?  No need to discuss the mechanics of how.  I'm just curious if it can be done.  Links appreciated.
Sometimes. In fact it often is. If the IP address is the only thing you got, only the police using court orders and log files from the ISP's can do it, but often you have more info then the IP address and often the guy you are looking for has used that IP address for other things and that what makes your day. First step is to connect the IP address with as much other information as possible. Names, email addresses, nick names, places, subjects and more Next is to use tools like Maltego and search engines to find more stuff connected to the IP connected info. Looking for these clues you can often find real names, addresses, email addresses, work places, physical location and more. If you want to learn this, my advice is to try out with some real IP addresses and see who you can connect to them, it's not easy, but once you get the tricks you will be scary good
