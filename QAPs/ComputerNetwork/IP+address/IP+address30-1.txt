â˜…How accurate is IP address geolocation for people visiting your site?A lot of sites use IP address geolocation to determine what city a user is in for the purpose of showing that user relevant content? I know that HTML5 geolocation is very accurate, however I want to know how accurate current IP address geolocation methods are? Can I locate users by city? Can I locate users by neighborhood for larger cities?
It's very inaccurate sometimes. I've seen people in UK get recognized as people in New York. In some cases it's decently accurate. You can bolt down till neighborhood in large cities when it works. The fact is it depends on your ISP. So how accurate geo is depends on how a person is provisioned internet access.
