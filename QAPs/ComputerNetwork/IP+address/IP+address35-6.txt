â˜…How can I exclude external traffic from Google Analytics without an IP address?I want to exclude my current clients as traffic to my site which they use daily. Their are over 200 so filtering their IP addresses is not practical.
If you have an exclusive section on your site for your clients (let's say they need to login to be able to see this section), you can tag this specific page with a name and then you can apply a filter to exclude all the traffic from tagged visitors. e.g. <a href="http://www.example.com/members/V..." onClick=" onClick="pageTracker._setVar('Loggedin/VIP');"> You can also make a new profile and track the behavior of only tagged visitors.
