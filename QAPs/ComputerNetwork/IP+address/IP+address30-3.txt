â˜…How accurate is IP address geolocation for people visiting your site?A lot of sites use IP address geolocation to determine what city a user is in for the purpose of showing that user relevant content? I know that HTML5 geolocation is very accurate, however I want to know how accurate current IP address geolocation methods are? Can I locate users by city? Can I locate users by neighborhood for larger cities?
For IP based geo location the accuracy of the result ranges anywhere in-between 50-99%. Take a look at (Ip Address location lookup and reverse geolocation map tool) and see how it shows the IP location accuracy. If alternatively, it is done via browser/HTML5 that's a whole lot more accurate, however requires user consent - and people really don't like giving away their position...there is some creepiness factor I guess.
