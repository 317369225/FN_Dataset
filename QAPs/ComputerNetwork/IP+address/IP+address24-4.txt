â˜…Why do we need domain name if IP address does the same thing?I was asked this question and I replied "To make life easy it is easy to remember names than huge set of random no's" what could be better technical reply
All of the answers here are correct, but one more reason to consider is that while IPv4 addresses are (relatively) easy to remember being only 32 bits we're in the (slow) process of moving to IPv6 which I don't think many of us will want to try and remember. IPv4 address in dotted decimal format: 199.170.121.15 (our main caching name server from ~15 years ago) An example of an IPv6 address in hex. FE80:0000:0000:0000:0202:B3FF:FE1E:8329
