★How do I do fast local geolocation of an IP address?I need to determine a city, state, and country from an IP address very quickly, in a matter of milliseconds.  This speed requirement demands that I do it based on a local database.  I've downloaded the hostip.info database but I can't find any instructions on how to do lookups in it.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  A free option would be ideal.
Try geoip-lite. It resolves ip details in 1 millisecond. You can deploy it as local web service to replace existing component in you application( non-nodejs app).  In that case it will take around 5 ms. ab testing results ab -n 1000 -c 10 url?ip=myip Connection Times (ms)               min  mean[+/-sd] median   max Connect:        0    0   0.1      0       2 Processing:     4    6   4.1      5      40 Waiting:        3    6   4.1      5      40 Total:          4    6   4.2      5      41 Percentage of the requests served within a certain time (ms)   50%      5   66%      6   75%      6   80%      7   90%      8   95%     10   98%     22   99%     33  100%     41 (longest request)
