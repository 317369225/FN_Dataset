â˜…How are IP addresses allotted to computers?
In short : The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a standardized networking protocol used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks for dynamically distributing network configuration parameters, such as IP addresses for interfaces and services. With DHCP, computers request IP addresses and networking parameters automatically from a DHCP server, reducing the need for a network administrator or a user to configure these settings manually. Detailed explanation: The protocol operates based on the client-server model. DHCP is very common in all modern networks ranging in size from home networks to large campus networks and regional Internet service provider networks. Most residential network routers receive a globally unique IP address within the provider network. Within a local network, DHCP assigns a local IP address to devices connected to the local network. When a computer or other networked device connects to a network, its DHCP client software in the operating system sends a broadcast query requesting necessary information. Any DHCP server on the network may service the request. The DHCP server manages a pool of IP addresses and information about client configuration parameters such as default gateway, domain name, the name servers, and time servers. On receiving a request, the server may respond with specific information for each client, as previously configured by an administrator, or with a specific address and any other information valid for the entire network, and the time period for which the allocation (lease) is valid. A host typically queries for this information immediately after booting, and periodically thereafter before the expiration of the information. When an assignment is refreshed by the client computer, it initially requests the same parameter values, but may be assigned a new address from the server, based on the assignment policies set by administrators.
