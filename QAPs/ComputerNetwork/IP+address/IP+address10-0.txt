★What are some famous IP addresses?IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) are a foundational aspect to modern networking and the Internet, but they don't get much recognition. I've seen the story behind 4.2.2.2: The Story Behind a DNS Legend, but I was wondering if there are any other interesting IP addresses out there.
Many Reserved IP addresses are famous in the sense that  that most engineers will recognize them.  10.x.x.x/172.16.x.x/192.168.x.x are all recognized as private.  192.168.0.1 and 192.168.1.1 are good first guesses for a home router.  192.0.2.x addresses are from documentation; 169.254.x.x are auto-assigned in the absence of DHCP server.  224.x.x.x are all multicast. Similar addresses exist in IPv6, such as ::1 for localhost, fe8x:: (and friends) for link-local and 2002:: for 6to4 translated. In a sense, all reserved IP addresses are "famous." If you are asking about publicly accessible famous "assigned" addresses, there are famous ones that are useful, and some that have a story. Some useful ones: DNS servers: 4.2.2.2 (as you noted) 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4 (Google DNS) 2001:4860:4860::8888 and 2001:4860:4860::8844 (Google DNS) 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220 (OpenDNS) 2620:0:ccc::2 and 2620:0:ccd::2 (OpenDNS) IPv6 Sprint web server: 2600:: is a short public IPv6 address to ping.  The address is an homage to the 2600Hz tone of the phone hacking Blue box.  Officially it is 2600::aaaa, but 2600:: works and answers ICMP Echo Requests (pings), though it is technically disallowed as an address. Some with a story: NTP server: 128.105.39.11 - hardcoded NTP server in buggy Netgear firmware.  See: Flawed Routers Flood University of Wisconsin Internet Time Server. Facebook embeds its name in its IPv6 address: 2a03:2880:2110:df07:face:b00c::1 Personally, I only ever use 8.8.8.8 and 2600:: because my memory sucks.  I wish there was an easy to remember DNS IPv6 anycast server. I also wish that there was an easy to remember NTP anycast for IPv4 and IPv6. Even without that, I can generally get DNS and NTP service up on any node in a jiffy with only 8.8.8.8 and pool.ntp.org.
