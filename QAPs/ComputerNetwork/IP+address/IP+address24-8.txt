â˜…Why do we need domain name if IP address does the same thing?I was asked this question and I replied "To make life easy it is easy to remember names than huge set of random no's" what could be better technical reply
Aside from technical reasons like sharing multiple IPs across the same domain, your reason is exactly correct. A domain name becomes a brand. It's not just something that's easy to remember: It's part of a company's brand image. Typing Google's domain name into my URL bar is part of the process. Imagine someone trying to go online and search for the Dallas Cowboys. They type "dallas . com" into their browser, and get the Official Site of the Dallas Cowboys . They didn't even need to go to a search engine. How could they possibly have done that with an IP?
