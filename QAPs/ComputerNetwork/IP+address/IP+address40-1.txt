★Can you find someone's IP address from an email?If I sends someone an email from a yahoo/hotmail/google account, can they easily find out what my IP address is?  How?  And if doesn't give exact IP address, will it definitely tell them what sate I'm in? If I go on business to another state and send an email, does my IP address change? Or can they at least tell wheat state I'm in?  Thanks!
Generally, the email can only be traced back to the mail server from which it was sent. In the email "header," which isn't typically shown by the email client, there is IP information that shows the the route through which the email was routed but that doesn't tell us anything about the original sender's address If you click on any links in an email, the tables are turned.  The click on a link will let an mail marketer make a connection between the email that was sent and the source of the click.  We can then often tell where the recipient lives down to the city level and we have the IP address from the browser.  Once those two things are avaiable, it's easy to tie email addresses to IP addresses.
