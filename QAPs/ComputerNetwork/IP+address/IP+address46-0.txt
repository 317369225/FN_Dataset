â˜…How are IP addresses decided for various ports?Like the Ethernet and Serial ports for a router.
If you meant to ask about TCP or UDP port numbers, Kok-Yong Tan's "answer to How are IP addresses decided for various ports" is ok. If you meant to ask about physical ports on routers & switches, it's up to the vendor. It's very common to number ports according to the slot/module/sequence number, as it is a very convenient scheme. Sometimes, even in a small switch, groups of ports are connected to separate chipsets, where each comprises a port group. Some vendors number all the ports in sequence, while others prefer to use the module/sequence number scheme.
