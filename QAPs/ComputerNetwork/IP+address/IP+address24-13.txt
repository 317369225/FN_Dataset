â˜…Why do we need domain name if IP address does the same thing?I was asked this question and I replied "To make life easy it is easy to remember names than huge set of random no's" what could be better technical reply
why do we have address books when we can call everyone straight from their numbers. The reason is that you cannot remember all the numbers, but its easier to remember the names. Lets consider the DNS (Domain Name System) as a yellow page for the WWW (World Wide Web). You ask what is the number (in this case : IP Address) for the a particular company or brand, and in return your DNS server gives (translates) the IP address for you. There has been a research which states that names are 5 times easier to remember than numbers. In this case, its about telelphone numbers but we can apply the same logic to IP addresses. In fact in terms of IP addresses its even harder. ref: http://www.dandmresearch.com.au/... Secondly, it is also necessary from a knowledge point of view i.e. you have some information about the website before you even visit. A website URL (uniform resource locator) gives you a lot more information that just a number. eg-> Page on australia.gov..au . Just from the URL, you get to know that this is the website for the australian government, instead if you just have an IP address like -> 208.94.148.4. You cannot decode anything from here. Thirdly, in the near future, we will be shifting to ipv6 address, which will make it ever more difficult to type (even if we somehow remember) since they are too long. Fourthly, a rough estimate of IP addresses owned by google is approx. 230,000. (i got my results by counting the number of (IP Address range) subnets owned by google using the dig command in linux.) Fifthly, a domain name can be used for marketing / promotion of a brand as well.
