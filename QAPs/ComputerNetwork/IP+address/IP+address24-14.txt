â˜…Why do we need domain name if IP address does the same thing?I was asked this question and I replied "To make life easy it is easy to remember names than huge set of random no's" what could be better technical reply
This doesn't really deserve an answer as it seems ridiculous to ask... Another use for DNS is virtual hosts. I can host hundreds of domain names from one ip address by configuring virtual hosts. http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2...
