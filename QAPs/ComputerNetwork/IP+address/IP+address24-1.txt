★Why do we need domain name if IP address does the same thing?I was asked this question and I replied "To make life easy it is easy to remember names than huge set of random no's" what could be better technical reply
The other answers are all very good.  I wanted to add: Domain names provide a level of Indirection under the control of the same administration that needs to change that indirection. By judicious use of  CNAME records and SRV records, a domain administrator can tell you where a host or service is located. When they relocate that host or service, they do not have to contact 1 billion users, telling them that the web service for Google has relocated, for example. This service is now at 74.125.129.104, please update your records: They simply change DNS and the traffic will follow (modulo caching effects, other stubborn people, etc.).
