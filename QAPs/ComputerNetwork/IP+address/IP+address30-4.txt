★How accurate is IP address geolocation for people visiting your site?A lot of sites use IP address geolocation to determine what city a user is in for the purpose of showing that user relevant content? I know that HTML5 geolocation is very accurate, however I want to know how accurate current IP address geolocation methods are? Can I locate users by city? Can I locate users by neighborhood for larger cities?
It's horrible for some users. Every site that uses my IP address to locate me says I'm in Santa Ana, CA, when I'm 100 miles north of there.  Why?  Because my ISP (Time-Warner cable) has huge address blocks that they use willy-nilly over their SoCal monopoly. It's worse than annoying, as many commercial sites keep resetting the location I manually enter (nearby store, weather, etc) with the same wrong geolocation. IMNSHO, any web designer that uses store-bought IP geolocation without having a user override cookie is a lazy-ass hack.
