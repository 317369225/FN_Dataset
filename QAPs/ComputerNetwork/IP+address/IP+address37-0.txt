★Could a computer security expert trace an 'untraceable' IP address?There are programs which masks a users IP address.  Are these methods foolproof?  No need to discuss the mechanics of how.  I'm just curious if it can be done.  Links appreciated.
The odds are actually against the expert. Although time frame makes a difference. Here is why: Most of us connect to the Internet by way of a network that uses IP #'s from the private network, 192.168.1.0/24, being the most common. This address cannot actually be used on the Internet so your router does a Network Address Translation, of your unusable IP number to a number assigned to the router by your ISP. So, the actual IP address of the user is hidden from the Internet in the first place. So, we trace the IP address to your home or business or campus but not to you, specifically. So, now we want to hide even deeper. A proxy server will do this. Again, you go in with one IP number, come out with a different IP number. Software such as  anonymoX, will do this for you. http://translate.google.de/trans... TOR networks. Here the idea, is to jump from one IP # to another. Your number is constantly changing. Tor Project: OverviewNote in all of these examples you will leave an IP number in server logs. You just don't leave behind a number that is going to lead anyone back to you. Well, in number 1, it will depend on how much logging is done by the router, but in examples 2 and 3 there are no logs. Now, if the expert is tracing you in real time, it becomes a slightly different story. He might be able to track you through the proxy server, although a heavily used server will probably thwart him just by the volume of traffic. The TOR network will probably thwart him altogether. So, with apologies to McGee on NCIS on CBS.com using either #2 or 3 will defeat the security expert.
