★What can hackers do with an IP address and Wi-Fi password?
An attacker cannot get your WiFi password from just your IP address, unless you are incredibly sloppy (e.g. you run a webserver on your computer with no access control, and there's a file that says "list of passwords"). That kind of thing does happen occasionally in industry - someone puts sensitive data on an internal webserver, then someone else changes the network so now it's public. All webserver operators have your public IP address - it's how websites know where to send the page you just requested. They can't do anything with that (except guess your location, or DoS you - slow down your connection) unless you are sloppy. Most personal computers now are not running any services by default, and are not sharing files to the internet unless you turn that on, and  some networks block file-sharing protocols anyway. A hacker can't do an SQL injection attack on your computer if you aren't running a webserver, don't have an SQL server, or don't have any stupidly vulnerable code on your website. In the past, I admit, there were occasions when that wasn't true. The ping-of-death for instance could knock machines down with a single command - I once took out about 30 printers doing a vulnerability scan. But now Microsoft and Apple and Linux etc. have had 20 years to harden their network software against that kind of thing. If you look at your network connection with a scanner such as Wireshark, you will see scans going on all the time. If you had a vulnerable service, someone would find it. They don't care who you are, they just want a computer to co-opt into a botnet. The fact that some particular person knows which is your computer makes little difference, except that they might be able to try passwords based on your public profile, in the unlikely event that you were running an SSH server with your dog's name as your password.
