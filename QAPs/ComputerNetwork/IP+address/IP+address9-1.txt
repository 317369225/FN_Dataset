â˜…Which IP addresses are special?For example 127.0.0.1
The other answers here get to the crux of the question, and they're all factually correct! In addition to this, there was a really interesting paper published at the Internet Measurement Conference in Melbourne, November 2010: "Internet Background Radiation Revisited", http://conferences.sigcomm.org/i... The paper identifies "hot spots" in parts of the address blocks they tested, and quantify just how much traffic these hot spots attract. For example, 1.1.1.0/24 is one such hot spot, and will likely never be allocated to any network. Others are byte order problems: 1.1.168.0/24, for example, is a hot spot generated by code not calling htonl() on 192.168.1.1, a private local address. The paper is a really interesting read; highly recommended.
