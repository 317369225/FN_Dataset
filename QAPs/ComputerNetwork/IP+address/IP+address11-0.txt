â˜…Does Quora ever ban IP addresses?I've noticed at least one particularly persistent troll who uses more than a few sock puppet identities. His first user account appears to have been banned. Considering that he's gotten around that, would Quora ever ban the IP address he uses?
Probably not. Banning IP addresses will not solve this problem. In many places, people's access to the Internet through an ISP is through DSL and through dynamic IP addresses. This means that every time the router in the building is reset, a different IP address could be assigned to it. Therefore there is a high likelihood that the same person will access Quora from different IP addresses on each subsequent visit.
