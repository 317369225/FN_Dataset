★Can't a CNAME point to an IP address?
No, a CNAME RR cannot "point" (or contain as its data) an IP Address, because it is defined that way in the standards that specify the data formats and protocols of the Domain Name System (DNS). In the Internet conception of the computing universe, a host computer has one name, and one name only: its canonical name. That was true for the old HOSTS.TXT file distributed from SRI-NIC before the DNS, and it's true for the DNS, too. In the DNS, that one name is where you're expected to put the host's A, MX, HINFO, LOC and other Resource Records (RR). A CNAME record is saying "this name inquiry which gave you back a CNAME RR is a pointer to the Canonical NAME (CNAME) of the host you're looking for." This is also why a CNAME record is not allowed to exist alongside any other RR type for a given name. For example, when I ran Internet Infrastructure at Apple (company), the host computer "apple.com" was a DEC VAX-8650 sitting in the Mariani One machine room, and that domain name had an A record, MX records, NS records (since it was also the name of the zone), a LOC (Latitude/Longitude coordinates) record, an HINFO record, and so on. There were also some CNAME records for it, including IIRC "ntp.apple.com", e.g. 1

 apple.com. IN A 130.43.2.2 apple.com. IN HINFO VAX-8650 Unix apple.com. IN MX 10 apple.com. apple.com. IN MX 20 colossus.apple.com. ;  secondary MX ntp.apple.com. IN CNAME apple.com. (I omitted the NS and SOA records for clarity) If you were to do a PTR record lookup for 2.2.43.130.IN-ADDR.ARPA. you would get back the name "apple.com", as you should.
