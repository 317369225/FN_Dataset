â˜…Why do we need domain name if IP address does the same thing?I was asked this question and I replied "To make life easy it is easy to remember names than huge set of random no's" what could be better technical reply
The use of domain names makes it possible for people to locate a website or other Internet resources using a human readable and memorable format instead of typing in a string of numerical addresses like 74.125.225.133. Using domain names aids in branding ourselves online and makes online visibility easy. Just imagine if all the sites we visit used IP adresses. If you forget the IP Adrress, how would you search for that site.
