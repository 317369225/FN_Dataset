★How are IP addresses decided for various ports?Like the Ethernet and Serial ports for a router.
IP addresses and port numbers are totally unrelated.  i.e., They have no connection whatsoever.  IP addresses are assigned by ICANN depending on region and then sub-assigned by various countries and sub-sub-assigned by ISPs within those countries.  People who try to be smartasses and think they can override those assignments cause all sorts of network headaches for network managers. Common ports are registered with IANA and it's usually a bad idea to use them for anything else but their intended purpose but there is no reason why someone cannot override them for another purpose, such as for security by confusion (e.g., using the telnet port for https instead).   Or use a port not specifically listed in the file /etc/services (on most Unixen) for some other purpose.  Of course, if their use conflicts with something else, it becomes a headache for whomever is administrating the machine.
