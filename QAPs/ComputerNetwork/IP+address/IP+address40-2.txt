★Can you find someone's IP address from an email?If I sends someone an email from a yahoo/hotmail/google account, can they easily find out what my IP address is?  How?  And if doesn't give exact IP address, will it definitely tell them what sate I'm in? If I go on business to another state and send an email, does my IP address change? Or can they at least tell wheat state I'm in?  Thanks!
open the msg in your inbox click the revert triangle in that message and click show original if you have gmail  or view full header if you have a yahoo account. It shows the ip address of the sender . check it with ip-details.com to know the details of the ip address
