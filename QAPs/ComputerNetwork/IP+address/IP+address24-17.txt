â˜…Why do we need domain name if IP address does the same thing?I was asked this question and I replied "To make life easy it is easy to remember names than huge set of random no's" what could be better technical reply
An another advantage of domain is we can map multiple ip numbers (usually means multiple servers) to one domain. Google, for instance, you can access the nearest server using the domain www.google.com no matter where you are. But without domain, you need to know the specific IP of the nearest server to access it, otherwise you can only access the one you remembered and it may be out of distance in some circumstance, such as you're on a business trip to Aisa and you only remember the IP of the server in US.
