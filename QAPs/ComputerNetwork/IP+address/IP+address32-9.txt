â˜…Can one track my real IP address when I use VPNs?
To add to @William-Emmanuel-Yu's answer, while the traffic is secure, nothing keeps VPN providers from storing information about you. They can log your IP address for any requests they make on your behalf. They can surf the web for you using their own IP addresses but won't use the IP address you used to connect to them. So, assuming there are no flaws with the VPN implementation, if someone can get a hold of the VPN provider's logs (and it has happened before through a subpoena), they can still connect the dots back to you, assuming you did something wrong. I am not saying it is easy to do connect those dots (they might have to identify traffic patterns from your browsing, assuming they get your IP address and it isn't dynamically assigned), but it is possible. VPN providers typically service many clients and different providers required more or less information about their clients. Being able to choose a provider which requires as little information about you and goes to great lengths to not keep logs or trails go a long way to ensuring you can't be tracked, much more than flaws in the VPN implementation.
