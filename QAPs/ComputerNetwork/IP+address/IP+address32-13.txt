★Can one track my real IP address when I use VPNs?
The original H.323 (video conferencing standard) pre-dated wide use of NAT, so it didn't work over NAT because it used the program, not the IP stack to identify the return path.  Say your VC system was 192.168.1.10 and NATed to 100.1.1.100, the H.323 would require that the handshake create the pipe from the remote end back to 192.168.1.10, which wouldn't work.  People first broke the protocol to work over NAT, then updated the protocol to allow NAT. There's no reason the computer on the other end couldn't ask for your local IP, your gateway IP, do CSS (cross-site scripting) to another site controlled by the same people trying to get more information about you. What the government does is to get the final IP you came into the system on, then go back from there.  The logs (if any) for the VPN services you use can be used to track you back to the original IP for that connection.  It's time consuming, and usually a dead end, many VPN services don't keep logs for that reason.  They can't destroy them if they make them, but they can choose to not make them in the first place, and can't be compelled to provide what they don't have. It's hard, but not impossible to completely hide where you are doing anything from, but most of them are illegal.  Compromise a server in the middle that has no connection to you, and use it as a proxy.  Or hire a sketchy proxy in a foreign country to bounce things off of.  The Russian mob servers don't comply with FBI requests.  But then, you are paying the Russian mob for a service, which I recommend against, but the mob takes Visa.
