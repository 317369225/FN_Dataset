â˜…Can one track my real IP address when I use VPNs?
VPN is not a single protocol but generic name for technology that allows you to join a private network without being physically present in the network. Thus "Virtual" private network. Thus first ting to know is that when you say "VPN" you are talking about a large number of technologies and not a single technology or protocol. So whether your IP address can be traced or not is largely dependent upon what technology you use. For example if you use : Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol : Then not only your IP address be tracked but also it is not difficult to crack the communication and snoop it. If you use IPsec then it is not possible to track your IP address, outside your ISP network. This is because the service provider will encapsulate the IP packet inside IPSec packet. On the other hand if you use Transport Layer Security based VPN techniques, it is possible to track your IP address without being able to snoop your data easily. The encryption is quite solid. In last several years, owing to the problems and costs of IPSec VPN, TLS based VPN has been quite common. And you are most likely to be using a TLS VPN.
