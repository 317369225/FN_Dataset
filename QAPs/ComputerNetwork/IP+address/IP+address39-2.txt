â˜…How do I find out ISP from an IP address?
What do you mean by ISP? Are you referring to a trading brand name or the AS Number for the ISP? If the latter then the easiest way is probably to query the IP address against a database like the Team Cymru IP to ASN Mapping Database: IP to ASN Mapping You can also achieve something similar by directly querying the RIRs' whois databases or services like RISwhois: RIPE Network Coordination Centre but they will probably involve a little more work on your part. Whichever option you chose you should let the operators of the services know your intended use in advance in case your use would lead to capacity problems.
