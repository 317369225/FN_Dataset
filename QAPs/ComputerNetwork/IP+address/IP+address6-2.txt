★IP Addresses: What are C-Blocks?I was reading up on the SEO Moz Search Engine Ranking Factors report for 2011 (http://www.seomoz.org/article/se...) and keep running across the term C-Block. I've done a bit of searching on Google, but can't really find any description in layman's terms.
An IP consist of 4 parts AAA.BBB.CCC.xxx – the first part is called A-class, the second part B-class and the third part C-class. So any IP under the last part will be in the same C-class. So for example: 123.123.123.1 and 123.123.123.2 are in the same C-class but 123.123.123.1 and 123.123.124.1 is in two different C-classes and heres a good article to help further http://www.redmudmedia.com/2011/...
