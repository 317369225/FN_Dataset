â˜…What are some famous IP addresses?IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) are a foundational aspect to modern networking and the Internet, but they don't get much recognition. I've seen the story behind 4.2.2.2: The Story Behind a DNS Legend, but I was wondering if there are any other interesting IP addresses out there.
localhost or 127.0.0.1 In computer networking, localhost means this computer. It is a hostname that the computer's software and users may employ to access the computer's own network services via its loopback network interface. On most computer systems, localhost resolves to the address 127.0.0.1, which is the most-commonly used IPv4 loopback address. The local loopback mechanism is useful for programmers to test software during development independent of any networking configurations. If a computer has been configured to provide a website, directing its web browser to http://localhost may display its home page. Using the loopback interface bypasses local network interface hardware. The name is also a reserved top-level domain name (cf. .localhost), set aside to avoid confusion with the narrower definition as a hostname and the registrars of many second-level domains also prevent registration.The IPv6 equivalent of "localhost" is ::1, or 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001
