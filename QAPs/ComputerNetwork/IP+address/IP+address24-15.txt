★Why do we need domain name if IP address does the same thing?I was asked this question and I replied "To make life easy it is easy to remember names than huge set of random no's" what could be better technical reply
I like the idea that we could have to remember all the IP addresses..like we used to do with phone numbers. Domain name are good for branding and it's easy to remember. One of the good reason to have both of them is to split the ownership of a website. Imagine you are a company, you can own your own domain and use subcontractors to host your server. In case the subcontractor doesn't respect its contract you still have control on your domain, which is your company image and reputation. You can still redirect  your brand to a new website.
