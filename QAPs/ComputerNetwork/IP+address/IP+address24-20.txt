â˜…Why do we need domain name if IP address does the same thing?I was asked this question and I replied "To make life easy it is easy to remember names than huge set of random no's" what could be better technical reply
DNS serves more purposes than just returning IP address corresponding to domain name. If you are a big company like Google, you may have more than one server that can handle user request. Now DNS server can load-balance the traffic to each server by simply using round-robin technique. Also, if your server is down for some reason you can still host your website on some other IP address without letting the end-user know such thing even happened.
