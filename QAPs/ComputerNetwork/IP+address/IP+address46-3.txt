â˜…How are IP addresses decided for various ports?Like the Ethernet and Serial ports for a router.
The question is not phrased correctly. This is a wild wild guess but are you asking "if we can only listen on a certain IP address for a given port number?" If so yes. If you have two IP addresses on your local machine and you want to be able to accept new connections on only one IP address for port 80 then you can definitely do so.
