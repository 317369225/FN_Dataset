â˜…Why do we need domain name if IP address does the same thing?I was asked this question and I replied "To make life easy it is easy to remember names than huge set of random no's" what could be better technical reply
It doesn't dothe same thing. The domain name identifies a function, the IP address a computer. It is liked the difference between "the duty officer" and "Joe Soap". Joe may be the duty officer at the moment, but he may go,off duty or be transferred. Referring to a DNS name will get you to whichever computer or computers is the one set up,to a do a job today. Referring to theIP address will get the computer doing that job whenever you wrote it down - which might have been years ago.
