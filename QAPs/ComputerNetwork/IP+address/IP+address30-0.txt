★How accurate is IP address geolocation for people visiting your site?A lot of sites use IP address geolocation to determine what city a user is in for the purpose of showing that user relevant content? I know that HTML5 geolocation is very accurate, however I want to know how accurate current IP address geolocation methods are? Can I locate users by city? Can I locate users by neighborhood for larger cities?
Maxmind offers 2 products, one with 99.5% accuracy (free) and one with 99.8% accuracy (around $300).  So the answer is most definitely "accurate." Is your question "how frequently is ip-based geolocation 'accurate' (versus 'inaccurate')" or is it "In general, how close will my person be to the location I am told?" There are ways users can hide from ip-based geocoders (eg, by proxying requests), but this is the exception, not the rule. Maxmind also offers a database of confidence ratings for its IP geo-location. http://www.maxmind.com/app/accuracy  ----- Help keep me caffeinated! http://bit.ly/9scckC
