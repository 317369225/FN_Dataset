★Why do we need domain name if IP address does the same thing?I was asked this question and I replied "To make life easy it is easy to remember names than huge set of random no's" what could be better technical reply
personally i think the answer can be found at http://[2a00:1450:4003:807::200e] | but i must admit it, it is not a real answer. I have found an interesting page at http://[2600:2001:0:3::106]/dns-why-its-important-how-it-works/ It was really helpful.  http://[2600:2001:0:3::106] is definitely a good site. Not to mention that in IPv4 it can be accessed through http://134.0.76.51 funny that http://[2600:2001:0:3::106]/dns-why-its-important-how-it-works/ can be also accessed through http://134.0.76.51/dns-why-its-important-how-it-works/ as there is no link between them ! :)) You can copy paste those url in your browser, if you have an IPV6 access and/or IPv4 access
