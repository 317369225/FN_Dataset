★How can I exclude external traffic from Google Analytics without an IP address?I want to exclude my current clients as traffic to my site which they use daily. Their are over 200 so filtering their IP addresses is not practical.
You could create a User Defined variable (perhaps called LoggedIn) which would cookie the user once they log in to your website.  Inside Google Analytics, you could create an Advanced Segment that contains everything but those that are logged in.  This way, you would be tracking all of your traffic (client and otherwise) and have a quick way to filter it out using Google Analytics.
