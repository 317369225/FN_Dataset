★Can you find someone's IP address from an email?If I sends someone an email from a yahoo/hotmail/google account, can they easily find out what my IP address is?  How?  And if doesn't give exact IP address, will it definitely tell them what sate I'm in? If I go on business to another state and send an email, does my IP address change? Or can they at least tell wheat state I'm in?  Thanks!
As stated before, you are at least able to find out the mail server that the user connected to. But in most cases, you can also find out the IP address of the user itself. If the user produced the mail with an Email program that uses the SMTP protocol for delivering the message, the user's machine is the first mail server. If the user uses a web mailer, many web mailers note an …"received from <IP address> with HTTP…" or something similar before the first mail server. Only if the user is on a corporate mail system (like Microsoft Exchange), all you see is the corporate mail server.   After browsing thru the headers of a few messages in my inbox, it seems that yahoo puts the client's IP address in the mail header, hotmail and gmail don't.
