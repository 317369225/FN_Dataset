â˜…IP Addresses: What are C-Blocks?I was reading up on the SEO Moz Search Engine Ranking Factors report for 2011 (http://www.seomoz.org/article/se...) and keep running across the term C-Block. I've done a bit of searching on Google, but can't really find any description in layman's terms.
Essentially a C-Block is all addresses starting with the same 3 numbers, e.g. 1.2.3.X . IP addresses were previously assigned in 3 types of blocks which were A:2**24, B:2**16 and C:2**8 addresses respectively. Even though address assignments can be done with other ranges nowadays, it is still a good assumption that a class C address range belongs to a specific company.
