â˜…What can you learn from someone's IP address?
An IP Address can show where in the Internet topology (routing system) you are attached, relative to other IP networks. If used as a key into databases, whatever information associated with that address can be retrieved also, e.g. location, if that address is associated with a given geography in a location mapping database. name & address & billing info, if in an Internet Service Provider customer assignment database. mobile network carrier, if the address is associated with a mobile IP network. web browsing history, if your ISP engages in Deep Packet Inspection and records URLs seen in unencrypted HTTP; see my answer to Of the things that I do on the Internet, what can my ISP see? anything else recorded in a database keyed with IP addresses. An IP address by itself is not very interesting.
