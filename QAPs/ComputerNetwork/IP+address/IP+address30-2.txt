★How accurate is IP address geolocation for people visiting your site?A lot of sites use IP address geolocation to determine what city a user is in for the purpose of showing that user relevant content? I know that HTML5 geolocation is very accurate, however I want to know how accurate current IP address geolocation methods are? Can I locate users by city? Can I locate users by neighborhood for larger cities?
Generally for city accuracy, Digital Element's NetAcuity Edge data is close to 98-99% at a city level.   Edge has the ability to target users down to a postal code world wide with a high degree of accuracy (so you can target neighborhoods within cities), and is used by nearly all major ad networks and large portals for geo-targeting. http://www.digitalelement.com/ou...
