★If you could remove one thing from the Internet forever, what would it be?
Cyber bullying. When the future masses look back on our plot in history,  think that the internet will be looked at as one of the seminal inventions and creations of our time. We can find out just about anything we could want to know at the click of a button or a submission on Google. We can connect with people from across the globe. We can point to events like flash mobs and the Arab Spring formed on social media and recognize the internet as the impetus for real life movements. Sadly, we can also point to suicide and death as real life consequences of cyber bullying. I'm 22 and not that far removed from high school and my own personal bullying stories. Cyber bullying was in its early infancy at the time. Now, there are growing numbers of social media sites, users, and bullies enough to make one's head spin. When I was bullied, home was a safe have and the internet was a tool for research and growth. There could be connections made to real friends and a gap between my bullies and I. Now, that gap has been bridged and it is the victims who pay the price for this growth.
