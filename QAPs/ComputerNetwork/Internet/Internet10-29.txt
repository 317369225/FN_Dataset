â˜…Is the Internet spoiling young children?
I asked my little cousin this and this is what he replied, although making me swear to never tell anyone ever, I think strangers are fine. I am paraphrasing, though The Internet gave me freedom in times, it gives me ways to escape boring reality. Though it has scarred me mentally, (he's one of the poor kids who searched up cartoontube and found something you never want to see), it has also made me connect to other people, given me ways to meet more people, and given me fun ways to talk to people. It goes on for a bit longer, but I don't remember much anymore.
