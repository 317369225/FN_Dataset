â˜…Is the Internet spoiling young children?
Not watching what they are doing is a no no. They should be able to function without a computer or the internet. They should have to research things in other ways too. I think some of the spoiling is the parents buying electronics that cost alot, just to fit in with some other people. They may feel embarassed that their kid doesn't have what so an so has, or their kid won't be as educated without the expensive one.
