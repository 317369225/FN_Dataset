â˜…What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
A couple well placed taps with a hammer and a lot of luck might do the trick. Doesn't Matthew 10:34 say, "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a hammer"? No? Well, maybe the hammer wouldn't work anyway. But a hammer seems more appropriate than a sword for a carpenter.
