â˜…Is the Internet spoiling young children?
It's interesting how people always feel the need to view things as inherently good or inherently bad, when reality is always blind. It's not necessarily ruining kids, and it's not necessarily unilaterally beneficial. It's definitely not what humans are used to. Biologically and neurologically it's something new to react to. The truth is, we really can't know how it's going to affect kids right now growing up with it long term. There are some positive aspects: less misinformation, I think decreased attention span as a con is a myth, easier communication with a wide range of people, exposure to different cultures and ideas etc. And there are some negative aspects that we may not know yet, like the potential for long term, crippling addiction, and how laws and the market will react to that, among many other potential issues such as safety online. It's just not a one way or the other sort of thing.
