â˜…What are the hottest startups in India?
This post appears to have been used by founders to plug their startups. As opportunistic as that is, I'm not sure it actually answers the question. What do you define as a start up? Pre-revenue? Under 2 years old? Seed funded but pre-series A? Or is FlipKart a startup in your opinion? In mine, it is. And what a great example of execution, not just in India but globally. Just Dial, Info Edge and MakeMyTrip all have billion dollar valuations. These are examples of great, young, ambitious Indian companies. Freshdesk are an awesome startup. Frrole have created some smart tech. This Video messaging startup are making a ton of noise even before they have their product out. And this Online Payment Gateway for mobile are ones to watch. Just my two pennies worth.
