â˜…What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
I liked the Lynx text browser which I used on my text-only Dell laptop back in 1992 and 1993 (It did actually do GUI, but only very slowly). It was fast and I didn't get distracted by stupid visuals. I'd love to see Quora on Lynx for instance. I also used to have an MCI mail email account that came free with my phone plan. That was great because it had a free dial-up number, so I didn't have to subscribe to AOL to get my email. It would download all my emails into one single giant text file that I would read through, which was a little inconvenient, but I didn't get that many emails back then. That was through about 1996 or 1997.
