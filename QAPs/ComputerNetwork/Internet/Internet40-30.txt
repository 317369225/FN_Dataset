â˜…Who will be the leading companies of the Internet of Things?Everything relating to the ethos of connecting the worlds devices to the web makes sense. I wonder in what timeframe it will play out? And who will be the leaders of this wave of technology.
The two main money makers with IoT are end-to-end integration and Data Intelligence. As such, I believe the following companies to show the road for others to follow. GE and Philips in the Healthcare Industry, IBM in Smart Cities, and Tieto in Intelligent (Public) Transport. All have a significant track record and proven back-office integration solutions.
