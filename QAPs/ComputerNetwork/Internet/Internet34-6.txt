â˜…Can I use the internet to save my mom, who suffers from Stage IV cancer?
You can use tools in today's technology to better care for patients. Back when I was dealing with a medical condition, I couldn't even look at my medical records, not to mention find any of them when asked by my doctor. Luckily enough, I had my partner do it for me, but looking for a better tool to manage medical records, I started Hello Doctor (http://goo.gl/04cCtE) to help you organize and understand your medical records on your mobile. Had I had such a tool when dealing with my medical condition, I'm sure it could have helped me and reduce a lot of stress and lack of control in my process. Make sure your information is always accessible on a mobile device so you always have answers to give your doctors when needed, and make sure everything is backed up!
