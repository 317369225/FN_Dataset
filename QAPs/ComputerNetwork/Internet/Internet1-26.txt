★What will the Internet look like in 2020?I'd like as many different descriptions of what the usage, adoption and structure of the Internet will look like in the year 2020 as possible. Be creative, and try to think outside the box how it will change in the next seven years. Let's see what the current early adopters of the Internet come up with (since we're all using Quora...).
Today the internet is an excellent tool for communicating, researching things, entertaining ourselves, shopping & creating.  In 2020 it will also be a better tool for controlling & automating day-to-day things in our lives. One aspect of this is that electrical devices that currently have their own, often confusing, user interfaces (e.g. my Siemens oven, my washing machine...) will all present more intuitive internet based UIs.  The user benefits of this will be greater simplicity and more power (e.g. really remote control; or the ability to programme your home so that when you go to bed you can press one button to power everything down, turn on the alarm, turn down the thermostat, close the blinds etc.). Devices will also become simpler, cheaper, more eco-friendly as they will be able to ship without 'hardware' user controls. Another aspect is that internet services which currently use the www's document & form metaphor will present alternative interfaces that are better optimised for getting tasks completed. One alternative might be conversational interfaces, which you can use through text or voice... So rather than browsing 14 web pages to, say, buy a train ticket, you could have a 20 second conversation with an intelligent agent via a chat interface and get everything sorted.
