★When will China join the rest of the world on the real Internet?
I am from Hong Kong where is identified by Chinese government as the helm of 'One counry and two system' that will be lasted for 50 years from the handover of its sovereignty in 1997.  Other than Hong kong's strengths on financial and legel systems, its high level of human rights and freedom of speech are utmost  treasure to Hongkongers and all Chinese people on the mainland.  Therefore, there are a lot of politics-sensetive reports about the Chinese communist and its government which are banned from broadcasting and propagating by all means on the mainland, but it is not the case to Hong Kong.  So that, not only the Internet being selectively censored, so does any mean that is assumed to be overspreaded to the public in general.  As the number of Internt users in China is the largest in the world and keeping on increasing exponentially, the Chinese government is seriously worried about any widespread discussion, insights, expression or thoughts from the dissents that is come out of control from the government.  Therefore, the western social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and etc, that are definitely the threat to the Chinese governmen.  So the time to reach the openness of all social media platforms without restrictions, it is definitely far far beyond I can anticipate in the foreseeable future.
