★Who are the best internet marketers?
I'll define "best" by including things like surface area (do they know more than one skill eg not just a pure SEO tactician), size of products they've worked on, competitiveness of the industry, thoughtfulness on the industry, and results. In general I include internet marketing to encompass these areas: SEO PPC (adwords) Social media (organic and paid usage of Facebook and Twitter) Homegrown websites or blogging Email marketing Platform leverage/widgets/distribution Mobile distribution (paid installs etc) A/B testing and product optimization Familiarity in driving virality whether it is through awesome infographics or social media The people I would rank as the best internet marketers I know: Alex Schultz  - (built the internet marketing team at Facebook, heavy influence on user growth products at Facebook, did direct acquisition marketing at eBay for several years, has grown his own blogs/personal sites to 300,000+ uniques/month, highly technical and data driven) Rand Fishkin - built the top resource for SEO knowledge and tools on the web, can go deeper on SEO than anyone, has grown SEOmoz utilizing a mix of internet marketing tactics including social, blogging, email marketing, etc. This guy has to be included on the list. Dennis Goedegebuure - I think he has more than a decade of IM experience and ran large swaths of internet marketing teams at eBay. The guy clearly knows SEO/PPC/conversion rate optimization at major scale. I'm sure there are all sorts of skills he has that I've never even heard of either.
