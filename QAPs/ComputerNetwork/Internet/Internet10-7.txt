★Is the Internet spoiling young children?
Did the car spoil young children ?  Did movies ? Did television ? Did the invention of Coca Cola ? The computer ? The video game ? No 'tool' ever spoiled anything, its effects are governed by how we use it and how we manage the positive and negative impacts.  Children need a secure, loving, nurturing environment.  The rest is contextual.  And you know what ? Some children do great things even if they don't have this start in life. What spoils children is an environment that builds their sense of entitlement, that dampens curiosity, that teaches them that material possessions define them as people, that suggests there are shortcuts to anything worth having, that promotes 'fame' as a life goal, that makes them think their own needs supercede any other individual or group need.  The internet has nothing to do with it.
