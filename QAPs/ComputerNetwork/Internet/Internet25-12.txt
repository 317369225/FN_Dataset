â˜…Are relationships on the Internet really real?Without any sound, facial expressions, or any kind actual, physical human interaction beyond sending lines of text to one another, words which one can edit and second guess prior to sending, are human relationships over the internet really human or are they actually superficial and fake to some degree?
I think it completely depends on how theses virtual relationships were established. If they were built based off common interests (dating, hobbies, activities or lifestyles) at a reliable virtual realm, i.e. Quora, LinkedIn etc. I think it can lead to just a real of a relationship or friendship as if you were to have encountered them in the real world. On the contrary, encounters based off random solicitations through only online interactions via okcupid, plentyoffish, random chat rooms etc, with no expectations to ever carry that relationship beyond the virtual world, are as real and reliable as however your better judgement will allow them to be.
