★What is the scariest thing you have experienced on the Internet?
The scariest thing that I have experienced was the malware that infected my system .I was trying to watch a movie online and this page comes up looking very genuine 'Notice from Metropolitan police UK :You have been found guilty of attempting to access illegal content and your system ip has been locked till further notice. Pay fine online and contact your nearest police station'  My system  stopped working and the page wouldn't go.I got really scared for like 10 mins and being an immigrant started imagining the impact all the way through,but the 'make payment online'part made it all look dubious :-)  Looked up on Google from other machine and it was a common malware propagated through Europe:-)  ..Had a good laugh later.
