★What innate traits do great Internet product leaders share?If you were setting up a program to train user-focused Internet product leaders/creators, what are the traits you'd look for in candidates that can't be easily taught?
Intellectual Curiosity.  You are driven to figure things out, find out why, and find out how to do things better. By far, this is the most intrinsic attribute that supersedes all other attributes to provide the desire to drive learning. This improves product beyond the status quo in all aspects (Leadership, Design, Strategy, Development, Management, Technology, Innovation, etc). It's the meta-requirement for product/customer improvement.
