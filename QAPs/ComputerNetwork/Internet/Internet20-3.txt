★The Internet: What is missing on the Internet?What service / site  do you think is missing on the web today?
The Internet or the web? Which do you mean? They are not the same thing. To answer some of the others, there are identity services but not everyone uses them, there are also password management services. People being mean and rude is unfortunate but not something that can be easilyrics fixed. To some extent it is because of the nature of the medium but I have also seen it become more prevalent offline. Security and privacy services also exist, but again aren't used as much as they could be. To be fair this question does sound a bit like "Invent my business for me" but then if I could make an idea into a business and hadn't then perhaps giving someone else the concept would mean that there was a business that I would later use. As for the actual question, I would like to see less commercialism... I know it isn't answering the question directly but we are deluged with ads and spam, never mind the less honest attempts to get our money (phishing, scam emails,...)
