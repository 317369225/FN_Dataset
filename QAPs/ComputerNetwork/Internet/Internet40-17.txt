â˜…Who will be the leading companies of the Internet of Things?Everything relating to the ethos of connecting the worlds devices to the web makes sense. I wonder in what timeframe it will play out? And who will be the leaders of this wave of technology.
Iot is very broad and it covers so many categories that can be very hard to say who is going to be THE big player in the field. There is one big trend that is clearly emerging: more and more start-ups, thanks to 3D printers, laser cutters and fast prototyping tools are now able to develop products that would have been impossible to develop without an R&D department up until few years ago. You can find many interesting start-ups at Homepage - Unbits most of them come from Crowdfunding, which is now becoming the main 'booster' for these kind of products. I am very interested to see where all this revolution goes!
