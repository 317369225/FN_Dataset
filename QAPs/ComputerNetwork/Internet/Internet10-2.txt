â˜…Is the Internet spoiling young children?
You want to know what's spoiling young children? Rock'n'roll music. The devil's music, I say. No, wait, I meant television. Kids are watching TV all the time, and God knows it can't be good for them. What could you possibly gain from TV? No, wait, I meant swing music. Swing music is ruining our children, they're dancing around and saying words like swell that don't even sound like English. Can't be tolerated. No, wait, I meant fiction novels. What do you learn from fiction? Obviously nothing about the real world. Kids need nonfiction. No, wait, I meant modern art. No, wait, I meant modern philosophy. No, wait, I meant the theory of evolution. No, wait, I meant unarranged marriages. No, wait, I meant anything that has changed between any given two generations.
