â˜…What innate traits do great Internet product leaders share?If you were setting up a program to train user-focused Internet product leaders/creators, what are the traits you'd look for in candidates that can't be easily taught?
I think objectivity is a very important trait. Often entrepreneurs and product managers are emotionally invested in the products and features that they create and find it difficult to face the facts when data coming in from the field runs against their intution.
