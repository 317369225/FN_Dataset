★Is the Internet spoiling young children?
If I were to answer this question 5 years ago, I would have adamantly said yes, the internet is spoiling young children, and not only is it spoiling young children but its spoiling adults also.  It may be spoiling our human way of life. However, today is a different day than 5 years ago.  Today I feel differently. I believe that the internet has a wealth of knowledge. The internet also has a wealth of trash, but in the wealth of trash and knowledge, is the task to discern between the trash and knowledge and decide which is which.  While the internet may allow or cause us to sit sedentary in front of a screen that is probably not good for our eyes, it now gives us this choice.  We as humans now have the choice to recognize a human experience and chose between the two.  It is possible that the internet has allowed us the ability to have a greater awareness of the human experience.  It could be easy to sit on the internet all day, surf the web and even communicate with others on the web, but communication via the web will never be as satisfying as communication in person: human v human.  We now have the awareness of this difference. We can now be more aware of the difference of a human experience virtually verses in reality.  The internet is a form of teaching all in its own.  The internet may have granted us the best gift ever.
