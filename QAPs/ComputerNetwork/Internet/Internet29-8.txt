â˜…What's it like to work for Rocket Internet?I've noticed they've been hiring alot recently, especially within the U.S. I was wondering if anyone has had experience working there. What is their reputation within the industry?
Your experience at rocket is directly proportional to the venture you join. Their model of aping products from the west and launching them with a set guideline, leaves scope for only executional brilliance. The other big draw back I felt while working there for a year was that the Co-Founders are salaried employees. They don't really own the business. And in some cases, the accountability shows.
