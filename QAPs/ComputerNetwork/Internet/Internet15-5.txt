â˜…What consumer Internet companies had a large number of users but failed to monetize?How large were the companies, and how did their monetization strategies fail? I'm specifically interested in revenues, rather than profit. E.g., YouTube had lots of users and revenues, but minimal profits. I'm interested in lots of users and minimal revenues.
If we're talking <10m revenue and no real viable business model (not just no profit), then the field is smaller, but there are still many contenders: Instagram: Millions of users, no revenue. Remains to be seen if Facebook can combine it with their users' data streams to monetize Blue mountain arts (someone else mentioned earlier): Popular online greetings cards, bought by @home for $900m, no business model. sexquotes.com: Popular because it combined porn with the mid-90s craze in stock quotes... and yet still a loser Pointcast: streamed info onto your screen when you weren't looking at it (screen saver). Multicasting stuff like this was supposed to be the future of the Internet, per Wired et al at the time. Napster (perhaps most famously): facilitated mass copyright violation for free. When the company was going down tried to monetize user base and failed. Any of the 1990s digital money start-ups: Cybercash et al, though questionable if they had lots of users. Webvan: Very popular where they operated. They did have revenue, though arguably never a viable model -- expenses were vastly greater than revenues throughout its brief life. NetZero and other free dial-up Internet providers: Ad models never exceeded cost of service, never mind made a profit.
