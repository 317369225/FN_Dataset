★What are the real-life equivalents of "Trolling on the Internet" ?
The most notable example is, of course, Candid Camera (and the spate of take-it-up-a-notch programs that arose from this culture, like the Tom Green Show, Punk'd, etc.). It's an entire business model built on: Creating situations just to elicit an outraged/upset/confused reaction from an unsuspecting person Documenting and sharing the results among an in-the-know community Getting fame/an audience and satisfaction from the lulz. Incidentally: Candid Camera goes back to 1948 -- and it was precede by Candid Microphone (on the radio) in 1947. Trolling certainly isn't anything new: We see this same pattern of cultures lauding and villifying the collection of lulz pretty much all over history: in the 15th century, we've got monks faking "magic" tricks (hiding beetles in apples, and faking water-to-wine conversions) just to get lulz.  In African storytelling, we've got Anansi trolling Tiger and all the animals -- usually by making outrageous comments that get the animals enraged (with predictable and hilarious results). In the ancient Norse tradition, you've got Loki trolling ... everyone ... telling outrageous lies often merely for the sake of stirring up trouble.  Trolling is a matter of understanding human nature, understanding how to elicit rage -- and taking advantage of this pattern for known results/and laughs.  While the word for it is new, the practice is as old as the human race ... long pre-dating the Internet.
