★What is the Internet of Things?
"The Internet of Things" has finally been scaling dramatically. It's interesting to see how people are coming to define it.  To me, the "Internet of Things" is all about connecting everyday devices with people, in order to create a dedicated network for data exchange, making everyday life better and safer. For example, imagine your smoke alarm being connected to your smart phone to alert you when it goes off while you are away,  enabling you to check where each family member is to make sure they are not stuck inside and take a smart response by calling the neighbor. Or another great way to implement "The Internet of Things" into your everyday life would be to have your Evoz's baby monitor, which monitors your child's sleep, connected to your smart phone, collecting and analyzing data, which can then provide you insights into your child's sleeping habits. They are now looking to expand from this into monitoring home devices, like your fridge or washing machine.  If this sounds interesting to you, feel free to check their platform out: (Welcome to evoz!)
