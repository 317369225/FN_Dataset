★What are the real-life equivalents of "Trolling on the Internet" ?
An old college prank is to go to a grocery store as a group and slip unwanted possibly embarrassing items into the carts of certain unsuspecting shoppers.  Then you join the checkout line so you can enjoy the person's bewilderment over how the three cans of smoked squid or the tampons (if the customer is male) became part of their order.  Bonus points if the cashier is a confederate who can make a big production out of getting management help for voiding the unwanted items and maybe the whole transaction if the customer becomes irate enough.  Stupid and inconsiderate yes, but harmless.
