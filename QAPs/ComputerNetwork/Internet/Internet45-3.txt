★When will China join the rest of the world on the real Internet?
I assume you are a English speaker who was born in North America or Western Europe. I think English speakers should understand a fact that there are so many cultures existed in the world, and not all of them could be merged into English culture, and Chinese culture is an extremely different one. In history, east Asian culture is isolated with other part of the world for thousands of years, which makes communication between Chinese and Western culture so difficult. Maybe you are wondering why these stuff matter or you have known all of these. However, you may not experience how the cultural differences affect life, for example, I find Chinese Weibo, Renren and Youku are more easy to use for Chinese people than twitter, facebook and youtube, and much much more fun. Same things happen when Western companies trying to break into the market of China, simply because the cultural differences make it not so easy to analyse the needs of Chinese customers. If you want to know more about a different culture, go there and experience. Before I come to Canada, I thought social network must be fun, however, I was wrong. But I do realize a negative affect of GFW. Most of the information online is in English, and the resources in Chinese are not abundant enough,  but GFW blocks a lot so that it's harder for people in China to find useful information for work and study. So that means, for normal people in China, the internet life is the same as the normal people in English speaking country, however, for researchers, university students, (software) engineers, and others who demand more valuable information, the internet experience would not be good enough.
