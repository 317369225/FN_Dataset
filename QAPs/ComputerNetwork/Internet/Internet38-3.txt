★What are the hottest startups in India?
Patanjali Ayurved, founded by Baba Ramdev in 2007, has been generating amazing revenues in the FMCG sector, which is characterized by cut-throat competition, from companies with deep pockets like ITC, HUL, Marico etc. The growth of Patanjali can be attributed to the following: Low cost products:At Tech market ( the goto place for almost all products at IIT Kharagpur ), I bought three 200ml tetrapak apple juices. And it was neither Tropicana nor Real ! The reason being a 33% difference in cost. 3 Patanjali Apple juices were being sold for Rs 40, as opposed to Rs 60 for any other similar beverage. As per the taste and quality, though I am no connoisseur of juices, I can assure you it was pretty much the same. Distribution channels: They started out as a franchise store, with 200 dedicated outlets and now their products are available on the shelves of kirana stores, exclusive kiosks in Reliance Fresh, and with Amazon opening their new food and grocery gourmet category, you will soon be able to order your favourite "Patanjali Oats Biscuit"and instantly digest it by the "Patanjali Shatavar Churana", just by making a few clicks !! Low Marketing costs:The brand image is pretty much out there, pure and healthy, and hence the marketing investments are minimal. Almost all of the target audience is aware of the uniqueness and benefits of the products, and hence ads become unnecessary. All in all, Baba Ramdev is on road to becoming the protagonist of the new age novel, “The Monk who Bought a Ferrari” !!
