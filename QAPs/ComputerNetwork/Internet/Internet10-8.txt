The Internet also can't be tamed.. There's scary shit on there!! You can think your locking out access to bad content but guess what? YOUR KIDS GREW UP ON COMPUTERS. They are smarter than we are about the Internet. Also social media makes people self absorbed, envious, and even hateful.  internet Bullying  Is making kids kill themselves. Kids (and adults) say things on the net that they wouldn't say in real life. Also pedophiles can easy find and converse with your children.
