★What is the Internet of Things?
The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the phenomenon of everyday devices connecting to the Internet through tiny embedded sensors and computing power. The idea is that not only your computer and your smartphone can talk to each other, but also all the things around you. From connected homes and cities to connected cars and roads to devices that track an individual’s behavior and use the data collected for “push” services. There are numerous applications that will solve everyday problems and lead to new customer experiences. The fitness trackers like Fitbit and smart watches like the iWatch are some current examples of Internet of Thing devices. But quite likely, this is only the start of a connected and quantified world that will look very different in 10 years.

The post might help you make sense of this phenomenon and help explain the Internet of Things to your friends or parents...
