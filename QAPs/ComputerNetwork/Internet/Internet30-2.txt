★Will the Internet ever become obsolete?
Yes. No. Joshua Engel said it best, so I say it dumb:  depends on how you define "the internet".  If it's the very specific languages that we currently use, then most certainly.  If it's generally used to define the "globally interconnected computer network", then no. Well . . . unless there's a global catastrophe and we regress back to the dark ages.  Otherwise, we'll continue our interconnected-ness and eventually end up completely interconnected to the point where our clothing, bodies, minds and lives end up completely inseparable from this network. Calling THAT network "the internet" might be a little like calling the US's interstate highway system "some roads", but the gist is about the same:  the internet is here to stay, is taking on a life of its own and will only increase in complexity for probably the remainder of our existence.
