â˜…What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
I'm trying to think of anything different. I guess... You would think about using gopher. AOL seemed relevant, and you couldn't avoid their marketing CDs. Computers were more expensive, and more people used desktops. There was still dial-up. I used Outlook Express as a mail client, which I don't think exists anymore. PCI interfaces were pretty reliable, so long as you had a good driver. Wireless wasn't mainstream. It felt like you were missing out if you weren't involved in the boom. I liked Microsoft more and wasn't a Linux Pledge. Apple was using IBM/Motorola CPUs. More webpages you visited were just a background and text (standard HTML).
