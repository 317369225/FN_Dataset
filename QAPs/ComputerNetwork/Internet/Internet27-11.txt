★What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
The same way you'd make a friend. It's literally the same thing. 1) Use the internet to invite them for coffee. 2) Over coffee, ask them who they are. 3) Listen so as to hear and understand. 4) Invite them out again. 5) Build a healthy two-way relationship of mutual respect. 6) Over time, ask about their inner truths. 7) Listen so as to feel, without presumption or judgment. 8) When they make an argument, consider it. 9) When you make an argument, do it through a gracious way of  life. 10) Constantly affirm your appreciation for them. Mean it. 11) Be vulnerable with your own brokenness. Accept their love. 12) As you identify brokenness in their life, pour love into it. Give everything. 13) Accept this all as a wonderful opportunity, not a duty or privilege. 14) Expect only one thing from this arrangement: to have a chance to love a fellow human being. If you're looking for a step 15, you've missed the point.
