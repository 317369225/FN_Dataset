â˜…What free stuff on the internet should everyone be taking advantage of?
People should definitely get their credit score. Some people don't realize that you are allowed 1 free look at your credit score from the reporting 3 agencies per year. Quicken Loans also offers something where you can get your credit score after that. But of course they want to sell you something but you don't have to buy it to get your rating.
