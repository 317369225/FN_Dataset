â˜…Is the Internet evil?What is the one thing common to Einstein, Newton, Beethoven, Nietzsche and Alexander Fleming? Apart from an extraordinary intelligence, none of them had access to the Internet. Does that mean the Internet is an impediment to the growth of human intelligence? If yes, does that make it evil ?
Your assertion about the 'common thing' is like saying, "No one's seen me and Batman in the same room. I very well might be Batman." You ask your questions from people all across the globe - people you don't even know, yet you question the character of Internet. How and to what extent one uses a particular technology decides what role it plays in the development of mankind.
