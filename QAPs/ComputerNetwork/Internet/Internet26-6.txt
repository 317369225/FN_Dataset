â˜…How do I become a hustler?
You have to be hungry for more, but composed and not show it. You have to be relentlessly plotting until you feel sick in the head and then you continue to plot. It means getting knocked down repeatedly, trying to get up and getting knocked down on the way up again. But then you grab the guy's feet that knocked you down and sweep them to the ground. You jump on top and now maybe have gained a little of that hope that we all need to keep going. You've got a success. And it's rejuvenating. Then the guy flips you over and throws you back on your ass. And you keep going. That's what hustling is.
