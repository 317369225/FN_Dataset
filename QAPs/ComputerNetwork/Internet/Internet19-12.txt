â˜…Are internet forums dead?There seemed to be a time where everyone congregated on forums. WIth the presence of Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Quora, etc. it seems like people are no longer into forums. Does anyone still use forums for online socialization, asking questions, discussion/hobbies anymore or have internet forums been rendered redundant?
Forums are not dead. They were always pretty specialized or niche. I've been using the TOR overchan decentralized forums, which are accessible over NNTP and are on the web, and I find the discussions there highly enlightening and the quality and intelligence of the discussions there are reminiscent of early Usenet. There's still some trolling but it's interesting so see what people have to say without censorship.
