★What is the scariest thing you have experienced on the Internet?
When I was 11, Perfect Dark for the N64 was the coolest thing in the world. I played it religiously. Out of all my friends, I was the best. I was looking for more information about the game, little tricks and tips to become a better player. I logged into my parents AOL account and did and Ask Jeeves search of Perfect Dark tips. I was a fairly inexperienced internet user at the time and I found myself in a strange message board where someone claimed to have a Carrington Institute log in. Being 11, I was naturally curious. I clicked the link. I will never forget the awe I felt when that webpage slowly loaded. There it was a real website for the real Carrington Institute. I remember being so frightened as I typed in the log in information that this mysterious stranger hasd posted to that message board. The page loaded and my heart was racing.   I was logged in as an agent.   I navigated all the sections just brimming with wonder, excitement but most of all pure unadulterated terror. Finally, I stumbled onto a section called agent field reports. I decided that if the Carrington Institute was real, they were going to come after me for infiltrating their systems. I wrote an apology letter in the submit field report section. I explained that I accidentally stumbled onto a login to their secure classified server. I told them I hadn't meant to cause any problems and pleaded for my families lives. It must have worked because 13 years later, I haven't heard a word from the Carrington Institute.
