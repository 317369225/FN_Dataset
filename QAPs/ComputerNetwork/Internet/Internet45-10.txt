★When will China join the rest of the world on the real Internet?
On my view, It will not happen on this centuryIt won't happen in this century. China is a  communism a communist country, not like other country countries which will have another an opposing party to competecompete and criticize ruling party. They need a Great Fire Wall (GFW) to make sure all they their decision is completely rightfabricated as right before it reaches our people, and no other negative news about spearheads their chief leader, . Otherwise, this country will be in complete chaos. As a Chinese, I  take my I show a neutralizing attitude about towards our GFW, after all a countrys' political economy depends on culture, which is reflected by political economy in verse. However, I also over pop-out the wall sometimes to see the outside world, not to judgementjudge, but just to maintain peace of heart heart, to know what was real happen is really happening in this country.
