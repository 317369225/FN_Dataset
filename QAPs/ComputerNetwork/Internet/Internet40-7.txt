★Who will be the leading companies of the Internet of Things?Everything relating to the ethos of connecting the worlds devices to the web makes sense. I wonder in what timeframe it will play out? And who will be the leaders of this wave of technology.
Who is already the leading company in IoT? What about: Telefónica wins UK smart meter deal A lot of companies are talking about the Internet of Things. Telefonica has taken the order to connect  53 million gas and electricity meters in UK. Who is able to match this £1.5bn = USD 2,.5bn deal? With wearbles or smart home applications it will be a long run to reach USD 2,500,000,000. My personal classification of the IoT / M2M market: My first IoT M2M Cookbook - How to develop a device based on wireless modules is related to the classical SIM card business. I explain in details how to design a device up to self- made antennas to save money. My next book will an IoT M2M Cookbook again. The second book will have the subtitle "How to develop wearables and sensor networks". With the second book I will address a lot of more designers of wireless devices than with the first book. I also could write the second book about Low Power Wide Area Networks, but the number of people with interest in this topic will be much smaller. Wearbales are smart watches or wrirst bands in fitness, sport or medical and even more. Senor network you will find for e.g. at smart home and factory automation. It looks that the leader in value in one IoT deal is Telefonica. If you start with counting of devices then the leader is Samsung, because they shipped 319.9 million smartphones followed by Apple with 153.4 million. In wearables we are far away from this quanties. Anyhow if you add all sold fitness trackers, then you reach interesting numbers as well. It is easy to design a wearble today. A lot of small companies go to Kickstarter, collect some money and lauch a wearble.
