â˜…What free stuff on the internet should everyone be taking advantage of?
Gmail, Hotmail, or some other free email service. It is worth having more than one email account. For instance I have a public email address, which is my own domain name, a gmail address, and a work address; but I also have a couple of email addresses that use to sign up on random forums. Many forums are just being run by young people, and I don't fully trust their use - so I use one of my trash addresses. This allows me to recover the password if I forget, or catch messages from the account - but if I find it starts attracting spam I can simply close the account down.
