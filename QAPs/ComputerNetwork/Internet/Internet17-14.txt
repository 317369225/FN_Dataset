★Who are the best internet marketers?
Agree with Andy Johns, An individual or a company that can promote your business with SEO, PPC, Social media, external /  home blogging platform, email marketing and many other ways that suits business requirements which allow client to stay in budget limit and provide industry's standard ROI. It would be commendeble if he/she or company can provide you more than that can be the best marketer...!!!! Personally really impressed with the Neil Patel he has to be with experts names mentioned in first answer like Rand Fishkin, Alex Schultz and Dennis Goedegebuure!
