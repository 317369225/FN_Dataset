★Can I use the internet to save my mom, who suffers from Stage IV cancer?
First of all, I'm so sorry about what you and your family are going through. You haven't been doing anything wrong. You could not have possibly fixed this.  Spend the time now being present with your mother. Don't spend it beating yourself up for not being able to stop the wind. The thing about all these hope stories on the Internet is that they're usually based on anecdotal cases. Remission is capricious, and it can happen very suddenly. Often well-meaning family or friends credit the remission to whatever it was they happened to be doing right before it occurred. This is magical thinking, not hope. The Internet can help you find out about the treatment plans your doctors use. I've found it useful to look up medicine or side effects and then go back and ask questions. This is one thing you can do on the Internet for someone who is ill. The Internet can also be a huge source of support-- I found this when my daughter died. It can help you with grieving, losing, letting go. Sometimes it's easier to share that grief with strangers than with loved ones. Unfortunately, the Internet won't cure cancer or stop death. I only wish it could. I wish you and your family strength and peace in the difficult time ahead.
