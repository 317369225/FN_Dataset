â˜…If you could remove one thing from the Internet forever, what would it be?
Geographic boundaries. The internet may look like one big place but it is far from it. I come from Pakistan where the Apple AppStore doesn't have movies or all the cool books/music for me. Amazon Kindle refuses to work here. PayPal won't accept payment to or from here. Pandora won't even open. A lot of Youtube videos are "not available in your country". Many eCommerce sites don't support a Pakistani Credit Card even if it is Visa backed. These issues aren't just Pakistan-specific, the rules are different for each country. Whether it's the ridiculous EU Cookie Law, the US illegally-cease-your-DNS policy, Pakistan's arbitrary website banning etc.
