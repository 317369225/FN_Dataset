â˜…What does a bad internet connection teach you?Though a bad internet connection is a pain in the ass,it does teach you some valuable lessons.
Teaches me to greet other people around me. That we all have anger issues that could potentially pale the Hulk's in comparison. That the computer manufacturer and the internet service provider probably have some deal. I often find that the slower the internet is, the more probable it is that I will punch my monitor, resulting in my having to procure a replacement computer. That the idea that browsing the internet is the only thing in the world that is entertaining... is perhaps false. How wonderful Google is. Regardless of how slow any websites/search engines may be, I find that Google's homepage always opens quickly. Mathematics. For example, if a speed test tells me that my download speed is about 10 KB/second, I start calculating how long it will take me to download a 2 GB movie. That's about sixty hours, by the way. That reading books is a good habit too. How spoilt we are that we get so worked up for something as innocuous as a slow internet connection.
