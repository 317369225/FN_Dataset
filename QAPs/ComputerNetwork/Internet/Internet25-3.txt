★Are relationships on the Internet really real?Without any sound, facial expressions, or any kind actual, physical human interaction beyond sending lines of text to one another, words which one can edit and second guess prior to sending, are human relationships over the internet really human or are they actually superficial and fake to some degree?
Relationships exist at multiple levels: - Physical - Emotional - Mental - Spiritual In college, I had a couple of internet (and eventually phone) romantic relationships.  Although the physical is strongly missed, since it is not there, the other levels are much more intense.  The bond feels stronger, much faster (maybe too fast) than when the physical relationship is not there. Since you were not specific to romantic relationships, I work in an international company, and have build strong mental-level relationships with people whom I have never met.  When the IM turns green, that has the same effect as them coming into the office.  IMs feel like having a conversation over the cube wall.  I have built quite good friendships with these people whom I have never seen.  Of course, the relationships get stronger with those whom I am also on the phone with 5 times a day. And I have a depth of mental relationship with you people on Quora, this knowledge/idea network, that is completely different.  So, in my opinion, these are not superficial.  Only those who believe that physical is the most important would say so.
