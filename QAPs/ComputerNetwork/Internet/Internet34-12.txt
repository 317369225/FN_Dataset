â˜…Can I use the internet to save my mom, who suffers from Stage IV cancer?
What the Internet can do: Help you find others who have been there before. -- Facebook is a great place to search. Many groups, pages, collections of blogs to find information, stories, sources of solace. Sometimes merely knowing you are not alone can get you through a rough patch. There are tons of blogs by cancer patients/survivors/caregivers -- there are even caregiver networks! All things put it place for people such as yourself to use at will. -- Tools to improve her quality of life. Free apps, videos, etc that can help a person get through the day-to-day and relax. The more things you can automate/not worry about, the more time you'll have to focus on enjoying life (and helping her enjoy/extend hers). There are many tricks to get around the discomforts of treatment and disease -- try what you can and see what sticks. In short, just try your best to keep her calm and well-nourished. (this will mean different things at different times. But you are creative and resourceful, and will be able to work accordingly.) You're doing great and the world thanks you for helping out. Keep at 'em. :)
