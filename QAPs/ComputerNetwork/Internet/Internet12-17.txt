â˜…What are the real-life equivalents of "Trolling on the Internet" ?
Something like this actually happened to me very recently I was going to the restroom one day, using one of those auto-flush sensor urinals, and unbeknownst to me, somebody had subtly placed those plastic filters at the bottom so it created a ramp towards the person going number 1. So when the sensor auto-flush commenced, I ended up with a half-water, half-urine solution rushing at my general direction. I could only laugh.
