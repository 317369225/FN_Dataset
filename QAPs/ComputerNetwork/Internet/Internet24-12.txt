â˜…What does a bad internet connection teach you?Though a bad internet connection is a pain in the ass,it does teach you some valuable lessons.
That there really is a world out there full of sunshine and rainbows. A world in which a gentle breeze kisses your face instead of the icy bite of air conditioning. You can interact with other human beings, who don't Laugh Out Loud at everything you say, who don't give you a smiley face and can't silently upvote your thoughts. Reality forces you to be judged by your gender, age or race whilst the internet lets you be whoever you want to be.
