â˜…How do I become a hustler?
It's all about energy. Given a choice of two options, if you grab both, you are a hustler. There are some medieval Indian folktales about a witty character called Tenali Rama. The story goes that as a kid, a goddess appeared before him, holding a cup of milk in each hand. She offered him a choice: the milk of wealth or the milk of intelligence. Tenali grabbed and drank both before the goddess could react. Now that's hustling.
