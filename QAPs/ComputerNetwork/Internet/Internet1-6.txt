â˜…What will the Internet look like in 2020?I'd like as many different descriptions of what the usage, adoption and structure of the Internet will look like in the year 2020 as possible. Be creative, and try to think outside the box how it will change in the next seven years. Let's see what the current early adopters of the Internet come up with (since we're all using Quora...).
In 2020 the Internet will not be much different than it is today (unless of course the Government gets involved and changes everything). The Internet itself over the last 9 years has not changed that much, so why should we expect it to change a ton in the next nine years? What will change is how we interact with the Internet. Currently smart phones and tablets are essentially redefining how people view the "Internet" since a lot of information is coming down through apps. Useful information will be easier to find in the future as search engines and other information sites rework themselves to provide more useful information faster. The devices that we use to access the Internet will get smaller and thinner and you may be able to carry the Internet on a device as thin as a credit card. The Internet will also be more useful for providing information locally about local events. Eventually Internet and TV will merge together (right now companies are trying to this but the cable networks are getting in the way). They won't be able to get in the way and your TV will become much more interactive allowing you to consume the media that you want to consume when you want to consume. The "cloud" will mature and more and more information will be stored not on your hard-drive but on distance servers. As mobile bandwidth speeds there will be less and less wires.
