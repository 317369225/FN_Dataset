â˜…Is atheism a fad among Internet users?
Interesting. Suggesting atheism is a fad. On the contrary, religion is a fad. A long-lasting fad but one that will slowly but surely fade away as people begin to understand the world around them, thanks to the internet, and embrace science over hocus-pocus. Atheism is not a fad. It is an enlightenment on a scale that mankind has never seen before.
