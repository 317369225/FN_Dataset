★What innate traits do great Internet product leaders share?If you were setting up a program to train user-focused Internet product leaders/creators, what are the traits you'd look for in candidates that can't be easily taught?
A great product person will have tear in her eyes when: 1. The abstract cause finds a proven reference model where all the details nicely fall into place (reference model can come from: human behavior, physics, mathematics, anything that worked long before she was born..) 2. The model no longer matches the abstract cause 3. If 2 is true, she goes back to 1. If you are here, the model is your new cause, your new logic.  Details that do not fit the model are rejected.  She will now find time to get in love with the details, the mechanics, the people, the users, the features, the flow, the design, the pleasure.  She now feels comfortable inside the forest looking out, and outside the forest looking in.
