â˜…Is atheism a fad among Internet users?
No, Fads were a fad of 19th and 20th century. Seriously, by the same token Religion would be a street fad. What is happening on the internet is a freedom of expression best expressed by an old New Yorker double-entender cartoon: "No one knows that you are a dog on the internet" (one canine to another) The internet comes with that ability to feel safer when pubicly expressing yourself about an issue that could have consequences in the break-room. For a long tine dissenters of many stripes have not all felt entirely comfortable coming out of the closet (Matthew 6:6) The internet simply provides the necessary space to be honest. To BE honest neither Organized Theism nor A-theism impresses me that much. Discourse currently seems premature for all the whoop-de-doo being jointly offered.
