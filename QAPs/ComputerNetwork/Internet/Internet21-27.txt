★How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
Horrible, grainy TV. Early computers (I had a TI 99 that I briefly coded on), arcades, hanging out with people, books, board games, radio and making mix tapes. My Walkman!  Hanging out in the record store.  Or the book store. Talking on the phone, which I hardly do anymore. Cooking.  Those little Coleco handheld videogames that could occupy me for hours.  Writing actual letters. Poetry even. Also, normal things took a lot longer.  We went out to the bank, the DMV, the library, shopping, etc. It's a much better world now, for sure.  Still slightly blows my mind to contemplate (almost) all of the world's knowledge accessible from the palm of my hand.
