★How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
I rode my Swinn 10 speed to the 7-Eleven, bought 10 comic books for $0.20 each (Spiderman, X-Men, Conan the Barbarian, etc), a bag of Doritos and a large RC cola bottle, rode home and... read all the comics, ate all the Doritos, and drank the entire 20oz of RC.  Total cost < $5.  Time wasted - approximately 4 hours.  Fun - immeasurable.
