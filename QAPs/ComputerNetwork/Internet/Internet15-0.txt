★What consumer Internet companies had a large number of users but failed to monetize?How large were the companies, and how did their monetization strategies fail? I'm specifically interested in revenues, rather than profit. E.g., YouTube had lots of users and revenues, but minimal profits. I'm interested in lots of users and minimal revenues.
I can't think of one. All the companies mentioned here either: a) *Did* have significant revenues: Netscape (the same company as Mosaic, btw) made $400M in revenue the first 9 months of 1997: http://sec.edgar-online.com/nets... Geocities (This is a guess, but I bet that traffic made Yahoo! a boatload of money back when banner dollars were easy to get. Maybe not enough to justify the $3.5B acquisition price, but that wasn't the question. Anyone know?) Shutterfly (see comment above) b) Didn't really have a lot of users. (What's "a lot" anyway?) 4chan? c) Got bought, ran out of funding due to dot-com crash, or sued out of existence before they tried in earnest to monetize. None of these are the same as "failing" to monetize. Geocities (Even if not really in category A under Yahoo's regime, they are here.) Almost everyone else mentioned Possible exceptions (don't really know the story on either of these, but I doubt it): JenniCam (was she a company?) DejaNews (did they have any users?) Ning (I think they were growing well for a while, not sure what happened exactly.) Having a large number of users and the inability to monetize them is a non-existent problem. People talk about it all the time, but it doesn't really happen—at least it doesn't happen in today's world. I'm not even sure it ever did. Sure, there were Internet companies that went out of business because they were losing too much money, but I think usually they didn't *really* have a lot of users (just a lot of hype) or they had out of control costs.
