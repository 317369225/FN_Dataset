â˜…What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1980s?A follow-up question to What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
While I suppose there are some people that were on the real internet (aka ARPANET and some of those early government and military networks), for most of us unwashed masses the internet in the 80s was a collection of Bulletin Board Systems (aka BBS), America Online, CompuServe and/or Prodigy. And, of course, everything was dial-up so it was incredibly slow.... Some Bulletin Board systems had themes related to hobbies (history, military, genealogy, etc.) and aside from the more simplistic UI's, felt very much like forums similar to those now powered by vBulletin and others. Some also had simple games that folks would come and play. They were interesting in that most only had a handful of phone lines so they were hard to get onto. Of all those online services, I had the most experience with AOL when it first appeared. It too had "forums" where you could interact with folks, but what what was most distinctive to me and other folks was how easy it to join "chat rooms" and send "instant messages". This was not necessarily an easy thing to do up until the late 80s or early 90s so it was kind of a big deal and really did open the doors for online social interaction. As ironic as it may sound, there would be no Facebook and Quora today, if it wasn't for the succcess of America Online in the early 90s.
