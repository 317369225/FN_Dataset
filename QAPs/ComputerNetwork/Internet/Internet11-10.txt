★What is the Internet of Things?
The Internet of things is the concept that any device that could use an Internet connection should get one, allowing it to talk with other devices on the network. It's widely believed to be the next catalyst for innovation in the tech world, with seemingly every major player looking at ways to connect more products together. With a $19 trillion market internet of things is the Next big thing, with 90 things connecting with the internet every second, it is believed that about 50 billion things will be connected to the internet by 2020. The world has come to a state today where more non-humans are connected to internet than actual humans, and this imbalance is only going to grow in the coming years. Internet of things is the future, home-based appliances are some of the most popular “smart” items, but the possibilities include any object that can be given the ability to transmit any kind of data along with a specialized IP address. From farm animals, to car tires to heart monitors, this new connectedness will permeate every aspect of our lives. The list just goes getting longer and more interesting.
