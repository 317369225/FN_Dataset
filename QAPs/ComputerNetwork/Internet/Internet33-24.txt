â˜…What innate traits do great Internet product leaders share?If you were setting up a program to train user-focused Internet product leaders/creators, what are the traits you'd look for in candidates that can't be easily taught?
Martin - we are in broad agreement but I would frame it differently. And Craig - your long-term perspective is one of your greatest strengths, imho. I have found the best product managers (and business leaders of all kinds) share a fundamental commitment to make products, services, experiences that meet the *basic* needs/desires of their customers. I tend to shy away from phrases like "insanely great." Through two decades of work, I still find that most companies get focused on the extremes and forget the basics. And if a company really nails the basics, then customers are delighted and it builds a long-term businesses.
