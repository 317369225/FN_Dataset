â˜…What does a bad internet connection teach you?Though a bad internet connection is a pain in the ass,it does teach you some valuable lessons.
Karma is a bitch. You need a better Internet service provider. You probably need to upgrade your Internet plan. You have an outstanding bill. How meaningless it is to sit and stare at a screen all day when there is no form of knowledge transfer taking place between you and the world. Whether or not you care for human interaction with a human who is physically present in front of you. Tea is best enjoyed when your mind isn't getting trolled by buffoons in the virtual world.
