â˜…How do I become a hustler?
Set goals. Be an expert in some element of getting to those goals. Get help where you need it. Set some milestones and go after them hard. Ask for help. Along the way occassionally there will be lame-ass shit to do. Do it. When the right opportunities come along don't pass. Fail a lot and often. Don't repeat the mistakes. Oh, and whatever your trying to accomplish could take a while. Along the way you will think of new goals. Repeat.
