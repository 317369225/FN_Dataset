★What is the Internet of Things?
IoT or the "internet of things" refers to any object is equipped with a unique digital tracker giving it the ability to send and receive information without human interaction. The "thing" can be any man made or organic object, which can be given the ability to transfer data over a network. For example, a heart monitor can be equipped to send information to your doctors office, a sprinkler system can be set up to determine if your lawn needs watering and perform the task, all without YOU having to do anything. Another example hot in the news today is Google's acquisition of Nest, a company that makes a thermostat that extracts data from the environment, including information about  lighting, humidity, and the daily behavior of a home’s residents in order to automatically adjust the temperature settings based the resident's preferences. Because the sensors embedded  in physical objects are linked through  wired and wireless networks, often using the same Internet Protocol (IP)  that connects the Internet, security for IoT will become a primary concern for many IoT businesses!
