★What innate traits do great Internet product leaders share?If you were setting up a program to train user-focused Internet product leaders/creators, what are the traits you'd look for in candidates that can't be easily taught?
Skepticism, in my opinion, cannot be taught.  I think "hustle" and JFDI also correlate well with this.
