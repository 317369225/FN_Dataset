â˜…When will China join the rest of the world on the real Internet?
If you really want to do that, I suggest that you can download chat applications in App Store, like QQ, WeChat or weibo. But, before you do that, please learn Chinese first. Majority of Chinese student who are studying abroad usually contact domestic friends by those applications.
