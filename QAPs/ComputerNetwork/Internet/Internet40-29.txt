â˜…Who will be the leading companies of the Internet of Things?Everything relating to the ethos of connecting the worlds devices to the web makes sense. I wonder in what timeframe it will play out? And who will be the leaders of this wave of technology.
It is a very broad question. I would simply say it depends on the technology area (Telematic terminals, Sensors, Storage, Cloud, Analytics etc.), or verticals (Healthcare, Transportation etc.). As for IT solution providers, I believe Oracle is one of the biggest candidates due to strong Technology product portfolio and Enterprise Applications. Furthermore, J2ME and J2SE have high chance to be the most popular platform for plenty of IoT applications.
