â˜…What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
Services for Privacy and Identity should be the next big thing; especially since it is the number one weakness of the other two you mentioned. Everywhere you look it can be seen that our identities, preferences, shopping habits, likes, histories, images and intellectual properties are either under attack or have been exploited. The next big service will be a central place or mechanism to store and control all your information and data: who has access to it; who has it already; what they are doing with it; and ways to automate and authenticate you so that you can insist on your rights to demand its removal. Having this standardised and simplified will help people understand the dangers more and give them the tools to tackle it. Until this problem is addressed, most ideas mentioned on this page are simply new services that will further expose our vulnerabilities. Image from stock.xchng - aToy's sxc home
