â˜…Is the Internet evil?What is the one thing common to Einstein, Newton, Beethoven, Nietzsche and Alexander Fleming? Apart from an extraordinary intelligence, none of them had access to the Internet. Does that mean the Internet is an impediment to the growth of human intelligence? If yes, does that make it evil ?
Well forget about the internet, I think Internet Explorer is evil. I guess it is one hundred percent up to you to decide whether it is evil or not. I mean it depends on what you want to look up for. If you are searching for something productive then internet can be your best friend else it can be more than evil. In my opinion, Internet can never be a hindrance or impediment to the growth of human intelligence, acuity or perspicacity. Because of Internet, the entire world is in one nutshell.
