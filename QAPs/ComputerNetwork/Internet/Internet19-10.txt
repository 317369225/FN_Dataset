â˜…Are internet forums dead?There seemed to be a time where everyone congregated on forums. WIth the presence of Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Quora, etc. it seems like people are no longer into forums. Does anyone still use forums for online socialization, asking questions, discussion/hobbies anymore or have internet forums been rendered redundant?
I don't think forums are dead. But it has evolved. The essence of forums was, and still is the community. Now that concept of community has evolved in a way which I think is faster, deeper, wider such as Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest.
