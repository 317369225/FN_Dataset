â˜…What is the coolest thing I can buy on the internet for under $100?
This might be the dumbest thing to ever make me happy, but I found this 3-meter 30-pin iPod/iPhone/iPad sync and charge cable at work: 9.8' USB Sync & Charger Cable for iPod, iPhone & iPad/2/3 I don't have to contort my body anymore while charging my iPhone. In fact, I can go almost halfway across the room and still charge my iPhone :)
