â˜…Who will be the leading companies of the Internet of Things?Everything relating to the ethos of connecting the worlds devices to the web makes sense. I wonder in what timeframe it will play out? And who will be the leaders of this wave of technology.
Companies like Sensefinity (Sensefinity) that allow other companies to enter the IoT world offering E2E solutions (hardware, software, training, etc.) and completely independents of the ERP's, CRM's, BI, etc. systems already installed. This "Internet-of-Things"-as-a-Service (Interview with Sensefinity about Their Low-Cost IoT Solution) allows the organization's position themselves financially for the future by allowing them to move from the CapEx Model to the OpEx Model which include significant tax advantages, easier predictability of direct expenditures, and the opportunity to spread costs over time and financial decision-making for smaller, regular operational costs is easier than for larger capital purchases as we already see trending since the bigger adoption of cloud based solutions. In one phrase: "Companies that make CFO's decisions more easy."
