â˜…What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
Wild. Wild. I had unfettered, unmonitored, high speed (very - for the time) 24*7 access via a University here in the early-mid to mid Nineties. I saw everything. Things that cannot ever be unseen. You kids with your Goatse, *shakes head, indulgent chuckle*. I hasten to add I didn't go looking for the Abyss, but this was the Bad Old Days; you could be looking for a particular game - perhaps to 'evaluate' - and with an injudicious click or two you could be in a place for Very Bad People Indeed. Hardware sucked. Let's say you found said 'evaluation' copy of a game. You'd have to download a .zip spanned over multiple floppies, anything up to 25 (!), then install it on your target machine (in the room I had access to, the best computer wasn't actually on the net). About 1 time in 5 you'd go through the whole 6 hour process, start re-assembling the .zip on the target computer, only for the very last floppy in the sequence to return a checksum error. Not funny. We did get an Iomega Zip Drive but later. Generally it was more fractured. You had to be handy with FTP, Usenet, IRC and even Telnet. You used Mosaic then Netscape for browsing. I had my first experience of what are now called MMOGs only back then we called them MUDs - Multi User Dungeons - and they were all text-based. The Discworld one in particular was a lot of fun. Porn drove all the advances in web technology. That is simply a fact. Online payment? Porn. Streaming video? Porn. Authentication and encryption? Porn. Er...so I am told at least. I had my first experience of online community, especially on IRC, where you could become part of a group of real friends, even though you were dotted all about the globe and had never met in person. That is probably my most fondly remembered and valued discovery of that period in my life. Good times.
