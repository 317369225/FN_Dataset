Lots of fun. In 1980, if you had an access number for ARPAnet, you could connect as a LUSER to the PDP-10 at MIT Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (links to: /Massachusetts-Institute-of-Technology-MIT-2) and play the original Zork.  Zork (links to: /Zork). Extra points if you actually stayed with it long enough to win. Trivia fact: Being eaten by a grue, is not what it may sound like. Look up the French translation of the word. If you worked at PARC PARC (links to: /PARC) in the early 80s, you communicated globally via the Xerox InterNetwork.  Yea. Yeah, that's where the word Internet Internet (links to: /The-Internet-2) originated. You had access to pretty much the same tech as today, but with less variety. It was very cool, and convenient, to remote access your Dandelion workstation (aka Dandy-lion) from thousands of miles away to compile apps, etc. Incredible that the remote GUI Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) (links to: /Graphical-User-Interfaces-GUI) could actually work over a 2k modem connection. Dialing into CompuServeCompuServe (links to: /CompuServe), the Source, the WELL, BBSesThe WELL (links to: /The-WELL), Bulletin Board Systems (links to: /Bulletin-Board-Systems), etc. ., was not accessing the Internet. Most people using the Internet in the late 80s were at university campuses. The public Internet was so small in the 80s that, even in 1990, you could get a two letter dotcom domain name.
