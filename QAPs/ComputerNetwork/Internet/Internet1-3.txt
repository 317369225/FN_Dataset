â˜…What will the Internet look like in 2020?I'd like as many different descriptions of what the usage, adoption and structure of the Internet will look like in the year 2020 as possible. Be creative, and try to think outside the box how it will change in the next seven years. Let's see what the current early adopters of the Internet come up with (since we're all using Quora...).
Websites as information + user interface will be long gone, websites only will serve structured information. UI will depend on app, platform you request information (think of Google Now). Web design as layout on screen will be gone. Information source, URL is irrelevant as users only ask or require information instead of surfing from website to website. Information is heavily filtered, censored and propagandized. Because of it, there will be almost no ads as information and advertisement are interwoven, but only very few people will realize it. Think of all these "Best phones of 20** and how iPhone is always on top. Marketing will move closer to PR and PRopaganda. User input is relevant to user's location, input time, etc. If user is asked "Where are you?" he will only need to reply "here" and it will be considered as permission to send location, directions, traffic conditions etc to the one who asked. Similarly relative words as "I", "that", "there" etc will be considered as permissions to reveal information about these things. One has to be really smart not to reveal anything. Internet correctness. Facebook like communities will heavily rely on ego -- what user has, owns, wants as a mean to drive economy. It is not a dedicated website, more like a filtered history of things one has bought from stores, places one has visited etc. Social media altogether is kind of like filtered, structured browsing history, transaction history etc. and it will be automatic, user doesn't have to "sign up for an account"
