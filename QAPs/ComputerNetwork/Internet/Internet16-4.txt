★What free stuff on the internet should everyone be taking advantage of?
The Gutenberg Project http://www.gutenberg.org http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro... EDIT: Just clarifying further for one of the commenters. Google  Books is a project that aims to scan and digitize all of the books that  have ever been published for search purposes. You will never really be  able to read these books for free. Project  Gutenberg differs from this by being a project that aims to digitize  and archive cultural works of literature and other fiction and non  fiction and encourage the use and distributioin of ebooks. In order to  do this, they target books that are out of print and not restricted by  copyrights, Project Gutenberg is careful to verify the status of its ebooks according to U.S. copyright law.  Material is added to the Project Gutenberg archive only after it has  received a copyright clearance, and records of these clearances are  saved for future reference. Project Gutenberg does not claim new  copyright on titles it publishes. Instead, it encourages their free  reproduction and distribution. Most books in the Project Gutenberg collection are distributed as public domain under U.S. copyright law. The licensing included with each ebook puts some restrictions on what can be done  with the texts (such as distributing them in modified form, or for  commercial purposes) as long as the Project Gutenberg trademark is used. If the header is stripped and the trademark not used, then the  public domain texts can be reused without any restrictions. There are also a few copyrighted texts that Project Gutenberg distributes with permission.
