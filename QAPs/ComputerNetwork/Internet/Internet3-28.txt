★What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
The next new internet  trend will most likely fall in the realm of crowdsourcing for opinions – both gathering and giving. Society today has strong opinions and wants their views to be heard.  Technology has allowed everyone to have a voice and the ability to influence others.  Websites such as Yelp & Google allow individuals to sound off about their discontents with a restaurant, leave rave reviews about their stylist, and are rewarded for doing so through review rankings by other users who turn to these sources for answers and guidance.  These rankings of others’ opinions only add fuel to the fire, encouraging users to again share their opinions racking up status points, expertise, and credibility with others.   This opinion crowdsourcing has even expanded to the corporate realm.  Brands consistently encourage consumers to review, rank, and gather information from others’ experiences – rewarding their loyal fans in the form of coupons, preferred treatments, or elite status.  Most brands and organizations work to promote their rankings on simple consumer sites to awarded industry rank associations – all accessible via the internet.    Additionally, technology has allowed users to review and rate on the go – mobile technology has put the gift of instantaneous voice and influence in the hands of society.  The ability to crowdsource opinions has even fallen to the individual level – simply stated through the ability to “like” an individual’s Facebook status or ReTweet on Twitter.  This can be viewed as a ranking, an expression of opinion, and agreement.  All of these manners off society the ability to source opinions, rank other’s opinions and indulging users’ sense of self-importance by contributing and influencing the rest of society.
