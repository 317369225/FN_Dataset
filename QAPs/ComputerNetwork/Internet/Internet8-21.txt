â˜…What was it like to be a programmer without the Internet?When there were no online documentation, no Google, no StackOverflow...
When I first was exposed to computer programming on an 80286, a wonderful machine, with 7 MB of disk, 1 MB of RAM, 16 colour EGA graphics card - waay before VGA. My MS-DOS distribution shipped with QBasic and QBasic shipped with a manual. That's all I had to learn BASIC. It was enough. Of course, this meant that I had to figure out the most popular (yet non-trivial) algorithms myself, and that I wasn't able to download any libraries for this and that problem. On the other hand, there was not enough disk space (or RAM) to load the libraries anyway.
