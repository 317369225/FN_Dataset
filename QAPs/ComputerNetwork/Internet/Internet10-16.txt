★Is the Internet spoiling young children?
There is no ugly side of internet, the internet is a neutral information tool, what is ugly is humanity, including the call for censorship.   Yes, the internet reveals the ugly side of humanity to children, but those are the information that they should not be deprived of: rape, murders, wars, indoctrination, child/animal abuse religious/scientific conflict, racism, politics, poverty, slavery, climate change, pornography, casino, drugs and last but not least, to understand the human weakness and tendencies to be drawn to the dark side. Just because children don't listen to parents, doesn't mean they are spoilt, it just means some parents are no longer the source of referent knowledge. We build knowledge on top of previous generation and that is how knowledge grows. In the last 20+ years humans built knowledge on top of the internet, learning how to learn faster with the use of internet, a feat that pre-internet humans (parents) did not experience and cannot grasp. Parents who do not get respected are the ones who demand respect, hides information, hide their own ignorance, avoid questions, thinks too highly of themselves, uses demeaning words "you are too young to understand", "you are not mature", "I know better than you",  do not keep up with times and do not know how to educate children of the internet age. It is glaringly obvious that parents are failing as educators and influencers, but all we do is blame the internet rather than humbly seek advice on parenting (I will post an answer if someone ask this as a separate question). Censorship is not a parenting methodology, it is the worse thing that can happen to children and humanity. It is currently being used against us, and if we continue to allow it, we will be destroying the very essence that makes us free.
