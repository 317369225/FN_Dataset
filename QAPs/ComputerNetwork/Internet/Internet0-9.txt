My most productive "free time" activity on the internet is using Memrise for language learning. I've used it to to go from knowing about 10 Chinese characters to being able to read simple books. The site uses a spaced repetition algorithm to help you efficiently remember vocabulary. The best thing about the site, as far as I'm concerned, is the mems, prompts written by the site and by users that help you to remember each item presented to you. The usefulness, quality, and variety of mems on the site continue to impress me, and creating new mems seems to help cement words in my mind. Whatever you choose to do, remember that it's imperative that you be active rather than receptive. Watching TED talks is great, but if you don't do anything to act upon/realize what was presented then all you've done is consume information.
