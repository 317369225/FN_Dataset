â˜…What are the real-life equivalents of "Trolling on the Internet" ?
I have done the following - results guaranteed. 1. Ping two people on your Gchat buddy list with a 'Hi'. Copy paste responses across the two windows. It takes a while for the two victims to realize they have actually been talking to each other. Do not do it if you owe anybody any money, or if there are sharp objects in the vicinity. 2. Make up outlandish stories for everyday questions, in real time - the narrative fallacy goes a long way. Sometimes I think this is Woody Allen's entire career. 3. Hum songs with key words replaced by expletives. True fans will whack you in the head with whatever they can find. 4. Answer regular questions with possibly true but completely useless answers. For example: Co-worker 1: John's proposing we do something about that South East Asia deck. Co-worker 2: Who is John? Me: James' brother. People usually throw whatever they can lay their hands on. 5. Symmetric answers: Answer questions with sentences constructed in a manner that closely mirrors the question. Co-worker: Do you plan to stay back late today? Me: I plan to stay back late today. Co-worker: Do you have a deadline tomorrow? Me: No, I do not have a deadline tomorrow. Co-worker: Are you a retard? Me: Yes, I might be a retard. 6. Semantically similar answers: Wife: So my security check-in is done, will board the air plane in 20 minutes. Me: Just finished off the third cup of tea, will hit the gym in 25 minutes. Wife: eh? Me: I thought we were exchanging status updates The last I haven't tried personally, but a friend who has assures me the results are good. Text two friends who don't know each other much the following, and arrange to keep them alone together for a while. "Be careful, the dude is on medication"
