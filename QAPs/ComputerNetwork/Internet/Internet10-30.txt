★Is the Internet spoiling young children?
Most sane parents regulate their child's access to reading materials, as do schools, trying to make ensure the information available is relevant to the needs of the child at that age and stage of development.   Neither schools nor parents have caught up with how to control the avalanche of inappropriate information now available (and sometimes forced upon) in an unregulated form to children.   Despite the attitude of billionaires and Governments who think parental concern is laughable and "free speech" excuses all, in the long term (IMV) they must lose.
