â˜…How do I become a hustler?
It's a hard one but nonetheless its down to you to measure how bad do you want it? So if you're willing to lose sleep and sacrifice having the 'pleasures' of life to live a life of potential wealth and happiness at a later date then you are good to go. Most importantly do what the majority of tech startups are doing, find peoples problems and solve them. If someone you know is not doing something because of whatever excuse, its your duty to go ahead and do it (providing its viable and makes business sense). Ultimately don't take no as an answer. Have a dream and use it as inspiration for your hustle.
