★Can I use the internet to save my mom, who suffers from Stage IV cancer?
The last paragraph of Jae Won Joh summarizes very precisly what I think you should do, my mother died 4 years ago because of a lung cancer, very powerful words: Learn from me, questioner. Learn from my mistakes. Do not battle with the demon. Shun him. Ignore him. Do not give in to his wiles and fall  for his feint. Sign off from Facebook/Quora/etc, go to your mother, and help her smile. She does not need you on the internet. She needs you at her side. Your presence alone will mean worlds to her. And sooner or later, when death comes for her, as it must for all of us, perhaps you will live with less regret than I.
