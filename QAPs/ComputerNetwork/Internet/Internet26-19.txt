★How do I become a hustler?
To be a hustler takes passion and nerve.  You have to be willing to make a fool of yourself and not care what anyone else thinks.  You have to take risks and always pick yourself up when you fall, cause because you will fall.  You have to see whats around the corner before everybody else does and run with it.  You have to know yourself and know that anything is possible.  Dream big but also DO big.
