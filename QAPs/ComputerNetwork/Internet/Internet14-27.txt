★What is the best way to learn internet marketing?
Listen, one of the biggest problems is 'wannabe' internet marketers get hooked on consuming.  There's something sexy about learning how to make millions online, reading about how you can do XYZ and be sitting on a beach making 100K in your underpants by next week. It don't work.  There is no magic pill or silver bullet... You have to roll up your sleeves and get dirty. You talk about learning from a professor but who'd you like to learn business from... a business professor or Richard Branson?  One teaches, the other does.  Both have lots of knowledge but one is in the trenches making cash money.  Big difference. Last... you need to know how you're going to make your money. What are you going to sell? Is it a service, or do you have products? Then crack on, and do it.
