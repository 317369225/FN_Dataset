â˜…Is atheism a fad among Internet users?
I was an atheist since I was 11 or 12 years old (may not have been in the purest sense, but I was definitely skeptical of the whole concept of GOD). I am 29 now. Although my first experience with a computer was around the same time, I didn't access the internet till I was around 16. This was back when you would type in the web address, hit enter and wait for 5 minutes for the page to come up. Around this time, In India, most people didn't even know anything apart from believing. We believed in different Gods, but we all believed, nonetheless. I was like the odd one. Maybe there were others who shared similar skeptical thoughts as me, but I never came across any when I was growing up. The internet definitely has provided a platform for me and others like me to reach out to other atheists. The reason why you see so many atheists on the internet and why this might seem like a fad is because, we don't have many atheist friends to discuss or share our knowledge. And it definitely is not a fad.
