★What will the Internet look like in 2020?I'd like as many different descriptions of what the usage, adoption and structure of the Internet will look like in the year 2020 as possible. Be creative, and try to think outside the box how it will change in the next seven years. Let's see what the current early adopters of the Internet come up with (since we're all using Quora...).
I think it's possible the Internet will become much more channel and push oriented as people tire of having to dig for interesting things.  And yes, this push will happen to all of the devices around us, and stories/games/brand experiences will unfold across them.  I'll be able to monetize my attention and filtering/synthesizing skills, and have people subscribe to my curated channels. I'll be able to define a set of trusted sources and have an unlimited stream of content and utilities to access.  I will be able to uniformly filter out junk and anything that doesn't coincide with my aesthetic or my political views.  I will be able to set a fuzzy switch that controls how much chaos I allow.  I'll pay less for any old content and more for convenience and quality.  I'll subscribe to services that keep me informed and entertained in an efficient and pro-active way. I will connect more with people and organizations directly and less with middlemen, advertising, email marketing and spam. Google should be on her way to consciousness, too, and can info power our wearables and web-enabled personal vehicles:
