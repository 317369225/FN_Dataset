â˜…How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
I remember wasting A LOT of time waiting for that hot new song to come on again (with my fingers on the cassette "record" and "play" buttons) so I could record the song from the very beginning. This was also before radio stations started playing the same 20 songs every hour. This means that if you mess up at all then that is another 2 hours you'll spend waiting for the song to come on again (at least).
