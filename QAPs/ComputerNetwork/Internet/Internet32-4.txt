â˜…Is the Internet killing religion?
The Internet is the most powerful tool for personal education that man has ever created. Religion has been the most powerful tool for local obfuscation and brainwashing that the world has ever known. With an Achilles heel of scepticism, triggered by rational enquiry. Disruption, Internet style. Disintermediation, and crowd sourcing. Game, set, and match. P.S. Shorn of its fear-inducing trappings such as impressive architechture, men in scary clothing, and smells of assorted things and spaces, sounds of mock-heavenly music, all coming together in a well-designed experience, Religion is stripped bare and naked, warts and all, on the altar of the Internet.
