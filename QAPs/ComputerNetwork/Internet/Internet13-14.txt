25-odd years ago (we were still using Lotus 1-2-3 on MS-DOS PCs) I had the good fortune to work with a very highly paid consultant (earning more in an hour than I earned in a day back then), planning a major (project cost: 8 digits) IT project. He created a Lotus spreadsheet with some planned budget numbers. He entered sums by hand, after he added up columns using a pocket calculator. His calculations were wrong.
