â˜…What is the Internet of Things?
This is the definition we adopted for the Internetome conference. The Internet of Things refers to a network of objects not historically connected. We can consider four kinds of objects: The device containing electronics in order to fulfil its primary function (eg, washing machine, car, aircon unit) The electrical device traditionally absent of sophisticated electronics (eg, lighting, heating, power distribution) Non-electrical objects (eg, food and drink packages, animals, clothing) Environmental sensors (eg, for variables such as temperature, ambient sound and moisture). More detailed information about the definition of the Internet of Things is included in the CASAGRAS Final Report << first result in a Google search for this title.
