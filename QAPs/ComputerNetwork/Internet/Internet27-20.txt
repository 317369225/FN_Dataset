â˜…What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
As a Christian, I don't condone forcing my beliefs on anybody. Everyone is entitled to their own belief or non-belief system and trying to convert atheists who don't want to be converted is insulting to the principles of tolerance, love and acceptance. I for sure don't like being told that I am idiot for being a Christian, so I don't imagine atheists would like being told they need to be saved from hell. I believe in being respectful of others. That goes for both theists and atheists. So to answer the question, the best way to convert an atheist over the internet is to find an atheist who is genuinely curious about religion and faith and then explaining your beliefs to them and answering any of their questions in a helpful and kind manner. Don't try to force anything on them but be embracing and accepting of them. Or Simply talk about your faith, your belief and why you think it is best for you. Don't direct this at anyone in particular, don't preach it in areas it is not relevant but merely sharing your story may help others reach the same conclusions. Do not force your beliefs on anyone. Be accepting and tolerant. Don't try to force others to believe the same as you, and don't fight intolerance of atheism with intolerance of theism.
