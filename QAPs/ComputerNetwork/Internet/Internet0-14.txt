It's no use setting down the so many websites in the answers. If you really want, you can benefit from every website. The most productive way to spend time on the Internet is to share, rather than just to be a reader or a passer-by. I came to Quora about a year ago and I was excited. I read a lot of questions and answers. I followed a lot of Top Writers. I was immersed in it. I am not a native English speaker, so I used to be ashamed to write answers on Quora. Then I realized that the information on the Internet is endless. If you don't show yourself, you will always be a part of the audience. So I began to write answers in my broken English. I share my stories, personal views and childish thoughts. I began to get upvotes, which motivated me to keep writing answers. My English writing improved a lot in the process. Now I have deleted my Facebook and Twitter accounts and focus all my spare time on Quora. I hope that I can get more upvotes. :-)   If you want to spend your time effectively on the Internet, learn to share with others on the Internet, whatever it is your thoughts, your stories or comments. You are sure to get upvotes(feedback) if your contribution is helpful. Get involved and don't get used to being just a reader of the Internet.
