★Is atheism a fad among Internet users?
I am not an Atheist, but what I understand from my Atheist friends, it is a conclusion they have reached on their own when they personally ponder the nature of the universe.  In my opinion, any conclusion reached by personal reflection and a desire to know the truth on an individual basis can not be a fad.
