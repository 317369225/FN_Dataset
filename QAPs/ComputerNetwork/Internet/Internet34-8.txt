â˜…Can I use the internet to save my mom, who suffers from Stage IV cancer?
I was in your shoes with my Dad a few months ago. Unfortunately, cancer won that battle a month and 3 days ago. I'm still mad, I just don't know with whom. I thought Radiation could remove his pain. I doubt it helped at all. Perhaps if we'd have skipped that last CT scan the Radiation would have proved worthwhile. Maybe not. But I've learned there's a reason that doctors who get cancer often choose not to treat it. A story I'm not finding right now from the NY Times that put chills down my spine. A doctor famous for his treatment of a certain type of cancer, was diagnosed with the same cancer and instead of using the treatment he created, he shut down his office immediately and chose no treatment. You will see a similar sentiment in this fine article: Why MOST doctors like me would rather DIE than endure the pain of treatment we inflict on others for terminal diseases: Insider smashes medicine's big taboo. Godspeed to you. It's a rough road ahead, but just be as positive as you can be while in front of your Mom.
