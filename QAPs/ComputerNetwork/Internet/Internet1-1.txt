★What will the Internet look like in 2020?I'd like as many different descriptions of what the usage, adoption and structure of the Internet will look like in the year 2020 as possible. Be creative, and try to think outside the box how it will change in the next seven years. Let's see what the current early adopters of the Internet come up with (since we're all using Quora...).
Imagine a web that... ...Isn't focused around a computer, but is instead "everywhere."  In every device, on every person, accessible at every location.  It's not a place you go, it's a layer behind everything you do. ...you interact with via natural user interfaces.  Being able to open the web by tapping your watch and having a screen appear in front of you.  Imagine Minority Report and the hand gesture interfaces.  No mouse, no keyboard. ...delivers content to you at any time, all the time, personalized and no matter where you are.  Tap a screen in a mall and it recognizes who you are and lets you know that you have three important messages to check.  Or tap a floating tablet screen and asks you if you want to pick up where you left off on season 40 of House, or if you'd rather tune into Lakers vs. Celtics game. ...connects directly with the mind.  Actions and commands come not only from NUIs, but from your thoughts.  How do you power up your vacuum? Command it in your head. I think this will be our children or our children's children, as they'll be more comfortable with a chip in the brain. ...lets you create and construct almost anything. Using the web to collaborate and create a full virtual world in seconds.  Use it to command a robotic factory to put together your dream car. ...connects us to each other.  Voice communication will one day be considered archaic.  Even emotion will be shareable via the web.It's just the beginning.
