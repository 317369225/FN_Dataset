★Are relationships on the Internet really real?Without any sound, facial expressions, or any kind actual, physical human interaction beyond sending lines of text to one another, words which one can edit and second guess prior to sending, are human relationships over the internet really human or are they actually superficial and fake to some degree?
This is going to sound all "new-world-agie" but the simple answer is: If it feels real, if it is important, if it matters, then of course it is "real".  If it doesn't feel real, if it isn't important, if it doesn't matter, then it probably isn't.   A relationship is continuous interaction between two beings, ergo any interaction, regardless of how ephemeral or superficial is "real".  But just how "real" it is, is up to the participants.   I have met some great people online.  A good friend who I know personally (we met a few years back) and my boyfriend were all "online" connections.  I really like my interactions with people here. I look forward to my conversations with people like Domhnall O'Huigin, Emily Altman, Andrew Gutsch, User, Erik Fair, Lou Davis (and a host of others) greatly.  It is a "relationship" and it is "real".  It may not be corporeal, but the fact that it is virtual doesn't mean it doesn't matter.
