â˜…Is the Internet evil?What is the one thing common to Einstein, Newton, Beethoven, Nietzsche and Alexander Fleming? Apart from an extraordinary intelligence, none of them had access to the Internet. Does that mean the Internet is an impediment to the growth of human intelligence? If yes, does that make it evil ?
Evil is something that can be done by men who can also do good. Internet is a powerful tool which can be used to do evil or to do good. It's up to us.
