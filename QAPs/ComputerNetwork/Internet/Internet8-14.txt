★What was it like to be a programmer without the Internet?When there were no online documentation, no Google, no StackOverflow...
Typically you had a stack of manuals that shipped with the language for the API references, you'd be best friends with the local Borders or Barnes and Noble to browse books on the subject and haunted the local library.  If you found something useful in a book you could use, you bought it on-the-spot.  This process made modern video games cheap by comparison.  And then you simply wrote code, played, muddled through and figured stuff out.  Knowledge was burned into your brain via practice.  As Bob Blackburn states, very hard to fake competency.  I cut my teeth in this period in the 1990s and interviewed then.  In phone interviews, you'd listen for the sounds of pages turning and measure the pauses.  If you knew the answer, you knew the answer and rattled it off immediately.  If you're trying to fake it, that 10-20 second pause was your death knell.  In that regard, not much has changed except for the sound.  Keyboard instead of pages.  And if you're in an in-person interview, you can't escape your lack of knowledge.  I interview in a manner designed to figure out if you actually know the skills you list on your resume.  Often simple questions can reveal if your knowledge is a millimeter deep or a mile.  You will get caught. I think that period produced better programmers in terms of depth and skill.  Only the dedicated could survive.  Today, anyone can break out an editor, hit a tutorial, slap down some JavaScript and try to call themselves a coder.  That generational gap shows today.  Today's senior level programmers (15+ years of experience), came out of this period.  And it shows.
