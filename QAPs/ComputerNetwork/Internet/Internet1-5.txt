â˜…What will the Internet look like in 2020?I'd like as many different descriptions of what the usage, adoption and structure of the Internet will look like in the year 2020 as possible. Be creative, and try to think outside the box how it will change in the next seven years. Let's see what the current early adopters of the Internet come up with (since we're all using Quora...).
Pessimistic version: There will not be a global Internet in 2020. Instead, there will be regional sub-internets for economic unions like EU, USA, and something equivalent for Africa, Asia and China etc. Within each "zone", traffic flows freely, but across the borders, traffic is tightly controlled, monitored and regulated to enforce intellectual property, antiterrorism, censorship and other regulations. Optimistic version: The Internet continues to be a free, global network. I can do a search and access any website through a chip embedded in my nervous system and having unlimited global wireless uplink/downlink to the rest of the world, both the Internet as we know it in the form of servers, as well as everyone like me who's individually connected as a person.
