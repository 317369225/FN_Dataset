â˜…What free stuff on the internet should everyone be taking advantage of?
1) Knowledge (Quora, Coursea, Udemy, Codecademy) would also be my #1 choice - you can get top noch education for free 2) Other useful things include all kind of freebies such as cupons, discount codes. When purchasing anything first look for a cupon e.g. at RetailMeNot.com Coupon Codes and Discounts 3) Use referral programs to recommend goods and services to your friends & family e.g. Travelpony, a hotel booking service provides you with free 35USD upon registration (referral link: TravelPony - great hotel deals every day) - there are multiple other refferal programs e.g. AirBnB, Uber - just find people willing to reffer you - I am sure there will be many 4) Price-comparison engines - use them when purchasing goods online - compare the price
