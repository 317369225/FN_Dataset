★When will China join the rest of the world on the real Internet?
Largely, they already have. The Internet is much, much more than Twiiter & Facebook.    China has access to the majority of Internet: of the millions of sites only half-a-dozen are blocked. However, China has its equivalents of those. Indeed, many countries do. Rather than worry about why Chinese can't access Twitter why not join them on their sites: you can access weibo.com   (北美微博广场)
