★What are the unwritten rules of the Internet circa 2011?This is incredibly broad, but a lot of this is just not written down or in the law. For instance, an ethos that a robust intellectual property strategy is bad. Or asking for an NDA is a faux pas. Or that data scraping for commercial purposes is not defensible.
If you're a startup, you're gonna need a bigger moat. A moat around your business something  defensible that protects what you've built. Examples are market  penetration/share, key strategic partnerships, exclusivity (early eBay auctions), dominant brand (e.g.  Google, Coke), infrastructure (e.g. carriers, Amazon). As barriers to entry decrease or fall away, due to lower capital requirements or abundance of API's, for example, the need to develop or increase other defensive moats around your business increase in importance. To  paraphrase Warren Buffett, "Shareholders don't pay for the castle, they  pay for the moat."
