â˜…Can I use the internet to save my mom, who suffers from Stage IV cancer?
my dad and a grandmother died of cancer, so i sort of know how you feel... :( there's a game called re-mission, freely available somewhere at HopeLab doesn't help cure cancer, of course, but gives an idea of what happens inside the body. it's a 3d shooter where you as a nano-robot have to fight various disease elements...
