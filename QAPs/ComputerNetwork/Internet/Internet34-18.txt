â˜…Can I use the internet to save my mom, who suffers from Stage IV cancer?
So sorry. :( Although it probably won't be in time to help your mother, you can help find a cure with Cancer Research UK and Zooniverse: there is far too much data for the scientists to process, so they are crowdsourcing the spadework.
