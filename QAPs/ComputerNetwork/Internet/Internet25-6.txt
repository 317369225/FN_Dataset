â˜…Are relationships on the Internet really real?Without any sound, facial expressions, or any kind actual, physical human interaction beyond sending lines of text to one another, words which one can edit and second guess prior to sending, are human relationships over the internet really human or are they actually superficial and fake to some degree?
Started with Yahoo Messenger. Moved on to Gtalk as chatting there was easier with the slow internet. Sent poems, movie clips, songs from the internet over Gmail. Expressed my feelings for her via Gmail. Though she was in my school for two years, talked for first time over telephone. (Yes! Now, after all this.) Been 6 years to all these, and we have recently introduced each other to our parents and things are going good! So, my answer is YES!
