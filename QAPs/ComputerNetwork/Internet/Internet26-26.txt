â˜…How do I become a hustler?
In the future it'd be nice to define hustling/vocab in your questions. Essentially it's about selling yourself. Everyone is willing to say yes at a certain point (that point may be that you do it for free/pay them to let you do it but still). If you study enough human behavior, if you read up enough and really try to understand people you'll just get when you're getting closer to the yes. Hustling is about being able to get better results than what you should be able to achieve, it's about being David and kicking Goliath's ass. It's about being Joan of Arc and persuading the French king to let you, a 17 year old illiterate farm girl command the army (and the beat the hell out of the English). It's about being clever and promising the ability to make big plays if they say yes and give you the $/contract/army/whatever. Delivering, hopefully you or someone else can do that after ;D
