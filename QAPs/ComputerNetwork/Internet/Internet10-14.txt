★Is the Internet spoiling young children?
Our youth now love luxury. They have bad manners,  contempt for authority; they show disrespect for their elders and love  chatter in place of exercise; they no longer rise when elders enter the  room; they contradict their parents, chatter before company; gobble up  their food and tyrannize their teachers. - Socrates
