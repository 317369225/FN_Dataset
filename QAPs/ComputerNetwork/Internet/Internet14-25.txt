â˜…What is the best way to learn internet marketing?
Compile lists of the most reputable SEO and Internet marketing blogs you can find. Subscribe to all of them using feedly or Pulse (Pulse is my favorite) and read and read and read. Once you start getting a good grasp of SEO start practicing on your site, or a friends. Install Google analytics and just start implementing the most authoratative, excellent sounding advice you come across, Nothing will teach you like actually doing it. This is how I taught myself SEO and I have a whole list of clients I help today. Good luck!
