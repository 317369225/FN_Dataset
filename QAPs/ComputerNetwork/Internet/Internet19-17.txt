â˜…Are internet forums dead?There seemed to be a time where everyone congregated on forums. WIth the presence of Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Quora, etc. it seems like people are no longer into forums. Does anyone still use forums for online socialization, asking questions, discussion/hobbies anymore or have internet forums been rendered redundant?
I dont think they are dead. A good example is reddit.com .. of course there are many redundant comments in it, but if you can find the specific "subreddits", they are have a lot good discussions.
