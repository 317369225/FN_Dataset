â˜…Will the Internet ever become obsolete?
I think we have moved past DARPA's concrete networking experiment into the realm of definition by the masses. (But I do love the slides this question has attracted.) The Internet (capital I) has become an idea that each person sees through his or her experiences with it. The vast majority of people understand they now have access to a lot of people and data and games through The Internet, but they equate The Internet with the web browser or app they use on their PC or mobile device. We technologists know there is a hell of a lot of black magic occurring to bring them that YouTube video, but like all technology before it, the people like to label it with simpler new words such as TV network or phone company. Fiber optic cabling, switches, firewalls, load balancers, SANs, ATM, X.25, Ethernet, Token Ring, twisted pair, stacks, servers, NICs, megabit, gigabyte, tera, peta, and on and on and on and, let me not forget, clouds. The Internet is an idea. It is not new-quickly-growing-old technology. When the names we give things become overloaded with ugly or contradictory meanings, we give them new names. Global Warming became Climate Change. Asbergers is becoming an Autism Spectrum disorder. So too will the name The Internet someday give way to a shinier name such as Mind Sync or Cognitive Implant. It will still deliver people, data, and games, but only old folks will slip up and call it The Internet. No, the idea of The Internet is not obsolete and may never be. The term may eventually become arcane and the technology will change more rapidly than we can ever hope to keep pace with, but the idea of and desire to be connected will live on.
