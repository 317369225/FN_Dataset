â˜…What does a bad internet connection teach you?Though a bad internet connection is a pain in the ass,it does teach you some valuable lessons.
We depend on speed in life. Remember how sad you used to be when you tried to connect to AOL and you would either connect at a 28.8k connection or get a dial tone as opposed to the amazing light speed of 56k? Or when you were kicked offline when downloading that picture and it stopped 14th the way down, before you were able to see what you had set out to see? Oh, the frustration!
