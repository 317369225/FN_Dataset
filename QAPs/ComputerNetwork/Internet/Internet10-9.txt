★Is the Internet spoiling young children?
Although the internet is a double edged sword which has its negatives, I do not think the internet is spoiling young children in our modern society as internet is just an outlet children have now that did not exist before. Children now a days are doing the exact same things that kids in the previous generations did before, just that they are doing it in different outlets. I remember my grandparents telling me that my father used to play all day with his friends, disregarding his homework. He spent his time outside roaming the streets, going out, playing sports. This are the same things kids are doing today. However, they spent time playing online with their peers, without the need to go out. Now, children are hanging in Facebook and whatever not. In singapore, there was a fight by teenagers which resulted in death. In a recent documentary, a lawyer said that the teens failed to find comfort at home and thus joined gangs. There wasn't any mention of the internet which influenced them. Moreover, the internet is just a mass portable Encyclopedia which permeates every aspect of our life. The internet has benefited children in a plethora of ways.  Children nowadays are smarter because the internet opened up the world to them. Therefore, I don't think that the internet is spoiling the children.
