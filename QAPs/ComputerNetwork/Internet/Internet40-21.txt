â˜…Who will be the leading companies of the Internet of Things?Everything relating to the ethos of connecting the worlds devices to the web makes sense. I wonder in what timeframe it will play out? And who will be the leaders of this wave of technology.
The leading company may not exist yet at this time. Of the current crop, Apple and Google with their iWatch and Google Glass are good bets because they are at the top of Mobile technology - which is the closest tech to what IOT's is at the current time. Other contenders are fitbit & Samsung. Swatch - the fashion technology brand of the 1980's is a dark horse. There is also enterprise IOT where SAP, Oracle and Salesforce are likely working on something. I am monitoring these developments myself, since I am super curious. I usually put my thoughts in my blog at IOT - The Next Frontier of Technology Convergence
