★Is the Internet spoiling young children?
I think that allowing unrestricted access to the Internet is incredibly harmful for young children. My daughters are 5 and 10 years old.  Neither of them use the internet by themselves, ever.  Furthermore, my 10 year old daughter is one of the few in her peer group in Southern CA who doesn't have a smartphone. I have gone to great lengths to put a moat around my daughters and control what outside influences of the world are able to get to them at this age.  This does not mean that my daughters are sheltered or naive. Rather, my daughters and I have frank conversations about love, sex, drug use, alcohol, making big decisions, and consequences; positive and negative. Furthermore, I have real conversations with them about mistakes I've made. The internet is a wonderful resource and I'm grateful for technology developments that has made information so easy to access.  But I would never let my children wander around in a large city alone and in the dark;  by the same token I will keep the world at bay as long as possible. Innocence is a beautiful thing, and once it leaves us, you can't reclaim it.
