★What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
Easy.  Evidence. Either God and the supernatural interacts with our reality in some way, in which case we can study that influence and have some kind of evidence, Or, they don't, in which case whether they exist or not, we cannot possibly know, but either way, it is entirely irrelevant to us. This is a catch-22 that destroys faith-based religion... unless they have evidence.  In which case they wouldn't need faith.  So never mind, it just destroys faith-based religion.
