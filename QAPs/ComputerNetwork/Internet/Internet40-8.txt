â˜…Who will be the leading companies of the Internet of Things?Everything relating to the ethos of connecting the worlds devices to the web makes sense. I wonder in what timeframe it will play out? And who will be the leaders of this wave of technology.
My guess is that the global product brands that we all know will be the leaders - Apple is selling IoT products (example - 94Fifty's connected Basketball) through it web shop along with other partners' IoT products. I suspect many of these things will be start-ups that lead the way and then acquired by the Nike's, Apple's and Google's of this world in the coming 1-3 years - similar to the Nest story. Also look out for the home goods (Samsung, Whirlpool, Electrolux, etc.) to offer more and more connected products. Until the smart/connected home platform dust settles, they'll likely be standalone products with dedicated smartphone apps and miss out on the real benefit of being in a ecosystem - but that will likely play out over the next 5 years. A start-up may be able to get the smart/connected home platform ecosystem to rally around a common ecosystem, but I would guess that it likely to be an established player on the distribution side that could make it happen.
