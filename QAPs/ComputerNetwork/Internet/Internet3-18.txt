★What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
I'll add one more to this fantastic list: Bitcoin and Bitcoin like technologies (Ethereum, Ripple, Alternate block chains etc). **Note: I'm not referring to  Bitcoin the "currency" but the underlying protocol. In short, it enables decentralized, minimal trust contracts. This has large scale implications that sweep across national, technical and industry boundaries. One very apt description by a hacker news-er is to think of it as "an open protocol for ownership" (Bitcoin 2.0 explained | Hacker News). It's likely to end up becoming an important enabling technology for many things, but I suspect it'll go mostly unnoticed to the general consumers of these services (much like TCP or HTTP does today on the web). While still very young, we're just now starting to tap into the possibilities.
