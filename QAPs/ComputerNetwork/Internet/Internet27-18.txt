â˜…What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
You have about as much chance of "converting atheists" over the internet as some heathen has of convincing you that Christianity (and every other religion in the world) is a totally constructed, man-made dogma that has no basis in fact whatsoever. There is no "way." You are simply viewing this topic through a prism of delusion and religious indoctrination.
