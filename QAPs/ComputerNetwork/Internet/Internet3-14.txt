â˜…What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
If we keep it within the Internet, I think it will be about how we use the information from the social networks in order to target people to their needs. The last decade has been about building the social network, ended up with Facebook.. obviously. Now it will be about using that information to satisfy people's needs, either by connecting them or by assisting them physically and mentally through applications and vice versa.
