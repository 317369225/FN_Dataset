â˜…What innate traits do great Internet product leaders share?If you were setting up a program to train user-focused Internet product leaders/creators, what are the traits you'd look for in candidates that can't be easily taught?
I have been watching Loic Le Meur and noticed his hands on approach to the internet space, where he evolves himself both physically and mentally, through both interaction and broadcast. That kind of model, where you first interact, then evolve, then broadcast, is where, I think, the differentiator lies.
