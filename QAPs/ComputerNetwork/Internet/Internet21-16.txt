★How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
With all due respect to Yishan Wong's article, I find it to one of the most elitist and uninformed piece of....(OK Glen, BNBR!)...stuff I have seen. I often went to the library to research microfilm and microfiche records of historical events; I read through every volume of my World Book Encyclopedia (over a number of years) as well as learning to love the Encyclopedia Brittanica as a research source. I learned the Dewey Decimal System to navigate my way through the mountains of books and written literature available to me. I was never bored. If I BEGAN to get bored, my friends and I would go hiking, learning the trees, birds and plant life we came across, often taking notes and crude pictures to research later, as we wanted. I never found the majority of people as dumb and uninteresting as Mr. Wong seems to have, and I don't think I am very happy with his tone of knowing how, and why, I lived my life..before the Internet. At 65 years of age,  I think I have a right to my comments, and to refuse the validity of his.
