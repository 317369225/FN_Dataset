â˜…Is the Internet spoiling young children?
Children who choose the wrong path always have chosen that. What medium they chose in the earlier times was different. The medium now may be Internet (of many others). In India, I see the current generation is better than the previous in many terms. They are fine to share freely (until they become elders), are tolerant to fellow people, civilized, behave well and accept other coloured people, are concerned about environment, give women their importance, respect; share domestic work (help wife); do not spit on roads; do not spoil monuments; are highly confident that they can be big names some point of time; have very less hatred to Pakistan (We used to hate Pakistan a lot). They may not respect parents, but they love them a lot. I can understand that bit. They have access to a huge world. Parents are no longer their world. So they know much more than their parents. Am I being over positive? I work with thousands of engineering students who are between 18 - 21. They may not be children. But are close representative of the next generation.
