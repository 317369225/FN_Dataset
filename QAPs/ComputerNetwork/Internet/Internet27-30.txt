★What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
The question seems a little edgy  for Quora but I will  give you a serious response, okay? As you know, atheists are simply people who don't have a belief in a higher power. Some atheists have thought things through carefully and concluded that the idea of God or a higher power is silly - magical thinking. Others haven't really thought about it much; they never found the subject very interesting. This latter group may not have much exposure to churches or religion. They are often very practical minded people who don't like to waste time dealing with abstract stuff. In a different life, they might have been members of a church or a synagogue or a mosque. In this one, they wouldn't see the point. Don't target those who have thought about the subject carefully and have the most resistance; Try to find people in the other group, those who never thought about religious stuff and always thought of it as more-or-less a waste of time.  Inevitably, they will experience moments of crisis in their lives. Faith offers solutions that, to some, can help. I am tempted to say something cynical here about the utility of those solutions but - you know what? - you asked me a question and I gave my best answer. Good luck with your recruiting.
