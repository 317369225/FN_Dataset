â˜…How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
Bullshitting (e.g. Chatting around the water cooler) Reading (magazines, tabloids,occasionally books) Board games (At lunch breaks) Drinking (DUI's were rare, so drinking was plentiful. Also most companies didn't have the alcohol policies they do today) Getting high (Drugs were cheaper and stronger then it seems. Also several things that are now illegal were not at that time. Also, drug screening was uncommon in many industries, making it unlikely that users would be fired for their usage) Smoking. Lots of smoking.
