★Who will be the leading companies of the Internet of Things?Everything relating to the ethos of connecting the worlds devices to the web makes sense. I wonder in what timeframe it will play out? And who will be the leaders of this wave of technology.
I am answering this question in the context companies that would enable IoT or IoT solutions for their customers: Apple (IOS Devices, and the unifying framework HomeKit) Nest (Google) with additional acquisitions  - DropCam, Revolv and the launch of Thread Initiative. Google (along with Nest Labs) - large projects internally that will converge on discovery, automation, and autonomous behavior - all elements of IoT. Cisco IBM GE SAP [Plugging IoT into Enterprise Applications is the primary theme] Oracle [Enterprise Integration PLUS Java on the Embedded front] Bosch [Appliances, EV Chargers, Software, etc. - Many products that will benefit as Bosch begins to enable them for IoT] Schneider Electric Honeywell Rockwell Automation Semiconductor: Qualcomm, Intel, Texas Instruments, Marvell, Broadcom, Freescale, NXP among the large ones Startups - It is early, and there is lot of hype around IoT. Things will need to shake out.
