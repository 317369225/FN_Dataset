â˜…Who will be the leading companies of the Internet of Things?Everything relating to the ethos of connecting the worlds devices to the web makes sense. I wonder in what timeframe it will play out? And who will be the leaders of this wave of technology.
There are definitely plenty of companies already providing connected devices. The most beneficial and lucrative ideas are going to be action-based companies that can streamline our everyday lives. Right now, there are a slew of companies are learning to harness personal data in order to make those predictable actions possible. Take a look at Sherbit (my company) - We take the data from all of your connected devices (which are typically interactive due to an app on your smartphone) and transfer it into one central hub (another app on your phone) that acts like a search engine to show you how all of those devices affect your everyday life. You can tie in health & diet, fitness, productivity, finance, conservation, etc. Once you have a steady amount of data, you can see just how all of those devices work together within your life (or don't). Eventually, that data will be able to help you make decisions on what stays and what goes. Everything is personal to each user, so it's an ever expanding business - currently about $13B. Knowing what companies will dominate is absolutely about what companies can continue to generate a content-based strategy to educate their users about the latest personal technology and devices.
