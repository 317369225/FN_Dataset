â˜…What are the real-life equivalents of "Trolling on the Internet" ?
I present for your consideration The Westboro Baptish Church. Here's one of their less-offensive messages: Sometimes they turn it up a notch: Sometimes they go completely over the top: And they've been known to do their thing at funerals for fallen soldiers. I've heard (from a non-authoritative source, mind you) that their real purpose is to provoke passers-by into assaulting them, or provoke police/governments into violating their civil rights (right to assemble, right to speak, etc) so that they can file civil suits and collect damages. In other words, their whole purpose is, allegedly, trolling for money. So apparently only amateurs do it for the lulz.
