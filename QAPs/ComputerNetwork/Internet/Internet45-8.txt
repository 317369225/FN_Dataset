â˜…When will China join the rest of the world on the real Internet?
China will never join the rest of the world on U.S dominated internet world. Internet products are all about habits and cultures, and Chinese are very different from Americans. Take social network for example, Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest are very popular in the U.S, but similar products are not welcomed in China. Chinese Facebook site Renren has been dying for years, and Chinese copies of Instagram or Pinterest have never drawn enough attention from local users. The most popular social network app in China is Weixin, an indigeneous Chinese idea. Another example is web UI. Most American website's UI looks overly simple to most Chinese people. On the other hand, Chinese websites are inclined to provide more information on a single page, which appears clumsy to western users. The way we use internet is quite different from Americans and we are more and more proud to stay this way.
