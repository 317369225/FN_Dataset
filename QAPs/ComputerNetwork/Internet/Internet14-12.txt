★What is the best way to learn internet marketing?
If you want to learn, utilize Youtube.  You will find many introductory videos on Internet Marketing, Google Analytics, Google Adwords etc.. Once you have viewed a few helpful videos, then you can dig further online and learn even more.  Google topics you hear about on Youtube and learn more about them. This is exactly what I did and now have a successful company -- all self taught.
