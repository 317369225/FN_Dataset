★What is the scariest thing you have experienced on the Internet?
I stay far away from the dark side of the internet. However, one day in the early 00's, I was homeschooling my kids, who were in kindergarten and second grade. I wanted to show them a picture of the White House in Washington D.C. So I just entered: "www.whitehouse.com".  The browser opened right to a porn site, complete with full frontal men in large pictures on the home page!  It scared all three of us!  I should have entered "www.whitehouse.gov" instead!
