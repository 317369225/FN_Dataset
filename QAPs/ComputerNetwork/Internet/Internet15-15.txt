★What consumer Internet companies had a large number of users but failed to monetize?How large were the companies, and how did their monetization strategies fail? I'm specifically interested in revenues, rather than profit. E.g., YouTube had lots of users and revenues, but minimal profits. I'm interested in lots of users and minimal revenues.
In the voice services space there were quite a few flops.  The increased cost of providing free services was an obstacle that was frequently underestimated (as was also the case of the free dialup ISPs like NetZero, 1stUp, Spinway, et al). Voice services that built large followings but couldn't monetize include: SpinVox (b. 2003 d. 2009)  Raised $106M and sold for $102M eVoice (b. 1999 d. 2001) Raised >$80M and sold for <$3M OneBox (b. 1998 d. 2000) Raised >$75M and sold for $850M All were credible, highly-touted businesses with great press and tons of consumer adoption.  All forced to exit after blowing scads of money servicing large consumer audiences with no revenue model.  OneBox.com had <$1M in revenue on 2.5 million users when it sold.
