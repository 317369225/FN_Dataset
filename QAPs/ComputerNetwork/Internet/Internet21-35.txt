â˜…How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
A millenial's answer: I was pretty young in the pre-internet era, but I remember physical toys and games being much more important than they are now. Things my friends and I did in the early 90s: 1. Invent 20 different types of "tag": lava monster, kick the can, stuck in the mud, etc. 2. Red Rover 3. Mancala/other board games (before school, after school...a lot of games) 4. Bop-it (great way to waste time if there ever was one) 5. Read joke books aloud to each other 6. Legos 7. Explore the suburbs on bike, make fun of the weird-looking houses (children are so cruel) 8. Wreak havoc at the mall (try everything on, buy nothing) Things I did by myself to waste time: 1. Walk around and think 2. Journal 3. Read 4. And of course....Watch TV! A lot of TV. I probably spent as much time watching TV as kids today spend on the computer surfing the web. Now my question is...how did people waste time before TV? Before books? Before speech? I suppose walking and thinking have always been around. But was that really considered time wasted?
