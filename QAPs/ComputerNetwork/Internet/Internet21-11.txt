★How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
Oh, this one's easy for me. My Google was the local library or the bookstore. I'd peek into a place like this bookstore and get all excited. All the questions I wanted to ask, I could find answers to here. I'd go to a particular section, depending on what subject was interesting to me at the time: Linguistics, History, Travel, Fiction... and I'd thumb through the books. I might even buy one or two. I could spend hours in a bookstore. If there were nice comfy chairs, I'd get me a stack of books to look through - Poetry, Art, Literature. When I wasn't in bookstores, I'd go for a bike ride along the river to my favorite cafe in the city. I'd order me a mocha and sourdough toast, pull out my journal and start writing. And I always carried a book and something to write on with me, so I was never caught with nothing to do. (Now I bring my iPad.) Now, if I have time to kill, I fire up my laptop or iPad. If I have subjects to research, I ask Google or Quora, browse through Twitter, or go check through Facebook, all of which I can do sitting down staring at a screen. Back then, even the way I wasted time was better somehow. Actually, when Borders closed was when I really stopped hanging out at  bookstores. There was one near my house, and I used to take my work there and sit in the cafe instead of working at home. I kind of miss the old days.
