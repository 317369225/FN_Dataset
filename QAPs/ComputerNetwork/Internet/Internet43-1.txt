★What are the hottest internet startups in Brazil?
I like Peixe Urbano, Boo-box, Compra3, Apontador, Predicta, Migux, and SambaTech (we are investors in Samba). But there are dozens of great startups, with more opening almost every day.  I agree with Andrew's recommendation, if you want to follow startups in Brazil, the easiest way is to read Startupi and ReadWriteWeb Brasil, which are Brazil's TechCrunch equivalents.
