★Is atheism a fad among Internet users?
Most answers to this question arrive, girded for battle. I'm an atheist but, in prologue, I would say a couple of things: I separate atheists (no belief in a deity) from anti-theists (actively denouncing theism.) I am secure (thus far) in my reasoning for my choice, but this in no way affects anyone else's considerations, which may differ. /prologue. The question IS NOT is atheism a fad. The question is whether it is a fad among internet users. The answer is…could well be. The internet has seen its fads. Kids go through a phase when they like to portray themselves as worldly cynics. That doesn't mean the real worldly cynics don't exist, only that for the kids….it's fad. Many in life (and we can demarcate that with the boundaries of the internet if we please) will try atheism, find it isn't for them, and move on. Same with religions of various stripes. We're all human, it's our nature to explore. The thesis that atheism a fad among Internet users is recent. Too recent, in fact to know the answer to. Only given time can we gain the perspective (and statistics) to say one way or the other. Very possibly it IS a fad, among some internet habitués. If so, it hardly degrades the actual reasoned belief (see? Atheists DO believe) that while there may be natural laws and universal cause and effect scenarios we don't understand, we have come to our own conclusion that there is no great deity watching over us, able to influence our existence or actions. We acknowledge that we are on our own to give life meaning on a personal level, and to make life better on a human level. It's on us. So sure….internet users with an atheism fad? Yeah, I absolutely buy that. Because, to come to atheism as a conclusion, one really ought first to gain the maturity to conclude something.
