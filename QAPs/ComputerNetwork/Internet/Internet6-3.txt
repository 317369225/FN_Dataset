â˜…What are some of the most innovative infographics on the internet?Please add what impressed you about it, and whether you think the infographic would have a lasting impact on the world.

Often they can help us understand the relative scale of things by adding context and comparison in a visual way. A few memorable ones are: Virtual Water: http://virtualwater.eu/ Series from Mother Jones about inequality of wealth in America: http://motherjones.com/politics/...
