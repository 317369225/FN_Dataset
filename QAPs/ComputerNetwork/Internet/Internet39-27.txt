â˜…If you could remove one thing from the Internet forever, what would it be?
Eliminate unsigned email. I would require that all email must be cryptographically (digitally) signed with Public-key Cryptography. That would effectively eliminate spam as I could simply trash all email from unknown senders or from known spammers or from "young" IDs. It would enable private communication since everyone would have an easily obtainable public key for encrypting messages. Basically, I am saying every internet user must have a public/private key pair which would also facilitate single sign-on and ecommerce.
