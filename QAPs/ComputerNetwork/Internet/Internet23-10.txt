★What is the coolest thing I can buy on the internet for under $100?
If you're a student or attend a lot of conferences, an Echo Smartpen is cool and a really good investment. It records the lecturer's voice while you're taking notes and later you can tap anywhere on your notes in order to hear what the lecturer said at that time. No more scrambling to note everything! There are also some cool tricks it can do, like you can draw a piano in your notebook and then you can play real music on it. http://www.livescribe.com/store/...  from $69.95 Admittedly these are refurbished, if you want a brand new one you'll have to pay slightly over $100.
