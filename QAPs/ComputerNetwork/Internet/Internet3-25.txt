â˜…What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
I think it would be some advanced decision making system that will be capable of making wise decisions and recommending choices to the end-user, by leveraging the power of smart search capabilities combined with the huge amount of social data that is present on the web. Such systems would be able to make use of your social interactions, and then suggest places you should visit on weekends, restaurants that would suit your tastes and budgets, jobs that you should apply to, books that you should read, and many more including maybe the person you should be marrying based on previous conversations you have had with her/him in the past. So, I feel it would be a smart decision/recommendation system that will only get better as time progresses and more data gets accumulated.
