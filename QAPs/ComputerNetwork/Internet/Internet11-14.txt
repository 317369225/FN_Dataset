★What is the Internet of Things?
The IoT dream / wish Everything is based on IP Everything has an IP address Everything means really everything Every plug at house, every plug at TV, every plug at every device Every sensor at your home like a temperature sensor Every actor like roller shutter Every device like an iron blade Every dish washer, washing machine or fridge Up to a cardiac pacemaker in your body Will we have enough IP addresses for all plugs and four persons living in the same house for any house on the globe? The IPv6 address range is 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 This mean approx. 6.67 x 10^27IP addresses per square meter on our globe Which technologies to use for the IP communication?One answer is 6LoWPAN The facts about 6LoWPAN Defined by IETF standards Stateless header compression Enables a standard socket API Minimal use of code and memory Direct end-to-end Internet integrationAvailable on Europe: 868.0-868.6 MHz North America: 902-928 MHz Worldwide: 2400-2483.5 MHz Worldwide: IEEE P1901.2 -  Narrow Band Power Line Communications on Low Frequency (less than 500 kHz) Worldwide: Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Bluetooth Low Energy draft http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft... Conclusion: Yes,  there is a standard for the Internet of Things. The base is IP. Wi-Fi  and Ethernet in our laptops, smartphones, tablets and a lot of more are  already on IP. 6LoWPAN is just one more option to use IP for smart  objects in the IoT.
