â˜…Are internet forums dead?There seemed to be a time where everyone congregated on forums. WIth the presence of Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Quora, etc. it seems like people are no longer into forums. Does anyone still use forums for online socialization, asking questions, discussion/hobbies anymore or have internet forums been rendered redundant?
I wouldn't exactly call them dead. I imagine, like some comments below have mentioned, that forums aren't really sure where to go from here. They need to do a better job of integrating into all the other sites (FB, Twitter, etc.) and finding their niche. Something which makes them stand out and become a once more viable place to visit.
