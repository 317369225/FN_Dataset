â˜…Can I use the internet to save my mom, who suffers from Stage IV cancer?
Since so much has been covered, I can only add that as much of a tool as the internet can be, it is not sites that give answers that will help you the most, but ones that help you analyze the data from test results and progress of the treatment. Medical Doctors aren't always the best scientists (of course many are), or at least don't look at complex computational modeling. I don't know your background in regression analysis, but even if you don't have the time to learn more mathematics yourself, the more general tools like Wolfram Alpha, or programs that are are fairly easy to use for analyzing data like Matlab. Let the data tell the story, not the intuition of either you, your Mom or even the doctors. I say this as a cancer survivor myself, who worked with my team as scientists, who dealt with dynamic probabilities. This is why I now know that the very poor odds I had been given when diagnosed were just an aggregate of end stage cases. I may still die of cancer, as all of us might, but knowing that you are making more objective decisions, will bring you some comfort. I am sorry if this seems cold. I nearly have an anxiety attack hearing about cancer, yet it is necessary I have found to be a little more mechanical and less emotionally human when actually trying to solve the problem.
