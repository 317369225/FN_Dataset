â˜…If you could remove one thing from the Internet forever, what would it be?
Pre-Roll video advertising. Banners I can ignore Pop ups I can close in seconds Even pre rolls on YouTube you can skip after 3 seconds are fine But to make me watch a boring "tv ad" lasting thirty seconds with no option to skip, in order to watch maybe a 45-90 second long piece I had vague interest with is not something I will ever do. It's getting worse and right now every single news piece in video form is something I can no longer watch (with my attitude) .... A real shame.
