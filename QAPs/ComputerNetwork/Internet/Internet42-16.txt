â˜…What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1980s?A follow-up question to What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
I think I can just squeak by to chime in on this one. I remember getting online in early 1989 both on the internet and my city's local network of Bulletin Board Systems (BBS's). That squealing static noise that came while the modems were handshaking always seemed exciting -a bit magical. It was a lot smaller. Think about the number of different websites you visit in a month and how many you return to with any regularity. I had about 5 or 7 servers that I visited regularly. Any more than that & I felt like I was spread out too thin. With fewer destinations back then, you got to know the users and admins a lot better at the places you did go. I think the message boards & chat rooms had a greater sense of community then. As a newbie, I was schooled by a friend on the importance of closing with an advanced thank you when asking for help; don't type in all caps; don't attempt sarcasm without a smiley (I still can't bring myself to use the word "emoticon"). I remember getting into a debate forum where my opposition called me a pr*ck right before I left town on vacation. When I got back, half the board's users had jumped into the discussion: "Shame on you, Ralph. He probably isn't coming back now." was the general tone of most of the posts. And Ralph had the decency to BE ashamed by them. We were anonymous, faceless posts to one another, but we tried not to be. Modeming & internet were generally nocturnal activities; everyone's usage spiked at around midnight. Most people only had the one phone line & your friends were likely to send the police to check on you if they got a busy signal for 3 straight hours in the middle of the afternoon.
