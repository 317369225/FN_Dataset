★What will the Internet look like in 2020?I'd like as many different descriptions of what the usage, adoption and structure of the Internet will look like in the year 2020 as possible. Be creative, and try to think outside the box how it will change in the next seven years. Let's see what the current early adopters of the Internet come up with (since we're all using Quora...).
By 2020 information exchanges between people and devices, bots and organizations will be so ambient and seamless that the concept of the The Internet itself will no longer be used in common speech. The Internet will perhaps be a subject of some academic investigation in the same way that language, writing and culture are the domains of academic specialists today.  For example, people today never think 'hey lets solve the problem using language' or 'hey did you engage in any cultural forms passed on by tradition yesterday.'  In this same way, people in 2020 will not think about the Internet because it will always be there.  The internet will simply be assumed part of the fabric of everyday life and therefore invisible to its users. As they say, I don't know who first came up with the idea of water, but it was not a fish.
