â˜…What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
To convert Atheists to theists provide evidence for the existence of god. (Any god, Zeus, Odin, the Flying Pasta Monster... Just not Xenu...please let it not be Xenu) And... then post it online, I guess. Maybe on a Quora blog post. If it's Christianity you want, well, focus on Jehovah and Jesus. Mind you, you'd be closing a lot of options for yourself.
