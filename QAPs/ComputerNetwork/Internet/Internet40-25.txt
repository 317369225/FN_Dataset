★Who will be the leading companies of the Internet of Things?Everything relating to the ethos of connecting the worlds devices to the web makes sense. I wonder in what timeframe it will play out? And who will be the leaders of this wave of technology.
Today the world has more non-humans are connected to internet than actual humans, and this imbalance is only going to grow in the coming years. Internet of things is the future, home-based appliances are some of the most popular “smart” items, but the possibilities include any object that can be given the ability to transmit any kind of data along with a specialized IP address. Every company is trying its best to bring out an outstanding IoT product, About 15 percent of companies already have IoT solutions in place such as Google, Cisco, Intel, Oracle, Samsung, and Hitachi, while 28 percent of companies will have IoT solutions in place in the next 12 month.  As for other companies, , 25 percent plan on establishing IoT solutions in the next one-to-two years, with 14 percent planning on setting up IoT solutions in the next two-to-five years. The company I work for, Click Labs has developed quite a lot of IoT products like Boombotix sync app, health sensors and analytics, 3D scanning and printing and many more. We hope to make several more such products and make the lives of people easier.
