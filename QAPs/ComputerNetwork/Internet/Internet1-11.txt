â˜…What will the Internet look like in 2020?I'd like as many different descriptions of what the usage, adoption and structure of the Internet will look like in the year 2020 as possible. Be creative, and try to think outside the box how it will change in the next seven years. Let's see what the current early adopters of the Internet come up with (since we're all using Quora...).
My business depends on guessing correctly what is coming is 5 years and 'guess' is the correct word. In 1991 my mobile phone weighed 5 kgs, had an antenna almost as tall as I am, needed a handset, was carried in a satchel and all it did was make phone calls. If someone told me back then my mobile phone, monster of a desk top computer, with no internet capability, my still photo and movie cameras, a GPS (which only the military could afford), my entire collection of music cassettes, TV, all the books in my home library and more video games than in an arcade would fit in my shirt pocket I'd have laughed at them. So my prediction for what the internet will be 10 years hence... faster, hated even more by governments than it is currently, and accessed a lot different than today. We'll probably be using holographic monitors, voice instead of keyboard commands, and it will all be compressed to fit into something permanently implanted somewhere on our bodies for convince. As a bonus our personal internet connections will be able to constantly monitor our vitals and upload them a central medical data centre, allow us to buy anything and have our ebank accounts instantly debited, board a plane without the need to be scanned, search, questioned or xrayed... and the list goes on.
