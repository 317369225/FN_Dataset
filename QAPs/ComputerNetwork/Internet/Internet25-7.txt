â˜…Are relationships on the Internet really real?Without any sound, facial expressions, or any kind actual, physical human interaction beyond sending lines of text to one another, words which one can edit and second guess prior to sending, are human relationships over the internet really human or are they actually superficial and fake to some degree?
This is indeed arguable. It is possible to feel love for someone, whether tangible or not. I believe that a person may develop romantic feelings for a person based on the same triggers of attraction based on percieved notions (looks, personality, humor, socioeconomic status, etc...) as "real" dating, however the physical chemistry of attraction is blocked (audible voice, poise, pheremones). When meeting for the first time, even the most promising mates can seem repulsive in mannerisms. This successful convergence is critical to the romantic growth of the relationship.
