★What are some of the best education websites on the Internet?
I am currently working on Unimersiv, a platform to learn through virtual reality and we are working hard tu push VR education further. As research has shown, students remember 20% of what they hear, 30% of what they see and up to 90% of what they do or simulate. Virtual reality yields the latter scenario impeccably; students can interact with the virtual environment in person and manipulate the various objects within it. This supports “learning by doing” and also results in creativity by constructionism. What I believe is that VR may be an amazing technology to learn history or sciences, there are already some very interesting educational experiences available on the platform: - The Apollo 11 Experience (Demo) - Titans of Space
