â˜…What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
It looks like a combination of search+social can be the next big thing at least in the nearest future. With the launch of Google Me and Facebook's cooperation with Bing, search experience will become fully personalized and based on social recommendations. The search engine will give you very targeted results even before you will think what you want to look for (like Google Now does). This will have a big impact on SEM and the online shopping behaviors. Taking under consideration that 90% of consumers trust peer recommendations and only 14% trust advertisement it will be all about likes, +1s' and stars in the decision-making process.
