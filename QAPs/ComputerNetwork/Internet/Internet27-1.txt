★What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
Catch people at their worst. Grief counseling sites, sexual assault survivor sites, bankruptcy sites. Proselytizing works best on people who are emotionally vulnerable.  Target the nones. Target people who are culturally Christian but don't think about religion much. Their thinking is likely to be fuzzy and vulnerable. They won't have seen your bad arguments before. "If humans evolved from monkeys,  why are there still monkeys?" won't evoke peals of laughter. Isolate the target. Convince them that only your church cares about them. Smother them with love. Begin to slowly withdraw love if they fail to profess whatever you want them to believe. Go slowly, so it doesn't strike them as the manipulation that it is. Eventually get them into a church for a high pressure altar call. Humans will kill other humans in situations like this; conversion is much less difficult. And there you go.  A soul saved. I mean, sure, it's a completely unethical and cruel thing to do to a person. But you asked.
