â˜…What is the coolest thing I can buy on the internet for under $100?
Amazon Prime (if you live in the US). For $79 you get unlimited free two-day shipping from Amazon (company) for a year. They also let you extend the free shipping to four family members. In my opinion, joining Amazon Prime is a no-brainer. As a bonus, there's a ton of free video content for Prime members in Amazon's streaming video library. It's not enough of a selection to compete directly with Netflix, but when I'm bored and want to watch something, I can always find something cool there. As an additional bonus, there's a lending library for Prime members who also own Kindles.
