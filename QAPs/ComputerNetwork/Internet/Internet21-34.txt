★How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
Number one was books.  I always had something to read.  Often it was technical, but it was fiction fairly regularly. Computer code.  I spent a lot of time programming my 8 bit computers.  Talking to people about lots of stuff. Play.  Sometimes goofy things, jokes, but other time games.  One place I worked had pool tables setup.  Perfect idle distraction. Tinker or build.  Little bit of time would lead to small projects.
