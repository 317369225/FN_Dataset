â˜…What will the Internet look like in 2020?I'd like as many different descriptions of what the usage, adoption and structure of the Internet will look like in the year 2020 as possible. Be creative, and try to think outside the box how it will change in the next seven years. Let's see what the current early adopters of the Internet come up with (since we're all using Quora...).
Internet in 2020 will be: - Everywhere and universally accessible (yes, that includes 3rd world countries) - A lot of today services like telephone, radio, TV and more will migrate completely to the Internet - Information will be able to interact freely to create more and new information - Everything that's electric or has a chip in it wil be able to connect to the Internet
