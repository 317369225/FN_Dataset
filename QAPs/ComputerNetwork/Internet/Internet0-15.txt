â˜…What are the most productive ways to spend time on the Internet?Please go through at least the top 20-40 answers (if not all) before answering the question. There have been numerous repeated answers which do not add to the quality of the information. Also, please don't answer Quora.com
The best ones are already there in the answers. One website that I would add to the list is Blinkist (not sure if it already there) - www.blinkist.com Blinkist summarizes the most important concepts of a non-fiction book, and allows you to get the gist of the entire book in just 15 - 20 minutes. It has a pretty decent collection of books and a great tablet/mobile app.
