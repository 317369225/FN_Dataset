â˜…What was it like to be a programmer without the Internet?When there were no online documentation, no Google, no StackOverflow...
If you don't mind I'll report what I wrote here: Dan Piponi's answer to How did people live before Google Search? I was thinking about when I was 15 or 16 trying to write 3D rendering code in 6502 assembly language. I had no idea about the mathematics of rendering. I had no books on the subject. I had no access to a library with such books. (Actually, nobody had told me I could order books on esoteric subjects.) I couldn't afford any books on 3D. My teachers couldn't help me. All I had were a few clues here and there. I must have seen the Bresenham line drawing algorithm in a magazine. I think I guessed that I could project by dividing by z. I had learnt enough at school to use matrices for rotations. But every scrap of information was hard earned. I think my main source of computing knowledge was memorizing stuff I discovered in expensive books while browsing Foyle's book store in London. Nowadays it takes a second to find out what might have taken me months to find out as a kid. It's a very different world today.
