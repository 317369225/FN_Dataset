★Is the Internet spoiling young children?
I first got my laptop freshman year of high school. If I had never decided to get a computer I wouldn't be where I am now. I just started a business at 16 which was because of my computer since I got my idea for it online. I wouldn't have learned coding and would of never known what it even was.  I wouldn't be on Quora right now, learning everyday about different things. Computers have definitely changed my life in a good way.
