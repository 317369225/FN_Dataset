â˜…When will China join the rest of the world on the real Internet?
You seem to have it backwards - the Chinese internet is not hidden behind the GFW; you are free to get accounts on Weibo, Weixin, Youku, etc from wherever you are. But you don't even have to do that - finding Chinese people to chat with (in English or Chinese) is easy anywhere on the internet. Weixin (Wechat) even provides their app in English. And the Chinese internet is plenty real, it's just a slightly different neighborhood than the ones you're used to.
