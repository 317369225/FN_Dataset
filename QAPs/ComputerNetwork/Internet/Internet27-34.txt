★What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
The only way to convince an atheist to believe in anything is to provide solid evidence to prove its validity. You will find  that no evidence whatsoever has been found that supports the Christian worldview. PS: The Bible is not considered a valid source to present "evidence" from.
