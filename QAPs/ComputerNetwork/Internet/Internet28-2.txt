★What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
Ah, internet in the 90's... sitting up all night in the university computer lab (because there was no ethernet in the dorm yet), fiddling with Notepad to write HTML that you had to save and upload before you could actually see the effects of what you had written.  No AOL Wordpress (!), no way to see how an image or color would look... it was like a little surprise party every time a page opened.  Except when it wouldn't open, or opened all wrong... that was more like a surprise mugging. And then, on breaks when you left campus, you couldn't always dial up directly to the university system (where all your email and your files were living), so you had to dial up to the state library system instead and find your way over to the university system from there...  entirely with keystroke command-line stuff, no helpful graphical interface.  Oh, and the fun of discovering "chat rooms" in the 90's! Strangers mingling under assumed user names, flailing around in an unmoderated mess of emoticons, flame wars, and all around hilarity.  Heck of a way to break out of a sheltered upbringing.  In short... it was fantastic.
