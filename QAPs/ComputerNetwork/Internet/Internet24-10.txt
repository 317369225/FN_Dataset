★What does a bad internet connection teach you?Though a bad internet connection is a pain in the ass,it does teach you some valuable lessons.
It taught me to use "mosh", a shell from folks at MIT designed for bad internet connections. the mobile shell I'm reassured though that whatever internet connection I have now is better than this one, from 1992, the first account I have found of connecting to the Internet from an airplane.

 This message is being composed with mh/comp running in an x11r5/xterm on an IBM PS-2 model l40-sx running mach 2.6, on Northwest flight 181, which departed Detroit at 9:30 and is due in San Jose at 14:45. It will be delivered with smtp as soon as I get a chance, probably when I reach Tahoe City. [I was able to send it from the San Jose airport.] I brought up slip over GTE Airfone with a Konex Koupler model 203 acoustic coupler and a Telebit Qblazer running at 300 baud. The acoustic coupler is a good match for the airfone -- I was able to make a very snug coupling. I buried the mated pair under pillows. The Microport 4232 modem was uncooperative, and started complaining about a low battery before I was able to establish a connection. With the Qblazer, I was unable to connect to the remote Worldblazer at high baud rates, but I did get a 300 baud connection going, whereupon I brought up slip.
