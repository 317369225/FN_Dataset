★Who are the best internet marketers?
You should look for someone who has results in what you are trying to accomplish.  Be careful of the so called internet guru's.  Many of them are only good at selling make money advice and their programs are complete garbage.  Ryan Dice is an example of that. For SEO, Bring The Fresh is a good program. For how to convert visitors into buyers, The Conversions Rate Experts are good. For business strategy, Micheal Masterson is good.  Start with Ready, Fire Aim.
