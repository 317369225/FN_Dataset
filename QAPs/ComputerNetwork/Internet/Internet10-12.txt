â˜…Is the Internet spoiling young children?
My sister is a teacher in a Secondary School, 12-18 year old's and their biggest problem is children coming to school exhausted because they are up all night using devices. This is not the internets fault. It is absolutely possible for parents to institute some kind of devices curfew, but unfortunately there are parents out there who aren't willing to supervise their kids to that extent and that is a problem.
