â˜…What will the Internet look like in 2020?I'd like as many different descriptions of what the usage, adoption and structure of the Internet will look like in the year 2020 as possible. Be creative, and try to think outside the box how it will change in the next seven years. Let's see what the current early adopters of the Internet come up with (since we're all using Quora...).
Search will change. Instead of searching for the keywords, we'll be searching for the concept. For example, if I want to find out about radiative recombination of electron hole pair today, I would search for "electron-hole pair radiative recombination". This search might exclude some results which are very relevant to me but do not use the same terminology as my keywords do. Whereas, a search for the concept will show all devices, experiments, etc where the idea of e-h pair recombination has been used or implemented irrespective of their terminology. This kind of a search will be very useful for researchers particularly.
