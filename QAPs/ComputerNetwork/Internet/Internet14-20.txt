â˜…What is the best way to learn internet marketing?
YouTube is a great way of going if you want to see it and try some of the principles as you are watching. You also will want to subscribe to a few blogs in the industry. I have created a series on my blog that will be good for you just starting out at www.paultherond.com, which explains online marketing on a small budget. All the best.
