â˜…What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
"Search" can be equated to connecting people to information. "Social" can be equated to connecting people to each other. The next paradigm on the Internet will be about connecting people with the physical objects (appliances) around them and physical objects to each other, in more seamless ways. The driver-less car is an example of this, where we are better "connected" with our car, or the car can better "connect" with other cars on the road for preventing accidents, etc.
