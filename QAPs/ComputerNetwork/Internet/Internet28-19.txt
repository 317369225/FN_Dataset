â˜…What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
I first used in the internet in 95 or 96 (don't remember which now, god that was almost 20 years ago, where's the time gone?), websites were a lot simpler of course, no fancy javascript and stuff like that or at least very little of it, and of course you had to disconnect from the net if somebody wanted to use the phone because the internet took over the phone lines so you couldn't use both at once. And you had a modem that made screechy noises when it dialed into the network.
