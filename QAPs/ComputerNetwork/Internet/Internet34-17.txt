â˜…Can I use the internet to save my mom, who suffers from Stage IV cancer?
I was in the same situation last year, and Jae Won Joh's answer covers it all. Take heed of the following lines: "go to your mother, and help her smile. She does not need you on the internet. She needs you at her side. Your presence alone will mean worlds to her." Your time and energies are much, much, MUCH better spent assisting her and comforting her. To whatever extent possible, take ownership of all of her concerns (giving her her meds on time, scheduling her appointments, etc.). Let her sweet soul rest and be comfortable without a worry in the world, thus making it easier for her to replenish her strength and have enjoyable and meaningful moments with her family. This is both for your sake and hers. Once the time comes, as it does for us all, whether it be next week or in 30 years, there is often a feeling that you didn't do enough and didn't spend enough time with your loved one. No matter how much you do, after they are gone, it is never enough. So spend as much time with her now so that you have (unfortunately only slightly) less regret later on. Wishing you and your family all the best.
