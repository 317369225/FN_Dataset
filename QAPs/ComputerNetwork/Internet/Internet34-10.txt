★Can I use the internet to save my mom, who suffers from Stage IV cancer?
You should head over to American Cancer Online Resources (ACOR) and join one of the support groups which address your Mom's cancer specifically.  I saved my own life on the Internet and support from the community of patients on ACOR has been marvelous.  Here's a bit about my story (http://e-patients.net/archives/2010/05/it-takes-guts-to-be-a-neuroendocrine-patient-a-story-of-participatory-medicine.html).  I hope this helps you.    One additional point I would highlight is that cancer is very tough on the family caregivers too.  Make sure you are resting well and keeping your own immune resistance high so that you can be there for you Mom.
