â˜…What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
I would suggest an advertisement, something like this: ATTENTION ATHEISTS! ARE YOU UNHAPPY WITH YOUR CURRENT NON-BELIEF??? ARE YOU TIRED OF NOT GETTING ANY PROMISES OF EVERLASTING LIFE? ARE YOU TIRED OF NOT HAVING A LOVING HEAVENLY FATHER? ARE YOU TIRED OF NOT HAVING HAPPY, CARING FRIENDS? ARE YOU TIRED OF NOT GETTING CALLS FROM MISSIONARIES? TALK TO OUR REPS! ASK THEM IF THEY ARE HAPPY! INVESTIGATE OUR 2,000+ YEARS IN BUSINESS, OUR MILLIONS OF CLIENTS, AND OUR PERFECT REPUTATION! NOTE: CURRENT ATHEISTS AND AGNOSTICS ONLY! MUST SHOW PROOF OF CURRENT LACK OF BELIEF!
