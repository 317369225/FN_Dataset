â˜…What is the coolest thing I can buy on the internet for under $100?
For under USD$100.00 you could buy online one if the new HuMn wallets. HuMn wallets are great for protecting your new RFID enabled credit cards (and other RFID documents such as your driver license) against unauthorized and inadvertently scanning (now known as skimming). HuMn wallets are also thin, portable, durable and cool you can customize the wallet number of plates and its colors. Makes a great gift as well. Take a look at: http://humnwallet.com
