â˜…What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1980s?A follow-up question to What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
A 300 Baud acoustic coupled dial-up modem. You had to choose phone or Internet, not both at the same time. Slow. After you heard this: You had to be able to speak DOS (disk operating system) in the IBM age. Did I say slow? It took 15 minutes in 1984 to send a short text message to and from the USA to France. It was amazing at the time. It was so new, you were on your own, no one else to ask for help. It is now so different, more different from pre-Internet (telephone only) to now with instant transmission, video, images, and voice. and portable (here now answering on WIFI from my phone). We were rare then, but now it is almost a necessity.
