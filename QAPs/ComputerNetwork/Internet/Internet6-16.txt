★What are some of the most innovative infographics on the internet?Please add what impressed you about it, and whether you think the infographic would have a lasting impact on the world.
I am fascinated with well-constructed infographics.   I manage a UX department and even though we have some world class interaction and visual designers, few of them have really mastered the art of infographics --- so we are sharing a journey together to grow this capability.   Of course, most people might be familiar with the Minard diagram; probably the most seminal and early work but i'll offer it as a starting point, and hope to see the more modern inspirations others offer! Fast forward to a modern context, and this guy actually proposed wedding through an interesting Infographic!
