â˜…Will the Internet ever become obsolete?
"The Internet" has already been obsoleted several times. The Internet is an evolving collection of technologies. They're often presented in layers: (Image credit: Internet Foundations) The whole idea is that you should be able to strip out one layer and replace it without disturbing the others. This occurs frequently, often without non-technical users noticing. The bottommost layer changes all the time, as we went from dial-up to fiber and wireless. The topmost layers can shift over time as well; they rarely disappear completely but are replaced with superior protocols or are obsoleted by other ideas. (Telnet, for example, has security issues and has been largely replaced). The middle layers, TCP and IP, have been quite stable. We're in the middle of shifting to a new version, a process going more slowly than one might hope, but it is happening. They're incredibly generic, and with the newly-expanded addressing space, it's hard to imagine that we'd ever find something to replace it. But there is ongoing research and who knows what wacky things we'll find? The topmost layer, the Web, has been wildly revamped numerous times. The oldest web pages work because they were trivial, but many pages using intermediate ideas don't render in a modern browser. If you were to take many of your devices back in time, you'd have no way of connecting to "the Internet" as it existed then. Many old devices no longer work today without cobbling in new connections. And you can be pretty sure that many of your existing devices will gradually get less and less connectable as time goes on.
