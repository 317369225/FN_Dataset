★What are the hottest startups in India?
Providing food in train is not an easy task. To top it all, facilitating this service in one of the largest railway networks in the world - the Indian Railways - this startup definitely has to feature as the hottest startup in India! RailTiffin…Order food in trains! Call 086-5588-5588 When I first heard of RailTiffin from a friend, the concept sounded fabulous but I couldn't even imagine the kind of logistics one would need to deliver meals to passengers on 1500+ trains running through 120+ railway stations across the country! But this startup has done a good job in their attempt to make our train journeys more enjoyable & hassle-free by providing fresh, tasty & hot train food at our seats.
