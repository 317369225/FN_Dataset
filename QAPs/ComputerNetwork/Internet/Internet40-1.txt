â˜…Who will be the leading companies of the Internet of Things?Everything relating to the ethos of connecting the worlds devices to the web makes sense. I wonder in what timeframe it will play out? And who will be the leaders of this wave of technology.
Samsung is the obvious candidate. They already have a massive competitive advantage in everything from refrigerators to TVs, washer/dryers, dish washers, and air conditioners. The only other candidate with such momentum (and a presence in computing) is LG, and I would guess they probably won't be very far behind Samsung.
