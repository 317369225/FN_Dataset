â˜…What will the Internet look like in 2020?I'd like as many different descriptions of what the usage, adoption and structure of the Internet will look like in the year 2020 as possible. Be creative, and try to think outside the box how it will change in the next seven years. Let's see what the current early adopters of the Internet come up with (since we're all using Quora...).
Cleaner, more consolidated, and easier to navigate with your voice. There's a lot of jumping around online you have to do. You run over to Facebook for this, Tweet that, Yelp that cup of tea, and Instagram that weird feather. I think the future of the Internet will be a more consolidated place. All of those sites will be better linked with each other and more Apps will come along to help with that. I also think voice technology will become more and more helpful as time passes. Think Siri...but a thousand times better.
