â˜…Are relationships on the Internet really real?Without any sound, facial expressions, or any kind actual, physical human interaction beyond sending lines of text to one another, words which one can edit and second guess prior to sending, are human relationships over the internet really human or are they actually superficial and fake to some degree?
Virtual relationships have existed for centuries. Before the web and telephones, people wrote letters. In the 80s, I corresponded with someone for several years. We wrote long, deeply personal letters to each other every day. I loved getting the mail and I pined when there wasn't a letter from my friend. That was more meaningful relationship to me than some proximate ones I've had. I'm sure physical presence is vital for some people. Everyone's different. In my case, I haven't noticed a big difference between online and off. I have both meaningful and shallow relationships offline, and the same is true for my relationships on the web. One thing to keep in mind is that some people are shy. Extroverts tend to do better in person. At least some introverts find it easier to open up via letters, phone conversations (though I loathe the phone) and online interactions. There's one guy I consider a very close friend. We live in the same city. However, we're both shy, and when we're in a room together, it's awkward, because neither of us initiates anything. But he loves to write and so do I. Online, we're gregarious.
