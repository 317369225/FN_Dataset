★Can I use the internet to save my mom, who suffers from Stage IV cancer?
I'm so sorry about your Mom. I fully agree with Jae Won Joh, I too lost a father to cancer when I was a lot younger.  He at that time was about my age now..... You didn't do anything wrong, since your mother, like so many other ovarian cancer patients, was diagnosed very late in stage IIIC.  Looking at survival, ovarian cancer is one of the best treatable(≠curable) cancers in coming into remission on drugs therapy like you described, the other more favorable ones being testicular cancer, malignant lymphoma and breast cancer, which still claims a lot of lives. Each relapse is harder to treat and in the end nothing works, like you stated. Beware of people on dubious websites trying to make a profit from your desperation, making you pay lots of money for some "miracle cure", always accompanied by anecdotal stories how so and so was miraculously cured, but never backed up by any scientific research, they will blame big pharma for not being able to set up a decent research trial on their "cure". The more bonafide websites as you have seen show you the bare facts, which you find depressing, but better to know than to succumb to your intense desire to do some good for you Mom and follow some very costly useless alternate "therapy" or "healing". Wishing you and your whole family a lot of strength and fortitude in the coming months, and all the best.
