â˜…Is the Internet spoiling young children?
Deciding what people should and shouldn't learn is an unsustainable position. Education breaks down barriers and teaches people to think for themselves and find out for themselves. That reduces the power of those who try to control them. Secondly the world is full of bad advice, wrong thinking and deliberate falsehoods. News isn't fact - it is opinion. Encyclopedias, online or printed, are wrong. Every white paper, fact sheet or treatise contains bias. Our version of what is true is true only to us. But if you educate people, then they learn to sort out the lies from the truth. Education isn't about regurgitating knowledge. It is about giving people the skills to evaluate information fed to them from whatever source, to work out how to find out more when they need to and how to recognise when information is being manipulated. Teach your children to ask questions, not accept whatever they are told (even from you). Show them how to multi-source information to show up bias. Help them put things in context. Be a mentor they can ask questions of, not just their "teacher". And accept that what they will decide is right is not the same as what you believe is right.
