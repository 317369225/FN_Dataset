Set goals and measure results so you can hold yourself accountable.  Don't just work hard, work smart.  A lot of time people associate effort with hustling, but the most successful people I know don't exert themselves as much as others.  They have learned how to optimize processes and focus on highly replicable activities to maximize their per activity ROI.
