â˜…How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
When I was a child we "made our own fun" as my grandmother put it. Summer was best. Endless days of riding our bikes across the river to the big library and spending hours browsing. Swimming at the beach, which was really just a patch of dirt, but it was much better than nothing. Games of Monopoly which no one ever won because we would just quit from boredom. If there was a big windstorm and a tree blew over we would climb all over it and wonder that we the first people to touch those branches. Making up outdoor games that somehow simultaneously involved cowboys, knights of old and dinosaurs. Kickball. Discovering that if you turned on the hose full and adjusted the nozzle to the narrowest stream you could push it into the ground and it would keep going down until it appeared somewhere else several or more feet away like a geyser. Until our parents found out. Lying on my bed reading on rainy days. I could go on with my Leave it to Beaver childhood, but we didn't mind not having the internet at all. We had each other, and when we weren't fighting we had a lot of fun.
