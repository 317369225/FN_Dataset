â˜…Is atheism a fad among Internet users?
I was a atheist before the Internet. Before the mobile phone. Before the PC. Before the first Mac even. In my opinion then the answer to this question is 'no'. However the Internet does allow for the sharing of ideas and thus may help spread common sense quicker than it might have happened before. Sadly though it also helps spread a fair amount of trivial nonsense, so theists haven't been left out.
