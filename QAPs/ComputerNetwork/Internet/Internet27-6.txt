â˜…What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
It's damn difficult to convert atheists to Christianity in any venue. As a lifelong atheist now 79, if I were going to become a member of a theistic belief, Christianity would be next to last on my list.Given those constraints, I'd say the "best way," whatever it might be, is next to impossible. And whatever it is, its unlikely to be something a current Christian is capable of thinking of. So, hire a few atheists as consultants and see what they might come up with.
