â˜…What will the Internet look like in 2020?I'd like as many different descriptions of what the usage, adoption and structure of the Internet will look like in the year 2020 as possible. Be creative, and try to think outside the box how it will change in the next seven years. Let's see what the current early adopters of the Internet come up with (since we're all using Quora...).
Somehow I strongly believe we won't even need a handset or anything to be connected to the internet, probably just small clips (like earrings) connected to the ears that send the transmission to the brain. So we can just think and be connected to the internet. The internet signal will be everywhere. The concept of wi-fi will be gone. Something like 3G will be everywhere just like air. The clips connected to our ears will receive this signal no matter where we go. Google glass without the glasses and without the handset pretty much.
