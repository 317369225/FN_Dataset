â˜…What does a bad internet connection teach you?Though a bad internet connection is a pain in the ass,it does teach you some valuable lessons.
That in many ways the 1990s were more different from today than we often realize. That it isn't the end of the world if you can't find out who were the two Monkees besides Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones at the exact moment you realize that you can't remember. That bookstores apparently still exist. (Who knew?) Also, libraries which are even weirder. That watching youtube videos is kind of depressing when you have time to think about what you are doing.
