â˜…What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
First, Quora is not the best place to do it. It was built to be a question and answer platform-- not a moral battleground. Second, we can't and shouldn't try to convince or attack atheists. Aside from being morally wrong, it also further reinforces the sentiments many have against us as being pushy, prideful, self-righteous, and controlling. We can be right and faithful without being smug or overbearing. Don't bash. All we can and should do is politely defend our faith, share what we believe and know, and invite others to learn the truth for themselves. If a person is prepared to receive Christ, he will feel the Holy Ghost testify the truth of our words-- the rest is out of our control.
