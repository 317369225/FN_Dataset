â˜…When will China join the rest of the world on the real Internet?
The majority of us dont care, because there emerges nearly 1 billion new informations per SECOND on weibo or QQ, which include all walks of life of all over the world and is genueinly enough for us(in fact we know exactly how the rest of te world runs, and talk about it all day). And the minority of us, who passionately interested in western country, culture and language, will hate the firewall and looking for ways to connect with the real western world on internet(see myself as a good case). But, you know, "the majority" is the predominate part, if the Party allow us to visit Fcebk, Twtr, Yotbe, oh that is fantastic, but if they dont, there are more other fish in the sea(except for people like me who interested in Western language & culture).We have much more abundant resources on our own websites than you think.
