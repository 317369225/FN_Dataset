At my previous startup (a dating site) we had a lot of funny cases. The best was the guy that didn't know scroll existed. I mean, the guy didn't know how to scroll a window at all. He had no mouse and didn't figure out the scroll feature on his laptop, neither the up/down arrows. For him, the web was limited to his screen height. Imagine the efforts we had to put to understand his problem over the phone and the guy's joy when figuring out :-)
