â˜…Who are the best internet marketers?
A couple on my list are; Noah Kagan of OKdork - his blog is up there with Neil Patel and quicksprout Clay Collins of Leadpages Matt Bacak - he is very passionate and knows his stuff Frank Kern is always good to follow Dan Kennedy Rich Schefren Marshall Sylver - more marketing and NLP but has some awesome stuff Jonathan Mizel The next two are e-mail marketers Ben Settle alsa a really good copywriter Andre Chaperone I just noticed some on my list have already been posted but they way I see it a second mention is another vote...
