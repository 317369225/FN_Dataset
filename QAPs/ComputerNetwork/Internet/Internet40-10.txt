â˜…Who will be the leading companies of the Internet of Things?Everything relating to the ethos of connecting the worlds devices to the web makes sense. I wonder in what timeframe it will play out? And who will be the leaders of this wave of technology.
I'm surprised that no one so far has made the point that the leading companies of the "internet of things" will be those who merely control access all the while making the most profit from the least work, which means COMCAST (and perhpas a few telcos) for whom all the other companies are mere sharecroppers, laboring to produce value from the Feudal Lord's domain. Comcast will just love to have you pay them an exorbitant monthly fee to use your own damned thermostat, now won't they!
