★Are relationships on the Internet really real?Without any sound, facial expressions, or any kind actual, physical human interaction beyond sending lines of text to one another, words which one can edit and second guess prior to sending, are human relationships over the internet really human or are they actually superficial and fake to some degree?
People frequently confuse virtual with not real.  The telephone is also a virtual technology, and plenty of people have very real relationships in that context.  That said, anonymity is a clever disguise sometimes, so trust nothing until you have met in person.
