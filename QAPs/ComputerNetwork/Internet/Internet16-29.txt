★What free stuff on the internet should everyone be taking advantage of?
Listed are few free stuffs where I have saved lot of money. 1) Free Recharge You get many useful coupons after you recharge your prepaid mobile or DTH or Data  card. Whenever I want to buy any stuff online, I first check for coupons that I will get on recharging my mobile. You get various discount coupons for flight ticket, Movie tickets, McDonald's, Dominos, e-bay and various online shopping sites on recharge. Once on recharge of 300 rupees , I got 300 off on my flight ticket (which I was going to book anyways). So, in one sense it is indeed 'free' recharge. Prepaid Mobile, DTH & Data Card Recharge 2) Online selling/buying/renting apartment There are many sites were you can post free advertisements regarding selling, buying or renting a apartment. This is applicable to many other stuffs like selling bike, mobile, furniture etc. Advantage- zero brokerage fees incurred, ease of finding customers. 3) Restaurant Coupons ( though some are not free(minimal charge incurred), you may even get 50% discount at some good restaurants ) Many sites give a list of good emerging restaurants giving attractive discounts.
