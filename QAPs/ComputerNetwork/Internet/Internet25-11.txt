â˜…Are relationships on the Internet really real?Without any sound, facial expressions, or any kind actual, physical human interaction beyond sending lines of text to one another, words which one can edit and second guess prior to sending, are human relationships over the internet really human or are they actually superficial and fake to some degree?
Well after watching Like Crazy, I can say relationships can be real. Yes. But on some conditions like two people should trust each other completely. They should be devoted to each other if they truly want to make it happen. I was also in a long distance relationship with a girl, whom I never saw but still our families knew other and she was from the same city. But it didn't go well. You know why? She didn't trust me well whereas I trusted her completely. She was probably intimidated by the fact that "We are from different fields & we have no future". I sometimes doubted if she was faking everything. But still I was optimistic. Moreover, She often said, "I can't adjust there & blah blah". These were lame excuses she made I guess. After so many months, what I am hearing from my best friend, that she is hooking up with someone else from their class. Well, after that I analysed she definitely needed a physical aspect of the relationship. I won't hesitate to say even that she wanted to get physical. Who knows? But in the end, it's all up to the person. You just have keep your eyes open in order avoid yourself from getting hurt. That's it.
