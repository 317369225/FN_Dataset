â˜…How do I become a hustler?
Hustlers are basically very hard working businessmen. You need to first have a basic understanding of business and dealing with relationships. Then you need to develop excellent time management habits. That means creating a schedule for yourself that you stick to. Often it means working 80hour weeks. And then just work as hard as u can, consistently, and just keep pushing forward relentlessy, no breaks.
