★What innate traits do great Internet product leaders share?If you were setting up a program to train user-focused Internet product leaders/creators, what are the traits you'd look for in candidates that can't be easily taught?
I have been wrestling with this question and found the most helpful way to think about it was reading a 2010 BBC report called the State of Product Mangement by Nic Newman (http://www.bbctraining.com/partn...).  It addresses broader questions of what makes for a successful online Product Management organisation and what is Product Management, but touches heavily on the characteristics of a good Product Manager.  Many of the elements have been touched on the previous answers but the top characteristics I look for are: (a) passion and drive - relentless focus on continually innovating and improving ways to better solve consumer needs; (b) multi-functional constraint satisfaction - combining needs of technology, consumers, UI design, and financial to come up with the best product design that meets multiple constraints; (c) builders - can think in terms of functional building blocks and how they can be combined to build a great product (release) and great product roadmap ; (d) evangelists - relentless champion and advocate for their product ideas across an organisation; (e) specific - can specify features and functionality to a level of detail that can be understood by the technologists; (f) smart and intellectually curious.  My best Internet Product Managers hires are invariably from a technology background but are as interested in how the product meets consumer needs as they are in the underlying technology.  In short really good Product Managers are rare.
