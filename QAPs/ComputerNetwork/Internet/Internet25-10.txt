★Are relationships on the Internet really real?Without any sound, facial expressions, or any kind actual, physical human interaction beyond sending lines of text to one another, words which one can edit and second guess prior to sending, are human relationships over the internet really human or are they actually superficial and fake to some degree?
Most of the relationships starts " without any sound" - and without mutual "facial expressions" - You will see the other person and get attracted to her or him and when you try again and again then the other person is aware and starts looking at you. Then actually mutual expressions will start. Until we exchange our mutual expressions for some time and until we take the assistance of the sound a.k.a speaking - not necessarily by voice, it can be by chatting - an understanding can not be  reached. Physical human interaction takes after walking / talking / chatting for months.   " The words… Are innocent, neutral, precise, standing for this, describing that, meaning the other…so if you look after them you can build bridges across incomprehension and chaos. They deserve respect.  If you get the right ones in the right order they can nudge the world a little…"  The words have got the real capability to create the magic. Most of the people can express if they are alone, before the laptop, more clearly and more freely and mostly without any lies. But the things is as they say it depends on the other side about how they treat this openness and expressions.  When you are alone pouring yourself openly.. the bond is creating and it requires some chemicals to give it a strength.  Any one can search with X ray eyes for some thing unacceptable or unsocial things... but then.. one need a person who has the capability to understand the "openness" - without which even the offline relationships can be treated as fake.
