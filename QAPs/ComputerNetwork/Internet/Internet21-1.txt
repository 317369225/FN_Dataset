★How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
I think people did all the same things that you list, but did them very, very slowly.  Looking up something in the library or buying a book somewhere could take an entire day. Shopping for clothes.  Writing letters to loved ones and going to the post office to buy stamps.  It was all happening, just very slowly. For years I saw my father in law sitting at his desk for hours on end playing solitaire, with a deck of cards.  It took about thirty seconds to shuffle and lay them all out.  If you set out to play a thousand games, that's a whole day of your life "wasted". Lastly, I think one answer is that we used to do nothing every once in a while.  Nothing was a good way to spend an evening.  You could sit in a chair and feel the breeze, getting nothing done.  Even if there were two or three of you, you might not speak.  You went for a walk by yourself and came back to the same place, having accomplished nothing.  I don't think any of us can conceive of life three hundred years ago when there was nothing to do but plant the crops and watch them grow.  Hard work, but hardly like catching the subway or watching a Transformers movie in 3d.  If you wanted music you could sing, or get a bunch of friends together and sing.  We should do more nothing but we won't go back now.
