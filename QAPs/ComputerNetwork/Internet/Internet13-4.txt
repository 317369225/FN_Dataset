My mother works for the Indian Postal Department- When I first showed her how to email, she was flabbergasted. She said "That's it?" "Who would come to post offices anymore?". The problem was that she would forget her password to her email and started creating a new account almost every other day- the justification being that it was free. I think there are hundreds of accounts in her name. At one point, she ran out of ideas for new names and started having accounts like uttarasmom@ etc. In India, she works with the Central Government. Her entire office with some 500 people used a single gmail account simultaneously. All of them would open the account and pick out the emails that they had to respond to. At one point, I set up a filter for my mother's department and that's how I became tech support for Central Government of India. When she asked me about Facebook, I told her that it was a virus and she would have to pay thousands of rupees as internet bill if she was on it. Thankfully, she still believes in it.
