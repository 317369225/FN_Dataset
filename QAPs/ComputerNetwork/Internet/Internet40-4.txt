★Who will be the leading companies of the Internet of Things?Everything relating to the ethos of connecting the worlds devices to the web makes sense. I wonder in what timeframe it will play out? And who will be the leaders of this wave of technology.
IoT is broad, not only by the impact it will have but also by the number of player, protocol, business model, industries, etc.. Asking who will be leading Internet of Things can't have a straight answer. You have to split the answer along many categories:   - Wearables      - Health      - Fitness      - Entertainment      - Social   - Gateways      - Home gateways      - Industrial gateways   - Connectivity      - Chip manufacturers (cisco, qualcomm, etc..)   - Vertical solutions vs Platform backend solutions   - Analytics solutions   - by vertical (healthcare, transportation, Oil & Gas, utilities, consumer, etc..)   - etc, etc.. This is not an exhaustive list by this is how you want to look at it. If you question is who is going to be successful and I should go work for them, maybe let us know which area interests you, and I think people will be happy to chime in. I did start gathering a list of players in IoT and it's a never ending list honestly.. A lot of answers are saying Withings, and I would agree that in the field of integrated solution for the consumer market they are great. But if you think about IoT in manufacturing, I don't think they are such a hot company ;-)
