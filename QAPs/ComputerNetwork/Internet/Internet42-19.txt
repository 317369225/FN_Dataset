â˜…What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1980s?A follow-up question to What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
It was awesome. You could connect with people from around the world in near-real-time. ARPANET took collaboration to a new level. I could pose a question on USENET or some other BBS and get responses from around the world within hours. I recall the day I bought a massive 5 Mb external hard drive thinking it would hold everything I would ever download. It served me well for a few years. Upgrading to a 9600 baud (bits/second) modem took you to the height of power (I started with a 1200 baud modem). Files that took hours to transfer took, well, fewer hours, lol. Of course, this was in the days when entire programs were measured in kB and the offline currency was a 5.25-inch 360 kB floppy. I spent more than a few sleepless nights playing Startrek on a teletype console chewing through boxes of paper while finding and killing Klingons, squandering the then-substantial computing resources of UC Berkeley's research system (which can be matched today with a single laptop). It boggles my mind to think that we will one day look upon today's internet with similar amazement at how limited and archaic it and the related technologies have become. More interesting is that this pace of change is accelerating at an exponential rate.
