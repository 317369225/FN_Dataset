★Is the Internet evil?What is the one thing common to Einstein, Newton, Beethoven, Nietzsche and Alexander Fleming? Apart from an extraordinary intelligence, none of them had access to the Internet. Does that mean the Internet is an impediment to the growth of human intelligence? If yes, does that make it evil ?
I don't think so, wait for another few years, you will find people of this era who will be at the top notch and can be comparable to the people you listed.Also, yeah,  none of them had internet but everyone of them surely had that zeal and perseverance, that's what is crucial. For that matter, everything can be used for good and bad, it totally depends on individual. May be if the people you mentioned are alive now, they might have appreciated internet and would've thought that it saved a hell lot of time for them and made the task easier, just saying :)
