'Defragmenting your Solid State Drive(SSD)' When data is stored it ends up in multiple locations or "fragments" on the hard disk. It slows down the HDDs because the driver's head needs to move from place to place to read all the information. Since spinning hard drives read and write data in a sequential manner,it will take longer for the hard drive to read a file if parts of the file are located on different parts of the disk as compared to being located altogether in "one unit/space". So defragmenting a normal spinning drive can be useful. However Solid State Drive(SSD) is a non-volatile flash memory. SSD is fast because it randomly accesses memory instead of sequential access like in HDDs. There are no moving mechanical components in SSD. Because of how SSDs are built, each write to an SSD wears it down so to say. Flash memory has a very finite lifespan and the more it is used, the more quickly it will fail. So each time you do a defragment  your SSD it will perform write accesses and will further reduce the lifespan of the SSD. Also as the data is not read sequentially in SSD it has no performance benefits as well. So, you should NOT defragment your SSD!
