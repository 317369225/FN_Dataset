â˜…Will the Internet ever become obsolete?
Possibly when it become more ubiquitous than electricity it may APPEAR to have become extinct; while in fact, it will merely evolved into an unseen symbiot, sustaining the "wind beneath our wings" to wax saccharinely poetic. One way or another, we need "just in time" support that improves and adapts to of changing needs, If, or when, humans ever evolve true biologically/genetically "evolved" telepathic networking THEN possible the material network technology it replaces can be said to be obsolete. Probably not until then.
