★When will China join the rest of the world on the real Internet?
I think,when CCP controls the world. OK, this is a joke. But in China, everything that can influence the thoughts of the people must be control ed by the government(CCP), unless all the internet belong to him, this is impossible. Now CCP is "clean the environment of the Internet",some people who often comment their idea which is not good for the government were detained。So,this is a hard thing to realize.
