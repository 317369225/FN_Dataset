â˜…What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
Best bet is to never mention Christianity. Once you mention it, they start with all the eye rolling and mocking. Be the best Christian ever and never mention it. It works offline too. Share, give, help, be there, be quiet about it. It says so right there on the Bible. You have read the Bible, right? I'm going to guess no since you're still a Christian but there are some passages hidden among all the genocide and the vengeance that make some sense. They are not meant to be followed as guidelines on how to live your life. They are pertinent only to that one guy or that one little group two thousand years ago, but just because you don't have to doesn't mean you can't.
