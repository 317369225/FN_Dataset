★Is the Internet evil?What is the one thing common to Einstein, Newton, Beethoven, Nietzsche and Alexander Fleming? Apart from an extraordinary intelligence, none of them had access to the Internet. Does that mean the Internet is an impediment to the growth of human intelligence? If yes, does that make it evil ?
No. Surprisingly the internet is not evil. Nor is it an impediment to the growth of human intelligence, but is instead the reason for the growth of human knowledge, or at least the potential for humans to gain knowledge easier than in the pre-internet days.   I love your linking though. The geniuses shared extraordinary intelligence and the lack of internet access - therefore internet stunts intelligence! Brilliant. None of them had a Big Mac Meal either - maybe that is the real impediment to the growth of human intelligence?   And then comes the biggest problem you face with your linking. What evidence do you use to show that human intelligence in the internet age is impeded at all? Where is your proof that there are no people of extraordinary intelligence today?
