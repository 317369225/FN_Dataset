â˜…Are internet forums dead?There seemed to be a time where everyone congregated on forums. WIth the presence of Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Quora, etc. it seems like people are no longer into forums. Does anyone still use forums for online socialization, asking questions, discussion/hobbies anymore or have internet forums been rendered redundant?
What about Facebook groups? Linkedin groups? All of the media comment enabled sites where you can choose to authenticate or stay anonymous? Yahoo! answers, ehow, etc., and yes obviously here on Quora? All are grouped, cascading forms of topical discussions. Is there a substantial difference, taxonomy aside?
