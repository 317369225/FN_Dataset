â˜…Is the Internet spoiling young children?
I am 22 and from my own experience... It does. My mother used to try keep me away from Internet and television, as many Asian parents do, and reading become my only entertainment. I read everything i can find from Great Expectation to ingredients on food package, all the time from boring classes to having snacks. But after I left home for college, I watch more online television rather than read book. Then there is twitter, which makes me totally impatient to long articles. I still love books and buy a lot of them, but I rarely finish one in the last four years. Internet is definitely very important, but if you are concerning about your kids' education, then only give them limited access.
