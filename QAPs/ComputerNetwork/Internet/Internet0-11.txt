The most productive way to spend time on the Internet is to create or do something with it. Learning is good but at some point you just need to get dirty and start doing things. And I hate to break it to people, but access to information and resources on how to do things isn't exactly new. You could have done that at something called the library long before the days of Yahoo, Alta Vista, Excite, Netscape, etc. Taking action and doing things is the best way to use the internet. Here are some ideas... - Start a blog. Write for other blogs. You have a chance to get heard by millions of people. People have no idea how much power they have at their fingertips just by sitting in front of a computer. - Write a book. Amazon and Createspace makes this easy. - Meet interesting people. Use Twitter to say hi.
