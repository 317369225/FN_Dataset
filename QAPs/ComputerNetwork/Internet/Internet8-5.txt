★What was it like to be a programmer without the Internet?When there were no online documentation, no Google, no StackOverflow...
Back in ye days of ole, we had computers that didn't even have modems. To write software, you purchased a book, which listed pages of source code for you to type in.  After spending hours typing in the code, you could run it a few times.  Then you had to delete it, because your computer didn't have enough RAM for more than one program to run at a time. And we liked it, because that's all we had! (Youtube recommendation by Toby Thain)
