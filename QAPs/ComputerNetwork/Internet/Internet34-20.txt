â˜…Can I use the internet to save my mom, who suffers from Stage IV cancer?
Can Stage IV cancer patients be saved by information from the internet? With luck, life might be extended by the right information about a certain cancer at a particular point, so it depends on what you mean by "saved." Cured? Extremely rare. Life extension, often very possible. Good quality of life? Often not; cancer treatment is usually unpleasant. If remission means that treatment can be stopped, the patient may get good-quality time out of an extended life. However, many newer treatments are continued until they lose effectiveness, meaning that the patient may get more time but less enjoyment. Yet some people do very well! There might be hope in any situation. You are not alone in wondering this, questioner. Many cling to the hope that if only they look hard enough, fight hard enough, their loved one will be saved from Stage IV cancer. In the majority of cases, it is not to be. As Jae Won Joh pointed out, time spent with the patient is a great idea instead of hours on the internet. But if you still must search -- and many of us feel driven to do so! -- my advice is to find a clinically up-to-date group of patients and caregivers. Look for people who pursue knowledge and science and clinical trials. Patient groups at Association of Cancer Online Resources have a reputation for being scientifically oriented. Their information and support can be extremely helpful in extending life and in making patients comfortable. I do know many patients who have managed to extend their lives for years, some without sacrificing too much quality and others living with a great deal of pain and side effects. Still, there comes a time for all of us to die, regardless of how healthy or sick we may have been. Cherish the love you had for your mother, and the love she must have had for you in order to undergo everything she experienced with cancer.
