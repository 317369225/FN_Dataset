â˜…What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1980s?A follow-up question to What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
I was working for Symbolics in 1985 when we registered the first .COM. I was in support, but my office was right next to the guy who wrote our TCP/IP stack. Back then, as a support guy I read all the RFCs and subscribed to the email list where all the big names in the TCP/IP world were beating out the standards. There were rules against using the network (then called ARPAnet) for commercial purposes. When I left Symbolics for Schlumberger in 1987, the only employees allowed to use the network were either being funded by DARPA or were managing the network (that was me). I wrote a program that walked the DNS and printed out the entire tree. I put it on the wall next to my office and updated it every month or so. When I started it was about 2 feet long, I stopped when it went across the ceiling and down the wall on the other side. When we relocated from Palo Alto to Austin in 1989, the rules had changed somewhat. I signed off on our connection to what was now called NSFnet. It was $40,000/year for a 64k circuit.
