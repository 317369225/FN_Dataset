★Who are the best internet marketers?
It depends what you mean by 'best'. Is the best marketer the one that makes the most money?  From their own products, or from consulting?  The best marketers for B2B or B2C products? If you segment your question even into channel specific areas (like "Who's the best SEO?"), the question doesn't get easier. Different challenges are different, and different marketers have different goals.  Some might be perfectly happy making $500K a year and working 10-20 hours a week, while others may want to create billion dollar companies. Even within the small world of SEO, there are brilliant marketers that: Create networks of lead generation sites in highly profitable verticals and don't write or speak about their methods Build world-class consulting brands and offer training to some of the largest, most sophisticated publishers in the world Create substantial SaaS tools businesses with millions in monthly recurring revenue Build membership-driven community sites with thousands of members and charge hundreds in monthly fees Speak and write books, commanding huge appearance fees Become part owner of poker, payday loan, and adult content sites and leverage their skills in those verticals. Which of these people is the best SEO?  I have no idea - the best SEO for an enterprise-level ecommerce site isn't the best SEO for a new lead generation site. Extend this to the world of marketers at large. Are the best email marketers better than the best PPC people?  Are the best B2B demand generation leaders better than the best B2C copywriters?  As you can see, this is sort of an impossible question to answer.  Smart marketers focus on segments they can win, so they don't have to compete with all of the other smart marketers in the world. (That being said, all of the marketers mentioned on this thread so far are excellent.  I think it's a mistake to discount the super-affiliate guys as marketers - many of them are phenomenal marketers.)
