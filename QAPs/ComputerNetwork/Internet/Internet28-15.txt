â˜…What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
Lots of good answers here. I'll add a bit: before the World Wide Web and browsers, pretty much the only useful stuff was email and Usenet and simple file transferring via FTP. Everything was command line and text-based. But useful it was: There was NO SPAM whatsoever, until the green-card spam postings on Usenet by the Arizona lawyer. Before that, ALL emails and postings were by real people looking for, or providing, useful information. Hard to imagine, eh? Strictly text was much more useful than you might think. It forced you to compose properly and reading answers was very efficient as there was no distracting eye-candy. Usenet clients, which could read and post, were a very efficient way of getting and giving information, since most clients had some kind of filtering. So for instance, you could read the new posts in a topic, kill the subject lines you were not interested in, and you would never see them again, even the follow-ups. Contrast that with todays forums where you are exposed to the same subject lines over and over and must mentally filter them out at each visit. Furthermore, Usenet had every topic grouped in a single go-to source, so you didn't have to search around trying to find a good source for questions and answers. Only universities, the military, and a few larger public agencies had access to the Arpanet/Internet. So the quality of people using it was very high. I got a lot of high quality answers regularly, and hopefully provided a few myself. Contrast that again with today, where any knucklehead can and does post uninformed and often wrong opinions on any topic. In many ways the Internet was a higher-quality instrument back then.
