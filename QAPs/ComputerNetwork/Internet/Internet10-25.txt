â˜…Is the Internet spoiling young children?
I think the main challenge is that many elder people are less experienced with the internet. When World Wide Web became available to the public, I was 30 years old. When online people became the majority in my country, I was well over 40. That means: Many of the parents with children of 12 and above were raised without the internet. They first got in touch with the web at Univerity, or maybe even later. Today's children get in touch with the net very early, they get experienced by chance. It is like learning your mother language vs. learning a foreign language. Today's children often are more experienced jn using the web than their parents. And that is somewhat new. Today's parents feel a deficit in teaching their children how to cope with life's cahallenges in the digital field - and they are completely right with that. But they have no choice. If they try to keep their children away from the web, they will spoil their future. So they must learn as much as possible about the web and try to cooperate with their children. Complaining is useless.
