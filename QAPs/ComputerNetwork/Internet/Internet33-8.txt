â˜…What innate traits do great Internet product leaders share?If you were setting up a program to train user-focused Internet product leaders/creators, what are the traits you'd look for in candidates that can't be easily taught?
There are a lot of great answers here already so instead of stating the same points I'll call out two traits that I think are crucial for any successful product leader to posses: The urge to CONNECT deeply with your customer/user base, and often. This goes beyond simply communicating with those making the most noise, be it positive or negative. You need to communicate with the average user as well and collect feedback, thoughts, etc. More often than not what you hear from the most vocal customers is not indicative of the bulk of the customer base. USING the product yourself. This is one I don't see too often and in some cases it may not make sense, but for most internet products there are few reasons why a Product Manager/Leader should not be a consumer of the product themselves. Even if you don't have a direct need personally find a way to leverage your product/service in a way that allows you to see things from your customers perspective. If you experience problems or pain points you can be sure your customers are as well and it really helps you relate to their day-day problems/complaints. Eat your own dog food. This does not happen enough.
