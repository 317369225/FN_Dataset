â˜…What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
I started using the Internet around 1995-96, I was about 8 years old at the time. My memories of what the "Internet" was is represented by the disc image above. Pop in the disc, install, and boom Internet. We had 2 phone lines, one for regular phone calls and one for Internet so that we wouldn't get knocked off when signing on (though I understand we were fairly lucky to do this as some of my friends didn't have the luxury of having 2 phone lines). From the time I clicked the AOL icon on my desktop, it took around 2-3 minutes to actually "sign on" and get to the home screen where the familiar, "Welcome! You've got mail!" would greet me. The majority of my Internet surfing back then was downloading pointless screensavers, images of my favorite basketball players to print out, and video clips that took entirely way too long to download (we're talking an hour for a minute long clip). Instant messaging became the preferred way of talking with my classmates.
