★Can I use the internet to save my mom, who suffers from Stage IV cancer?
In this stage of cancer, there will be no effect of surgery as the cells are totally out of control and they can’t be stopped from multiplying. What you can do to ease the pain and suffering is to provide proper and healthy diet and spend as much time as possible with her. Give her the pleasure of your company and allow her to do whatever she wants to.
