How about a failure to use software? I needed a copy of a recent pay stub so I called our university's payroll office. The pleasant gentleman who answered the phone was able to call up my stubs as a PDF. Fantastic, right? I offered him my email. He seemed confused and asked me for a fax number... He then printed the PDF to paper and faxed it to me. Of course, since I don't have a fax machine, I gave him the number for a service I use which receives the fax as a scan and emails it to me... as an attached PDF.
