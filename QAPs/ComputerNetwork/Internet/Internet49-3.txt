â˜…What is the scariest thing you have experienced on the Internet?
War Crimes I was probably 12 when I first came to know about war crimes. I had read somewhere about the war on Iraq and had seen the term "Human Rights Abuses" quite a lot of times. I didn't know what it meant back then. With a lot of curiosity, I searched the internet and saw/read things that I never should have. I was horrified. Being young, I had never even thought for a second about what torture was (who does, anyway?) and how it was being inflicted on a huge number of people everyday. I read a lot about how war crimes were being committed . I really don't know how I could actually go through all of it, but I did. And I was shit scared. I even remember telling my parents about it. For many days, the thought of prisoners being subjected to brutal forms of torture would haunt me. It took some time to get over all of it. But it did scare the living daylights out of me.
