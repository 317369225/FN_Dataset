★What was it like to be a programmer without the Internet?When there were no online documentation, no Google, no StackOverflow...
We had books. Thats really the biggest answer.  Most of our learning came from books.  In key technology areas like Silicon valley there were entire bookstores just devoted to books about every conceivable programming topic. There were also magazines like BYTE that contained articles every month on programming techniques and computer topics.  In its heyday an issue of byte was over a hundred pages in thickness. We also had a few pre-internet computer communication tools.  There was a conferencing system much like modern mail lists called "usenet".  It was a relay system were compuetrs passed messages to other computers.  Sometimes that was over direct connection, and sometimes it was by dialing each other up with acoustic modems.  A unix program called UUCP (Unix to Unix Copy Program) was often used to do this dial-up and a  UUCP address was a list of computer names separated by exclamation points.  ( see UUCP) Another thing we had was bulletin boards.  These were individual computers running a kind of forum software.  They would have one or more modems attached to them.  You would dial up, read and write posts and the hang up so someone else could attach. Finally, we had monthly local user groups where all the programmers working with a  given technology would meet and share what they knew and had learned that month.  There were some bigger groups such as SHARE that had regional or national conferences to bring local groups together.
