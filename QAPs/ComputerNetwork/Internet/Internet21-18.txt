â˜…How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
I think about this quite often, when I have to go into the office for one reason or another. Instead of communicating online people: walked around and talked with one another and called each other up on the phone. Instead of playing online games, people filled out crossword puzzles Instead of reading blogs, people read the newspaper None of this is "wasting" time, it's just the pre-online version of information gathering, sharing and networking.
