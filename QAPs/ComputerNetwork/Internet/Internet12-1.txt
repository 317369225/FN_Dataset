â˜…What are the real-life equivalents of "Trolling on the Internet" ?
Well, I trolled a person quite unintentionally. In my second year at college, I had an opportunity to intern at the premier nuclear research facility in my country. Our accommodation was set up in a building where research scholars resided. The building was 30 stories tall and my room was in the topmost floor with an excellent view. However, the building only had one elevator, and it was pretty slow. One day, after dinner at a restaurant, as I travelled up the elevator alone ( at around 10 PM ) , I gave into my temptation of pressing the button corresponding to the floor as soon as the elevator crossed the floor. By the time I reached floor 30, I ended up lighting up all the floors from 1 to 29. Quite happy, I stepped out. Imagine my horror when I saw another person - a research scholar, running in great haste to catch the elevator before it closed. He was quite relieved to enter the lift, but it was shortlived as his eyes darted across the brightly lit number panel on the side and he managed to catch a glimpse of me ( rooted to my spot ) just as the doors slammed shut. I stood there for what seemed like an eternity, watching the number display pausing at one floor at a time, and the doors opening and closing over and over again.
