★What is the Internet?
The best way to define the internet in my opinion is to go back to its roots: the TCP/IP protocol.  - the IP protocol enables two computers to communicate without a central dispatching (controlling) system (any device connected to the network can send and receive messages that can make their way to their destination via an infinite number of possible paths).  - the TCP protocol enables that communication to happen asynchronously and efficiently (both computers don't need to monopolise a direct link between them) So the internet is primarily an efficient, decentralised way for devices to send and receive digital messages (data bits).  Everything else is built on top of that.
