I used to work at a twin plant in El Paso, so there were offices on both the US and Mexico sides.  One day we went to visit the manager in Juarez and he wanted to go over a particular report, so he went over to the corner PC to print it out.  This is back in the 80s, the magical days of the DOS command line, but it still was taking him longer than usual to generate the report. Eventually, I wander over to see if I could help and I noticed that he was typing something out, then looking over at the printer, back to typing, printer, etc.  Confused, I stepped closer and asked what he was doing.  He tells me, "Our monitor died 3 weeks ago so I can't see what's on the screen anymore. So first I type the command, hit Print Screen and check the printer to see if it's right.  If it is, I hit enter.  If it's not, I backspace and try again.  Sometimes it takes a while." And he had been doing this for THREE WEEKS.
