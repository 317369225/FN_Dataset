â˜…If you could remove one thing from the Internet forever, what would it be?
Myself, just for a while. I'd have waaay more time for the local library and my kindle. Still, how do manage to live without skyping parents in France, gf in Russia and friends casually throughout the world? Without News Republic, Quora and Wikipedia? Without (oh, forgive me, Universe) Facebook red tiny numbers? ...sigh.
