â˜…What are the greatest software misuses?i.e Can you give me instances of the biggest unintended uses of softwares you have encountered ? Please have a look at meaning of the word "Misuse" here http://www.google.com/search?q=m...
My Artificial Intelligence teacher (he teaches Computer Networks also) opens Firefox, which looked something like He types Google and hits Google Search. Well, at this point, we were mildly astonished, but what happens after this is even better. He follows the first link, reaches http://www.google.com and believe it or not, he types Google again :-o Yes, AGAIN! This happened in a Computer Networks lab, and by this point all of us had a very hard time not to burst out laughing. I think all of us were secretly praying that his recursion causes a stack overflow :-D But thankfully he stopped the loop here and finally typed in what he was actually searching for. And in case you are wondering, I am a student doing Bachelor of Engineering in one of the 'decent' engineering colleges of Bangalore. It is really sad, but a hilarious misuse of software, I must say!
