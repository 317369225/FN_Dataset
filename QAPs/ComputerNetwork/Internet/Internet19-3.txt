â˜…Are internet forums dead?There seemed to be a time where everyone congregated on forums. WIth the presence of Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Quora, etc. it seems like people are no longer into forums. Does anyone still use forums for online socialization, asking questions, discussion/hobbies anymore or have internet forums been rendered redundant?
My forum, which gets millions of page views per month, has grown every year since 1995. To say that forums are dead would be to say that the sharing of information is dead. There are two types of people on the internet - those who simply consume information and those who both create and consume it. Forums allow for both types of people. Using Facebook or a similar service can work in some (smaller) cases, but if you are the community administrator or content provider, you are effectively handing over your valuables (knowledge) to another party who will then profit from it. No, forums are not dead. They are not dying. In fact, for thousands of niche subjects, they are the only way to properly share information.
