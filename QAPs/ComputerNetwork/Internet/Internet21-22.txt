★How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
I asked a friend who did waste a lot of time pre-Internet, this is what he wrote: "I worked out at the gym at lunch time.  at night, my friends and i went to open bars at nightclubs which were much bigger in the '80's in New York and filled with a wide variety of interesting people including artists, musicians, publishing industry execs, ad agency execs and creatives, writers as well as scattering of bankers and lawyers.  music was compiled into sets played by djs who had travelled the world sampling and listening to musicians directly, not being programmed by intelligent software programs. then the internet happened and people stopped going out.  they only speak or listen to people that "share" the same point of view or people who were "friends" or "friends of friends".  the idea of mixing with others became lost. since people no longer go out, personal hygiene has declined and you can't tell anymore who smells bad or who has stopped brushing their teeth since everyone is always banging away at some keyboard alone in a room making some non important statement to as many people as they can collect into groups of passive listeners."
