★What free stuff on the internet should everyone be taking advantage of?
Google Reader  -  This is probably the best way to gather information around the topics of interest. Quora -  Need I say anything more :) Free Open Source Software (sourceforge.com)  - Think of the amount you would be spending on buying proprietary software, if it wasn't for open source s/w Ubuntu - Because I don't want to pay a hefty amount for putting an OS in my machine.  (Stumbleupon) Explore more. Web pages, photos, and videos - The best way to discover content based on interests. (Evernote) Remember everything with Evernote, Skitch and our other great apps. Grooveshark  - If you have a decent internet connection and aren't a big fan on buying music, online streaming is the best way. Google News - I love it because, I don't have to visit 10 different news sites now. Chrome Browser - The browser of choice. http://Stackoverflow.com - The mecca for developers. I could go on and on...(and probably will keep editing this answer :) )
