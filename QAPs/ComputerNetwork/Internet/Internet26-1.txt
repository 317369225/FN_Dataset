â˜…How do I become a hustler?
Never, ever, throw out the first number unless you have enough information to anchor your acceptable price. [1] Be confident in all matters (even when you don't know). Learn how to be persuasive, 50% is in your body language or tone. Hype it up, talk a good game. Understand what value you know you can add, and what you can figure out later. Solve a problem, ask for reciprocated value. Exploit counter-party weaknesses. Identify win-win solutions. Learn empathy, see it from their point of view. Understand that the counterparty needs are not always relevant, but sometimes tangential. Learn the difference between features and benefits. Feel their pain, solve it. --- [1] http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/430...
