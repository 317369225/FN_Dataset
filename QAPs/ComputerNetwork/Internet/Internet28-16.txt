â˜…What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
It was almost all personal and academic sites in the mid-90's. No pop ups. No banner ads. No pop-unders, etc. The few "commercial" sites there were were just informational or in the case of magazines, just some content from the print version. It was nice, simple, and uncluttered but very simple. No flash, tables still had that silly fake 3D border: etc...
