â˜…What's it like to work for Rocket Internet?I've noticed they've been hiring alot recently, especially within the U.S. I was wondering if anyone has had experience working there. What is their reputation within the industry?
The management team is filled with assholes. They constantly look for problems without finding solutions, and they encourage you to build shell companies that have good 'metrics' but aren't actually well-run or properly serving customers. GVDs are also given way less responsibility than the Rocket pitch might suggest. There seems to be very little care for local staff, customers, or laws in the countries that Rocket operates. This is just my experience, but it is one that I have found to be consistent (and nothing like previous banks and firms, or startups, where I have worked). On the flip side, I've heard that things are much better in Europe than the rest of the world.
