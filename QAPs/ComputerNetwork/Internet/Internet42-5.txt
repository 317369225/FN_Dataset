â˜…What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1980s?A follow-up question to What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
I just scraped in by about 3 months (late September 1989), when I got the long-defunct mph@ecs.ox.ac.uk address :-) It was: Messaging... a bit of email, a lot of NNTP Fun... who remembers the USENET Oracle now? Long-since fallen into disuse, but digest 666 was a classic Text... yes, I used a Sun 3/50 wth X some of the time, but basically I was on a terminal Not really something we thought would grow Surprisingly instant - I think that 'Cheeseplant's house' (one of the first UK chat rooms) was early 90s. It felt like something academic - this was, of course, in the days before it was legal to have commercial access in Europe, so basically, you could chat to other students / academics. Then, I fell out of that world for a few years when I started work - and we were on DOS machines with some Novell file-sharing, and some MHS mail ... ... then after a few years, Trumpet Winsock, and NCSA mosaic... and, on an old Sparc, my first webserver... but we're into the mid 90s by then.
