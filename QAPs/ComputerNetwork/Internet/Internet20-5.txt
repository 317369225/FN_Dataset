★The Internet: What is missing on the Internet?What service / site  do you think is missing on the web today?
A website/ a tool that used advanced translation technology to homogenize Wikipedia articles in every language. This might sound absurd at first, but I've been thinking about it lately and I found that such a tool would be extremely efficient. It would translate the richest article on any subject (it means they look on a Wikipedia language version which has the most info on a certain topic) in all languages so that there would be the same amount of articles across all Wikipedia versions. In addition, any entry into Wikipedia would be directly translated and integrated into every version. Of course this might seem a fanciful idea due to the A.I. and accuracy involved but I truly believe it's feasible. Besides, none other than Wikimedia has the right to conduct such a project: maybe somebody'd better just pass on the suggestion.
