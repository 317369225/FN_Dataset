★The Internet: What is missing on the Internet?What service / site  do you think is missing on the web today?
the cohesive community that used to exist on the internet before everyone and their mother joined.  Now, it's full of trolls.  Also I do agree with the ability to have at least a more detailed look at what you are buying online.  Many places are selling cheap items but sometimes they are so rare you can't find a good review or idea of what you are buying and then have to worry if you are getting something that is far from what you are expecting.
