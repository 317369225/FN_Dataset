★Is the Internet spoiling young children?
No. I started using when I was 15. It helped me because : 1.  I could learn web programming.  Without it no body would have taught me php. 2.  I could feel less lonely.  After coming from school. no body was at home.  I could go online, I used to be part of a movies forum, people responded to me 3.  I could know should i take science, commerce or law after school.  I got points for my own set of pros and cons. 4.  When porn etc did get exposed to me as a kid, I understood people EVEN do these.  That led me to think - the world might contain so many things I did not know.  That actually helped me get in touch with reality soon. 5.  Yahoo answers etc helped me a lot to ask personal questions etc.  Like quora helps now. 6.  I could find new places, new information, new algorithms.
