★What are the hottest startups in India?
Freekall (Bangalore-based Cloud telephony startup) You can make free phone calls. You don't need to install any application, smartphone or internet connectivity. To use the service, one has to call their number 080-49202060 after which the call will drop and you will receive a call back. You need to  answer the call and dial the number of the person you wish to talk to, followed by the symbol #. Both calls will be bridged and users can talk freely. P.S  I used it and it worked flawlessly for me.
