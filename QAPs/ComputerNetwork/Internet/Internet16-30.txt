â˜…What free stuff on the internet should everyone be taking advantage of?
The BBC website has thousands and thousands of free learning resources. Free language learning courses at bbc.co.uk/learning ; free learning materials for children and teachers at bbc.co.uk/schools and especially at bbc.co.uk/bitesize ; free adult skills resources to improve literacy and numeracy at bbc.co.uk/skillswise ; thousands of free recipes by famous chefs at bbc.co.uk/food and so much more. You'll find so much hidden away if you dig around as well. BBC Learning isn't as well known as iPlayer or News or any of the BBC's TV or radio channels but as a department it makes a huge volume of web content and is one of the first things the BBC ever started doing, both over the radio and then online. I'm very proud to be able to say I work there. I'm not being paid to promote it, by the way. It's just awesome. Find everything at bbc.co.uk/learning.
