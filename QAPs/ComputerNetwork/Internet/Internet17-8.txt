â˜…Who are the best internet marketers?
The industry is still a bit fragmented, meaning a good internet marketer will likely be a generalist in many ways. There is no one tool to accomplish all areas of digital marketing, so a good marketer needs to be a jack of many. When looking for an internet marketer look for: -social media expertise and enthusiasm -SEO -Email marketing -A/B testing -KISS metrics or other metric tools -PPC (adwords and Facebook advertising) -blog and content creation -creativity (guerrilla tactics and early adoption) All of these areas can be specializations in themselves (as we see with Mari Smith and social media, Rand Fishkin and SEO, and Eric Reis associated with KISS metrics and A/B testing). As far as generalists, Seth Godin, Mitch Joel, & Noah Kagan, have lots of great overall strategy and inspirational information available. Depending on your budget on hiring great marketers, you can hire a generalist of all the elements or a few masters on one. For startups, I would recommend getting a scrappy generalist, high on the creativity and early adoption. For a large company, I would hire a specialist for each element.
