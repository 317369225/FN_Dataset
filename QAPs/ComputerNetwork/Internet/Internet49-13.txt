â˜…What is the scariest thing you have experienced on the Internet?
The most horrifying thing has to be the average Youtube comments section. Mainly because of what it says about the current state of humanity. Speaking for myself though, maybe it was the Fox News talk shows. As a (mostly) non TV watcher, I had no idea how amazingly bad they were until encountering them online. Which may help to explain the kind of comments we see on YouTube, and I imagine the feedback loop goes both ways.
