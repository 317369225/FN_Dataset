My 50+ year old mom (then in her 40s) used to say "that thing is making some noise" when my first cell phone would ring with it's monotone ringtone. She'd ignore her own phone whenever it rang as she assumed some neighbor is playing a song really loud on their tv. Now she has highly advanced over the past few years in the digital age - has her own youtube channel, a facebook account generously used to play Candy Crush Saga, and a highly elaborate Google+ circle of family and friends. The only thing she didn't know for her utility, was to take a screenshot. I learned that after this incident. My inlaws sent her a read-only cd with our wedding pictures as a video collage. I live abroad so she couldn't mail the CD to me. She played the video, paused at each pic, took a picture of the screen with her point-n-shoot camera (carefully avoiding the flash and her reflection on the monitor, mind well!), transferred all those pics on to Picassa and mailed them to me. There were well over 150 photographs. (Imagine her patience n efforts!) I emailed her back, "Why didn't you use Ctrl+print screen? You could've obtained better quality pics with considerably less effort." And then the fight started.
