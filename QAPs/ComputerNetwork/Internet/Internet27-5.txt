★What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
To convince me, you'd need to start with answers for questions that I have. Not answers that sound made up, but real, satisfying answers:   Would an all-good God tell anyone to kill their child? Why would the second set of stone tablets delivered to Moses be much different than the first? Why do Christians generally pay attention to the first and try to forget about the second? If God wants to be known, why doesn't he make sure we all know him? If he wants to hide, why was he very visible for the period of the Old Testament? Every religion thinks that they have the truth, and everyone else is mistaken. What kind of evidence is there that your religion is true that isn't there for others? Why is it hard to point to things in the Old Testament that God does that are unambiguously good, but it's fairly easy to point to things that appear to be evil, unless we redefine good as "whatever God wants"?
