â˜…What are some of the best education websites on the Internet?
For fully structured higher education, I highly recommend the free MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) platforms. Rather than just learning bits and pieces through short videos, blog posts and TED Talks - you can gain a much greater mastery of a subject by taking a fully structured course. I created a guide to the major MOOC platforms, their courses starting soon and their most popular courses that you might find useful. The Ultimate Guide to MOOCs (it covers the major players: Coursera, Udacity, edX, Canvas Network, NovoED, iVersity, Open2Study and FutureLearn).
