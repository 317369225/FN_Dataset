★What's it like to work for Rocket Internet?I've noticed they've been hiring alot recently, especially within the U.S. I was wondering if anyone has had experience working there. What is their reputation within the industry?
I currently lead a local venture in Rocket Internet as Founder and was also involved in the global development of another venture as well. I work in Rocket for the past two years. To be honest, based on my personal experiences and the responses I get from this board, the experiences in Rocket Internet are probably mixed, depending on the region or the venture you're directly involved. In my case, I had two very different experiences. When implementing a global venture, it was very hectic and purely focused on execution. The direction of the venture was pretty much defined by Oliver Samwer himself, who took the decisions and defined what to do, micro-managing all Founders to a great extent. We were focused primarily on very fast execution and delivery. To be honest, it was not fun at all. On the other hand, when leading a local venture, the experience could not have been different. I am fully in charge of the venture and I also have access to a very large network of experts, besides having an almost unlimited pool of resources. If the venture goes well in terms of performance and growth, the ability to decide fast and the internal resources Rocket Internet has is fantastic.  For Founders, it comes with the trade-off of higher salary, lower equity and less control compared to launching a venture on your own, but as I had less experience being a tech entrepreneur, its benefits outweighed its problems. In my personal case, it has been a fantastic experience and I have learned a ton and I fell much more prepared to attempt something on my own in the near future.
