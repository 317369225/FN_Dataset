★Can I use the internet to save my mom, who suffers from Stage IV cancer?
I understand how terribly frustrating it is to try to sort through the masses of information on the web and find whatever gold might be hiding in the trash.   Sometimes you can find a clinical trial that is evaluating a new therapy.  Here in the US, they're tightly regulated; current trials are at http://clinicaltrials.gov. I see that there is a site specific to India here: http://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrial... I don't know how the system works there, but it might be worth at least asking the doctors about.
