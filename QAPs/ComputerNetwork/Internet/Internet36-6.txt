â˜…Is atheism a fad among Internet users?
Nope, it's just that this is the first time/place that atheists and agnostics could speak out freely without any fear of being ostracised/accused of being a witch/or tortured, often to death. This national discussion is giving heart and voice to the millions who are "religious" because it is easier than trying to tell some proselytizing twit to GTFO. And so these silent majority are starting to speak up.
