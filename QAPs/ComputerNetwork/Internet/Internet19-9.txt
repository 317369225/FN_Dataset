â˜…Are internet forums dead?There seemed to be a time where everyone congregated on forums. WIth the presence of Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Quora, etc. it seems like people are no longer into forums. Does anyone still use forums for online socialization, asking questions, discussion/hobbies anymore or have internet forums been rendered redundant?
Forums, as most people see them, are dead. The old fashioned forum system is very outdated, but still has a lot of relevant and useful information. Forums in essence do exist, if you want to look at it from a conversational or a Q&A perspective. Quora, Reddit, etc. are all "forums" in the general meaning, they just aren't displayed or organized as old school forums are. I firmly believe that Quora and Reddit are forums, just with a new and restyled twist. If you are looking for an answer in terms of old school forums, then I do think they are dead, although it is sad to see their existence go.
