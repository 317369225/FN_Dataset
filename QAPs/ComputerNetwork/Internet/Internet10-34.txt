★Is the Internet spoiling young children?
I don't see the problem with it. I'm in my late 20s now.  I turned out okay. I had all those freedoms and were exposed to all those "bad" things, but it hasn't turned me into a bad person.  It just helped me understand what the world was like better, faster, and earlier in my life.  Just because young people are exposed to Something and even curious to try sth "bad" it doesn't mean they  will be forever corrupted. People have the agency to make their own choices and to live their lives their own way, and learn to be judicious and discerning as they live life and make mistakes.  By  removing trust in young people just because they are young insults the basic intelligence that humans are born with, and such arrogance is probably why smart, young people would lose their respect for you.
