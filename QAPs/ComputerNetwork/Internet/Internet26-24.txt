â˜…How do I become a hustler?
Start hustling. Get all the old things you have around, make pics, start selling them on ebay and everywhere. Make the prices outrageously high at first, and keep them up. Then start decreasing them slowly for items that haven't yet been sold. Feel the taste of money. Fast money. Easy money (compared to 9 to 5). Then find something else to sell. And first you must learn how to write a basic ad. Google "Bencivenga Persuasion Equation" for that, but that's an overkill for you now.
