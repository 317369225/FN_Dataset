★Is the Internet spoiling young children?
I would just like to comment on the comments above: our carelessness is whats destroying us.  I was surprised how people here are trying to shade the problem instead of facing it. The fact that the world has always been corrupt must be perceived as Alarming! If you think your in a life where society, nature, or nurture control you, please keep it for yourself and let other people who are actually LIVING not being LIVED do what they want. Many many years and centuries have passed, but you human, still have not discovered yourself. A crack on the wall is not that important, and can be neglected. After all, all walls have cracks on them! The day will come however, when the wall falls on you. For this life, that day is the day you die.
