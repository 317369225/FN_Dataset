★What are the real-life equivalents of "Trolling on the Internet" ?
I think my understanding of a "troll" differs from people in this thread ... I understand that a troll does not necessarily believe in the merits of his own argument. All of his actions are motivated by a lust for the "lulz". Keeping that in mind, I think the simplest real-life example of trolling would be those  prank calls people make ... "I.P. Freely", anyone?
