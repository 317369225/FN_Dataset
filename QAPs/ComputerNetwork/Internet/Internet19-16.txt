â˜…Are internet forums dead?There seemed to be a time where everyone congregated on forums. WIth the presence of Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Quora, etc. it seems like people are no longer into forums. Does anyone still use forums for online socialization, asking questions, discussion/hobbies anymore or have internet forums been rendered redundant?
For me, i am lazier to spend much time on forums than before. I'd rather enjoy the "fast food" from others on facebook or twitter. Lazier to think, lazier to talk, lazier to type. Just wanna to see what others are talking about, what they are sharing. Lazy to participate, just onlook. I have an account on pinterest, i just wanna share the gorgeous pics, seldom check others account info or comment there...
