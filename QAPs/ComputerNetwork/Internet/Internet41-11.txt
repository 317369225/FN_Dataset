â˜…What are the unwritten rules of the Internet circa 2011?This is incredibly broad, but a lot of this is just not written down or in the law. For instance, an ethos that a robust intellectual property strategy is bad. Or asking for an NDA is a faux pas. Or that data scraping for commercial purposes is not defensible.
I have the full list of unwritten rules. I can't post them though because they would lose their "unwritten" status.
