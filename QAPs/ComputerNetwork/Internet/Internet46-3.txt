★Is there an alternative to the Internet?
I found an initiative called Netsukuku. I guess that sort of "alternative" is what you are looking for. The Iranian idea, I do not think is a good one. Not because politics is involved, but because it is just an Intranet with country-size coberture.  It does not seem to have access to the entire world, if ever implemented.
