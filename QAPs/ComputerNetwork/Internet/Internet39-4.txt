â˜…If you could remove one thing from the Internet forever, what would it be?
One word: Misinformation. I come from the days when the internet was a series of UUCP feeds via the FIDO Network and 2400 Baud Modems. BBS's were almost the only way to communicate and phone calls were expensive. Most users were academics. The cost of calls meant that people were economical in their comms and stuck to what they were passionate about. We had flame wars, but for the most part the level of factual truth was high. We looked forward to the day when the net would be universally available, imagining a new age of enlightenment and knowledge. Then came the www. That abbreviation was the first sign of silliness. Double U x 3? Nine syllables? World Wide Web was three syllables! People instantly grouped themselves into tribes and reinforced each others' prejudices. In a magnificent sea of knowledge, there erupted hills of hogwash, fiefdoms of fallacies and mountains of misinformation,. "I saw it on the net" was no longer a guarantee of fact or truth. It only takes a few clicks to fact check - there are even browser extensions that have been developed for the purpose, sites and groups that debunk etc, yet many people choose to mindlessly share complete hoaxes that validate and spread ignorance. The only benefit of this process is that it becomes obvious where the most lack of knowledge lies. Even Quora attempts to deal with this. I fervently hope this is a transitional stage and that the truth will slowly win, but there are no guarantees. Formal education is meant to give you the tools to approach life as a permanent learning process - the net is a perfect tool for that, but only if it is consciously used for the purpose of learning.
