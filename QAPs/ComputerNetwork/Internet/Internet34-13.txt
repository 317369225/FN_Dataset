★Can I use the internet to save my mom, who suffers from Stage IV cancer?
My mother was diagnosed with stage IIIC ovarian as well.  She is in remission now. She was treated in America.  I don't know what medicine is available to you there so I would suggest you do some searching.  Do not believe the websites that tell you there's a cure.  Stick with known resources such as American cancer society, cancer treatment centers of america etc.  Not knowing what was given to her in the past, it's hard to say if we can even offer her anything she didn't already get.  I wish you all the best and am so sorry to hear about your mother.  I wish her the best as well.  Just be with her and make her comfortable and know she's loved.
