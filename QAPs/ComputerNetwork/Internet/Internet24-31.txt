â˜…What does a bad internet connection teach you?Though a bad internet connection is a pain in the ass,it does teach you some valuable lessons.
I read it somewhere and it really impressed me.... "There are two things in the world that tells about a person's character; a rainy day when you have no umbrella and a Shitty net connection" But seriously, they teach us patience is a virtue and all good thing happens to those who wait... But that principle goes to hell when your internet fails you. Surely this is apocalypse, where machine has taken over mankind.
