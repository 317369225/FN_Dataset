â˜…Are internet forums dead?There seemed to be a time where everyone congregated on forums. WIth the presence of Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Quora, etc. it seems like people are no longer into forums. Does anyone still use forums for online socialization, asking questions, discussion/hobbies anymore or have internet forums been rendered redundant?
No. Hell, I still use Usenet some. Forums are alive and well, but for specialty topics.
