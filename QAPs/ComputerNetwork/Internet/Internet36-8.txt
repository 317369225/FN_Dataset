★Is atheism a fad among Internet users?
Seems like this behavior started thousands of years ago, might be more trendy now. Perhaps many people who are atheists have been afraid to reveal their belief - for example in many parts of America there are very real social consequences to admitting to disbelief in God.  However one can discuss atheism online with far less risk, and one can see that one is not alone in one's belief.
