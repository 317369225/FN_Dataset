★What innate traits do great Internet product leaders share?If you were setting up a program to train user-focused Internet product leaders/creators, what are the traits you'd look for in candidates that can't be easily taught?
Great product leaders are excellent communicators. They can inject a brand new idea into a user’s head in a way that is familiar, intuitive and natural. This skill manifests itself in so many ways: — They abhor confusion, ambiguity and disinterest — They can infuse an idea in their teammates and compel them to act on it — They can write the actual copy that the user interfaces with — They can articulate the value of a product to users, stakeholders and everyone in between — They can handpick the core concepts and words necessary to understand the product — They are great listeners and respond effectively to feedback — They have the restraint to say nothing more than needs to be said, the same sort of restraint required to build product that is cruft- and bullshit-free
