â˜…What was it like to be a programmer without the Internet?When there were no online documentation, no Google, no StackOverflow...
Two things immediately come to mind: 1. It required a lot more desktop space to spread out manuals and code listings. Now that's all on screen, in multiple tabs in my browser. 2. Finding answers to really difficult usage questions often involved researching through hardcopy manuals, journals, Usenet (when available), asking others, going to conferences. A particularly difficult problem might take weeks to solve. Now it can often be dealt with with a quick Google search that points to a Stack Overflow answer. 3. The program editor took up the whole screen, and did not easily let you compare code from multiple sources. Now, I have two large monitors, and typically run my IDE (Interactive Development Environment, an editor on steroids) in one, while testing in the other. Sometimes even stretch the IDE across both if I need to see multiple modules at once. OK, three things. But then, no one expects the Spanish Inquisition.
