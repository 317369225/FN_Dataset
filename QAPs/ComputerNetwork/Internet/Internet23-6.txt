â˜…What is the coolest thing I can buy on the internet for under $100?
http://www.funraniumlabs.com/ They sell vacuum extracted coffee, which is both VERY dense in caffeine and avoids a lot of acids that are in normally brewed coffee. They call it "Black Blood of the Earth", so bonus points. The site also sells metal flasks meant for liquid nitrogen converted into super-insulating beer steins, but those are quite expensive. Edit: I've finally purchased some, and had it. It's fairly similar to what cold espresso would taste like if it didn't become stale and awful when it went cold (good in other words). It has an excellent aroma, but a milder flavor than you might expect. If you dilute it to the volume of its caffeine-equivalent in coffee (like an americano) you'll find it's mildly flavored. It also performs very well as something to soak a cake in (like tiramisu), and the flavor does come through there. Overall a good product, but the price point is pretty high. I will probably buy more, but I'm going through my current bottle very very slowly.
