â˜…How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
When I was a kid we were playing more with each other all kind of games and not on computers because we had none. Walking on the town streets (small town in my native country) was another way to waste time and also a way to know girls (yes, there wasn't this craziness of "don't talk to strangers" and girls/boys could actually get acquainted on the streets - there were no bars or clubs at that time...communist times). Going to movies was another way to spend time and the theater I was regularly going was always full (although most of the movies were quite old). Going to some parties at friends houses was a way to "replace" the non-existent bars and clubs. My town is surrounded by mountains so in the summer going up there was fun (in the winter not so much because there wasn't the possibility for skiing - that was added later). Reading was done also on a regular basis (I got to read two books a day sometimes, when I was in the high school). Then, when I had grown up I spent time working and going to a martial arts club for several years where also I've met other people (and some of them are still my friends now). Then the Internet came and all this went down the toilet...but also new possibilities replaced what I had and that meant getting in contact with people from other cities and other countries, something which couldn't be done easily when the Internet wasn't there. I have made some friends this way too, even meeting some of them in person. For me, overall, the Internet was (still is) a good thing...it came out at the time when I have done pretty much all what it can be done (and more) when you are a kid and teenager and needed to jump to the next step. But I don't know if it's necessarily the best thing for nowadays kids and teenagers.
