★What are some of the most innovative infographics on the internet?Please add what impressed you about it, and whether you think the infographic would have a lasting impact on the world.
I feel "Stats of the Union", though interactive, is a great addition to this list.  The infographic was designed and implemented by Ben Fry (http://www.benfry.com & http://www.processing.org) and colleagues at Fathom (http://www.fathom.info).  And I think the infographic was commissioned by GE (http://visualization.geblogs.com/)? I feel Stats of the Union is innovative for several reasons. It's use of public data.  Looking at the bigger picture there is a growing, and already significant, effort by governments to make public data accessible.  Examples include http://www.data.gov and http://www.data.gov.uk.  Making these various types of data available should encourage new and interesting applications and innovations, many of which serve the greater wellbeing of citizens.  And, the openness suggests to me that there is a increasing awareness of the value of encouraging participation. It's topic regarding health.  As the state of our physical, mental and emotional wellbeing is something that impacts the quality of life of every living human being. It's execution is a delight.  Simply, it's pretty amazing. http://vimeo.com/23482967
