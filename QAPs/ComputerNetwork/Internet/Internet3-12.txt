â˜…What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
It is not about social destination, it is about the ability to seamlessly act on impulse. Connections will allow us to live our lives in a way that puts the information, products or needs in-front of us when we need them. Search turns into delivering anticipated needs. Information becomes relevant and contextual versus spam or advertising. This is not mobile vs desk top, commerce vs ecommerce vs mcommerce, this is about delivering and facilitating at the point of need or impulse, where ever that might be.
