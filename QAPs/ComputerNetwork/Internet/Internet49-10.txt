â˜…What is the scariest thing you have experienced on the Internet?
Many years ago, there was a real video of an American man being beheaded by terrorists...that's all I remember about the story. I was at work, a local real estate office, and the owner's son, who was in his early twenties - just your average everyday joe - was so excited to watch this video, and gathered a few other guys around his age to one of the computers, and they all began watching the video. At first I didn't realize what it was, because I was distracted doing my work, but when I heard the excited shouting from the group, I looked over their shoulders, and what I saw made me sick. What I saw changed my perspective on life, and people, in many ways. The slow and purposeful back and forth motion of the blade cutting through the neck of the young man with red hair and a beard...who remained completely silent, and the sick and twisted smiles and enjoyment of the young men watching it happen...wow. I cannot put into words the gruesome scene before my eyes, and the ugly glimpse into primal human animal behavior. We have a long way to go in our species. A long way to go. That whole scene gave me nightmares and an ugly feeling inside for months...and I'm not sure I ever got over it.
