★What is the best way to learn internet marketing?
Best way to learn is by doing.  It's as simple as starting a blog.  Try to drive traffic.  Try to collect email addresses.  Try to sell your audience a product.  Get on social media, add value, give people reasons to talk about you.  See what works, learn what doesn't.  Test..learn...optimize... and repeat.
