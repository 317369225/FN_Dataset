★What is the best way to learn internet marketing?
Many of the others offered some great resources, so I will just offer two additional ones: MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan...) offers some general Marketing Management courses that are worth checking out.  While they are not specific to internet marketing it's a good starting point. Coursera (http://coursera.org) although they currently do not offer a pure "marketing" course, they do offer a bunch of other courses which play into marketing and will serve you well in learning some of the advanced concepts / data.
