â˜…Is the Internet spoiling young children?
Good answers here. Don't have specific references to type on my phone, but there is neurological research coming out showing the negative effects of long stints spent on iPads and social media, and it turns out there's an impact on brain development in younger children. Doesn't mean there isn't a place for it, but like with most things, kids need balance - they need to discover, imagine, create, without having a cheaper representation being instantly available on a screen. This is equally true for adults, minus the issues surrounding development.
