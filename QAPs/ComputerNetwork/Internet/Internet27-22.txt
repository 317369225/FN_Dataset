â˜…What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
This is starting to sound very familiar. So here's the same old answer. Find some compelling, objective, verifiable proof that Christianity is correct. Present it to the atheists. But don't stop there. Present it to the Buddhists and Moslems and Hindus as well. Present it to the Communists in China and North Korea. Pretty soon you will have converted the entire world, you'll be hailed as a universal saviour, and they'll make you a lifetime recipient of the Templeton Prize. Of course, you'll have to find the proof first.
