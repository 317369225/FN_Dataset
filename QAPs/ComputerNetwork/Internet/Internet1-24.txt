â˜…What will the Internet look like in 2020?I'd like as many different descriptions of what the usage, adoption and structure of the Internet will look like in the year 2020 as possible. Be creative, and try to think outside the box how it will change in the next seven years. Let's see what the current early adopters of the Internet come up with (since we're all using Quora...).
The Internet will have transformed households (even households consisting of 1 person) to a higher maturity level. The majority of households will have transformed into household-companies due to advanced integrated tooling (e.g. addressbooks of now will be household-crm systems in 2020). The main difference with current enterprise systems is that household software is unstructured while enterprise systems are structured.
