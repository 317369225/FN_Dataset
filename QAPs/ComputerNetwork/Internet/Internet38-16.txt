â˜…What are the hottest startups in India?
My Epoch A startup out of IIT Delhi. It helps students in making their college yearbooks. It was actually in last semester when we were thinking that we need more than a T-shirt for us to remember the awesome days spent. Hence we thought of a platform to ease out the process. While working we found out that the Yearbook making process is very tiresome and often the responsibility falls on 2-3 students to collect data, design, get it print etc. So we decided to pursue the idea We made an online social platform where students of a college can register , update their profile, write about their friends. We would design, print and deliver the yearbooks to the students. PiNotes - Its coming soon!!!
