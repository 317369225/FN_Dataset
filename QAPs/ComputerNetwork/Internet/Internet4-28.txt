â˜…What have you found on the Internet today that made you smile?
I have been applying for jobs quite desperately over the past few months. More often than not, I end up making a silly error in the mail and then smack my head after clicking "Send". Today was one of those days when I forgot to attach my CV and Gmail prompted me with this message after I clicked on "Send". I felt so relieved and thankful towards the caring developer who decided to add this feature :') After sending the mail, I smiled to myself for nearly 2 minutes. What a beautiful world!!
