★Is atheism a fad among Internet users?
Sometime in primary school* (when, in the UK, religion was forced on us every morning) I decided I wanted nothing to do with it - much like I wanted nothing to do with most things that teachers were trying to force on us at school.  It was boring, and unnecessary.  Sometime later on, I learned that there was a word 'atheist'. Oh, that's me, I thought. I rarely thought about it again. If people are obviously religious, I assume they're believers. If they're not, I don't care and it's irrelevant. It's not something I recall ever talking about  with any of my friends. If I did, the conversation would go something like "You believe in god(s)?" "[yes/no]" "OK, now let's talk about something more interesting."  I also don't think about the fact that I'm a primate very often. I think about it sometimes when I see questions like this on sites like Quora, and I think "Oh, they're talking about me, aren't they?" *Approaching 40 years ago, before most people had heard of the internet or used a computer.
