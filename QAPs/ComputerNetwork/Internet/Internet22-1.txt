â˜…Is the Internet evil?What is the one thing common to Einstein, Newton, Beethoven, Nietzsche and Alexander Fleming? Apart from an extraordinary intelligence, none of them had access to the Internet. Does that mean the Internet is an impediment to the growth of human intelligence? If yes, does that make it evil ?
What a strange question. It seems that the question proposes some arbitrary connections that cannot be proven. How could one posit that the existence of Einstein, Newton, Beethoven, Nietzsche and Fleming depend on such a singular factor rather than on specifics on ones gifts and circumstances? Is the assumption then, that the existence of the internet would preclude the existence of any future persons with comparable intellect without regard to each person's gifts and circumstance? I know this is not true. Brilliance walks among us everyday. It is neither obvious, nor easily recognized in the course of everyday life. I don't understand how this can fit within the framework of "Good" and "Evil". These are moral assignations to what is essentially non-moral technology.
