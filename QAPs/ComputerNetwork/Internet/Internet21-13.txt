★How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
I worked on a pipeline as a welders helper.  Essentially for 12 hours I stood around.  To kill time I taught myself some really useless skills.  How to whistle (poorly) how to blow bubble gum bubbles.  I  practised multiplication tables and divisions.  Stuff like that. I am not a person that runs out of things to think about.  I can do just fine without Internet.
