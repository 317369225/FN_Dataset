â˜…What are the real-life equivalents of "Trolling on the Internet" ?
Some academic ones: Any vita/thesis defence Q&A session is basically 60% valid questions and 40% high-level trolling by attending professors. The academic publishing process is a system devised by trolls. Write up your research in the proper format, have a slim chance of publishing it in a journal after corrections from people working for the publisher but not getting paid for their work. Then you either pay to publish it (outrageous sums if open access), or publish it for free within strict limits, in which case your work (average 10 pages) will be sold at prices that are higher than most books, including textbooks. Academic publishers all deserve a great troll star. Job ads that ask for experienced young people with a degree are written by trolls. Get invited to submit a research proposal as part of a multi-authored grant proposal. Write proposal complete with detailed budget breakdown and submit it a couple of weeks before the deadline. The person who is putting the whole document together forgets to copy-paste your part. Trololo~
