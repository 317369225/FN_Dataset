â˜…What does a bad internet connection teach you?Though a bad internet connection is a pain in the ass,it does teach you some valuable lessons.
I'm living in a developing country with very slow and unreliable internet. Mostly, via my own frustration, it teaches me how true this is, by Louis CK: Transcript (plus audio clip) "I was on an airplane and there was high speed internet on the airplane-- that's the newest thing that I know exists. And I'm sitting on the plane and they go, 'open up your laptop and you can go on the internet' and it's fast and I'm watching YouTube clips. It's amazing... then it breaks down and they apologize: 'the internet is not working' and the guy next to me goes 'pbbt, this is bull****.' Like, how quickly the world owes him something he knew existed only 10 seconds ago."
