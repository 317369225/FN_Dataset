Know why you are on the Internet. Don't spend any time in the internet unless there's a clear purpose. I think many of us have been trained in a sense to go onto the internet as a means to evade pure boredom. Then, browsing the web becomes completely a waste of time. Instead, spend your free time finding out what you are curious about or drawn to, start taking steps to DO it, and then use the internet as a means to an end. That is productive. Most sites that people think aren't productive can be productive. For example, you figure out that you want to reconnect with an old friend. Therefore, spending time on Facebook to reach out and message them is productive. Or, you want to write an article on weird or funny anecdotes posted on Reddit. Then going onto reddit is productive. It all depends on whether you come into the internet with a mission or are wandering around aimlessly (in which case, get off the internet! Go outside and interact with the physical world!).
