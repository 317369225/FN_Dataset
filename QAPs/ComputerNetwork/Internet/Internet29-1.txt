â˜…What's it like to work for Rocket Internet?I've noticed they've been hiring alot recently, especially within the U.S. I was wondering if anyone has had experience working there. What is their reputation within the industry?
I work for one of the Rocket Internet ventures - can't disclose exact one for obvious reasons :) First of all I would say that your experience will depend on large part on what position you are hired into. People coming in as EIRs, co founders, global venture developers - i.e. people who are hired directly by the German partners - tend to have a lot more leverage in the organisation than others. So, if you are joining in one of the fore-mentioned positions, the tradeoff is very clear. On the one hand you get a lot of responsibility and opportunity to build and lead a team of your own. On the other hand, you will have to compromise salary; potentially location; and definitely your scruples/ having a professional work environment. If you're not careful, you may also find yourself having to face legal and tax risks because of your employment with Rocket. So you have to be very careful in analysing the risks. This applies in particular to people who are taking up overseas assignments with Rocket. If you are joining in a non-management level position, the cost-benefit is a lot worse. You lose a lot more than you gain (salary, responsibility, professional work environment is what you lose, and being in a high energy, fast paced exciting work environment is what you gain). On balance, if you are a German/Austrian with good exit options (based on your prior work experience) and connections at the top (to Oliver or the partners) then I think it can be a great experience. For everyone else, think again. And think hard.
