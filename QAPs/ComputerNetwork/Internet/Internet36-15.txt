★Is atheism a fad among Internet users?
I guess you can say the internet has something to do with the growth in the number of atheists, but not something as trend or fad. I have been an atheist long before I was a heavy internet user, but I never had the courage to "come out" - I didn't know that many atheists. By seeing the growth of an atheist community on the internet, and by getting in touch and sharing ideas with people about it, I found this courage. I can only guess if that which gave me this courage to come out is a trend.  And I really can't see how a person would just became an atheist for the kicks since this brings a lot of prejudice and downsides to this choice.
