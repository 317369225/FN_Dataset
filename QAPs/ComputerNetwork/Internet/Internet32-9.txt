â˜…Is the Internet killing religion?
I don't think that correlation means much. US is becoming more and more secular for decades, and internet use is on the rise for years. There is no wonder they have a negative correlation. While, internet use in China is on the rise, even more rapidly than US, but religions like Buddhism and Christianity are becoming more and more popular in China. So NO will be my answer.
