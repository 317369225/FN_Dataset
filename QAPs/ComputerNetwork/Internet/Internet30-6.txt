â˜…Will the Internet ever become obsolete?
Given that millions of devices are being added a year, and even home appliances are getting IP addresses, the internet is not going to be obsolete until John Connor shuts down Skynet. On a serious note, short of a global apocalypse, the Internet is here to stay. For instance, even during total government black outs like the Egyptian protests, people found a way to Tweet. But that is the beauty of it - it cannot be shut down. There is no "Off" switch. It is now connected via undersea optical cables, satellites and wireless networks. So there you have it - the last Wall-E collecting garbage on Earth will probably connect to the internet. *If this question is inspired by "The Grid" of CERN - It will NOT replace the internet.
