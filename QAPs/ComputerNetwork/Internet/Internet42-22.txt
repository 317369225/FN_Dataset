★What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1980s?A follow-up question to What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
I started using the net in 1987, on a unix box at work. Since the company did government contracts, we were hooked up well. As others have mentioned, there was just email/FTP/telnet as tools and the only ‘community’ was usent newsgroups. And yes, if you tried to do anything at home it was brutally slow. As I remember, there were only a few thousand domains. I was a bit of an evangelist, boring my friends and relative with stories of how amazing it was to be able to send a file to someone, instead of faxing. When the first browsers appeared in 92/93, (point & click, instead of “telnet to IP x.x.x.x, then cd to different directories, then ‘get’ a file”) I knew that global acceptance was pretty much done deal.
