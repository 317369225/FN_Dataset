â˜…What are the hottest startups in India?
InMobi (2nd largest mobile Ad Network the world) Grabbon (bought by snapdeal) and Taggle (group buying) CloudMagic (improves searching for information in gmail, Facebook, Evernote, box, dropbox and other services.) AllGo Systems (conceptualised a $35 tablet.. possibly the Indian govt one) Notion Ink (developing Adam tablet has shifted their base to Bannerghatta Road) Althea Systems (the company behind shufflr.tv -- making videos more social) Hidden Reflex (Built Epic Browser, the first truly Indian browser) With inputs from Baishampayan Ghose Ashwin Prabhu Sanjay Kamble // NOTE: Most of the companies listed here, I believe, do not deserve to be on the list anymore.
