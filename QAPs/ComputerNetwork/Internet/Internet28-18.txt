★What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
To the other excellent posts, I have to add that over in Italy, where I was living at the time, everything was very time-lagged. In the early 90's  we were under the iron heel of the Telecom Italia monopoly and it sucked to no end. I guess I have to be grateful that at least it was not France, where the suckiness lasted even longer. Inside universities the excellent GARR-NIR academic network would link to the European and US network, so it was all Gopher, FTP, NNTP, IRC fun. Spelunking inside the alt.* binary groups was at times a bit more educational than expected. So was tweaking people on IRC. Outside of universities, you would have to wait for months to get an Internet contract with Telecom, and it would make sense only for company use. ISDN was being pushed quite aggressively. Owning and using your own modem was actually illegal. Since the phone network was a strategic resource, the only hardware you could hook up to the phone socket was hardware that you had rented from Telecom. By the way, the phone socket was this giant horror, almost but not quite uglier than the British power plug. Of course, Italy being Italy everybody was soon in violation of the law. Things became freaky when a free dial-up Internet provider and portal called Video On Line started spamming everybody through every possible channel with sign-on floppies. We did not have AOL, but VOL tried hard to fill a similar niche. I suspect that somebody, somewhere, is still dialing into the last VOL modem. The advent of VOL was the beginning of public Internet access in Italy. After VOL was purchased by Telecom Italia in 1996, the market started opening up and connectivity prices started coming down. Overall, in Italy people realized the potential of the Internet much later than in the US. I remember having to convince CEOs of small Italian companies that they needed a website. "What for?" they would ask.
