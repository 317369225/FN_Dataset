â˜…What is the Internet of Things?
Two questions in one. I will follow the question What is IOT and how it is different from IOE? IoE is the acronym for Internet of Everything. IoE is a acronym used by Cisco. Maybe it is a trademark of them already. IoT and IoE is in my opinion the same. An older word than IoT and IoE is M2M (Machine to Machine). Today M2M is a subset of the IoT. In May 2012 I started to write a book. I called it the M2M Cookbook. M2M, IoT and IoT are using wireless data communication. 25 years ago - where started my job in wireless - we had no word like M2M, IoT or IoE. We designed things that they call M2M, IoT or IoE devices today. We played with wireless stuff without to know, that such a device will later on called an IoT device. My M2M Cookbook I renamed to the IoT M2M Cookbook already. It will be the IoT M2M Cookbook and not the IoT IoE M2M Cookbook and not the M2M IoT Cookbook.
