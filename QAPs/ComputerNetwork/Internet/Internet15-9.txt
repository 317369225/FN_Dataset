â˜…What consumer Internet companies had a large number of users but failed to monetize?How large were the companies, and how did their monetization strategies fail? I'm specifically interested in revenues, rather than profit. E.g., YouTube had lots of users and revenues, but minimal profits. I'm interested in lots of users and minimal revenues.
Quora? Instagram? Pinterest (too early, maybe)? Friendster? MapQuest (in its heyday)? All the web 1.0 search engines. Foursquare (probably not huge, but still big). Wikipedia (bad example, maybe)... how about Wikia? And, I was on the team that helped sunset Geocities. As Even says, in the early days it may have monetized well but if the cost of acquiring a user and OpEx is higher than total revenue, it's hard to make that work long term. But if they are huge and lose boatloads of cash and operational focus who cares if they generate any cash?
