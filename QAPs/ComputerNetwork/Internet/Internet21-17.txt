â˜…How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
Lots of TV, which was way different but probably not better or worse than now -- except for the news shows which were actually thoughtful adult-oriented broadcasts with journalism standards in those days (think Walter Cronkite). Lots of extremely annoying and unproductive time driving to malls, circling for a parking place in said malls, and shopping in malls. Traveling to book store, browsing in book stores for hours to find just the right book(s), then reading said book(s). Magazines were a major information resource, and were much more interesting both in the news domain and the technical domain in those days - both have been severely dumbed down now. The only reasonably literate news magazine left is the Economist. Ham radio. CB. Model trains. Radio-controlled airplanes. Slot cars. Etc. Lots and lots of time on the phone chatting with friends and family. I hated phone calls so don't miss this at all. Bars (some things don't change). I swear I'm not actually a curmudgeon.
