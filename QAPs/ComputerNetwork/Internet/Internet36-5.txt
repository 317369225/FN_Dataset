â˜…Is atheism a fad among Internet users?
I don't think it's a fad -- I just think the Internet enabled the conversation in ways that weren't possible before. If you think about it, prior to the Internet, theists and atheists probably moved in different circles, or if they did interact, they interacted in places (work) where talking about faith was at least inconvenient and possibly even frowned upon. Now that the Internet exists and people are more connected, it's easier for the faithful to bump into the atheists that have always been out there.
