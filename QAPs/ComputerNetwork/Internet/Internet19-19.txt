â˜…Are internet forums dead?There seemed to be a time where everyone congregated on forums. WIth the presence of Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Quora, etc. it seems like people are no longer into forums. Does anyone still use forums for online socialization, asking questions, discussion/hobbies anymore or have internet forums been rendered redundant?
I think that forums are suffering of the increase of new way of communication on the net. However, wa cannot say forums are dead. It is absolutly not true. First of all, even if all become more and more virtual people still need to share, exchange and discuss. Secondly some compnies like Forumotion are doing very well.
