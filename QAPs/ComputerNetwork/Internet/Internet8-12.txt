★What was it like to be a programmer without the Internet?When there were no online documentation, no Google, no StackOverflow...
Lots and lots of books or magazines.  I used to keep the 6502 assembler opcode chart taped up near my desk.  That thing was my bible. If you didn't know how to do something, you asked someone who worked at your office, or you got a book (and of course you had to go to an actual book store - no Amazon then). I remember once I had to write an algorithm to convert spreadsheet formulas stored in reverse polish to infix ... in 6502 assembler.  The C guy at my shop knew the recursive algorithm so that was not useful. Luckily my high school textbook had a solution involving two stacks and no recursion. Solving tough problems back then made you feel like a God. Nowadays most everything's just a Google search away. Not that I would want to go backwards...
