★If you could remove one thing from the Internet forever, what would it be?
Any reference to "Hitler" which is not directly related to the subjects of: Adolf Hitler,Nazi Germany, The Holocaust or World War II. Next to a certain racial invective spewed by those who hate Black people in general, and African Americans in particular, nothing else will end rational conversation online faster than someone inaccuractely or hyperbolically referring  to anyone else or anything else as being "Hitler" or "Hitler-like."
