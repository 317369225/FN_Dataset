â˜…Is the Internet evil?What is the one thing common to Einstein, Newton, Beethoven, Nietzsche and Alexander Fleming? Apart from an extraordinary intelligence, none of them had access to the Internet. Does that mean the Internet is an impediment to the growth of human intelligence? If yes, does that make it evil ?
I don't think the Internet in itself is necessary evil. The people on the other side of the screen, sure. It's sort of like someone having a live grenade and letting them pick which side to toss it in. The right side is an open field where nobody will be hurt. The left side is filled with mingling people and buildings. Nobody will see you do it so there isn't anything really and truly wrong, right? That's when having a concision can be helpful.
