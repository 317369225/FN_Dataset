â˜…Who will be the leading companies of the Internet of Things?Everything relating to the ethos of connecting the worlds devices to the web makes sense. I wonder in what timeframe it will play out? And who will be the leaders of this wave of technology.
One trend I find fascinating is what happens beyond the initial connection of devices. How will the internet connection of devices really change how we use products and devices. One company I have spoken to who has a unique take on it is Evoz (Welcome to evoz!) - they are putting the data and services first. Will take a while to see if they got it right but the features and value prop they are trying to offer device makers is really interesting.
