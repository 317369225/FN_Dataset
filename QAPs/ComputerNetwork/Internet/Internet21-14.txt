â˜…How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
Pinball machines worked for me. The goal was to get so good at pinball that you could get a quarter to last for an hour or until people behind you started clamoring for their turn. One of the reasons I never got into gaming is that I had already wasted huge chunks of time on various pinball machines.
