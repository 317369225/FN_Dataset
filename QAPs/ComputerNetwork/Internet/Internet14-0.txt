★What is the best way to learn internet marketing?
Hi there, that's a great question.  It happens to be one that I love answering because my entry into the web marketing profession was so far off the beaten path. The answer will really depend on how you learn.  I've noticed that there are several different learning styles. Visual Learners - These are your folks that learn best by watching someone else do whatever it is that you're trying to learn.  Ideal Learning Method for Visual Learners:  Video courses, YouTube or a physical classroom.  If this is you you might enjoy Udemy, InstanteTraining or TutsPlus. Cerebral Learners - These folks are able to learn the material just by hearing how to do something. Ideal Learning Method for Cerebral Learners:  Reading a book, joining an online forum or talking to others in the field.  If this is you you might like SEObook.com (their premium subscription), reading Kaushik Avinash's book called Web Analytics: An Hour a Day or reading Aaron Wall's Building Findable Websites: Web Standards, SEO, and Beyond. Action Oriented Learners - If this is you, you learn best by doing the thing that you're trying to learn and adjusting to correct or improve upon your mistakes. Ideal Learning Method for Action Oriented Learners: Internships, freelance work, volunteer work.  Note: I know it might sound weird to work on something that you may not know that well, but believe me...I've definitely seen folks that learned web marketing this way. Hope that helps!
