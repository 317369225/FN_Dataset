â˜…What is the Internet?
A free network of computers (as in sense of freedom) where platforms like Quora exist. A place where dumb people can ask question instead of just doing a simple Google search. What? Google banned/not working/some legit reason? Okay, you could have at least searched it on Quora : What is Internet? and What is internet now? Infact, I know you have no access issues because I can know who asked the question. So I simply have to look up your profile to know who you are! Mr. Avinash Soni, if you are new to Quora, please read the excellent guidelines and tutorials already posted. Please do not pollute Quora and degrade its quality by your actions. IMPORTANT: If you had added this question in any other context except the obvious, please mention it in details. Do point out the intention behind posting the question because intentional or otherwise, stupidity on Quora is almost always answered with sarcasm.
