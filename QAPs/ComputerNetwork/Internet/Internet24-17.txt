â˜…What does a bad internet connection teach you?Though a bad internet connection is a pain in the ass,it does teach you some valuable lessons.
A bad Internet connection teaches me: 1) value of patience 2) to reflect on how much our society has changed because of Internet 3) to realize that as our world becomes increasingly computerized, the less and less and less patient we become 4) to appreciate the knowledge that, even with a bad Internet connection, what we get out of Internet far outweighs the negatives
