★Are internet forums dead?There seemed to be a time where everyone congregated on forums. WIth the presence of Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Quora, etc. it seems like people are no longer into forums. Does anyone still use forums for online socialization, asking questions, discussion/hobbies anymore or have internet forums been rendered redundant?
I have watched many good communities die off.  It seems politics and teen age sexual problem forums are thriving sadly. America has become a pills and drugs nation and it's showing online.
