★What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
Francis of Assisi is said to have said, "Preach the gospel at all times; when necessary, use words." " A little less conversation, a little more action."    Elvis Presley Live a life that is ethical, peaceful, respectful of the earth, others, no believers, that serves others , that wages peace and not war.. do that, and maybe, just maybe, you'll have a chance at having their attention. Or stop trying to recruit people, lest you fall into a Pyramid scheme type mindset.
