â˜…Are relationships on the Internet really real?Without any sound, facial expressions, or any kind actual, physical human interaction beyond sending lines of text to one another, words which one can edit and second guess prior to sending, are human relationships over the internet really human or are they actually superficial and fake to some degree?
I have been "in real life" relationships with some people who I can now say were ultimately strangers, and I have had deep connect with people who I only communicate with online. Of the two, which was more real? I'd say the latter. Of course not all real life relationships or online relationships are like that but online relationships could be just as real.
