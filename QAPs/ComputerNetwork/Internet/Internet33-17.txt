â˜…What innate traits do great Internet product leaders share?If you were setting up a program to train user-focused Internet product leaders/creators, what are the traits you'd look for in candidates that can't be easily taught?
An unreasonable "Bias for action". Most of the leaders fall into a trap of getting the complete numbers to analyze and then decide their plan of action. I would look for a individual with an innate drive to get the product out in the view and then keep making changes as feedback starts arriving. And an ability to say No.
