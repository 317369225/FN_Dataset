â˜…Can I use the internet to save my mom, who suffers from Stage IV cancer?
The latest and best information about cancer treatment available anywhere is at the US National Cancer Institute's website (see National Cancer Institute ), with separate information for patients and medical professionals. (Sites from other government-supported agencies, such as those in the UK or Canada, are of course equally trustworthy) A strategy for finding a good specialist is to go to PubMed (Home - PubMed - NCBI) , use the name of the person's cancer as the search term, find experts who have written review articles (describing the latest information on diagnosis and treatment of that cancer), look for a set of authors geographically close to you, and ask their office for either an appointment or a referral. Do not believe what you read on the general Internet via Google. Trust only the NCI site (or a similar government-sponsored site) for information about diagnosis, treatment, and followup, because these sites have been vetted by the best cancer specialists. Unfortunately by Stage IV most cancers are not curable. Therefore except for patients who are determined to spend their last days focusing on fighting the cancer (and I mean the patients themselves, not their loved ones), it may be most gratifying to find ways to make the last days meaningful for everyone involved. For this, the Internet can be very useful. No matter what disease is involved, a careful search can locate forums and support groups for patients and their care providers and family. Offering a truly diverse and caring group of interested individuals, many of these online support groups demonstrate the capabilities of the Internet at its best.
