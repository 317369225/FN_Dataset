â˜…Can I use the internet to save my mom, who suffers from Stage IV cancer?
I am sympathetic to what you are going through; in 2005 my Mom was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and it started were her ovaries used to be. Chemo gave her more time. She spent it well. And, I flew to Southern California from Idaho every other month. During her chemo, I was there for four of her treatments. The internet explained things, but it does not offer a cure. The only cure is love and presence. Be with her as much as you can. All I can tell you or advise you is one thing: be present for her. Listen to what she has to tell you. Ask questions about her before you were born. The stories will be incredible! And, there is valuable advice in the previous posts. Glean from those. I read a book titled, Final Gifts, and it was very helpful for my siblings since they had never gone through this process before. All I will tell you is that every chapter is a different and beautiful story. Read it because it will help you. Your mother's story will be just as beautiful if you ask her to tell you. Take care,
