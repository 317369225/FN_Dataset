★When will China join the rest of the world on the real Internet?
It is not easy to predict the future of China because you never know what CPC will do in the next minute, so I just share some changes I've seen in Chinese online communities. one year, may be two years ago, CPC's leaders' name would be automatically "correct" to something like *** in basically all online communities. Image how hilarious it is when you see “*** is the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China”. Now there aren't any ***. I consider this change as a signal that China is gradually getting closer to the rest of the world, so I believe China will get rid of the Great Firewall in 20 years. I admit i'm an optimist. "I'd love to see Chinese people on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube as much as other people. When do you think this will happen?" Take a look at what happened when Google+ was unblocked. It will be a chaos. Chinese characters everywhere..BUT just for a while, one year at most.
