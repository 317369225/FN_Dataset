â˜…What is the Internet of Things?
There are few definitions that I can think of when it comes to Internet of Things. Oxford Dictionary (yeap, IoT was added in August 2013) : A proposed development of the Internet in which everyday objects have network connectivity, allowing them to send and receive data. (Internet of things) Next, wikipedia: uniquely identifiable objects and their virtual representations in an Internet-like structure.(Internet of Things) Personally, I think the best definition was giving by SAP AG : A world where physical objects are seamlessly integrated into the information network, and where the physical objects can become active participants in business processes. Services are available to interact with these 'smart objects' over the Internet, query and change their state and any information associated with them, taking into account security and privacy issues. Note: I would also like to highlight that IoT is relatively new and the definition is growing and evolving as I write this. So, maybe we got to wait and see how people will define it in another 10 years. This particular info graphics answers all your questions very well: (credit: postscapes-harbor-iot-infographics.jpg)
