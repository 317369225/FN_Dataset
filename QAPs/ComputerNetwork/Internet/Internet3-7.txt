â˜…What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?
Aggregate & Filter. The internet's biggest challenge lies in taking billions of billions of data points and putting them together into readable, actionable forms of content with predictive abilities. Imagine Twitter's power if they had built a system that somehow aggregates all tweets into one mega media library. Now do the same for Google. Nowadays when searching Google, most of us get the same list of suggested topics as the other, without regard of our demographics, social graph or personal taste. Aggregation of my preferences, poll rankings, page views and tweets would eventually lead to costumized & personalized recommendations that are based on my previous actions and the action of people with similar demographics as myself. Therefore, I believe that the next disruptive tech will be the one to manage a data collection system that aggregates data in a structured way and with that reduces the noise to minimum.
