â˜…What free stuff on the internet should everyone be taking advantage of?
You can learn how to play musical instruments or to practice what you've learned with your teacher. I'm using free videos on YouTube to practice my guitar skills and there are many videos out there. I don't know if learning to play other musical instruments is as effective as guitar learning but for me it's perfect. You still need to practice a lot but the videos are awsome.
