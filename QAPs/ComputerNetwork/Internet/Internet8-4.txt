★What was it like to be a programmer without the Internet?When there were no online documentation, no Google, no StackOverflow...
I learned programming in Manila, not just without the Internet, but without contact with fellow programmers. I started programming on my own in 1987, got BBS access in 1993, and the Internet in late 1994. From 1987 to 1991, my high school years, I subsisted on some low-quality book reprints, and  photocopied manuals from Virra Mall, the software piracy mecca of that time. I was lucky there was one store that specialized in programmer stuff - both books and pirated software. I had no idea whether I was going down the right path. In retrospect, I didn't - I wasted some time doing various kinds of BASIC, then x86 assembly, when I could have done C (programming language) instead. In 1991, I went to college and got access to the library, computer science faculty, and interested peers. In 1993, I discovered Linux, through the 20+ floppy disks of Slackware.
