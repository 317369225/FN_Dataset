I used to work for TCS and there was a lady in my team who had an issue with her monitor. She raised a request with tech support to replace the monitor.   A guy from tech support came to replace the monitor who in turn gave her a brand new monitor and left with the old one. She was idle for about half an hour without connecting the new monitor to power supply and CPU, while my other colleague casually asked her what she was waiting for. She told him that "My files are in the other monitor and I am waiting for that guy to come back and copy them to my new monitor". We laughed our ass off! :)   She had a total of 5 years of IT experience when this incident took place. Edit 1: I don't have anything in store to prove that this incident actually happened, to you all but I'm still living and I've witnessed it! If you choose not to believe it, just chill and at least laugh at my creativity! :D
