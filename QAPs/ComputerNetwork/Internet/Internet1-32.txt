★What will the Internet look like in 2020?I'd like as many different descriptions of what the usage, adoption and structure of the Internet will look like in the year 2020 as possible. Be creative, and try to think outside the box how it will change in the next seven years. Let's see what the current early adopters of the Internet come up with (since we're all using Quora...).
The Internet will be integrated into everyday life. People won't "log on" anymore, rather it will serve as a virtual dimension. More complex than width, depth, or height, it will offer an abundance of information. Similar to a sixth sense with which we will analyze situations.  Already in the works, contact lenses with user interfaces allow wearers to identify people on the street via facial recognition technology, seamlessly bringing up their social media profiles, phone numbers, addresses, anything about them that is listed in the cyber dimension. Life will consist of various user interfaces that are globally connected, allowing effortless communication with anyone and everyone. The scale of communication will transform business models and social institutions such as the church and the family. The real question is whether or not this influx of readily available information on every person we meet will have positive effects on our relationships.
