★What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
Simple, you need to do what no theist has so far ever managed to do throughout the whole history of religion, provide evidence that there is a god, that it's your god and that said god agrees with everything you say and think.  Provide genuine, repeatable, testable evidence and you'll convert every atheist on the planet overnight.
