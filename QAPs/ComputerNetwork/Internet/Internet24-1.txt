â˜…What does a bad internet connection teach you?Though a bad internet connection is a pain in the ass,it does teach you some valuable lessons.
That my garden needs to be watered. That I've not watched many of the DVDs I've bought in a really long time, if ever. That Lego Star Wars on the Playstation 3 is just as fun the second time around That my house isn't nearly as clean as I think it is. That my dogs are a lot more fun when they aren't laying around the house. That playing Civilization V doesn't take nearly as long when you're playing alone, offline. That the stuff on tv is still shit. That sometimes getting to work a half hour early isn't so bad.
