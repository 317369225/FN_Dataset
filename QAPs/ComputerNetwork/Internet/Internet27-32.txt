â˜…What is the best way to convert atheists to Christianity over the Internet?
I find that every time Christians try to convert atheists over the internet, they only end up getting called out on their hypocrisy when they get attacked for trying to shove their beliefs down atheists' throats. Atheists are pretty sick of having to deal with people spouting their religious dogma everywhere they go, and telling everybody else they need to convert to that religion or suffer damnation. Gets pretty old after a while, and when you start preaching at atheists over the internet, you're probably going to get a not-so-nice response.
