â˜…When will China join the rest of the world on the real Internet?
Chinese people already have weibo(chinese twitter/Facebook),youku (chinese YouTube),they really don't need Facebook and YouTube, if you really want to talk to Chinese, you should use what Chinese use ,and just don't think Chinese in western way !
