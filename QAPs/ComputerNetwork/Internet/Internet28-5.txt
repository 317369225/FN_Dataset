★What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
Mm. University servers, and then...oh, the breathtaking joy of commercial Internet access! And then...this thing that started to be rumored about. A graphical sort of gopher? Oh my. Every day, there was a buzz about what big company was online now. So much excitement as cocacola.com or kodak.com showed up. So many different search engines and portals. Lycos, altavista, dogpile, excite. Usenet! So much discussion flying around. Then came aol.com, and Permanent September, and then webtv.  Imminent Doom Projected. Trolls. RFCs, Canter & Siegel, and the birth of spam. It was breathtaking.
