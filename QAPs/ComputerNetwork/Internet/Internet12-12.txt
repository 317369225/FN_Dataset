â˜…What are the real-life equivalents of "Trolling on the Internet" ?
I have a coexist bumper sticker on my car. If you want to attract trolls to you, get one. " So, you don't love Jesus?" "Muslims kill people." "I believe American culture is the best " Geez.. It doesn't say let's hold hands or lets all love each other. Just coexist . Why does it piss so many people off so much?
