★Who are the best internet marketers?
I speak of the internet marketers who have realized that selling information on "how to" internet market turned out to be more lucrative than the results of themselves using their internet marketing skills to sell products and services. Jeff Walker - Product Launch Formula http://productlaunchformula.com/ Mike Koenigs -  Traffic Geyser + cross channel mojo (trumpia) http://trafficgeyser.com/  http://trumpia.com/ Andy Jenkins - Video Boss (great sense of humor) http://www.thevideoboss.com/ Brendon Burchard - The Millionaire Messenger http://millionairemessenger.com/ Eben Pagan (aka David DeAngelo) http://www.ebenpaganguruproductb... Jeff Johnson - Nonstop traffic formula http://www.nonstoptrafficformula... One of their keys to success seems to be cross promoting each other and taking 40-50% affiliate commissions from each other.  It appears that between them they have email lists on the order of 50 million people. I can elaborate more on this topic if anyone is interested.
