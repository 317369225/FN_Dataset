â˜…Will the Internet ever become obsolete?
The short answer is, No. It is something that is evolving and changing to cope the needs as we go and the initial design was clean to allow it to change this way. As Joshua Engel has already pointed out, the Internet works in layers of abstractions, each of them independent (for the most part) from others and can be replaced with something better without disturbing the system. So, I think something that keeps on changing and stays useful (we have come a long way from it being useful to indispensable) will not go extinct, I mean obsolete. But, it may change so much in the coming decades, that we may not be able to say its the same thing at the first glance, but at its very core, it will be.
