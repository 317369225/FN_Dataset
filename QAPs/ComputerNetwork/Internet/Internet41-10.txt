â˜…What are the unwritten rules of the Internet circa 2011?This is incredibly broad, but a lot of this is just not written down or in the law. For instance, an ethos that a robust intellectual property strategy is bad. Or asking for an NDA is a faux pas. Or that data scraping for commercial purposes is not defensible.
Rules: 1. If you can't speak sense, shut up. 2. If you don't have something useful to say, listen.
