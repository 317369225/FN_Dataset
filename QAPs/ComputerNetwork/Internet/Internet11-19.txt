★What is the Internet of Things?
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a scenario in which objects, animals or people are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to automatically transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. In simple words, everything is connected over IP and would interact would each other based on pre-defined logic, e.g. refrigerator can order milk by itself when it is about to get over based on past consumption trends. The keyword is “Things”. Here things includes people and animals which means that in future even the people might be connected to objects like health equipment or household appliances. This might sound straight out of a science fiction movie but that is how human to machine and machine to machine interactions are likely to take place.  IoT describes a system where items in the physical world, and sensors within or attached to these items, are connected to the Internet via wireless and wired Internet connections. These sensors can use various types of local area connections such as RFID, NFC, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee. Sensors can also have wide area connectivity such as GSM, GPRS, 3G, and LTE. In summary, the Internet of Things will: 1. Connect both inanimate and living things 2. Use sensors for data collection 3. Identify, track and communicate with objects over IP network IPv6′s huge increase in address space is an important factor in the development of the Internet of Things. With IPv6, it is possible to assign a unique IP address to each atom on earth and still not run out of IP addresses. You can read the rest of the article at What is Internet of Things?
