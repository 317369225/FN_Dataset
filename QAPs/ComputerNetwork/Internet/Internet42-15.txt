â˜…What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1980s?A follow-up question to What was it like to be on the Internet during the 1990s?
I (from the USA) planned to visit a friend and professional colleague in Italy. Bags packed, airline ticket in hand, I sent a quick message (not called email) to her (blue screen, no windows, Apple not functioning yet), asking where we should meet. She mailed back, named a time in two days and a restaurant in a town I'd never visited. Two days later, I pulled my rental car into the restaurant parking lot on time, and there she was. Seems ordinary today. In 1983 this was a miracle. TransAtlantic telephone calls were horribly expensive and unreliable, and mails took over a week at best. No FedEx. There was literally no way I could have made such precipitous arrangements were I not in a professional field that used the academic internet. At the time, I pitied everybody else who was not "connected."
