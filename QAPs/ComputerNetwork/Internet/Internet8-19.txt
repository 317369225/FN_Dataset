★What was it like to be a programmer without the Internet?When there were no online documentation, no Google, no StackOverflow...
A lot harder to fake. Now you can hear job candidates typing during an interview for answers. You can post on forums and have others solve your problems quickly. There used to be shelves of technical documentation to look things up. You were paired up with a senior person when you started to help answer questions.  Now with development tools and the internet, it is much easier to become a developer. The learning curve is much shorter. Are programmers today better? That is another topic.
