★How do I become a hustler?
Hustle.  NOW! Tell yourself you'll take a break tomorrow.  When the sun rises tomorrow, hustle again.  Defer not-hustling until you are retired. Don't read anything else.  Katt Williams and Rick Ross are good role models: And don't get discouraged while you're a "hustler" for years and are still broke and get no respect.  TLDR:  Just Keep Hustling.
