★What is the best way to learn internet marketing?
I got into internet marketing Nov 2011 and I must say I've learned a lot. I've made a few hundred $ but not nearly the 1,000's I expected.  It is not as easy as most people make it out to be, but I get the impression that if you know what you are doing and don't give up you CAN make money pretty quickly. Some guys make upwards of $50,000 per month. I followed some strategies of respected IMers and saw an immediate turnaround in my results. I'm trying some new techniques right now to increase traffic and sales. My suggestions: Check out Wealthy Affiliate University. It is a community of beginners and advanced IMers who help each other out. I am a member and love it. Another very popular resource is Warrior Forum. This is where most of the heavy hitters are. Most of the info is free there and is VERY helpful. I am also subscribed there and love it. WarriorForum - Internet Marketing Forums Immerse yourself in those two alone and you will be well on your way. Of course the best way to do it...is to just do it. Not sure if it is against TOS to post links, but here is a link to my review on Wealthy Affiliate, too much to type here. Product Review For Wealthy Affiliate University Hope this helps
