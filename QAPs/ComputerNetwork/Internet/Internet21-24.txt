★How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
Honestly, doing the same things we do today without all the technology. Dungeons and dragons played in person instead of on the net. Phone calls, though tethered to the House. Passing notes in school on paper instead of messaging. Reading books without the benefits of kindle. Humans haven't changed much since forever as near as I can tell, the only changes are with technology and speed. I not so sure speed is a good thing.  But I love it!
