â˜…What will the Internet look like in 2020?I'd like as many different descriptions of what the usage, adoption and structure of the Internet will look like in the year 2020 as possible. Be creative, and try to think outside the box how it will change in the next seven years. Let's see what the current early adopters of the Internet come up with (since we're all using Quora...).
The network won't be appreciably faster (ok, maybe more throughput, but latency is already as good as it will get). So anything that is better/faster will be because we are smarter programmers. A big way to combat latency is to already have a copy of what you want on your device already. Remember "web accelerators"? They'll be back with a vengeance. So when you pull out your screen thingy, it'll already have a copy of Hacker News and all the articles it links to and all the articles they link to, that it fetched in the background the night before. New updates will trickle in in real time. It'll be interesting, because the further you get from your habitual browsing patterns, the slower the net will get. As you start using a new site more frequently, your browser will up its fetch priority, so that it will already be on your device too, with updates streamed in in real time. The upshot is that everyone's phones will have a copy of the slice of the internet they care about on it. The good news is that the interoperability required to make this happen will make web-app vendor lock-in a thing of the past. Eg: once you have all of your flickr photos on all your devices, and they are synchronized around in a standard way, if flickr were to shut down, you could just sync them to photobucket instead. (Or directly to your friends, if you prefer.)
