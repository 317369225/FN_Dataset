â˜…Is the Internet spoiling young children?
The answers here cover what I would have said but I would like to add this to the mix. There's something about this Internet age that has separated us from the reality of now. We aren't attached anymore, to life, to each other, to what's going on in the moment and I think it's so very sad. When I see young kids recording life on their i-Devices, rather than enjoying the moment, my heart breaks. The parade of life has gone by, the band has left the stage, the celebrity has gotten in their car and the puppy that wanted to give you a kiss, while you only wanted to record the moment, is now grown up. I've gone to concerts and spent most of the time recording it on my iPhone. I never really watched it, the quality wasn't great, I didn't have a Stead-i-Cam, everything was jerky and I missed the show. I stopped making that mistake. Your question asks about why these kids have the attitude that it's their life and they can do what they want with it. Their life is 3" by 5" or 4" by 6". This makes me want to cry.
