â˜…Is the Internet killing religion?
I believe it will over time. I just saw this image on Facebook yesterday. It shows an alarming and actual fact about the three great Abrahamic Religions, a fact that is extremely problematic if YHWH/The Trinity/Allah actually created the entire 93 billion light year wide observable Universe, but that is entirely consistent with those religion's having been created by superstitious men living in a specific part of the globe in ancient, myth-ridden times.
