I can tell you right now that the vast majority of Americans who attend church on a regular basis are functionally atheists or agnostics who simply attend church services because it's expected, and moreover that things have been this way for at least a hundred years. The difference is simply that shifting public perceptions of atheism have allowed people to be more open about this than in the past.
