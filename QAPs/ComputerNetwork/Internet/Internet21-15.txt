â˜…How did people waste their time in the pre-Internet era?
I remember pre-computer days; if you were traveling, you always brought a deck of cards with you to kill time while waiting for your train, bus, whatever. Also crossword puzzles & other games. At my parents' house where computer time is frowned upon as anti-social, we spend a lot of time on the backyard deck, drinking ice tea, watching the squirrels & birds, talking about life or reading. I think what I miss most being constantly tethered to technology is I hardly spend any time outdoors anymore. And, no, bringing my laptop to the park is not at all the same thing. As far as work breaks go, we smoked or gossiped, walked around the block, ran to the store.
