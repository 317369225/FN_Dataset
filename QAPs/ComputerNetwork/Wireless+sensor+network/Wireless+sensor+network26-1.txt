★Where can I find research journals for wireless sensor networks on the Internet?
This might be remotely relevant. There is few companies that have sophisticated wireless sensor networks, one that came in my mind is Intrix - Microsoft 's daughter company that aggregates data from sensors placed in Toyota, Ford, BMW, and Audi. Similar networks are also common in health industry. One thing that may interest you is new project "Shadon" - this is a search engine for internet of things network (which among else includes sensors, devices connected to the internet, etc.)    Embed Quote
