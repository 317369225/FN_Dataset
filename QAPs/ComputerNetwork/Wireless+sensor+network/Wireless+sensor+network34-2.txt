★What is mobility support for wireless sensor networks? I want to undrestand the concept.
I am not sure if i understand your question correctly but here is an example. suppose you have several nodes deployed randomly in an area. after period of operation, specific nodes starts to deplete their energy. to minimize and balance the energy consumption over the other nodes, mobility support can used by using a mobile sink node that changes it location in the network to create different connections routes for the network to involve other nodes in the network operation. that is one example of mobility support. I hope it helps.    Embed Quote
