★Can we buy wireless sensor network modules rather than building from the scratch? If so what can be the price?I am looking for WSN module of proximity sensors or infrared sensors.
You may try contacting C-DAC Bangalore / Tiruananthpuram. They have developed their own motes. Crossbow motes may be available from Intrinsic at Bangalore.    Embed Quote
