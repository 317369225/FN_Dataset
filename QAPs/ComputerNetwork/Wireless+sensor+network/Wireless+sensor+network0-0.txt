★What is a wireless sensor network?
A Wireless Sensor Network is a collection of multiple sensor nodes which communicate with a gateway or set of gateways to transfer information about their environment. Each node contains a small processor, sensing devices (to measure things like motion, temperature, sounds, etc.) and a wireless radio. Nodes are generally powered by batteries, but stationary nodes may also have a more reliable power source. Nodes have the ability to buffer data from sensors and perform computations using that data. Gateway devices generally have a more reliable power source, greater processing capability and can interact with outside networks.    Embed Quote
