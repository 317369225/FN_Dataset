★What is the difference between wireless sensor networks and wireless adhoc networks?I need  to understand distinct differences between both for my reserach project on MAC protocl
The main difference is in purpose and, hence, in node charachteristics. Sensor networks are intended to collect data, store it and maybe process data. As nodes are data collectors, they are mostly immobil, low powered and often utilizes hierarchical routing on OSI lvl 3. AdHoc networks can be treated as more general concept. They can be mobile (MANETs) or stationary, but nodes are still routers, there is no network center. They can be multimedia, delivering heavy content, or like sensor nets, small pieces of data. They can be intended to any purpose, but till any node is a router and there is no central point managing all connections, theese are AdHoc networks.    Embed Quote
