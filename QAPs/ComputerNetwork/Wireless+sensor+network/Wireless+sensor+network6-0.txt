★Could you compare actual Wireless Sensor Network?
Of course, mustn't forget WiFi, which is probably the most widely used of them all. Most of the protocols you mention are mostly used in commercial settings, are not widely used or are only used by hardcore home automation geeks. Basic problem is that the devices using them aren't very compelling for homes. Just not that much value for most users, too hard to install, too ugly, etc. But watch the up-and-comer, Thread. Like Zigbee or WirelessHART, it's based on 802.15.4, and it actually sits on top of 6LoWPAN, but with Google/Nest and others behind it, there are actual networked devices using it which normal people might get excited about using. It's not a 100% hard and fast rule, but more often than not, applications create protocols, not the other way around.    Embed Quote
