★Which are the most commonly used routing and security protocols in wireless sensor networks?Which one is suited for what kind of environment? Can you please list down the details, and links for learning the same. I am looking at an energy efficient measure, improvement over the existing protocols, but don't have an idea where to start with
For a high reliability network, take a look at Linear's implementation of WirelessHART -- it's an extremely low power mesh network. It's a very pragmatic design based on a centralized optimizer that schedules time and frequency slots to optimize routing. SemTech LoRa and Sigfox have a new take on things -- forget the mesh, just go to very low bitrates and very asymmetric power consumption, expanding the range so much that you need very very few basestations, very little power consumption at the sensor nodes, and no meshing required.    Embed Quote
