★What is the difference between wireless sensor networks and ad hoc?
WSN can be considered a special sub-class of adhoc networks (MANETS are another). Any network with no infrastructure support for networking --- requiring mesh like connectivity, is an Ad-Hoc network For WSN the specialization arises in the purpose: this is captured in the description "sensor" networks. So WSN are meant to be adhoc networks of sensors collecting sensory information for applications that need notification and possibly an appropriate response (with the response these become the more broader field of cyberphysical system). hth    Embed Quote
