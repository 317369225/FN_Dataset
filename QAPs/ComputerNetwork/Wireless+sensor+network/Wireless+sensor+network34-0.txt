★What is mobility support for wireless sensor networks? I want to undrestand the concept.
You may be referring to wireless sensor networks, where most sensors are not deployed at fixed locations, but are rather mobile. Such an example is ZebraNet [1], which was aimed at wildlife monitoring. In scenarios like this, you may have multi-hop communications and you would want the measurements gathered by the sensors to be routed efficiently to one/multiple sinks. Though as the network topology changes due to sensors moving in and out of direct communication range of one another, routing will break if their location identifier change as a result of its mobility. This is less problematic for mobile networks where devices have superior computational capabilities and less strict battery constraints, e.g. cellular or WiFi networks. Mobility management is however cumbersome for wireless sensors, given their very constrained capabilities. Since the IPv6 protocol [2] brings a set of capabilities on top of addressing, that provide support for mobility (neighbour discovery, mobility and routing extension headers [3], security) researchers have made efforts to enable its use also on low power devices. The result is a family of RFC standards grouped under the 6LoWPAN umbrella [4]. Their focus is on optimised network discovery and header compression (IPv6 has a header length of at least 40 Bytes if uncompressed), among others. These mechanisms specically address the challenges inherent in severely limited devices such as sensors. [1] T. Liu et al.
