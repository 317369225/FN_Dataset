★Are there any true examples of customers insisting on having IPv6 for their in-building wireless sensor networks?if so, what is the actual application of IPv6 or is it just a "check box" for the future?  Mostly this seems like a marketing gimmick pushed by Cisco and accepted by the government as a result.  I am skeptical that customers really care about IPv6 for small wireless devices.
There's plenty of places other than Cisco (Silver Spring, Electric Imp, etc) that have IPv6 IoT networks. It's a matter of end-to-end addressability without address translating gateways.    Embed Quote
