★What is the state of the art hardware and operating system to build a wireless sensor network?If more than one hardware and operating systems are currently used for development, when and why favour one over another?
The answer is coupled. So while theoretically you can build an OS and port it to any embedded system, a lay user can choose to use only those OS that have ports to a specific embedded system. This becomes more complicated as different version of the same MCU architecture can have different set of peripherals making the OS ''platform'' dependent. For WSN from a research perspective you have tinyOS (TinyOS Home Page) as the front runner, but a close second is Contiki (The Open Source Operating System for the Internet of Things) that has found greater traction in the industry due to its quite robust IP stack. You will find a list of supported platforms (hardware on their website). For commercial purchase of equipment, libelium is a great company (Libelium - Wireless Sensor Networks - ZigBee - Smart Cities). Other end-to-end solution companies are Linear Tech(Wireless Sensor Networks - Linear Technology), Ember (Ember ZigBee Wireless Networking Systems) and Millenial (http://www.millennialnet.com/) HTH.    Embed Quote
