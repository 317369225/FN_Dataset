★Are there any true examples of customers insisting on having IPv6 for their in-building wireless sensor networks?if so, what is the actual application of IPv6 or is it just a "check box" for the future?  Mostly this seems like a marketing gimmick pushed by Cisco and accepted by the government as a result.  I am skeptical that customers really care about IPv6 for small wireless devices.
I don't know about examples, but my view on the matter is, that when everything moves away from IPv4, why would we leave anything on it? It just means that we'd have to run legacy IP protocol for no real reason. And we all should and must require IPv6 support on all products and solutions.    Embed Quote
