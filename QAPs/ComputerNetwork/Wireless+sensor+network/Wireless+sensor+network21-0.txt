★How is the cluster formed in wireless sensor networks?
there are many papers based on cluster based routing protocols ,u can read those ,all i remember is dat the process can be initiated by any node making it to send beacon signals to initiate the process,and receive the signals of identification from nearby nodes making a cluster.Provided the range many clusters can be made,each equipped with their own cluster head for data collection.all the data collected by nodes within a cluster is relayed to the cluster head which in turn relays it to the sink,where u get all da data.srry for being inadequate in da coding part :/    Embed Quote
