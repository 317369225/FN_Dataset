★How hard is making an energy efficient routing protocol for wireless sensor networks?Hierarchical Clustering
It's so easy that everyone is doing it!! Seriously, though: This is an active research area. The nature of the underlying network and the objectives of the data routing may cause you to have different answers for this question. The IETF ROLL group (Routing over Low-Power and Lossy Networks) is actively dedicated to this question (See: Roll Status Pages).  I'm fond of the RPL protocol (RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) which uses a concept called "objective routing" to direct traffic based not only on the optimal-distance path but also on other objectives like power consumption or processing capacity.  Rather than invent a new protocol, chances are you can use the RPL framework to achieve your packet forwarding objectives in the most energy efficient way.    Embed Quote
