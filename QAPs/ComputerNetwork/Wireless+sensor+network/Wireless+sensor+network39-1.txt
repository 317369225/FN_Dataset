★Which are the most commonly used routing and security protocols in wireless sensor networks?Which one is suited for what kind of environment? Can you please list down the details, and links for learning the same. I am looking at an energy efficient measure, improvement over the existing protocols, but don't have an idea where to start with
Look at ctp aka collection tree protocol. This is for sink based data collection. Another (not supported) idea is for directed diffusion. For purely mesh routing there is no clear winner but most real deployment and standards have a second hierarchy of routing nodes that are ip connected for routing e.g zig bee or wirelesshart. 6 low pan is another option. Look at RPL implementations for tinyos or contiki.    Embed Quote
