★What is wireless sensor network (WSN) technology?
-->WSN is spatially distributed, collection of sensor nodes for the purpose of monitoring physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, pressure, etc. and to cooperatively pass their data through the network to a main location. -->it consists of transducers(Device that converts one form of energy into another form of energy.),microcomputer,transceiver and power source. The transducer generates electrical signals based on sensed physical effects and phenomena. The microcomputer processes and stores the sensor output. The transceiver receives commands from a central computer and transmits data to that computer. The power for each sensor node is derived from a battery. -->Potential applications of sensor networks include: Industrial automation Automated and smart homes Video surveillance Traffic monitoring Medical device monitoring Monitoring of weather conditions Air traffic control Robot control.    Embed Quote
