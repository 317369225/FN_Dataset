★Why are the wireless sensor network standards (Zigbee, Zwave) mostly based on 802.15.04? What characteristics of 802.15.04 make it a favorite for wireless sensors?
The goals of IEEE 802.15.4 include low power, low speed, and low cost.  802.15.4 can also run in a mesh configuration, so that you don't have to have all of your sensors directly connected to the central controller. It turns out that's the same design constraints that led to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is a different approach to the same end. I'd seriously look at BLE whenever 802.15.4 was mentioned and figure out which of the two was most suited for the task. Doug Comer has an article in the Internet Protocol Journal Page on dreamhosters.com entitled "The ZigBee IP Protocol Stack", in which he looks closely at one of the ways that people have built IP over 802.15.4. He concludes that 802.15.4 is a bad match for IPv6 networks, for a variety of reasons. In practice, IPv6 and standard IPv6 support protocols are insufficient for a low-power, lossy wireless mesh technology that has a small MTU and a low data rate. Consequently, work has focused on replacing many parts of IPv6, adding a shim layer to accommodate small MTU, inventing a new protocol that tests signal strength and establishes links, and building a new routing protocol that constructs a forwarding tree. Even with the changes, the design of IPv6 does not match IEEE 802.15.4 radio technology well.    Embed Quote
