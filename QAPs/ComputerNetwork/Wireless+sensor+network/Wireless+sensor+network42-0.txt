★What are the most popular LEACH routing protocols for wireless sensor networks?
Spin is a family of protocols used to efficiently disseminate information in a wireless sensor network. Conventional data dissemination approaches like flooding and gossiping waste valuable communication and energy resources sending redundant information throughout the network. In addition, these protocols are not resource-aware or resource-adaptive. SPIN solves these shortcomings of conventional approaches using data negotiation and resource-adaptive algorithms. Nodes running SPIN assign a high-level name to their data, called meta-data, and perform meta-data negotiations before any data is transmitted. This assures that these is no redundant data sent throughout the network. In addition, SPIN has access to the current energy level of the node and adapts the protocol it is running based on how much energy is remaining. Simulation results show that SPIN is more energy-efficient than flooding or gossiping while distributing data at the same rate or faster than either of these protocols.    Embed Quote
