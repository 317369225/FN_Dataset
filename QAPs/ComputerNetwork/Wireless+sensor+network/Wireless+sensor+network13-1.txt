★What is the state of the art hardware and operating system to build a wireless sensor network?If more than one hardware and operating systems are currently used for development, when and why favour one over another?
One piece of hardware that I find state of the art to mew age WSNs is a Software Defined Radio. Essentially in traditional WSNs we fetch data from a sensor and use a seperate RF protocol/stack for the transmission/reception purposes. SDRs allow us to:- 1. Integrate data absorption and transmission into one system (this has otherwise been done as well for simpler protocols like Zigbee) 2. Make the same WSN subject to multiple RF protocols and hence multiple sensor networks (now this is pretty amazing as it gives you a flexible WSN node essentially)    Embed Quote
