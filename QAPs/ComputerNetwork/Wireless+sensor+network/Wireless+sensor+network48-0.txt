★What kind of algorithms/protocol designs are applicable to Underwater Wireless Sensor Network communication?
You really need to ask a slightly more precise question. The basic issue, as my dissertation tried painstakingly clear, is that underwater networks generally --- for various reasons --- stick with acoustic communication that is more than 5 orders of magnitude slower than speed of light (i.e. RF comms). Thus any algorithm and protocol that relies on an assumption of nearly instantaneous communication, or which can tolerate the delay incurred by RF comms between two points, perhaps in nano seconds, suddenly has to deal with milli-sec or greater delays. These algorithms and protocols have to be fundamentally rethought.
