★Which do you think are the most exciting fields of wireless sensor networks from a research perspective,  and why?Please give me details if you are familiar with the topic.
As a shameless plug, I would vote for the area of delivering wireless power to wireless sensor networks. Or, as I like to call in my IPSN paper, a power grid for WSN [1]. This is exciting as it motivates the need to focus on power delivery so that the WSN applications (IoT, BodySensor networks, UWSN, Building Sensor networks, XYZ sensor networks) can become independent of the energy constraints that prevents --- in my mind --- from them being realizable. However, the practicality concerns are quite huge! [1] LAMP: Building a "wireless" power grid for WSN/IoTs    Embed Quote
