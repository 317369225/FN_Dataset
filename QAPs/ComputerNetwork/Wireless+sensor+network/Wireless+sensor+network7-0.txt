★Where can i find public datasets about wireless sensor networks?So far i found these: Sensorscope: Sensor Networks for Environmental Monitoring Labelled Wireless Sensor Network Data Repository (LWSNDR) Intel Lab Data
The University of Washington department of Computer Science and Engineering has several projects requiring collaboration between researchers in databases, machine learning, ubiquitous computing, and more. Their Lahar project [1] is an effort to determine location and trajectory information from a noisy and uncertain collection of RFID signals. You can download their data from the link [2] below.
