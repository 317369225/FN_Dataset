â˜…What is the best solution for a multi-use USB data cable for developers who want to develop on multiple devices with one cable or at least less cabling?
Be careful. USB "squid cables" exist, but these are (mostly? always?) power-only (because if the data wires were all connected, and multiple USB devices were plugged in at once, there would be no way to send a message to a specific device).
