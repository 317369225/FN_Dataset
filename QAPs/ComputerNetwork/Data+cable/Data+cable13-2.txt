★How do I unlock a pattern lock using developer tools without any data cable or a PC and without losing data?
There is no real way i afraid!!   However, There are two straight forward ways to unlock a pattern lock if you forget it 1.Using your gmail id, that everyone know! 2.Wiping your data in recovery mode.   I know its not the answer that you want, but still it might help some one else!
