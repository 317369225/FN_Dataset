★Why do ordinary data cables (USB, HDMI, etc.) fail?In a normal household or office environment, they seem like things that should never fail. What makes them stop working?
Bending them without realizing it while you do other things can cause stresses on the cables, which causes mechanical wear on the conductors. Oxidation and chemical changes.  Changes caused by oxidation can impact the resistance of the connection which may cause the circuit to operate slightly differently - less important for digital signals, but still an issue if the signal is missing a bit or two entirely. Changes in the plastics (dielectrics) change the transfer characteristics of the cable.  Believe it or not the speed of the signal propagation is entirely dependent on the characteristics of the insulation around the wire.  If the dielectric constant changes this can alter the cable so much that the placement of nodes and antinodes on the cable change.  (eg. coaxial Arcnet cables!  Ever had the joy of figuring out why an office full of people "all of a sudden" can't access file shares on a coax-based network?)  Degradation of the plastics, shrinkage over time, or chemical reaction with the conductors can cause the cable to fail.
