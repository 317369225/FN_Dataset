â˜…What consumes more energy: charging a phone directly from a power point or charging it from a laptop using a data cable?
The primary source of power in both case is the AC supply in your house. Charging from charger involves only one simple electronic circuit. So loss is small because of simplicity of circuit. Whereas while charging from laptop, the AC electricity has to go through the complex architecture of a laptop to the usb charging point. Hence, IMO the losses will be more. So a charger is more efficient. A better and more conclusive way to prove the hypothesis will be to calculate the actual energy spent. A general charger draws a current of order ~.15 A. So charging the phone for one hour will consume 220 x .15 x 1 = 33w. Emulate the same thing by charging the phone from your laptop while the laptop is not plugged in. Observe the drop in charge against the time of 1 hr with same settings. Lets say there is a difference of 10% in battery charge remaining. Now calculate the power consumed by laptop charger in charging the laptop by 10%. Compare it with 33w, and you will have your answer P.S. may be the charging of phone by charger will be faster as against charging by laptop. In that case, instead of using 1 Hour, you may use 50% charge as basis.
