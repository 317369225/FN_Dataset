A day on the planet Venus is longer than a year on Venus.  It takes 243 Earth days (5832 hours) for Venus to make one full rotation on its axis, but it only takes 224.7 Earth days (5392.8 hours) for Venus to make a full revolution around the sun. When I was in middle school, I tried to explain this to my classmates, and my teacher, and they literally refused to believe it. Why is a Venus day longer than a Venus year? - Curiosity
