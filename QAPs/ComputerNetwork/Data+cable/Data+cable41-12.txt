★Why does Microsoft Surface have USB ports?Does adding a USB port give Surface an edge over the other tablets?
Well said Dan Zhang. You hit the nail on the head. Why wouldn't you want USB? The question should be: How can Apple convince so many people to buy devices that are effectively crippled as far as universal connectivity is concerned? I have so many USB devices I personally can't live without it and at the moment I would never consider any device without a USB port ... or any device that required me to purchase an intentionally crippled expensive adapter to get limited USB functionality. Don't get me wrong, I'm not totally anti Apple (I'm writing his on a Mac Pro ... with USB) but as with most of Apple's usage of proprietary interfaces, their omission of USB is purely to drive the flock into reliance on their eco-system ... where as Dave Haynie so rightly says they can charge their Apple Tax on everything you connect to your device by charging a hefty license fee to manufacturers for the "privilege" of offering iDevice connectivity. Sure cloud centric (from any provider) is a really great feature. But it's only designed for syncing between devices and for that very reason it's certainly not a backup option.  Oh look I accidentally deleted that folder ... from everywhere!! Nothing replaces a few TB of trusty USB External HDD that can easily be purchased at a one time cost lower than the annual price of a 50GB iCloud plan. Sure iPad touch screens are nice but they don't even come close to providing the usability or functionality of a dedicated Wacom tablet when it comes to art work. How many printer manufacturers would pay the license fee for offering AirPrint support if you could simply connect a USB printer to your iDevice.
