â˜…What makes a cinema camera better or more useful than a high quality DSLR?
I am assuming you're asking what makes a cinema camera "better" and "more useful" at shooting video than a high quality DSLR can.Besides the technical aspects that many people have mentioned, here is a fact to consider: Cinema cameras are made to shoot video. High quality DSLRs are optimized for still photographs and happen to also have a video setting. With digital compression and the convenience of small screens people rarely pay attention to the finer differences in visual quality. Therefore, it's easier to get away with just using a DSLR (which is primarily for still photographs) to make videos. If you want to be a filmmaker more than a photographer, I would advise getting a cinema camera. You can always take screenshots of your content and post them as photographs. However, if you want a convenient way of shooting photo and video and don't care about projecting your content on large screens, buy a DSLR.
