â˜…What are some unusual features that would be great to add to a new home under construction?
As the asker of this question appears to live in Austin, TX, the first thing that pops to mind for structual features is heat sinks. I'm not an expert on the topic, but if I were you I'd be looking at ways to reduce my home cooling bill. There are structural features that you can build into the house that will allow it to absorb heat way more efficiently.
