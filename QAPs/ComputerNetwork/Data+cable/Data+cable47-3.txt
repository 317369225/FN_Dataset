â˜…Is there any technology to share the mobile battery just like sharing the mobile data by creating a hotspot?
This technology will available in future. But not now. Though now a days we can use wireless charger to charge our phone. i.e. Nokia Lumia phones have this facility. But it is not for all devices. I watched a show on discovery when I was at 14. It was about wireless electricity which was invented in earlier 19's. I don't know why it wasn't not successful technology. But it was possible to transform electricity wireless. So In future it will common feature of every mobile to transform battery from one to another. There is no doubt about it.
