★How can I send my installed apps to my friend via Wi-Fi? My phone is Android.
I  do it by File Expert, a file management app for Android devices. Enter My Files Tab-Apps-Select the application you want to send and choose send by Wifi. Easy to operate. You can get it from Google Play: File Expert with Clouds I hope it helps.
