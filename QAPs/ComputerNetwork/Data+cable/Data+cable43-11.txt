★What purpose does the small cylindrical module near the end of my laptop charger cable serve?
It is a ferrite bead, used to suppress high frequency electromagnetic noise from your charger from reaching the AC mains. The power adapters for laptops and phone chargers use a switched mode power supply, which converts 110/230V AC to a smaller 5-20V DC. To do this efficiently,  the 110/230V AC is converted to 150/320 V DC, and the large DC voltage is switched on and off at a high frequency, and the output averaged to the required smaller DC voltage. This switching can inject a high frequency noise to go into the AC mains, which can cause other appliances connectedt to the mains to malfunction. The ferrite bead, which is a choke attenuates the high frequency noise that reaches the AC mains. Each device has to satisfy certain noise emission criteria for them to be approved for use. The beads ensure that the device can pass the emission tests.
