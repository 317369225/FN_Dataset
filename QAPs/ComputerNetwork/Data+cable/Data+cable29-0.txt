â˜…What is a recommended book about the nature of data in cables?
There are dozens of different ways data can be transmitted over cables, and each method has its own literature. Your PCs at home are probably connected with Ethernet to each other through a router. Your computer and its devices like printers and keyboards connect over USB. Those are both low-level protocols that define the physical properties of the transmission, like actual voltages on the wire and such. Typically the bits on the wire are further arranged by a higher-level software protocol like TCP/IP (Internet protocol). Yet another protocol is used for for sending data over the coaxial cable that your cable company runs to your house. Between ISPs they probably run yet another protocol over fiber optics.
