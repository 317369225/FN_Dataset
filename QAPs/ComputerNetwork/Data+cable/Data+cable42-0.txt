â˜…How do I transfer my files from Android to laptop?
Android connects to your computer via ADB. ADB understands USB cables and also socket connections. When the connection is made to a device, I use vanilla Android File Transfer on OS X to grab files [1]. The standard Windows file explorer should also work. From the shell I use adb push/pull. I use a standard USB cable usually. I use Wifi ADB on my rooted development devices (when the router allows peer connections, as in my office, but not most public or coworking spaces) so I don't have to have a bunch of cables around [2]. Hope that helps. If you're trying to get something out of an app, look for an export or share option in the app and save it into Dropbox or similar. The app may support a clean export to a single archive or file so you don't have to cobble the files together yourself. 1. https://www.android.com/filetran... 2. https://play.google.com/store/ap...
