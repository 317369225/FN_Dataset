â˜…Is there a way to transfer five-minute short films from my Nokia phone to the PC without a data cable slot?I have a Nokia phone that doesn't have a data cable slot. I have made 5-minute short films on my phone that I can't transfer to the PC. Is there a way out?
What model would that be? Does it have bluetooth? Wifi? Removable SD card?
