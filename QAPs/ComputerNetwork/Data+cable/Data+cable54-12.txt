★Mobile Applications: What's the most innovative app?(NB: mostly for Android here)
Google Sky Map - a knockout app for anyone with an interest/passing-interest in backyard astronomy. If you like watching stars,then why just stare at them without knowing their name?? Google Sky Map Android App offers a real-time clear view of constellations for Android phones. The app uses your phone’s GPS, compass and accelerometer to get accurate stellar information so you can turn the device in any direction or lock in a position and scroll through. Google Sky Map features layers: Stars, Constellations, Messier Objects, Planets, Grid Lines and Horizon; which can be toggled on/off. You can toggle viewing modes for day/night as well. The really cool feature is the Search functionality; the results’ finder leads you to the object you were looking for. It is helpful for finding constellations first then probing the sky. Of course those interested in astrology would dig the app. pic- this is how the interface looks like. Its a must for night sky photography, star trail photography and milky way photography(for non-pro). Thats how I came to know about this app. It's your bedroom window on the night sky.
