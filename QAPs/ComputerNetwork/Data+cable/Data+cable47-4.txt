â˜…Is there any technology to share the mobile battery just like sharing the mobile data by creating a hotspot?
If you know about the induction process? The technology does exist, it is same technology charging the phone wirelessly. But there is big amount of energy loss in the processor from the source. At present>> Wireless charger >> charging phone (by induction) Future>> phone would act as charger (would have induction module)>>will give charge to the phone in contact. It would be just like, working with NFC. But I heard a news that, scientists have developed wireless transfer of electricity and recorded the maximum distance of 55 m, which is an innovation itself. And future, it would be applied to all gadgets.
