â˜…Mobile Applications: What's the most innovative app?(NB: mostly for Android here)
I like Wallaby. It is my favorite app. I can get the most rewards for my credit cards. Isn't that the reason we've multiple credit cards? When you pull the app at a certain location it tells you what card to use. Isn't that cool? App does the work for you.
