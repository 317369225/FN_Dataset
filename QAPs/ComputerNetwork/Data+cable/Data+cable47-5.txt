â˜…Is there any technology to share the mobile battery just like sharing the mobile data by creating a hotspot?
As mentioned by Amit, you need a OTG cable and a usb cable to charge one phone from another. Taking this concept to another level is the battery sharing cable - http://qrioh.com/shop/battery-sh... This nifty little device marries a OTG cable and micro usb port into a portable easy to use device. You can charge one phone from another just by plugging in compatible phones at both the ends. Charging can only be provided by a OTG compatible handset where as any android phone / Apple iPhone can receive the charge. You can charge an iPhone by using the bundled micro usb to lightning connector. An iPhone can only take a charge but cannot provide charging to other devices. This device solves the major problem of carrying two cables everywhere you go. Battery sharing cable can also be used as a keychain and is portable enough for your wallet or bag. Please take a moment to watch the video on how this device looks and works in real time - PS: I am the founder of qrioh.com so in case you have any questions or need any discounts, please let me know.
