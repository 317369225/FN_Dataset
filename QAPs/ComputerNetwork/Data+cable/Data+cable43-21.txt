★What purpose does the small cylindrical module near the end of my laptop charger cable serve?
It is a ferrite core. According to slate: What Is That Little Cylinder on My Computer Wire? It is for reducing noise... The most common use of ferrite cores, according to Dwayne Campbell, Senior Director of Regulator and Product Development for Radio Shack, “is to suppress noise emanating from the product through cords or cables.” So the ferrite core is typically working to reduce interference from a cable—often to comply with regulatory requirements that specify how much interference a device is permitted to emit. ...and electrical interference Ferrite cores can also be deployed to reduce electrical interference to a cable, especially if it’s carrying data. The household blender, and the otherwise innocuous electric can opener, are particularly virulent sources of such interference, according to John Drengenberg, Consumer Safety Director for UL (Underwriters Laboratories), the company that develops safety standards, tests products, and provides manufacturers with the UL safety mark to place on products that pass. A ferrite core on data cables can “enhance the quality of your data stream,” says Drengenberg. I had heard about the interference issue before but this was the first time read about the noise issue.
