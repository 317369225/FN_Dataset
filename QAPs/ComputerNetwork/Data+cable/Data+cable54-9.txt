★Mobile Applications: What's the most innovative app?(NB: mostly for Android here)
I'm big time into apps, for both Android and iOS. Here is what I have for you. Telegram (free) - This is an app by a Russian developer, specifically designed to protect your privacy. It is exceptionally good for messaging with web versions which works for all devices (whatsapp doesn't have web version for iOS). Flipboard (free) - This app has been there for a long time but worth mentioning. It is basically a news reading app, but you can follow things that interests you, and the contents are presented in a seamless interface. Looks amazing on iPad! Letterspace (free, ios only) - It's a note-taking app which you will fall in love with. Currently available only for iOS. It has a very intuitive interface. Pushbullet (free) - This app truly integrates all your devices and some pretty cool features, you can accept or decline a call from your browser, reply to messages - text, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram etc.. etc . One drawback I noticed in this app is you can see iPhone notifications only on your mac, if you have the pushbullet app installed. For Android guys, it's fun! vocabulary.com (paid) - If you're looking to improve your vocab, look nowhere. This is such a cool, cloud based vocabulary app, you'll find it worth every penny you spent. Calm (free) - Looking to get to some place else, with some soothing tunes and interesting stories amid your hectic schedule, this is it! Splitwise (free) -  There hasn't been a more productive and useful app to me than this one. Immaculate design and smooth operations! This app can be used to split bills with other people, e.g. you went on a trip with friends, or have a flatmate. In US, it supports settlement of payments as well. Goodluck with the apps! Hope you'll enjoy!
