★Mobile Applications: What's the most innovative app?(NB: mostly for Android here)
An app was launched recently which can solve Math problems! Not only that this app also gives a step by step solution of the problems. The app is PhotoMath launched by MicroBlink.   PhotoMath promises to help solve simple linear equations and other math problems by “reading” questions with the help of your smartphone camera. Although this app is still at a nascent stage. All you need to do is point your phone's camera at the problem, the app will scan it and try to solve it. I have tried it a few times and it works good for high school maths. (Oh! I wish I had got it earlier) PhotoMath - on Vimeo The Android version is due for Early 2015 and the Windows and iOS version are already out.
