★What are some unusual features that would be great to add to a new home under construction?
Some of my friends have incorporated features that I thought worked well: If you have chandeliers, particularly on a high ceiling, you can install an electric winch so that they can be lowered to floor level for cleaning.

Others have mentioned a central vacuum. In the kitchen, you can install a vacuum intake at floor level so you can sweep with a broom into the intake and the vacuum system will take it from there. This is much easier than getting your vacuum cleaner out of the closet for areas that frequently need sweeping. Think of a dustpan shaped vacuum intake.

I have a Jacuzzi that I rarely use, because to fill it takes more than the capacity of my water heater, so by the time it is full, I have cool water in it. There are tankless gas water heaters that heat the water on demand as they flow through your pipes, rather than the conventional water heaters that heat water and store it in an insulated vessel for use later. These tankless gas water heaters are much more energy efficient, and they make the edge cases like filling a Jacuzzi easy. They are easy to install in a new house, but difficult to retrofit.  They also make electrical models of these water heaters, but then you don't get the energy saving benefits.
