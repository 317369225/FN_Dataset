★What are the names of the two cables I need to connect another HDD to my computer?
You mean the data connection, and the power connection?  The power connection isn't a "cable" as much as it is a connector. The red one is a SATA data cable, the gray one is an IDE or PATA data cable. What kind of computer?  Laptop?  Desktop?  What kind of hard drive?  SATA?  IDE? If we are talking about a relatively modern desktop, you'd need a SATA data cable, to connect your SATA hard drive, to one of the SATA ports on your motherboard.  You'd then take one of the existing SATA power connectors coming out of your power supply, and connect it to the hard drive. If your desktop didn't have any available SATA power connectors, you'd need a splitter. Otherwise, to just tell you what to purchase, we would need specific details about your situation and hardware.
