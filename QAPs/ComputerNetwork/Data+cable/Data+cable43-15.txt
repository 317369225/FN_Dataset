â˜…What purpose does the small cylindrical module near the end of my laptop charger cable serve?
"These 'bumps' are called ferrite beads or sometimes ferrite chokes. Their goal in life is to reduce EMI (electromagnetic interference) and RFI (radio-frequency interference)." "The charging cable act as nice, long antennae for the signals they carry. They broadcast the signals quite efficiently. The signals they broadcast can interfere with radios and TVs. The cables can also receive signals and transmit them into the case, where they cause problems. A Essentially, the ferrite bead has the property of Essentially, it "chokes" the RFI transmission at that point on the cable -- this is why you find the beads at the ends of the cables. Instead of traveling down the cable and transmitting, the RFI signals turn into heat in the bead." Read more here : What are the bumps at the end of computer cables? - HowStuffWorks
