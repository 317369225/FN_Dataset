★What purpose does the small cylindrical module near the end of my laptop charger cable serve?
These bumps found in a charger cable, the mouse, keyboard and monitor cables are called 'ferrite beads' or 'ferrite chokes'  used to reduce the ElectroMagnetic Interference(EMI) and Radio Frequency Interference(RFI) produced by the cable. A ferrite bead is simply a hollow bead or cylinder made of ferrite, which is a semi-magnetic substance made from iron oxide (rust) alloyed with other metals. It slips over the cable when the cable is made, or it can be snapped around the cable in two pieces after the cable is made. The bead is encased in plastic -- if you cut the plastic, all that you would find inside is a black metal cylinder. Now, when current passes through the conductors (inside the power cords), it produces EMF (Electromotive Force) or Radio Energy. The power cords and cable transfer this energy outside in the form of noise, which disturb and interfere with other electronics devices such as nearby radio sound would be noisy with improper tuning of channel. In addition, some electrical energy is wasted in the form of radiation, which also reduces the supply power to the battery or other connected devices, which leads to increase the charging time of battery. Ferrite Bead has the ability to stop and block the emission of radio waves form the power cords and uses electrical energy for charging purpose only without power losses. Due to this important factor, there is a tiny cylinder in your laptop or mobile charger cords.
