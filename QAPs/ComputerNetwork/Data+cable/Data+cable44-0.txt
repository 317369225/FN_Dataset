â˜…How can I send my installed apps to my friend via Wi-Fi? My phone is Android.
There are some ways to send an installed app using an Android phone. Sending an installed app will not be called an "installed app" but an .apk file. You should convert an installed Android app into an .apk file for you to be able to send it. I admit that I haven't tried sending it through WiFi but only through bluetooth. But once you convert an Android app into an .apk file you can have so many ways to send it not only through WiFi but through the use of Internet. One of the most easiest ways is by attaching it to an e-mail. :) Here is the link of the Apk Extractor on Google Play
