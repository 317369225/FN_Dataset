â˜…Mobile Applications: What's the most innovative app?(NB: mostly for Android here)
Suck at waking up? Are you the type of person to set multiple alarms a few minutes apart from each other just to make sure you wake up on time? If so, say hello to your new alarm clock. "SpinMe Alarm Clock " is a super clever app designed to get you out of bed on time. The only way to turn off the alarm is by getting out of bed and physically spinning yourself around until the alarm stops! There is no escape! Think you can cheat and simply spin the device while still in bed? Try and see for yourself! If SpinMe doesn't wake you up, then don't know what will. http://spinmealarm.com/download
