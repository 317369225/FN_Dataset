â˜…What makes a cinema camera better or more useful than a high quality DSLR?
It's made to shoot video so all the controls are there for you. Something that I didn't consider with my Nikon D800 purchase. I can shoot video, but smooth zooms are out. The auto focus does work in video mode, but it does have some finding focus issues. You're also limited to 19 minutes per take.
