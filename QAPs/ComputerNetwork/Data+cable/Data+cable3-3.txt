â˜…Why do ordinary data cables (USB, HDMI, etc.) fail?In a normal household or office environment, they seem like things that should never fail. What makes them stop working?
They can get bent, the connections can wear out(they have to be pressed against each other yet be able to slide in and out so they can't be welded), winding up the cable can weaken connections, and the part on the laptop can be damaged from force applied in one direction over a period of time. Also, there's practically nothing that should "never fail". Things wear out over time due to mechanical wear and tear, corrosion, etc. It's all a matter of time scales.
