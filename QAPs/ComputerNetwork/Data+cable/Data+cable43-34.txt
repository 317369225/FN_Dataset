★What purpose does the small cylindrical module near the end of my laptop charger cable serve?
That tiny cylinder is a ferrite bead, covered with plastic. The function of it is to reduce Electromagnetic Interference and radio frequency interference. Ferrite is a semi-magnetic substance made from iron oxide (rust) alloyed with other metals. Each device contains an oscillator working at some frequency, also the charger of the laptop generates some frequency which can get transmitted through the cable and interfere with working of laptop.    A ferrite bead has the property of eliminating the broadcast signals. Essentially, it "chokes" the RFI transmission at that point on the cable -- this is why you find the beads at the ends of the cables. Instead of traveling down the cable and transmitting, the RFI signals turn into heat in the bead.
