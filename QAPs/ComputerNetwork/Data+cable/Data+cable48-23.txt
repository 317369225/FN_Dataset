★What are some unusual features that would be great to add to a new home under construction?
Although you don't mention plans to have dogs, I got this forwarded in email today. (Can put you in touch with author on request.) when i worked with an architect several years back, i specified tall front windows with sills that are 5" above the floor. this allows our dogs and cats to see the outside easily,  without having to climb up on furniture---which they still do. :-) there is a japanese architectural firm that specialises in pet friendly homes. some of the features include " proper ventilation to eliminate hair shed, odor absorbent materials, dog-level peepholes in garden walls, pet-door installations in every room, outdoor courtyards, scratch resistant flooring, and a separate dog shower and toilet area." here is one of their articles with some good ideas: http://www.inman.com/2012/01/06/... houzz.com is always a source of ideas and inspiration: http://www.houzz.com/photos/dall... http://www.houzz.com/ideabooks/1... here is another article with some cool ideas: http://www.crookedbrains.net/200...
