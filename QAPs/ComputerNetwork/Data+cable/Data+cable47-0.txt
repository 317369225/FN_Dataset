★Is there any technology to share the mobile battery just like sharing the mobile data by creating a hotspot?
This is a great question and at the heart of Microsoft strategy in Africa following a recent market research project that estimated 75% of the cost of rural mobile telecommunications is spent on power. Likewise, a recent taxi ride to an African airport where neither driver or myself had a charging cable and both of our phones were flat, we stopped at a make shift service station whereas a local guy with a car battery, rigged up to a bike turbo trainer was offering a mobile charging station. So Microsoft (Nokia/Lumia) have invested in a company who will be bringing a $7 cost mini-solar panel mobile charger to market in 2015.  This unit will create a charging unit which can also charge other people's phones as well as the owners, effectively creating mini-power traders. So watch this space for the $7 solar panel phone charger as there is a direct correlation between emerging markets mobile power challenges and the surplus of free sunshine!
