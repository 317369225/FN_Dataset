â˜…How can I send my installed apps to my friend via Wi-Fi? My phone is Android.
I am going to tell how I do it. First of all, I will suggest two apps that any android phone must have : ES File Explorer Superbeam (for those who don't have wifi direct) Steps: ES File Explorer has got so many options that you can do literally anything with a file present in your SD card/internal storage (Just like a PC). Superbeam uses wifi to transfer files, but make sure the other person also has it. (you can use the steps 2 and 3 with bluetooth to send the app or even you can ask your friend to download the app itself :) ) Slide in from the left of ES file explorer, and choose App Manager. Long press any of the app and select it (and more if needed). Then some options appear at the bottom. Select Share and then select Superbeam to send that file. VOILA. All done :) Enjoy sharing :D
