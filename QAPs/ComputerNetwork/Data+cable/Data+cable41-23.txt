â˜…Why does Microsoft Surface have USB ports?Does adding a USB port give Surface an edge over the other tablets?
This because usb also known as universal serial bus is higly useful and serves a wide variety of purposes from connecting exteral mouses, keyboard, a gaming pad, storage as well as serving as a charging port for other devices. Unless and until you are fanboy and like "lightning"fast connectors too much(all which merely cause you to buy new peripherals incompatible with all other devices except idevices) usb may be your best way to go.
