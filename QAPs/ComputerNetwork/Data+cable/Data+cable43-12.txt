â˜…What purpose does the small cylindrical module near the end of my laptop charger cable serve?
This 'tiny cylinder' is theoretically called ferrite beads. What if it wasn't there? When charging, due to the electric current in the cable, it creates radio energy within itself, which it emits in the form of waves outside the cable. Due to this, electric power is wasted and hinders charging the device(The signals would also interfere with other electronic devices, resulting in what we call as Noise). What now? Ferrite bead has the capability of blocking the emission of radio waves from the cable so that it uses electrical power for charging purpose only. Sanket Khedekar has put up more uses for the given question here: What purpose does the small cylindrical module near the end of my laptop charger cable serve? Do check it too!
