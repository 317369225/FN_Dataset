★Why does Microsoft Surface have USB ports?Does adding a USB port give Surface an edge over the other tablets?
People have given most of the answers already. And for those naysayers on using mouse and keyboard on a tablet, no it is not something you will do every day. But there are situations where the ability to use those or a thumb drive is a lifesaver.   The one big answer that I didn't see is gaming. On my recent flights I have been playing some games, including Snes games, using a 360 controller. Preeeetty sweet and infinitely better than touchscreen controls for certain types of games.
