★What are some unusual features that would be great to add to a new home under construction?
Ok, forget about all these fancy but wonderful ideas! Here is something that you will bless every day! It has become my favorite consumer item in my house..... A Japanese electronic bidet!  Go ahead and laugh...but even my kids love them and won't use anything else! There's nothing better than to sit on a warm seat and then have warm water wash you when you are done- so sanitary and civilized..and pleasurable! I guarantee you that you will become addicted, and will thank me from the bottom of your...well, from your bottom  :)
