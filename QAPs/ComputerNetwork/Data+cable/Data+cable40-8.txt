â˜…What are the most interesting facts you know?
There are more molecules in one glass of water than there are glasses of water in all the earth's oceans combined. This means that there is statistically a very good chance that anytime you drink a glass if water, at least one of the molecules in that glass has already been in your body before. Also because water molecules are so durable, every sip of water you take contains molecules that likely passed through dinosaurs, rainforest canopies, Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed, Bertrand Russell, Cleopatra, deep sea squid, has been frozen on Mt Everest, and an unfathomable number of other rad places. That's right, I said rad. Source (just one of many places where people have done the calculations): http://mathematics.bigparadox.co...
