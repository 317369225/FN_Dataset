★What makes a cinema camera better or more useful than a high quality DSLR?
DSLRs have a couple of very serious issues for motion photography. Rolling shutter - which distorts motion and gives rise to the jello effect. A byproduct of CMOS sensors.  (although some digital cine camera do have some rolling shutter issues) Moire - a 10 megapixel sensor needs to discard data to produce a 2K video stream. DSLR do this by discarding lines, rather than down filtering.  This can produce bad-looking images. (Especially if we are looking at something with fine parallel lines) Most DSLRs also use compression. They compress their output to h264.  This compression can rob the images of dynamic range, which can be a problem during grading.  A dedicated cinema camera should store captured images with greater fidelity.
