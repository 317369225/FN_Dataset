Jose Mujica. He may look like an average farmer, but he has been President of Uruguay since 2010. This man is globally known as the “World's Poorest President” due to his simple lifestyle and the fact that he donates around 90 percent of his $12,000 (£7,500)  monthly salary to charities that benefit poor people and small  entrepreneurs. He declined to live in the opulent presidential palace or use its staff. Instead he lives in a small farm owned by his wife. His humble lifestyle is reflected by his choice of an aging Volkswagen Beetle as transport. He  was a guerilla fighter that battled for the rights of the country’s  citizens, was imprisoned twice and was shot 6 times after an escape  attempt. He  doesn't care about money or appearances, but just leading his country.
