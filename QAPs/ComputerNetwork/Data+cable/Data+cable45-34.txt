â˜…What are some examples of bad design you have seen?Original question: "What is the worst piece of design ever?"
This is the service menu on an Android phone that I won't mention publicly. Notice "Enter" on the left and "OK" on the right. Pressing "Enter" will correctly confirm selections Pressing "OK" will exit the menu and reboot the device without saving changes. Pressing "Enter" on the keyboard has the same function as the "OK" screen button. Try educating 100 tech agents to correctly walk a customer through this over the phone. Also, "Touch Here" does nothing. EDIT: This menu has appeared on many Samsung Android phones since I first began dealing with it and first reported it.
