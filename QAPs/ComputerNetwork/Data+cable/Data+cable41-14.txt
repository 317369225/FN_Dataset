★Why does Microsoft Surface have USB ports?Does adding a USB port give Surface an edge over the other tablets?
Apple has had a past history of shooting themselves in the foot. Just look at the Lisa which could of been the standard for PC's around the world until some high ranking whiz decided they KNEW what the PC market would and would not tolerate.   The fact is that there are more devices that connect to an USB port than just about any other interface in computing history. In addition, it is far more user friendly than any other. You can plug in just about everything and with hubs, it is even offers something resembling virtual expandability. All of which is an important feature for what Microsoft is trying to accomplish with the Surface.   Meanwhile, the Ipad is basically a portable device only for mostly fun things. While you can get a keyboard that will communicate by Bluetooth, it does not translate into a serious device. I would never try typing a long document on an Ipad while I could connect up a real keyboard and do so on a Surface.   In addition, Microsoft has finally admitted that the tablet market is a serious one and it is not only because of the IOS. Android has a major share of that market and it is growing faster than the IOS for the simple fact that it is found on far cheaper devices. Devices that cost one tenth of an Ipad and are often just as functional. Which also translate into more people creating applications for the Android than for the IOS. Which was the same thing that gave the PC it's leg up over the MAC.
