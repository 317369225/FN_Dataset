★Mobile Applications: What's the most innovative app?(NB: mostly for Android here)
S.M.T.H. The app description reads something like this: DON´T PLAY IF YOU ARE A SISSY! S.M.T.H. (Send Me To Heaven) is a sport game. Player throws his phone as high as he can. The higher, the better. The phone registers the height and uploads result to leader boards. World Top 10, Week Top 10, Day Top 10, Local Top 10 (national) and Facebook Friends lists are available. I don't know if they were serious or trying to be funny while making such an app, but they give proper disclaimers and warnings at all the stages in the games. Whatever might be the case, I don't have the guts to try this "innovative" app on my new phone atleast! Here's the link to the app on play store: https://play.google.com/store/ap... Try and play at your own risk!! Ideal for people who are planning to change their phone ;)
