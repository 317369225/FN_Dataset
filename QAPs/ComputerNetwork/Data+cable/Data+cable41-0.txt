â˜…Why does Microsoft Surface have USB ports?Does adding a USB port give Surface an edge over the other tablets?
Because they know people want USB ports. This allows connecting cameras, keyboards, flash drives, etc. the only challenge is devices which draw a lot of power from USB like external hard drives. I'm not certain how that will be handled.
