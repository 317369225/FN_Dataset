â˜…What are some unusual features that would be great to add to a new home under construction?
Have a drain in all bathrooms floors, regardless of whether you need it or not. It provides an outlet for water so your house won't get flooded in the off chance that you have a plumbing mishap. (Edit: While you're at it, add 'em in the laundry room too like Nate Waddoups suggested)
