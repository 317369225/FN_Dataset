★What are some unusual features that would be great to add to a new home under construction?
There are some very cool ideas posted so far. Very, very cool. Most are very expensive. I am going to propose something cool, which puts money in your pocket without taking any out of anyone else's pocket. Something cool and good for the environment. Something which pays for itself in short order. Something which lasts virtually forever with no maintenance or moving parts. Something cool and cooling! I give you the most gorgeous hunk of metal ever invented.... ​ ​ The Wastewater Heat Recovery Coil ! Ta Daaaaaah! OK, ok, it does not look glamorous, nowhere near as cool as a car elevator. But it is magic, my friend; it takes money that you used to flush down the drain and keeps it in your pocket.  It's easy to install; you cut out a section of the plumbing stack in your basement (you do have a basement, right?), fit this in, clamp it on, and hook up the plumbing. It can be retrofit into existing homes. All it does is transfer heat from the warm water going down your plumbing stack to preheat the water feeding into your water heating system. It can have efficiency rates in the high 40% range, significantly cutting down your water heating bill. And it never needs maintenance or second thought. It takes energy you were ejecting into the municipal sewers, energy you already paid for once, and keeps it in your house! I know I used a lot of exclamation points here. But I have one of these things, it works like a charm, has already paid for itself, and I feel all twitchy and inspired to shout it out to the world at large. This thing might be standard issue in other jurisdictions, but no-one I show mine to has ever seen one before. I keep my money! More exclamation points!!!!
