â˜…Why do Apple iPods and iPhones use proprietary USB data cables?Or why can't they use microUSB cables like all new Smartphones, such as the BlackBerry.
The adoption of microUSB is a recent development which is much less common than commonly-touted. The 'agreement' is to make it an agreed standard in 2012. The cable from the iPhone and iPod is not just a USB cable, as it's able to also transmit HD video and Audio. A MicroUSB connector would seriously cut one of the main selling points of the devices. It also doesn't hurt that the iPod dock is solid enough, structurally, to also work as a clamp and support to keep the device in place. microUSB to iPod Dock adapters have existed for a long time. They can be as low as $6. To be fair, there's zero advantage for Apple in adopting the microUSB format. There's several disadvantages, though. Considering the sheer number of iPod Dock Connectors out there, they'd be in a position to defend that their connector is just as 'standard' (de facto) as microUSB and it's likely it's even more used depending on the market segment.
