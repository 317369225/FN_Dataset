★Mobile Applications: What's the most innovative app?(NB: mostly for Android here)
Thief Tracker is a must have app. This application helps you know who has your phone when stolen, lost or mis-placed. This app takes the picture of the user from the front cam when unlocking your mobile fails more than 3 times, uploads the image to our server and send notification to your mail id. A must have app on all your hard earned smartphone. 1. Resizes the image to a smaller size to reduce gprs usage and to upload faster. 2. Delete option in UI to delete all your images stored in the server. 3. You get the location of mobile along with the pic. 4. Set the number of unlock failure attempts before pic is taken. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​This was indeed helpful when my cousin's mobile phone was pick pocketed in a bus and the thief tried to unlock it a several times. She received the mail. Showed his photos to the Police, lodged a complaint and they easily tracked him as he was in the 'Wanted' list
