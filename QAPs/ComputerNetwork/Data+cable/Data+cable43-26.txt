â˜…What purpose does the small cylindrical module near the end of my laptop charger cable serve?
I think it is one of those questions which pops up in everyone's mind one day or other!! It is called "Ferrite Bead". It is one of the the most simple & inexpensive way to prevent external interference & noise. Among other things, let us say this little guy helps ensures that if lightning strikes, it doesn't fry your laptop via power cable. What do the beads do? They prevent the cable from sending/receiving signals. It has the property of eliminating the broadcast signals. Essentially, it "chokes" the RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) transmission at that point on the cable -- this is why you find the beads at the ends of the cables. Instead of travelling down the cable and transmitting, the RFI signals turn into heat in the bead.
