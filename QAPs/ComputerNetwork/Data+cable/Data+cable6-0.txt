â˜…How do you know which data cable will charge your phone fast?
You cant unless you are aware of the quality of the cable you use. The capabiltiy of a cable to transmit a higher amount of current depends on the resistance offered by the cable you use. One way to find the resistance of the cable is to use the 'meter bridge' or 'wheatstone bridge' apparatus. The basic principle here is the amount of voltage emanating from your charger box is constant but the resistance offered due to different cables varies. So you can apply: V= IxR (Usual notations) The best way to get a quick charge is to ensure your cable is short and made of low resistance material. For your ease, you should assume the longer the cable the lesser the amount of current reaches your device.
