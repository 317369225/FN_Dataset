★Why does Microsoft Surface have USB ports?Does adding a USB port give Surface an edge over the other tablets?
Speaking for myself, here's just an example of why the Surface's USB port is useful. I enjoy connecting our Garmin Oregon 450 GPS to it to download routes, Geocaches etc, for offline use. Otherwise we'd have to go and use a desktop PC or a laptop to do this task. It's much nicer to do it from the comfort of our living room chair on the Surface :-). So yes, it gives the surface an edge over other tablets for us.   And cloud-backup or not, we find a svelte external hard drive a useful way to carry around and back up a lot more data than you can fit on a Surface's internal drive (512GB is the biggest Surface Pro 3 drive available right now, but you can buy small portable HDDs at 2TB for a very nice price).
