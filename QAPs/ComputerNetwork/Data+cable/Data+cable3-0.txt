â˜…Why do ordinary data cables (USB, HDMI, etc.) fail?In a normal household or office environment, they seem like things that should never fail. What makes them stop working?
As Bruno D. Rodrigues states, everything eventually fails. In particular, cables are prone to breakage because of constant insertions and removals. The most common problem I see is tha the plug gets detacted from the wire because of constant pulling.
