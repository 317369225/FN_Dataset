★What are some examples of bad design you have seen?Original question: "What is the worst piece of design ever?"
1) Buzz lightyear cup It’s not only the placement of the straw that’s most disturbing here; rather it’s the crossed arms and smug, nonchalant look on his face as if he knows your 6-year-old daughter will be drinking her juice soon and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. 2) Donald Duck Ride This one is the worst! Why? Because when your daughter begs you to ride it you cringe but can’t come up with a single reason to tell your four-year-old daughter. 3) Batman Water Pistol it is more disturbing than funny
