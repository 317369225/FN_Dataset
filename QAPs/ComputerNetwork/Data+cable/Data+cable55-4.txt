â˜…What makes a cinema camera better or more useful than a high quality DSLR?
I don't think my answer is optimal, but anyway.. In professional cameras, you got plants of options, "gadgets" on the body of the camera. But beyond that, you can shot in higher quality than basic HD ( I'm thinking about 4K for example ) and with bigger fps. These are just few arguments and I suppose there are lot more. Hope it helped :)
