★What are some unusual features that would be great to add to a new home under construction?
Lots more electric outlets than usual.  I believe that the NEC requires one every 12 feet.  I would have at least one every six feet.  And be absolutely sure that every wall, no matter how short, has one. A pipe/wire chase.  It will make later additions of wiring and plumbing much easier, less destructive, and cheaper.  Empty conduits with messenger lines from the electrical service panel to the attic and basement. ETA:  Consider getting laminated glass windows.  The glass man told me that they can be cracked, but are extremely resistant to being penetrated, making the house much more secure. Have the frames for the exterior doors built much heavier than usual, and consider getting steel doors to make forcible entry difficult.  If not steel, get heavy solid wood. ETA:  I apologize for not picking up on the house being two story  I have edited my answer to reflect that. One more suggestion:  Locate the washer and dryer upstairs if that's where the bedrooms and main bathrooms are, since that's where most of the laundry will be generated and and returned to..  We have ours upstairs, and it makes things a lot easier. Have counter heights at whatever is the most comfortablee level for you, not the standard height.
