★What purpose does the small cylindrical module near the end of my laptop charger cable serve?
This cylinder like structure is called a ferrite core or ferrite bead. It acts as a choke or inductor that blocks high frequency noise.  A long cable can act as an antenna (sending or receiving) for high frequency noise. The cable may transmit any noise generated by the device to the external world, or pick up existing noise. This is undesirable. The core is made up of ceramic compounds, derived from iron oxide and/or oxides of other transition metals. These have some interesting properties (Ferrimagnetism). Source : Ferrite bead
