★What makes a cinema camera better or more useful than a high quality DSLR?
A cinema camera makes me feel complete relaxed because I it is completely build to give professional answers to all those things That give me headache with a DSLR. Really it feels so much better. DSLR  is like trying to fly but constantly afraid of crashing. But if you fly you *might* get the same result as a Cinema Camera. So the end result is very satisfactory if you succeed like winning a prolongued marathon. It keeps you going plus of course it is cheaper. With a Cinema Camera you don't even have to try to fly because you are already flying actually it is impossible not to fly. ( i am thinking Arri Alexa here) Then you have all the energy to concentrate on the movie you shoot. But is it worth the money? Nope... never, especially the c300 canon is a joke. There are no components in the camera that  justifies its price. Arri Alexa same story no components. Same thing for red, in the beginning they were quite cheap until they realized who would buy their camera's so up their price went until unreachable heights. No, looking at price it is all a fraud in my opinion. That is why I stick to my headaches.
