★What are some unusual features that would be great to add to a new home under construction?
One thing I've found annoying is that there never seems to be quite enough water pressure in the bathtubs and showers as I would like.  Seems like if there is anything you can do with laying the plumbing in a way that would create the maximum amount of pressure allowable, the time to decide would be now.  In two story houses (where the water heater is on the first floor), the hot water always takes longer than I would like to kick in.  You may wish to look into a tankless water heater for instant hot water (but I don't think that needs to be decided while nails are still being pounded). I'm a fan of cooking.  I wish I could get the flame on my gas stove as hot as it would get as say a Chinese restaurant.  Not sure if there is anything you can do with laying the gas lines to accomplish this, if this is an important feature for you. I'd look seriously into soundproofing.  Maybe you have noisy neighbors or you yourself will be a noisy neighbor, keen on cranking their television set or music up to the highest notch possible.  Soundproofing between walls within the structure would additionally be prudent.  Sometimes, you may not anticipate this, but water running through the pipes can be annoying.  I live in a condo and every morning, I wake up not to the sound of an alarm clock, but my neighbor above taking a shower.  There may be some things you can do on the plumbing end to minimize the noise (not an expert in this area).   Or maybe one of your kids will want to take drum or piano lessons one day.  Ever heard a piano passage being practices hundreds of times?  Very annoying to other house members.  Too many people think of these things 'after the fact' when the realize it is a problem and the dry walls have already been put up. Hope you'll find these ideas of practical usefulness.
