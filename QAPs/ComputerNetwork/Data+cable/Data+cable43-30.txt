★What purpose does the small cylindrical module near the end of my laptop charger cable serve?
In a computer system or charger, you normally see these "cylinders" on the cables. You can even find them on power supply wires. These "cylinders" are called ferrite beads or sometimes ferrite chokes. A ferrite bead is simply a hollow bead or cylinder made of ferrite, iron oxide (rust) alloyed with other metals. The bead is packed in plastic, if you cut the plastic, you will find a black metal cylinder. Computers are noisy devices. It is used to reduce EMI (electromagnetic interference) and RFI (radio-frequency interference). It is used to suppress noise from the product through cords or cables. So the ferrite core is typically working to reduce interference from a cable. Ferrite cores can also be used to reduce electrical interference to a cable, especially if it’s carrying data.
