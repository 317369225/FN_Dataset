★What purpose does the small cylindrical module near the end of my laptop charger cable serve?
The lump's called a ferrite bead or, more generically, a choke. It's a fancy name for what's basically an electromagnetic wave-bouncer. Electromagnetic interference is what makes our radios chirp when our cell phones are too close, and something similar turns our televisions fuzzy or pixilated. The choke is responsible for chilling out those EMI waves—basically making sure our cables don't send any signals except in the intended directions. The ferrite's atoms allow the choke to be the mediator by aligning themselves in a couple of different directions. The arrangement acts as an EMI blocker. And the block is most effective when close to the source. "It will always be between device that generates interference and a device you don't want interfered with," explains Greg Winchester, a program manager at the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. The ferrite lumps are positioned at the ends of cables because their job is to take noise from a certain device and turn it into heat. And closer positioning to the source stops the cable from turning into a receiver early on, giving the lumps a purpose. Src- What Do Those Mysterious Lumps on Your Cables Do?
