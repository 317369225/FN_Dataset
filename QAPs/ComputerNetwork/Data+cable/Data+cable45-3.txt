â˜…What are some examples of bad design you have seen?Original question: "What is the worst piece of design ever?"
This is how the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District lets you know when you can cross the golden gate bridge. (The rules are here: Page on Goldengatebridge) It depends on [1] whether you are walking or riding a bike, [2] what time of day it is, [3] whether it's sunny, foggy, or windy. There are 10 million visitors to the Golden Gate Bridge per year. Interesting observations: From Trini Fox, so when it's windy, cyclists have to walk their bikes but no pedestrians are allowed?
