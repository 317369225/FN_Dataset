★How do I connect (via data cable) my Samsung GT-18262 on my laptop?I have Ubuntu13.10 installed. Is there any application that I need to install? I can sync via Bluetooth but the transfer speed is slow?
No need to install anything. Just plug your phone in usb and you should see a new drive appearing on the devices column of nautilus(file explorer). You should be able to access all the files from there.(in my Samsung galaxy s3, I can only read/write content in the primary directory, other directories doesn't show up.  ) Another fast way of transferring files is with Samsung kies app on your phone. You can use your phone as wifi transmission device, then connecting your laptop and then you will be able see kies web interface in your laptop, transfer any file you want at wifi speeds.
