★Why does Microsoft Surface have USB ports?Does adding a USB port give Surface an edge over the other tablets?
The  question is why shouldn't it? People need data to be carried around  without always needing cloud or wifi. We haven;t actually gotten there  yet where everything will be clouded. In Africa, Asia amd Middle East,  carrying data on USB is still primary and folks like Apple can't change  that at least in the interim. :DEdit
