â˜…Is it possible to share the Internet connection of your PC (LAN or dongle) on your mobile through a data cable?I wish to use the internet connection of my PC with my phone. For example, let's say my PC is connected to a LAN. I want to access internet on my phone through my PC's LAN.
I am a little unsure about the direction of connectivity desired. But since there are no answers yet, I will throw one out for correction: Assuming you wish to access the internet on your computer, but do not have a suitable wifi or ethernet cable connection available - then yes, many smart phones will allow access to the internet through their cell phone connection, either by a short distance wifi or by a USB cable. Look in your phone for "Hot Spot" (to create a wifi hub) or "Tethering" (to use USB). Of course, my terminology may be specific to AT&T in the US, but you will get the idea. I use tethering quite often from my Samsung Note 3, and it works perfectly well. Depending on your data plan, you may need to be mindful of how much of your phones data plan you are burning through, though!
