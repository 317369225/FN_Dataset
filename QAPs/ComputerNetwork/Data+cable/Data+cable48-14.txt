★What are some unusual features that would be great to add to a new home under construction?
If you don't like everyone in the house to hear loud flushing noises from the bathrooms, make sure that your sewer stack pipes are cast iron.  I thank my plumber every day for this advice. And I just remembered this:  We  have lever-type door handles throughout and they are surprisingly  useful.  You can open and close doors even when your hands are full --  you can't do that with doorknobs.  We initially put them in for the "old  age" factor, but people of any age will appreciate them.
