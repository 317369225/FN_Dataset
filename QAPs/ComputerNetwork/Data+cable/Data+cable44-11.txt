â˜…How can I send my installed apps to my friend via Wi-Fi? My phone is Android.
You can send movies (any size) or installed apps using below software. But both the devices should have any one of said sofwares. Software Data Cable - But received file will be saved in the location where "Software Data Cable" is installed.(ie Phone Memory OR External SD Card) Flash Transfer - But received file will be saved in the location where " Flash Transfer" is installed.(ie Phone Memory OR External SD Card) ES File Explorer - First Create connection in Net Manager, Than go to App Manager and select APK and SEND. Best part of ES File Explorer is that you can save any receiving file to any location (ie Phone Memory OR External SD Card) which is not possible with Software Data Cable OR Flash Transfer. But ES File Explorer is bit slower than others.
