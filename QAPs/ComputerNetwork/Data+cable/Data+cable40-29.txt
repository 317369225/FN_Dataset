â˜…What are the most interesting facts you know?
Angel Falls, located in Venezuela is the world's highest falls Here are some interesting facts about it: Water falls from the cliff unbroken for about 1000 meters Even before the water reaches the base of the falls it is blown away as mist due to the sheer height of the falls. This is one of the most spectacular videos about the falls. When I first saw it on BBC Planet Earth, I did not know what was coming when they showed the water flowing among the rocks...amazing camera work!
