â˜…Is there a way to transfer five-minute short films from my Nokia phone to the PC without a data cable slot?I have a Nokia phone that doesn't have a data cable slot. I have made 5-minute short films on my phone that I can't transfer to the PC. Is there a way out?
You can upload it to the cloud, I think it is SkyDrive or OneDrive in Windows based Nokia devices. You did not specify what model Nokia phone you have. There is also the option of Google Drive or Dropbox. If you have a removable SD card (or microSD, but you will need an adapter for that), then you can directly plug it into your laptop (or a friend's?) and transfer the contents. If all of that is not possible, maybe you could send them via Bluetooth to a friend and get him to plug his device to a PC and transfer it. Last option is to send them as MMS to a friend and then transfer it. I think if your phone can shoot video, it will at least have the option to send MMS if nothing else! Here, is the worst case scenario answer, and I am getting very creative! Film the video that is playing on your device, using another device that has at least one of the above features!
