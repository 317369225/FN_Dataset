★What are some examples of bad design you have seen?Original question: "What is the worst piece of design ever?"
Serial wired Christmas lights. At first, it will just be ungodly tangled: But then, thanks to serial wiring [1], when one of those bulbs turns out to be burnt out (or you break the flimsy filament during the untangling)... THE ENTIRE SET OF 100-1000 LIGHTS WILL NOT FUNCTION UNTIL YOU FIND AND REPLACE THE BULB BY TRIAL AND ERROR! The expected lifespan of a tiny little Christmas light already is approaching "mosquito".  So who decided that a daisy chain of 100's was a good idea? It's as if Santa designed this for parents who have been naughty. I still remember my dad struggling yearly with this (as a child in the 80's). [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ser...
