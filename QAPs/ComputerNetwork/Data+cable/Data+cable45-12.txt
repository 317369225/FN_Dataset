â˜…What are some examples of bad design you have seen?Original question: "What is the worst piece of design ever?"
The new 'Walkie Talkie' building in London. It appears that at certain times of day and year it focuses sunlight into a powerful heat beam that has been damaging cars, bikes, carpets, tiles and anything else in the way. How did the designers not know what a curved, mirrored surface exposed to the sun does? It's going to be interesting to see what they come up with to resolve the issue. Although, to be fair, it IS England, there's not that much sun around that often to do too much damage... ;)
