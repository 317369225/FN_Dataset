★What purpose does the small cylindrical module near the end of my laptop charger cable serve?
These cylindrical shaped bumps are not only found in laptop chargers but also in many other power cords, such as: mouse, keyboard, monitor cables, printer cables etc. These "bumps" are called Ferrite beads or sometimes Ferrite chokes. Their goal in life is to reduce EMI (electromagnetic interference) and RFI (radio-frequency interference).  Due to the electric current in the cable, it creates radio energy within itself and emits it in the form of waves outside the cable.  Just like an antenna, this cable transmits and receives signals to or from surrounding gadgets with same capability. Due to this, the electric power gets used in unnecessary function and hinders charging the actual device. A ferrite bead has the property of eliminating the broadcast signals. Essentially, it "chokes" the RFI transmission at that point on the cable -- this is why you find the beads at the ends of the cables. Instead of traveling down the cable and transmitting, the RFI signals turn into heat in the bead. In addition, these signals can interfere with other electronic devices resulting in noisy signals such as a nearby radio gives distorted voice or does not tune up to a channel. This is why a ferrite bead is inserted to a charger. It has the capability of blocking the emission of radio waves from the cable so that it uses electrical power for charging purpose only. A typical ferrite bead is formed through an insulated wire wrapped around a magnetic material just like it is shown in the picture below In our case, the charging cable is the insulated wire and the ferrite cylinder is the magnetic material which together form a special kind of lump for the charger.
