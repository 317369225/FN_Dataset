â˜…Is it possible to share the Internet connection of your PC (LAN or dongle) on your mobile through a data cable?I wish to use the internet connection of my PC with my phone. For example, let's say my PC is connected to a LAN. I want to access internet on my phone through my PC's LAN.
Reverse tethering! It is done successfully on most devices. But, sadly, on my micromax a 116 it fails to work. After several tries and back breaking hours of work I did figure out that my pc could not recognize the device as a lan and failed to connect. Anyway the best place to read more about the topic is stackexchange android.stackexchange.com
