★Where could unlabeled Cat5e and Coaxial cables lead?Inside the media center panel where all the coaxial and cat5e cords throughout the home meet up there are 7 unlabeled Coaxial and 3 unlabeled Cat5e cords. Every other cord is numbered and accounted for every jack inside the home. Essentially these extra cords do not lead to any jack inside the home that I am aware of. Where else could they lead?
I'm assuming that the Coax cables are already hooked up to take Cable Television input. Are the splitters actually switches? Does the house also have an aerial antenna for broadcast reception? It's possible that the 7 coaxial cables run towards the roof and that the house is broken into zones so that – if switched properly – some rooms can receive cable while other rooms receive the antenna signal. My parents' house used to have a panel that did that.
