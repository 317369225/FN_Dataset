â˜…Why does Microsoft Surface have USB ports?Does adding a USB port give Surface an edge over the other tablets?
You have been blinded by Apple fanboy-ism. USB ports are super useful for connecting all sorts of peripherals (cameras, external storage, keyboards, mice, printers, smartphones, music players, ethernet, Wacom tablets, MIDI synthesizers, embedded devices, etc). Why it SHOULDN'T have USB ports is a better question, in my opinion. Why is this even a question?
