â˜…What purpose does the small cylindrical module near the end of my laptop charger cable serve?
As electric current passes over the wire to charge the laptop, it creates radio energy within itself and emits it in the form of waves outside the cable. So its starts working just like an antenna which can emit radio waves and receive signals from the surroundings. The emission of radio waves can interfere with other devices resulting in noisy signals. The lump on the laptop charger blocks the emission of of radio waves so that all of the electrical energy is only used to charge the laptop, and not get wasted in emitting radio signals. This also helps in not disturbing nearby devices as there are no radio signals being emitted now.
