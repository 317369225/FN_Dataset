★Mobile Applications: What's the most innovative app?(NB: mostly for Android here)
Skype Real-time Language Translator Microsoft has recently previewed a new feature of Skype where students from US and Mexico  were made to converse with each other in their own native languages. While these participants spoke, Skype translated the language from English to Spanish and vice versa in real-time . Check the video below for the demonstration. As of now Skype is also  able to translate IM texts  with  40 different  languages supported . The real -time translation is now limited to only English and Spanish but this will change in coming months. Skype Translator helped me speak Spanish for the first time
