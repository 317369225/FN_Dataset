★What are some examples of bad design you have seen?Original question: "What is the worst piece of design ever?"
The Washington, DC metro ticket machine.  This is worse even than the other urban transit machine examples.  Behold its glory.  All that super-tiny print in rows and columns between the red and blue parts?  Every row is the name of a possible destination, and every column is a different price for you to pay to get there depending on the time of day you want to travel.  So your price is a function of two variables - distance traveled and time of day.  And you have to use this little matrix to figure it out.  Doesn't sound so hard, but when you're standing in front of this Wall of Death, it's misery.  I have seen so many tourists give up in despair after gazing at one of these machines for several minutes, saying "I'll just get a f&$cking taxi instead..." and I just shake my head, knowing that getting a taxi in DC is even worse than navigating this machine.  Nation's Capitol, baby, showing the country how it's done.
