â˜…What are some examples of bad design you have seen?Original question: "What is the worst piece of design ever?"
Not the worst, but something that annoys us here in parts of Alexandria, VA. This is a pedestrian crossing button. A lot of people think it's telling them to press the round metal thing on top that looks like a button but for some reason is just a metal disc that does nothing. Many of them are dented as a result. You have to press the white circle to use it.
