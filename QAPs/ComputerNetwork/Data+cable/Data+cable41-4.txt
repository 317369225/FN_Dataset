â˜…Why does Microsoft Surface have USB ports?Does adding a USB port give Surface an edge over the other tablets?
I'm sorry. This question strikes me as a bit retarded. Even if Surface was merely a tablet, which it's not...a USB port would still be a great addition. The biggest thing it offers is easy access to external storage. Think of it, an iPad with virtually unlimited local storage! The reason it doesnt exist now is because Apple wants to charge you an arm and a leg for storage space. Surface is not merely a tablet however, it's also a fully-fledged computer. Do you know any computers that DONT have USB ports? I didn't think so...
