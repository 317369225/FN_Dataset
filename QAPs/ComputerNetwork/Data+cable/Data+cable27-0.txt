â˜…PVC has a negative connotation but have there been better alternatives? Look at Apple's power and data cables - they don't use PVC, they don't last..
Thanks for asking this question. I am answering as an experienced expert on polymer materials. Despite some undesirable and somehow potential harmful properties of PVC, it has been the most widely used materials for wires and cables sheathings because of it can be formulated to a wide range of properties and great processability. There have been some attempts to find substitute materials for PVC and some of them are widely used for cable coatings. For example, crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE), ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, polyolefin thermoplastic elastomers (EPR, ...), and fluoropolymers (PTFE, ETFE, ...). Feasibility of application for each of these alternatives depends on several factors, such as the voltage, environment of use, level of insulation, cost, and some other desired properties.
