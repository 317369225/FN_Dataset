â˜…What type of fiber optic cable is best for home phone and data use? (The cable will be buried outdoors in conduit)This is a follow up to this: What kind of cable do I need to run phone/data 880 feet? I'm wanting to know how many strands the cable should be for best current and future performance.
Just had a look at the original question before answering. See the very good answer to the original. Your problem is with the phone company, and doing anything that's not what they want you to do will NEVER give you a satisfactory result. Unless you're planning to run fiber all the way to the central office, get rack space there, install your own equipment and intereconnect, and become a CLEC while you're at it, just do it their way. If you want to do all of the above, drop me a note, I'll walk you through it.
