â˜…Why do Android data cables stop transferring data after a few months of use, while they still manage to charge the phone?
An USB port cable contains four/five wires. This image shows different types of ports with the connections marked. The following tables shows the use of each connection. As you can see only 2 wires (1 and 4/5) are needed for charging purpose, while all are needed for data transfer. So if and when one of the data wires get broken with many days of usage, cable can still work for charging purpose. But if a power wire breaks, it makes the cable useless. Source: Wikipedia
