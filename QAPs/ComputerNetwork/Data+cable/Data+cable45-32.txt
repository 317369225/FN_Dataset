â˜…What are some examples of bad design you have seen?Original question: "What is the worst piece of design ever?"
There's many examples of poor design, and I'd imagine those that inadvertently threaten people's lives must be the worst of the worst. The Hindenburg, for example. On a more local and contemporary scale, this gives me the horrors: San Francisco's BART ticket machines. So poorly designed that a fare schedule on a piece of paper must be taped to the machine, in order that a rider can (1) insert monetary currency (1a) check the fare posting (not numbered on the process illustrated on the machine, btw) (2) increment the ticket by a relevant amount of said money (2a) double check, oh woops that's for Dublin/Pleasanton, I need to decrement 15 cents more again (3) finally confirm and obtain ticket. With such a rich information screen and a series of buttons already available, just list the stations, let me poke one, and sell me the ticket. FFS.
