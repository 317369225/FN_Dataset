â˜…What are some examples of bad design you have seen?Original question: "What is the worst piece of design ever?"
The everyday sink faucet. I frequently find that they have way too little room between the posterior surface and where the water comes out, making it quite awkward for anyone with hands larger than a 3-year-old's. See below photo, where there is literally ~1 inch of maneuvering space. This poor but common design causes water to splash everywhere making a mess. Some modern designs improve upon this greatly, but they are not at all commonplace. For example: See how the faucet is positioned such that there is maximal room to actually move your hands and get them clean? (Photo credit: http://www.aboutdesigninterior.c...)
