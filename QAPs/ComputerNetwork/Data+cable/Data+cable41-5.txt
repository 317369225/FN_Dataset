â˜…Why does Microsoft Surface have USB ports?Does adding a USB port give Surface an edge over the other tablets?
Microsoft is positioning Windows 8 as one single OS across mobile and desktop. Thus you can plug a LCD, keyboard / mouse on the Surface and use it as a normal Windows system. That's the approach Microsoft has taken, even though that means device manufacturers would rollout both ARM and X86 based Windows 8 systems. For a tablet to function as a full-fledged desktop , USB ports would be essential. Of course there are other benefits to having a USB port like attaching different peripherals (storage, printing, docks, I/O). I would suspect that as the need to reduce the thickness of Windows 8 tablets increases, the USB ports would shrink to Micro USB and provide converters like Nokia did with its USB on-the-go offerings.
