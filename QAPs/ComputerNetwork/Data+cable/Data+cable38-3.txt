â˜…Where could unlabeled Cat5e and Coaxial cables lead?Inside the media center panel where all the coaxial and cat5e cords throughout the home meet up there are 7 unlabeled Coaxial and 3 unlabeled Cat5e cords. Every other cord is numbered and accounted for every jack inside the home. Essentially these extra cords do not lead to any jack inside the home that I am aware of. Where else could they lead?
I doesn't seem like they wired the light switches, the most popular way to do that is using x10 or something similar, and they run through the electric cables. Now it could be that they had some kind of computer room and they were connected directly to cat5's coming directly from the ceiling and not from a wall connector, it may also be that those cables use to be connected to wall connectors that were removed or covered but never disconnected. For the coaxial cables, there's a good chance that they belonged to some kind of CCTV or that they were used to connect antennas or dishes in different times and never disconnected or reused, some of them may lead to the roof and probably still be connected to some kind of antenna. But again it's possible that they are reminiscences of gadgets long gone.
