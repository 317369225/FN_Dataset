â˜…What are the most interesting facts you know?
The fingerprints of koala bears are virtually indistinguishable from those of humans - so much so, they could be confused at a crime scene! Most primates have friction ridges on their palms, but our fingerprints are not just roughly similar to koalas - they really are identical. A trained expert would have trouble telling human and koala fingerprints apart, even using a microscope. As you can see a comparison of koala and human fingerprints on the left. While the two look quite similar in the larger view, it's under the even higher resolution of an electron microscope that they really look pretty much indistinguishable. BTW Thanks for the A2A! :D
