★What purpose does the small cylindrical module near the end of my laptop charger cable serve?
The cylinder is called a ferrite bead, ferrite core, or, more generally, a choke. Cables can act like unintentional antennas, broadcasting electrical interference (“noise”) or picking it up. The appointed task of a ferrite core is to prevent such interference. The most common use of ferrite cores, according to Dwayne Campbell, Senior Director of Regulator and Product Development for Radio Shack, “is to suppress noise emanating from the product through cords or cables.” So the ferrite core is typically working to reduce interference from a cable—often to comply with regulatory requirements that specify how much interference a device is permitted to emit. source: Page on slate.com p.s.
