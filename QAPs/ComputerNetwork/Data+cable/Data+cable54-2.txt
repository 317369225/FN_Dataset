â˜…Mobile Applications: What's the most innovative app?(NB: mostly for Android here)
BE MY EYES - lend your eyes to the blind(http://bemyeyes.org/) This is one of the most impressive apps I've seen. Be My Eyes helps blind people see through video chats. This is a great example of micro-volunteering and the power of apps to actually improve people's live in meaningful ways. From their website: How It Works Blind Requests Assistance A blind person requests assistance in the Be My Eyes app. The challenge that he/she needs help with can be anything from knowing the expiry date on the milk to navigating new surroundings. Volunteer Receives Video And Describes The volunteer helper receives a notification for help and a live video connection is established. From the live video the volunteer can help the blind person by answering the question they need answered. It is totally non-profit and open source.
