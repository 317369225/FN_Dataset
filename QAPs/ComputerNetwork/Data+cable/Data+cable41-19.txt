â˜…Why does Microsoft Surface have USB ports?Does adding a USB port give Surface an edge over the other tablets?
Microsoft Surface is not a client device. It is not one that can be synced by an external PC or a Mac. It is not one that can even be safely connected to a PC without a "Windows Easy Transfer" cable. Microsoft Surface is capable of acting as a host to an external device - flash drives, webcams and even phones. It is just like your average PC. Of course, everything that a person would want will not be put in one package, so a USB port lets you add whatever you like. And no, adding a USB port wasn't intended to give it an edge over other tablets. A Windows tablet is a full PC and it would be crippled without a USB port. On the other hand, consumers perceive a USB port as a perk, so maybe it does give it an edge over others.
