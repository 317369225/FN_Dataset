★Why don't smartphones use real-time differential GPS and ground-based transceiver networks for location services?Is the technology to expensive and not worth the trouble?  Are satellite and assisted solutions just 'good enough.'   Are there laws prohibiting consumer use of signals from ground based stations?  Seems like many places have these networks but only professional surveyors use them.

3.  Smart phones are VERY cost constrained - every penny counts, because parts cost multiplied by about 5 becomes the consumer price, and consumers are very price sensitive.  Mobile phone OEMs will sell their grandmother for 3 cents - because that can be 3 cents on 20 million units. 2.  GPS eats power, resulting in shorter battery life. Differential GPS = more power - even worse battery life.  A long battery life is desired by carriers so the user will make calls, send texts, do downloads,etc. Short battery life hurts both the consumer and the carrier, and will get bad reviews from magazines about which phone to buy. That's a lose-lose. Playing Angry Birds doesn't take much power...until it tries to get a location and  send back location info to the ad server -  the ads are 75% of the power. >> 1.  Normal consumers don't need to know where they are with an accuracy greater than about 2-3 meters. Surveyors and geologists do need to know. That's a teeny tiny fraction of world of 4.3 Billion phones and 400+ million smart phones.
