★Why don't smartphones use real-time differential GPS and ground-based transceiver networks for location services?Is the technology to expensive and not worth the trouble?  Are satellite and assisted solutions just 'good enough.'   Are there laws prohibiting consumer use of signals from ground based stations?  Seems like many places have these networks but only professional surveyors use them.

I bought a $150 Garmin receiver a few years ago with optional WAAS-enhanced GPS,  so consumer devices certainly can used ground-based augmentation. Beyond that, I know that turning WAAS on for that device significantly reduced battery life, so that could be a factor.
