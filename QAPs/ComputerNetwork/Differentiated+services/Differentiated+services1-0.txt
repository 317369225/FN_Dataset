â˜…What are the bases of differentiating IT services and IT products?Can someone explain how IT products are different from IT services. I am not very sure on what basics we should differentiate IT products from Services.
I think the short answer is, if you are buying a something with one time payment, it is a product. If you are paying in a regular interval it is a service. Because you don't pay for a product again unless it is broken. Then fixing it becomes a service. The difference is very stark. For example, if you are buying a phone with one time payment - you are buying a product of the IT industry. But when you are billed by your network service provider you are paying the IT services industry.
