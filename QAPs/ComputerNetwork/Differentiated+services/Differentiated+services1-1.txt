â˜…What are the bases of differentiating IT services and IT products?Can someone explain how IT products are different from IT services. I am not very sure on what basics we should differentiate IT products from Services.
A product company would generally create products for a broader market need and sell them to clients. For example a product company creates a Warehouse management system (WMS) keeping in mind the functional needs of Warehousing and then starts selling it to warehousing companies. A services company would do software development as a service. A services company discusses the product functionality with a client and then creates a tailor made solution which completely suits that company's needs. Mixed matched solutions do exist. Some product companies sell a very good generic product to a client and then also do some level of customization for extra billing. On the other hand services companies do productize some of their services which are repeatedly sought by clients and start implementing them at client sites as products.
