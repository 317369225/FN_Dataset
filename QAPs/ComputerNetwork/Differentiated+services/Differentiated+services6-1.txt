â˜…Wealthfront, Marketriders and Betterment are all interesting to me but I really don't understand the key differentiators among these services. Any thoughts?Wealthfront, Marketriders, Betterment, investing, stock market, ETF, ETF investing
The two key differences are the admin work involved and cost. Betterment takes care of everything, from selecting a diversified portfolio, diversifying every penny across a 8 carefully selected ETFs, rebalancing, reinvesting dividends in a tax efficient way, and automating deposits from your linked checking account. We also provide investment advice on reaching your goals. Marketriders is more of an advice tool - they don't actually invest the money for you, but make a recommendation which you could then choose to follow. You need to manually input the amount you plan on investing, then log into Vanguard or whichever fund they recommend and execute it yourself. As for cost, Betterment charges an AUM fee of 0.15%-0.35% per year (no charge from trades, transactions, withdrawals). Marketriders charges an annual fee of $179 plus costs for every trade.
