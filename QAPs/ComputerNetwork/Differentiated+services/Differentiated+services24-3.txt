★Why don't smartphones use real-time differential GPS and ground-based transceiver networks for location services?Is the technology to expensive and not worth the trouble?  Are satellite and assisted solutions just 'good enough.'   Are there laws prohibiting consumer use of signals from ground based stations?  Seems like many places have these networks but only professional surveyors use them.

the answer is simple and sad: Country-protection reasons. It is not so good, if anybody has an uncontrolled access for the precise location. I mean terror purposes.
