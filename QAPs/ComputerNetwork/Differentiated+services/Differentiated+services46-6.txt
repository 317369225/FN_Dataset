â˜…Valuations: Is Groupon worth $5 billion more than Twitter?Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. recently valued Twitter Inc. at $10 billion dollars. That is a whopping $5 billion dollars less than the Groupon Initial Public Offering (IPO) filed earlier this year. Not just a couple bucks, but $5 billion dollars.
Personally, I feel GroupOn is overvalued and overrated and that their bubble will burst - Is Groupon's bubble going to burst? - but based on their existing revenue, and the projections that likely show continuing meteoric growth, the valuation, although high, is not unrealistic on a pure comparative basis.
