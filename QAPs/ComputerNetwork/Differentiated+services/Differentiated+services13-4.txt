â˜…What differentiated Infosys and Wipro from other IT service delivery companies that allowed them to scale their billions of revenues and 100,000s employees?most remaining below 500 employees.
The ones remaining below 500 employees usually specialise in niches, and don't have full coverage. If you go to Wipro or Infosys with any IT RFP, chances are they'll be able to respond, and have a group of people in their company that can deliver (whether they're based in India, UK, or US). So basically, they have breadth of expertise. And for big clients, they like this, as they can sign partnership outsourcing/consulting agreements, and any of their divisions can access the skills required without having to go through onboarding process again and again with many smaller niche consultancies. It's a self fulfilling cycle - the more projects they win, the more breadth of expertise and skills they can employ, and then they can win more projects because they have that capability. Plus, once they're in with one project, lots of opportunities to cross-sell other IT services, and literally they can "milk" a client for years and years through a string of projects. One-trick consultancies/outsourcers can't do that.
