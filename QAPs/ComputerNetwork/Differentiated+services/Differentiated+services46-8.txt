★Valuations: Is Groupon worth $5 billion more than Twitter?Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. recently valued Twitter Inc. at $10 billion dollars. That is a whopping $5 billion dollars less than the Groupon Initial Public Offering (IPO) filed earlier this year. Not just a couple bucks, but $5 billion dollars.
Groupon should have sold to Google. I think retailers are going to learn quickly that the Groupon method of getting people into your shop for deals doesn't  build loyalty among consumers and only devalues their product and brand name.  It's amazing how people aren't very loyal to the daily coupon companies either as LivingSocial has taken a good chunk out of Groupon's business this past month.  Too much competition growing in this area now and I can also see a lot of retailers doing these deals directly with consumers.  It will be interesting to see the data that comes back from retailers who have used these services to see how much of an impact its had on their business, but especially their bottom line.  Which is generally not tied to sales.
