â˜…What are some good ways to differentiate pricing of a service in order to make it affordable to less well-off clients?I don't want to make less well-off clients embarrassed or to add needless perks to bump up the price for those with more money - I want to provide an honest service that benefits as many people as possible. In case it helps, the service is repairing computers - something that can be very helpful for people who are applying for jobs, for example. Thank you!
I would charge a good price, and then give it away to those in search of jobs. Best of both worlds. Why? I always use the jeans story. Way back when, you couldn't give regular jeans away. They sat on the shelves, unsold. Then someone dreamed up designer jeans. Same jeans, just gussied up. (This is what is also called selling the sizzle, not the steak). Four times the price of the old jeans. You couldn't keep them in the stores they sold out so fast. Set up a program to help less well off clients. Give them the service for free. If possible, see if this is tax deductible. For those who can pay, charge a healthy price. One subsidizes the other.
