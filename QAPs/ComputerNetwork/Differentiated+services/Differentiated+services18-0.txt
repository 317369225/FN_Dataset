â˜…Are oDesk and Elance considered as SAAS?
I don't consider them SAAS companies, I consider them web-based businesses, which are different. SAAS companies deliver functional software over the wire; web-based businesses are providing some differentiated service or product and use the web as a distribution channel. For an example, Salesforce.com is the classic example of business process automation, sold traditionally as on premise software, but now being offered over the wire. By contrast, Craigslist.com is a classic exchange (like eLance or oDesk) that could have existed just as well (although not nearly as effectively) offline.
