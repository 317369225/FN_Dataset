â˜…What differentiated Infosys and Wipro from other IT service delivery companies that allowed them to scale their billions of revenues and 100,000s employees?most remaining below 500 employees.
Thanks for A2A. There are already good answers which cover all the points. I also have only similar points, 1. Early into the business with onsite-offshore model (outsourcing model). 2. Getting more freshers and training them. They were giving the results as given by 2 - 3 years experience but the probation salary was very less comparatively. When I joined Infosys in 2004, I was paid Rs. 15,000/- which is equivalent to only $400. But, it was huge amount for a middle class person like me (and people like me) and we used to work like hell to show loyalty. Special mention to Infy, they hired any engineering graduates, and gave training for 4 months on a specific stream. This gave them more people to choose from, top people from various departments, rather than stick to the limited number of people doing CSE/IT courses. They even hired bachelor degrees in arts and science students for testing projects. 3. This is also in relation to point #2. Along with the revenue turnover, Infosys has the number of freshers hired also in their target list. I saw it grow from 20,000 employees to 1,00,000 employees in a matter of 4 years (2004 to 2008).
