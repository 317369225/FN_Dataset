â˜…What differentiated Infosys and Wipro from other IT service delivery companies that allowed them to scale their billions of revenues and 100,000s employees?most remaining below 500 employees.
I somehow think that both these factors are very much inter-related. They took in a lot of people every time as they had enough to pay them off even when there was no work. And to get more work, they could easily show available dedicated task force which got them work and hence the increased revenue.
