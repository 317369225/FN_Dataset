â˜…What is the key to successfully launching a subscription music service like Spotify MOG, or Rdio?
The major key to success in subscription based music streaming business is the music catalog. It should have at least 3 of the 4 biggest labels (Universal, Sony, Warner and EMI). It's sad to say but if the service offers a fringe of the musical gamut it will only get a fringe of the customers. Then the company have to understand that music consumption is ubiquitous. You listen to music at home, in your car, at the gym, <you pick> so the service should be available on computers (Windows, Mac and Linux), smartphones (Android, iOS, Blackberry, WP7), wifi enabled MP3 players (iPod Touch and Zune) and network enabled speakers (Sonos and Logitech). While on the go your devices might lose their connectivity, the service should allow to cache music. So you can load your favorite albums in advance, then listen when ever you want (not when ever you can).
