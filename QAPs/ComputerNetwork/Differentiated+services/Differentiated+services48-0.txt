★How does the law differentiate between a legal denial (which is indiscriminate) to a business or service, and an illegal denial which is discriminatory?My understanding is, that you can deny access to your business in an indiscriminate manner without legal consequence. For example, banning Mr. White from your flower shop because you don't like him. Conversely, you can not discriminate on the basis of age, race, religion, sex, or nationality. How is this distinction usually made to give it a legal effect?
Generally speaking, one proves illegal discrimination one of two ways: (1) by the admission of the person against whom the claim is being made; or (2) by proving a pattern of discriminatory behavior over time that cannot be otherwise reasonably explained.  If someone refuses to serve one gay couple, but serves others, it will be exceedingly hard to prove that their decision not to serve that one couple was the result of illegal discrimination.  Likewise, if someone refuses to serve any gay couple, it would not be difficult to convince a jury to a preponderance of the evidence that the intent was illegally discriminatory.
