★What differentiates Lookout from Apple's existing iCloud services?Lookout Mobile Security seems to do the same things that Apple provides now with iCloud, namely: backup to an offsite location and the ability to remotely zap your phone with the Find My iPhone app So... what else does Lookout do that make them a viable alternative to Apple's integrated services?

Lookout for iPhone is a single app that helps keep your phone safe. We want to help iOS users understand the risky behavior that could put their phone or their data at risk. It does include contacts backup and "find my phone" functionality like iCloud, and it also offers simple notifications to protect your privacy and your phone. For example, Lookout will alert you if your phone has been jailbroken. Some people know their phone is jailbroken because they did it themselves, but otherwise, it's pretty difficult to determine. If you buy a used iPhone or let your hacker little brother play with your phone and your phone is jailbroken unbeknownst to you, your phone could be more susceptible to security threats.  Also, Lookout has Theft Alerts in the paid Lookout Premium version. We'll send you an email with the location of your device whenever we see activity that could mean it has been stolen (like SIM card removal, airplane mode toggled on/off, passcode entered incorrectly multiple times). It gives you valuable clues to help get your phone back if it's stolen. Another great thing about Lookout is that it’s cross platform. If you have, say, an Android device and an iPad, you can manage both devices from a single place. We are continuing to innovate and add more features appropriate for iOS users. Plus, the free version is pretty robust, so it doesn't have to be an "alternative" to iCloud, you can use it in addition to iCloud or as that extra peace of mind as a backup for iCloud.
