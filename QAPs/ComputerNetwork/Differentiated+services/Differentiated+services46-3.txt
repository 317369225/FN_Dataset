★Valuations: Is Groupon worth $5 billion more than Twitter?Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. recently valued Twitter Inc. at $10 billion dollars. That is a whopping $5 billion dollars less than the Groupon Initial Public Offering (IPO) filed earlier this year. Not just a couple bucks, but $5 billion dollars.
A company that is profitable vs a company that is struggling to monetize.  I would say Groupon deserves a higher valuation than Twitter but both valuations seem ridiculously high.
