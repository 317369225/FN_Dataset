â˜…How do you answer the question, "What do you do?" How do you differentiate your services from that of your competitors (i.e. be more than just a price)?Does it work?
There are many ways to differentiate ones business but the one which I think would work best is to stress/emphasize that your company was First in the Market(example: First to offer Remediation Services for Medical Devices Manufacturing companies). This indirectly / directly means your competitors had to copy you & this reinforces the idea (in your potential prospect) that your products/services are better.
