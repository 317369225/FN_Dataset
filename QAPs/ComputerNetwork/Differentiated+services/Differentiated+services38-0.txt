â˜…How do you create differentiation in a saturated market where price, product, and service are all the same?Specific reference here is to domestic product and installations such as flooring.
Service, or at least the perception of the service, may be the key differential. While the price and the product may be a 1:1 match, the service, in terms of delivery and consumer satisfaction, can distinguish one business from another. Say the installers and customer service representatives for Flooring Company A get better feedback and reviews than Flooring Company B. That is one way in which Company A can gain a competitive edge in marketing. Having experienced installers with x number of years or y certification, customer service reps taking live calls, marketing those pluses demonstrate why Company A may be better than Company B. Same product, same price, better service.
