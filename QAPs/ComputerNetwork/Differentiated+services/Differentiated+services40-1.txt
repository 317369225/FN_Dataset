â˜…Is foursquare's new photo feature a way to differentiate themselves against other location-based services like Facebook Places and Gowalla, in direct competition to Path, or something else?
This feature is part of the natural evolution of this product. It should of had image capacity from the start, and I'm sure it's just a matter of time before FB places implements it. Foursquare is just playing (standard feature) catch-up, now that it has got more staff, offices and funding.
