â˜…Wealthfront, Marketriders and Betterment are all interesting to me but I really don't understand the key differentiators among these services. Any thoughts?Wealthfront, Marketriders, Betterment, investing, stock market, ETF, ETF investing
The value delivered to the consumer is very similar, but while Marketriders will sell you a model allocation for a flat monthly fee, Betterment and Wealthfront will make you open an account with them and charge a percentage of assets under management. Depending on how much money you have to invest, you may want to pick one or the other. In terms of value, although Marketriders seems slightly more advanced in their allocation construction, they all seem to use a classic broad 6 styles passive allocation, given some risk assessment and following a glide path strategy (i.e., start with lots of stocks if you're young and increase allocation to bonds as you grow older). But most so-called target date funds already use this strategy: low-cost, passive allocation following a glide path. Before investing with any of these services, I would ask what extra value I get for my money; or keep your fees low - as they advocate - and simply buy a target date fund.
