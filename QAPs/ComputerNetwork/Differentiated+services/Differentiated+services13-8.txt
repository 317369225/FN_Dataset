â˜…What differentiated Infosys and Wipro from other IT service delivery companies that allowed them to scale their billions of revenues and 100,000s employees?most remaining below 500 employees.
They kept their focus on "services" business without bothering much about "products" (though things like Finacle did come out later, that is more the exception). In contrast, companies like HCL, Sasken, Integra etc. were going behind products as well and lost focus on services.
