â˜…What can a coffee shop do to differentiate itself? Product, service, marketing/promotion...Etc?
It will differ from one country or region to another. I agree with Krista, use social media to get a feel for what your potential customers are looking for and what engages them. Just doing what interests you is a recipe for disaster. Our most successful customers are ones that have something unique to offer - some roast their own coffee and shout from the rooftops about it, others offer drinks that their competitors don't, like some whacky coffee flavours or really good quality frappes. Don't know how to make one? - It takes about 30 seconds, have a look at this easy to follow idea - Blog Most of all, successful coffee shops are about people and community, something the big chains have forgotten somewhere along the line. Best of luck with your venture! @a1_coffee
