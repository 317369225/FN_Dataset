â˜…What differentiated Infosys and Wipro from other IT service delivery companies that allowed them to scale their billions of revenues and 100,000s employees?most remaining below 500 employees.
The difference between Infosys and Wipro can be looked at from different dimensions: 1. Verticals: Infy is big on Financial sector deals. If you look at all the $100m+ deals which Infy has won in last few years, it would be in the BFSI space. They have a product called Finnacle which helps them get large transformation deals in this space. Wipro is big in Healthcare space. This comes from the initial collaboration from GE Healthcare which has been an anchor client for long time. 2. Consulting Versus Delivery: Wipro was first to explore consulting - beyond IT delivery and staff augmentation. Even now, Wipro is considered better in consulting in retail and healthcare, while Infy is considered better in BFSI. 3. Geography: Infy revenue has been NA dominated at around 65%, it has struggled in Europe traditionally and also in RoW. For Wipro, NA is largest market as well at 50%, but it is stroner in Europe and APAC as well. 4. Management: Infy is known to have a leadership clique - revolves around a group of people including founders and their friends. Wipro is known to have more entrepreneurial leaders and has produced CEOs of several tech companies and start-ups. Also, the buck at Wipro stops at Azim Premji, so there is no false ideal of who the real owner / promoter is. 5. Culture: Infy is more aligned to American working culture while Wipro is not so - may be because of a better geographic spread of clients. 6. Rates: pretty similar 7. Offerings: Wipro's products business contributes more than 7% of revenue. Including hardware business, it gets a certain edge as a technology company. 8. Heritage: Both belong to the phase 1 of Indian IT Services success and are currently struggling to get back on their feet.
