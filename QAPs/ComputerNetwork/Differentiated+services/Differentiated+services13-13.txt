â˜…What differentiated Infosys and Wipro from other IT service delivery companies that allowed them to scale their billions of revenues and 100,000s employees?most remaining below 500 employees.
Thanks for the A2A. For a MNC to scale big,they need the following things: 1.Good bench strength:IT companies hire more so that they have back up when employees leave/fall ill.Besides bench strength is an important criteria that helps to get client contracts. 2.Adapting to the latest technology 3.Giving employees world class training facilities 4.Using countries like India as a hub where they would get cheap resources 5.Good leaders And those IT giants have all these.
