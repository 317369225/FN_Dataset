★Are oDesk and Elance considered as SAAS?
Yes, I'd consider them a type of SaaS. They can be viewed with SaaS metrics in mind.  You can bet that they both keep a sharp eye on their LTV, CAC, churn rate and CAC:LTV ratio are.  They have an ARPU like any SaaS company. It helps to consider two sided marketplaces like these as not one, but two SaaS companies, each interdependent on the other.  They have a SaaS platform for freelancers to find work in, and a SaaS platform for companies to find freelancers in. Long story short:  Is it software? Yes. Is it provided as a service? Yes. Software as a Service.
