â˜…What differentiated Infosys and Wipro from other IT service delivery companies that allowed them to scale their billions of revenues and 100,000s employees?most remaining below 500 employees.
Firstly, you forgot TCS. TCS has more business than Infosys and Wipro. Now! Some of the things that got them where they are: Surprisingly low bids to get the projects: At the outset, these guys offered to do things for peanuts. Fortunately, what's peanuts for the people in the United States and Europe, is good enough in India. The outsourcing DNA: Everyone can cut down their prices, but the art of outsourcing is tough to crack. I have given business to a few service companies and I have done business for people in the service industry; it is hard to find talented people who can be aligned and deployed on a full-blown project. Leadership, and lots of perseverance: These companies had a lot of hard times, but they persevered and now they are the veterans in the industry. There were several other people along with Narayan Murthy, who used to pitch for IT projects. None of them because billion dollar business, but they too have a few hundreds of millions to deal with. Harvard-level graduates demanding a salary of an intern: India has extremely talented people who can do the work. Yes, we don't have lots of entrepreneurial sprint as it's in the US, but we have a lot of people who want to get as much education as they can and then work for someone for a decent pay that can buy him his car and house. Came first to the game: This would have contributed in a minor fashion, but it is advantageous to start as early as possible. Several other things like bench strength, government projects, and projects for their own subsidiary were responsible for their growth, but, these things came into the picture only after they were an established entity.
