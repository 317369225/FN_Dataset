â˜…Valuations: Is Groupon worth $5 billion more than Twitter?Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. recently valued Twitter Inc. at $10 billion dollars. That is a whopping $5 billion dollars less than the Groupon Initial Public Offering (IPO) filed earlier this year. Not just a couple bucks, but $5 billion dollars.
Remember that Value is very subjective. These words were very powerful for me: Value is an equilibrium. Half of everyone thinks it's worth less and half of everyone think it's worth more. The simple answer to your question is that it's worth whatever somebody is willing to pay, (price dictation by the market). Compounding this are underlying factors of: 1. Investors are uneducated and invest as a response to stimuli. 2. Tech companies have historically been difficult for humans to value(dotcom bubble anyone?) because they don't follow traditional patterns and have a lot of intangibles(IE. 50 Cent influencing his followers and making millions). 3. Big early-stage investors are incentivized to drive the value up more so they can profit. (you saw this in dotcom days as hiring sprees where having thousands of employees made your company more "valuable") 4. Current economy patterns at the time Historically, this is our second 'go-round' at valuing these sort of companies - and I should mention the heavy trend of much longer privately held companies and delayed IPOs. We will get better but it would be silly to think that we will nail the valuations of these companies this early on. 15 years ago the web was still very much the Wild West, and it's still that way now - we just won't realize it for a few years (Hindsight bias) -D
