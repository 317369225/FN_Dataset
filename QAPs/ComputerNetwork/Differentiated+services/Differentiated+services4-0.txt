★How could an advertising specialty company differentiate their products/services?
A company can make create its own trademark or signature kind of a service or product. Company like polpromo are always  spoken of, when any person discuss spooky pens. An advertising company can offer something out of the box, like we at Promodirect offer, FREE Artwork and Art Proof at Promodirect.com. Other such companies have weekly offers etc. Regards, Susan S www.promodirect,com
