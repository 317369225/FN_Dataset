â˜…Valuations: Is Groupon worth $5 billion more than Twitter?Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. recently valued Twitter Inc. at $10 billion dollars. That is a whopping $5 billion dollars less than the Groupon Initial Public Offering (IPO) filed earlier this year. Not just a couple bucks, but $5 billion dollars.
My worry for Groupon is how will they be able to maintain a differentiated service from copycats out there? Twitter was able to arise from a few similar microblogging services and fend off copycats well due to mainstream adoption and big journalism use. Can Groupon find a way to differentiate vs the Living Social's and the regional based copycats enough to keep this trajectory?
