â˜…Why should I pick Lyft instead of UberX (or vice versa)? Are the services basically a commodity or are they differentiated in some way?
They are relatively similar, but there are some key differences in the experience they deliver. Lyft's focus on community comes through in your rider experience. As a rider, you sit in the front passenger seat and you fist bump the driver. The ride is typically a lot more conversational and friendly, since you're sitting next to the driver. UberX has you sitting in the back seat, so it's a bit more service oriented. Drivers are often professional drivers (in my anecdotal experience) which can lead to them having better knowledge of the city. The drivers are friendly, but I'd say that Lyft's drivers seem like they're often part-timers doing it for fun/side income, rather than a FT job. I use UberX/Uber when I want to get somewhere quickly and/or quietly, like if I'm feeling anti-social. I use Lyft if I feel like being more social. Sidecar is similar to Lyft, except they don't do a fist bump. ---- Beyond all the driver stuff, I've found that Lyft can often be overwhelmed at certain times and they don't have any drivers available. It can be useful to check Sidecar during high demand times, since they seem to have drivers with others don't (and they're still cheap). UberX always has cars available (and a lot of them!), but you have to lookout for Surge Pricing if you're cost sensitive.
