â˜…How accurate are Google Maps time estimates for the subways in NYC versus hopstop?Google maps estimates seem to be consistently ~10min shorter than hopstop for the same door to door trips; which is more accurate?
My experience with Google maps all over the world is that if the directions involve any walking, you should automatically add 5 minutes of time for every 5-10 minutes of walking Google thinks you'll have to do (depending on how fast you walk, I have short legs so I double it). Apparently they think we're all 6'5'' Olympians. So, given that pretty much any subway trip in NYC is going to involve at least 5-10 mins of walking, I'd go with Hopstop.
