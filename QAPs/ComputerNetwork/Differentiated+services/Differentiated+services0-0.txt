★Would integrating personal telematics products with traditional group benefits packages / product help  to differentiate services? or enhance current capabilities?
Given that traditional telematics products are vehicle-centric, the addressable market for this would be limited to companies with a vehicle benefit for near-term implementation.  For those companies, there are existing, demonstrated benefit categories:  insurance, fuel costs, maintenance costs, etc.   The more interesting aspect of this question is "could there be a case made for application of telematics products to benefit programs that do not include a vehicle?"  From an insurance perspective, there would be little utility in a standalone application, but a couple of constraints could make it attractive:      1. The benefit insurance company has a direct or affiliate relationship with an insurance company that provides a PAYD or like insurance scheme.  Although this seems attractive, it is not pervasive enough to support a product in the current market.      2. The telematics product provides an intermediary, data brokerage aspect that could normalize data for an insurance benefit, based upon participation from an employee's insurance provider.  Again, this would require substantial uptake in the market before it could be viable. As is obvious, participation of insurance companies would be a prerequisite.  There are companies working on this now.  Cases could be made for other benefit categories, as well.
