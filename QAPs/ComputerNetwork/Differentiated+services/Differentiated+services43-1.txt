â˜…What are the differences between cloud service providers? What must a cloud provider do to differentiate himself?
Thanks for the post and for sharing the survey on iPaaS providers. I would like to suggest another platform to your list: my company develops an open source platform called Cloudify, which enables you to on-board and scale any app, on any cloud, with no code changes, while maintaining full visibility and control. We won several important awards in the cloud realm, including SD Times Top 100 for 2012 in the Cloud category, RED HERRING TOP 100 Europe selection and 20 COOLEST CLOUD VENDORS by CDN, so we mean business ;-) You can read more here: http://www.cloudifysource.org/ #gigaspaces #cloudify #paas #ipass
