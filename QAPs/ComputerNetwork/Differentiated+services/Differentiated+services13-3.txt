★What differentiated Infosys and Wipro from other IT service delivery companies that allowed them to scale their billions of revenues and 100,000s employees?most remaining below 500 employees.
As someone with an insider's perspective, I agree with much of what has been said in the answers below.  I think timing - being among the first to market with a business model whose time had just come - was the number 1 driver of success for companies like Infosys.  The Global Delivery Model (GDM), as Infosys called it, was innovative at the time, and it took vision and leadership to capitalize on what was essentially a labor arbitrage opportunity. (Side note: Infosys is the only company in the group that was not a legacy of the colonial era.  Wipro and Tata owe some of their success to ties to power at the dawn of the Indian republic.  Part of what made Infosys remarkable was the example of social mobility it provided in contrast to the caste system.) GDM has since been commoditized.  Managing spatially and temporally dispersed teams has become a norm of any business operating on anything larger than a local scale.  A more interesting question to ask is not, "How did Infosys and Wipro succeed?" but "What happened to their mojo?"  There is evidence other firms are putting pressure on margins while taking market share away from the dominant players of yesteryear.  See also: Cognizant.
