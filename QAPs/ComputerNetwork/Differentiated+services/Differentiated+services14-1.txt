â˜…What are the biggest challenges for incubator or accelerator programs like 500 Startups, Y Combinator, etc.?I'm interested in understanding the challenges that incubator programs face in continuing to grow. It seems as though there are more and more popping up each day and I'm curious about the challenges that they face. How big of an issue is deal flow for new applicants?
really like Casey's answer(s), however I'll also add a few items: * BRAND(-ING): what do you stand for, where do you intend to specialize? this is somewhat related to strategy, but regardless for both competitive and absolute reasons, it is useful to focus on some specific set of target demographic companies and differentiated services. * PROGRAMS & SERVICES: once you have determined brand & strategy, you will also need to consider what program curriculum, speakers, services, staff, and community resources you plan to offer. this could include specialization on engineering, design, marketing, business, recruiting, fundraising, etc. * DOWNSTREAM CAPITAL: after companies get accepted into an accelerator program and receive initial funding, the most important thing they need is likely additional funding as they complete the program. establishing good relationships with downstream angel, seed fund, and VC investors is essential, and building a track record of successful subsequent financings will be viewed critically by future founders who are considering entering such programs.
