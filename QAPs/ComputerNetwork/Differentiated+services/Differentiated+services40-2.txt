â˜…Is foursquare's new photo feature a way to differentiate themselves against other location-based services like Facebook Places and Gowalla, in direct competition to Path, or something else?
They added it because it was the most requested feature by their users. I wonder though, why would companies like Instagram and Foodspotting choose to share their photo data with Foursquare.
