â˜…What are the key differentiations of customer service in B2C companies and B2B companies?
The key difference is that in B2B customer service you need to acknowledge that not all customers are created equal. (Sorry.) B2C customer service generally carries a higher ticket volume, and the goal is to work through tickets as quickly as possible and maintain acceptable levels of customer happiness across the board. B2B customer service should consider other variables like the product line, pricing plan, account value, or renewal date for a customer. If you have customers using a free app and customers using a paid product, you'll likely prioritize the paying customers. Ditto for the customer whose $100K contract is up next month over the customer whose account manager told you their $5K contract is unlikely to renew. Yes, you want to make all your users/customers happy and provide great service across the board, but the expectations are also different in each of these customer segments. You can provide a great self-service experience through forums and active community engagement on your free app and have a dedicated help line and inbox for paying customers.
