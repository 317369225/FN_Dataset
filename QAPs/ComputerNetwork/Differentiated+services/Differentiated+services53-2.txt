â˜…What is the difference between a packet and a frame with reference to the OSI model?
At each layer of OSI model, data generated by Application layer is appended with some kind of header. So in Short, Packet refers to the unit of data that flows between network layer and, Framer refers to the unit of data that flows between Data Link Layer, similarly, unit of that that flows between Transport Layer is called a message, and at Physical layer everything is seen in form of bits. PS: At the time of writing this answer, no question details exist. So I assume this must be enough.
