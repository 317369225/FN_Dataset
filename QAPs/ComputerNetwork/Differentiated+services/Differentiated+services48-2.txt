â˜…How does the law differentiate between a legal denial (which is indiscriminate) to a business or service, and an illegal denial which is discriminatory?My understanding is, that you can deny access to your business in an indiscriminate manner without legal consequence. For example, banning Mr. White from your flower shop because you don't like him. Conversely, you can not discriminate on the basis of age, race, religion, sex, or nationality. How is this distinction usually made to give it a legal effect?
