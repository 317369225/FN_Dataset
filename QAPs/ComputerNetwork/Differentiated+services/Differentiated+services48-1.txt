★How does the law differentiate between a legal denial (which is indiscriminate) to a business or service, and an illegal denial which is discriminatory?My understanding is, that you can deny access to your business in an indiscriminate manner without legal consequence. For example, banning Mr. White from your flower shop because you don't like him. Conversely, you can not discriminate on the basis of age, race, religion, sex, or nationality. How is this distinction usually made to give it a legal effect?
You can choose not to do business with Mr. White for a range of reasons, but you cannot deny goods and services to everyone who shares certain characteristics (age, sex, gender identity, race, creed, heritage, ethnicity) with Mr. White, which are materially irrelevant to the goods and services offered to the general public.   Whether a wedding cake has two figures of males, or two figures of females, or figures of a male and a female, and is inscribed with "Micheal and George", "Michelle and Georgette" or "Michelle and George" is materially irrelevant to whether it is a cake. Hope that clears things up for you.
