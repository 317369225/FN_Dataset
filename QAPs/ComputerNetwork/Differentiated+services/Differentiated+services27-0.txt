â˜…What differentiates the Shinkansen (in Japan) from other high speed rail services around the world?
As the first high speed railway in the world, Shinkansen is the definitely pioneer of this new transportation model. It shows how this could possibly work. Also as far as I know, Shinkansen is probably till now still the safest in the world.
