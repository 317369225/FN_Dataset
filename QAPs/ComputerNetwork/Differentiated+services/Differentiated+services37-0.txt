â˜…How do the major banks differentiate themselves in the commercial banking services offered to small businesses in Silicon Valley?
If you're referring to very large banks such as Wells or BofA, the main differentiating points are going to be: - Big balance sheet, therefore real or perceived stability - Vast Product set, that'll ensure Company never outgrows the bank - Presence in nearly every city, making things like deposits, etc. very easy. If you're more referring to banks focused on Early Stage companies in the tech/life sector like SVB, Square 1, and Comerica, the point of differentiation is rich domain expertise, ability to be nimble, and dedicated service teams.
