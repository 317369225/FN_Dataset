★Why don't smartphones use real-time differential GPS and ground-based transceiver networks for location services?Is the technology to expensive and not worth the trouble?  Are satellite and assisted solutions just 'good enough.'   Are there laws prohibiting consumer use of signals from ground based stations?  Seems like many places have these networks but only professional surveyors use them.

I think it comes down to cost. The US Coast Guard operates a free land based differential GPS system that covers 92% land area (and all of the coastal regions) of the US with accuracy typically under 1 meter. However, as I mentioned, the cost of a DGPS receiver is much higher than a GPS receiver. Probably because DGPS chips never scaled up to achieve economy of scale like GPS chips did.
