â˜…Wealthfront, Marketriders and Betterment are all interesting to me but I really don't understand the key differentiators among these services. Any thoughts?Wealthfront, Marketriders, Betterment, investing, stock market, ETF, ETF investing
Thank you Anon - You have pointed out something really important. If they are similar when it comes to asset allocation why I would pay ongoing management fees to Wealthfront or Betterment if I can get similar service from Marketriders at a yearly fixed cost.I see your point re: target ETF baskets but I'd be more comfortable having a control and participation in the ETF selection process that these companies offer.
