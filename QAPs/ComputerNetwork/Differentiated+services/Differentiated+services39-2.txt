★What are some good ways to differentiate pricing of a service in order to make it affordable to less well-off clients?I don't want to make less well-off clients embarrassed or to add needless perks to bump up the price for those with more money - I want to provide an honest service that benefits as many people as possible. In case it helps, the service is repairing computers - something that can be very helpful for people who are applying for jobs, for example. Thank you!
You have a real problem.  Nobody wants shoddy repairs.    You can give "discounts" for special groups: say students,  the young, the old, the retired, anybody that shows up in pyjamas, anybody with white socks, anything.
