â˜…Is foursquare's new photo feature a way to differentiate themselves against other location-based services like Facebook Places and Gowalla, in direct competition to Path, or something else?
No. As they state on their blog, it's just a feature that was requested most by their users. I believe Foursquare will come up with new, not so obvious features in the future.
