â˜…Valuations: Is Groupon worth $5 billion more than Twitter?Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. recently valued Twitter Inc. at $10 billion dollars. That is a whopping $5 billion dollars less than the Groupon Initial Public Offering (IPO) filed earlier this year. Not just a couple bucks, but $5 billion dollars.
If you are looking on the basis of cash flows alone (+ growth in cash flows), absolutely. Groupon ~800mm in net profit, vs Twitter 100mm (revenue / top line, not sure what twitter's "net" margins are)
