â˜…Does Facebook advertising make sense for professional services firms?I am hearing a lot of interesting chatter but not a lot of data to support.
I've experimented with Facebook advertising for my B2B marketing consulting practice--mainly to test it out to see whether I'd recommend to clients. The PPC ads are cheap, which is good, but, no surprise, as always, the key is having an interesting, differentiated service or expertise--or interesting content.
