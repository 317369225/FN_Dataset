★URL Scheduler Service out there?
SiteUptime (http://www.siteuptime.com/) has been around forever. I had their free service a while back and it worked more or less as advertised. I haven't been getting their emails lately, but that's not too bad for a free account I got about five years ago and never did anything to maintain. I can't say I've had anything but a neutral experience with them, but I thought I'd jump in to keep this alive.
