★What is a Postback URL?
It's just a URL that directs to your tracking server and you get the base postback URL from the platform tracking your ads. You can add parameters to the postback URL that look something like this "&subid2=X" and the X value might be a unique identifier or the name of the app in which your ad was running when the click occurred that resulted in the conversion. You can layer them on fairly deep to get more and more info if necessary. The parameters can be used to convey various bits of info though, determined by your needs, which is probably where some confusion comes in.    Embed Quote
