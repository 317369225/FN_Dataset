★Does a vanity URL shortener improve SEO?For instance, Bit.ly Pro. http://bit.ly/pro/ This is a follow-up question to Does a URL shortener impact SEO?.
URL shorteners play into SEO in three following ways: 1. Users tend to share pretty urls more than long, cryptic urls. I've seen the data first hand from sites I've worked on and know other SEO's that have seen similar results. With that said you should consider a shortened URL a user friendly way of encouraging them to share links across the web. And getting external links is core to SEO. Check out Zappos product pages for example: http://www.zappos.com/tommy-baha... Scroll Below the product image you'll notice a box with a zapp.me tiny url. That is Zappos' way of encouraging people to link to their product pages via easily shared, shortened urls. 2. Make sure that the shorteners use 301 redirects since 301s pass PageRank. Some shorteners make the mistake of using 302 redirects (which don't flow PageRank). 3. One problem with shorteners though is it can obfuscate your referrer traffic. If shortened links use 301 redirects, a client browser would retain the original referrer site in the referrer header; ie you may have misattribution of visits from shortened links. Look around for services that track shortened urls if you'll be using them heavily so that you have usage statistics on them. Tools like bit.ly are pretty well known amongst avid Twitter users who want to track tiny URL usage.    Embed Quote
