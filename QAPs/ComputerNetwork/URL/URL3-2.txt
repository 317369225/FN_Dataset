★Is there a short URL for DuckDuckGo?It would be nice if there was a shorter URL, like http://ddg.com.
As answered by Jordan Kanarek's answer , use Page on Ddg http://ddg.gg - using this URL will redirect to https://duckduckgo.com. You can use it as a shorthand for a query. For example, http://ddg.gg/?q=quora will redirect to https://duckduckgo.com/?q=quora https://duck.co/ - is the DuckDuckGo Community. However, using https://i.duck.co/ - will redirect to https://duckduckgo.com https://dukgo.com - is the DuckDuckGo Community Platform, or the developers' area, if you will (Originally answered by Jonathan Melton's answer)    Embed Quote
