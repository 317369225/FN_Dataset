★Are long URLs bad for SEO?Quora uses very nice and very readable urls for its question pages.  Does the length of the URLs do more harm to SEO than the benefit gained by including good content in the URL?
I huge problem with URL's  and it isn't them, it's people over-complicating the process. I only have 3 basic rules. 1. Make it as long as it has to be in order to have a unique URL for your site and no longer, 2. Give it a keyword(s) and make sure it makes sense with the page it navigates you too. 3. Not a rule a wish. It would be great to make it so easy and simple that a visitor can actually remember it and type it in manually. It's unlikely that will happen, but that's what you should shoot for.    Embed Quote
