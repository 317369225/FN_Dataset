★Why does Quora expose my plaintext password as an URL variable?
Like Saurabh Bhambry, I'm not able to reproduce. However, since I was curious, I dug a little deeper... The form does submit as a POST, so the values should never appear in your browser the way they do in your screenshot. <form class="inline_login_form" method="POST" id="__w2_Dksafms_login_form"> The value in the id field changed each time I requested the page. I notice that you don't just have name, email and password in your url... you actually have email and password twice, followed by "allow_pass" which looks like the allow_passwordless checkbox. I can't explain how it happened, but it looks like something took every variation of the form and submitted them all as a GET instead of a POST. That would explain why some of them are filled in, and others are blank. EDIT: Looks like there was an ancient chrome bug where forms with a target of a new tab would try to submit as a POST, reset, then submit as a GET. But that was fixed about 20 versions ago. So, like Saurabh Bhambry said, maybe try disabling your extensions and see if you can reproduce it. I'm curious to know what it was.    Embed Quote
