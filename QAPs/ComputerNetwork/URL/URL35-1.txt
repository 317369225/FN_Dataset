★How useful are URLs in Offline Media?Are URLs redundant when sharing websites? Are we better off advertising Google search terms on a movie poster and QR codes in a catalogue? Any studies which show how people respond to URLs or at least how they are used?
I used to just use URL's, I use DuckDuckGo now so I use !bang commands to search other sites. I use !techcrunch to go on techcrunch or !Amazon (company) keyword, to search amazon. I tend to use a mix of !bang, tweets and sites like reddit/hackernews to get the rest of my content.    Embed Quote
