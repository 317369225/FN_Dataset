★How useful are URLs in Offline Media?Are URLs redundant when sharing websites? Are we better off advertising Google search terms on a movie poster and QR codes in a catalogue? Any studies which show how people respond to URLs or at least how they are used?
URLs can be very valuable in offline media. Custom URLs, one for each media/medium, can provide a great deal of marketing information. Take your example of a movie poster... use www.movie.com/poster. For a newspaper ad, use www.movie.com/newspaper_name. Same format for magazine, radio, OOH, TV, etc. Then, monitor...and manage the campaigns according to your success metrics. You can have post-click information re: what portions of the site are working for visitors of each media. This can be crucial for this, and future, campaigns.    Embed Quote
