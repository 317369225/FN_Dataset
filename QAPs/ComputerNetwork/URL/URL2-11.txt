★What is the best URL shortener?
I used http://YOURLS.org to grow my own for fun (http://VT802.us). That's not a recommendation as much as a fun fact ;) That said, I prefer Bitly pro. Pro lets you have you own domain but uses the http://bit.ly platofrm on the back end. I believe the NY Times actually uses the enterprise version of pro. For the cost of a domain (the http://bit.ly part is free), having your own vanity shortner is pretty cool. -- Added -- At the risk of getting a slight bit off topic, I just published a blog post on URL shortening as it relates to measuring online marketing. I'm not a spammer. I do believe this has relevance here. http://www.alchemyunited.com/201...    Embed Quote
