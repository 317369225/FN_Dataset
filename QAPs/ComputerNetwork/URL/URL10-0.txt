★Is using @ (at) in URL a good idea?For example Medium (company/website) use it for user profiles (eg.https://medium.com/@fat).
According to the RFC spec (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt) in section 2.2, "@" is a reserved character alongside; ";", "/", "?", ":", "&" the spec states: The "reserved" syntax class above refers to those characters that are allowed within a URI, but which may not be allowed within a particular component of the generic URI syntax; they are used as delimiters of the components described in Section 3. Technically the use of "@" is allowed within the URL, but only in particular circumstances. The way Medium use "@" in the URL is fine because they're not appending parameters or query strings to the URL.    Embed Quote
