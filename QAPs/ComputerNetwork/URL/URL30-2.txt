★Is the URL shortener category basically dead by now (late 2014)?
It depends on the use cases as suggested by Sam. For  example: Consider a company running a marketing campaign and it wishes  to reach out to maximum users. Of course mobile platform will be  considered in such scenario. Therefore promotional SMS, which can  contain information about the product along with a few links too, will  be sent to those users. Since cost of bulk SMSs' is based on its  quantity and size, URL shortner will be very cost effective. With the rising e-commerce market such use cases will last beyond 2014. After all everyone wants to save a penny where ever one can.    Embed Quote
