★What is a URL?
URL stands for uniform resource locator. It isn't really an address, because an IP address is an address. A URL is more like a business name, maybe a location or person inside that business, and a method of communication. Like "call://tacobell/manager". Except a URL is a way to find files (including webpages) instead of people. The part before the :// is the protocol. For the web, that's usually http or https. Sometimes it is omitted in browser address bars because most users don't really need to know. The part after the :// is the domain name or IP address. If you put in an IP address (e.g. 182.221.2.67), it will go directly to that computer. If you put in a domain name (e.g. www.tacobell.com), it will go to a DNS (domain name service), which will replace that part of the URL with the IP address of the web server that hosts the tacobell website, so that it can be found. The reason behind this is because IP addresses can change easily and they're not easy to remember anyway. The parts after the domain name is a path to a location on that web server. For example, on Quora, the URL of this answer is "http://www.quora.com/What-exactly-is-a-URL". What-exactly-is-a-URL is a directory on the Quora web server that contains this particular page. Sometimes at the end of the URL you will see "#something" like on wikipedia links: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier#Basics. This refers to a named location (in the html code) on the page to scroll to after loading. URLs can also be used to refer to resources on your own computer or network. If you're on Windows, you might be able to put "file:///C:/" into your browser and it will show you what's in your C: drive. (For completeness, I should mention a URL can also contain a port number [e.g. www.tacobell.com:80], but you probably don't need to worry about that. It defaults to 80 for web).    Embed Quote
