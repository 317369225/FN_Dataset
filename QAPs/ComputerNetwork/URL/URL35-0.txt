★How useful are URLs in Offline Media?Are URLs redundant when sharing websites? Are we better off advertising Google search terms on a movie poster and QR codes in a catalogue? Any studies which show how people respond to URLs or at least how they are used?
Yes, the Internet still uses URLs As for if you should advertise your URL I would say yes, for the sake of control. You have far more control over what your URL is than how high you appear in the audiences search engine of choice. Think of all those products and movies advertised with AOL keywords.  Look at the example of M&S buying the top awards on google search results for the term "interflora" to snipe customers for example.    Embed Quote
