★Are subfolders in URL relevant for SEO purposes?Are subfolders in URL (www.example.com/directory/title-of-content) relevant for SEO purposes (compared to www.example.com/title-of-content)? What's the maximum URL length recommended?

So that's an argument some use to stay away from using subfoldera. However Meghan said it real good by showing what google would recommend also Ian said something very impotant and he mentioned site architecture, it's SEO best practice to include subfolders in your URL. It helps google understand your site structure and what your site really is about.  The more google understands your website, the better chances you have for ranking for keywords you have choosen to optimize for.    Embed Quote
