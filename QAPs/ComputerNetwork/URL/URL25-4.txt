★Are subfolders in URL relevant for SEO purposes?Are subfolders in URL (www.example.com/directory/title-of-content) relevant for SEO purposes (compared to www.example.com/title-of-content)? What's the maximum URL length recommended?
The answer is an emphatic YES!  It's not just about subfolders but your entire namespace (URL including FQDN).  To simplify what others are saying here, look at it this way: search engines are giving more weight to things that show commitment and authority/focus. If your domain has particularly keywords AND the in-line content aligns AND the organic traffic tends to spend more time on target page given related keywords..  Then you have achieved a great SEO balance. Someone mentioned proximity and that is very true: proximity of keywords always applies...  But you can always use a URL shortening service, domain masking, or redirection on that end.  Still, it's better to own the domain that is optimized for search engines and human audiences alike.
