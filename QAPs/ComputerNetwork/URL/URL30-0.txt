★Is the URL shortener category basically dead by now (late 2014)?
It depends on the use-case but I still find URL shorteners to be quite handy. Many URLs are very long and not easily shared, or just plain ugly, so a URL shortener helps solve those problems. For instance, sharing an Amazon URL (especially an affiliate link), creates a URL that is ~200 characters in length. Sharing a shortened URL makes the link much easier to share with friends, customers, etc. For a business's use the URL shortener is still useful in tracking clicks and geographic information, especially for URLs to sites that I may not have access to or do not own. It's still very useful for me to know how many people clicked an iTunes download link, a news article link, etc. Has the technology been commodified as companies and services integrate it into their products? Sure, but having shortened URLs is still very useful regardless of if the tech is as sexy and exciting as it was in ~2008.    Embed Quote
