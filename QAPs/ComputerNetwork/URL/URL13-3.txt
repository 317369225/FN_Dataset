★Does a URL shortener impact SEO?Assume that the URL shortener persists (is always up) and never goes out of business...
I just ran across a really interesting URL shortener, http://drunkenmenworkhere.com. I used to go to this site as they had a really interesting game called media mammon where words used on the internet were treated like stocks that you could buy and trade. Anyway, it appears that they are venturing into a new idea with their URL shortener. I took a domain name for a site I own (http://goodchristmasideas.com) and I shortened it. The shortened URL was: http://⇨⥘.⇒.ws Now, I find this really awesome as far as URL aesthetics go, although it is not very practical, but do you think this style of URL can pass an SEO juice.    Embed Quote
