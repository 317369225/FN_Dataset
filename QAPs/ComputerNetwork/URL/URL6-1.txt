★Does Quora have a URL shortener?This is a follow-up question to Which URL shortener should I use?.
The questions you add are not shortened by default. So the link to your question for example is Does Quora have a URL shortener? - The entire question with words separated by dashes. This could definitely change in my opinion as questions do not have a character limit and long URLs do not work well in mobile environments. I tried browsing quora on Safari and was greeted with an error popup (in spite of the page opening successfully) every time. IE has a limit on URL size too. Is anyone at Quora listening? :)    Embed Quote
