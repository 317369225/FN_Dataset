★How does a URL-shortener work?
There're number of opensource API's available today that makes our job easy. But I like taking leverage of Apache Hbase. I will try to explain how it works. We can use hashmap kind of mechanism. Here Hbase can be powerful, In row we can have original URL and in the columnar family we can add each page index separated by delimiters and assign them to any short form. Like for ex : https://apple.com/iphone/itunes/... Save it as A = iPhone, B=iTunes and C=apps. It is independent to each and every columnar family. Whenever a user requests to shorten url, it takes that url and index it linearly and break into as above and store in columnar family. This is one of many ideas and it worked for me :) ... Designations like A,B could be custom.    Embed Quote
