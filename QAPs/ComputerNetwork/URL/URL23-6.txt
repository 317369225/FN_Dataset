★Do users pay attention to and interact with URL paths?Technical users appear to, but how much benefit is gained for regular users by having a well-crafted hierarchy of clean URLs for your website? Specifically, this is referring to the URL path - not the domain.
Another thing to consider is that when an internal page is returned in the SERPs you see the URL below the snippet; so a well formed URL may encourage people to click on your result - you would have keywords in the search phrase which are present in the URL highlighted (e.g. www.domain.com/category/keyword rather than www.domain.com/index.php?id=4834)    Embed Quote
