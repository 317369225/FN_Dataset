★How useful are URLs in Offline Media?Are URLs redundant when sharing websites? Are we better off advertising Google search terms on a movie poster and QR codes in a catalogue? Any studies which show how people respond to URLs or at least how they are used?
Not sure how using google search terms would be effective. How would you differentiate between competitors. Asking what's the value of a domain name is like asking what's the value of your business name.  Most online businesses actually name their company the same as their domain name, not the other way around. So the two are directly linked. Easier to think of domains as brands, rather than as navigational methods to get to an individual website.    Embed Quote
