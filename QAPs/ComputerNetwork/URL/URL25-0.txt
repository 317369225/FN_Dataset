★Are subfolders in URL relevant for SEO purposes?Are subfolders in URL (www.example.com/directory/title-of-content) relevant for SEO purposes (compared to www.example.com/title-of-content)? What's the maximum URL length recommended?
Yes - see page 8 of this SEO guide from Google: http://static.googleusercontent.... "Creating descriptive categories and filenames for the documents on your website can not only help you keep your site better organized,  but it could also lead to better crawling of your documents by  search engines. Also, it can create easier, "friendlier" URLs for those  that want to link to your content. Visitors may be intimidated by  extremely long and cryptic URLs that contain few recognizable words."    Embed Quote
