★How useful are URLs in Offline Media?Are URLs redundant when sharing websites? Are we better off advertising Google search terms on a movie poster and QR codes in a catalogue? Any studies which show how people respond to URLs or at least how they are used?
You used to hear "AOL Keyword xxx" or "Find xxx on MySpace" on Radio/TV commercials and in print. Now it is "Like xxx on Facebook" or "Follow xxx on Twitter". URLs will also stay around.    Embed Quote
