★What are SEO-friendly URLs, and why are they used?
Is there such a thing anymore? It used to be that a URL that described your business or your niche were optimal. But with all the recent changes, it's more important to stress your brand. I'd keep the URL as short as possible, without hyphens or other punctuation. Make sure that people can remember it and type it into the address bar easily and you're all set.    Embed Quote
