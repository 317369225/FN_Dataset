★What's the best way to track tweets of URLs?
'Tracking' is kind of a broad definition. If things like #mentions #impressions (accumulated followers) demographics (locations, skills, gender, sentiment) top tweets (most retweeted) top people (most impressions generated) is what you're looking for, I'd suggest you try twtrland (disclaimer, work there). For example, I've included a screenshot of tracking for "http://quora.com" which includes also shortened tweets mentioning this url, here tis a basic week-view of the overview section You can easily see it's been quite popular in United States and India, and in the Marketing, Developers and Entrepreneur communities.    Embed Quote
