★Are Google URL shorteners banned on Facebook?Today I tried to add a link via the URL shortener and Facebook showed me a spam notice. Has Facebook really banned Google URL shortener?
No. The URL might have been banned because of the exact link it has. Were you trying to posting a Goo.gl link for some referral program or to a Non Secure website.    Embed Quote
