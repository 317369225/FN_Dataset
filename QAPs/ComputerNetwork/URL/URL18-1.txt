★What is a Postback URL?
William Cleere it depends who you are and what you want to achieve. If you are a traffic source, and someone is willing to buy traffic from you, then: You want to dynamically inject values such as device ids, publisher ids, placement ids, or other ids related to your inventory and your users. For instance, Adwords would forward the bundle ids of the apps that would have generated installs. In its logs, the advertiser and the tracking tool would then be able to find this data for conversion attribution purposes. If you are an advertiser, and you're willing to buy inventory then: You just have to ensure the traffic source you're working with forwards your tracking tool all the ids it needs. If they don't, well, ask them to change their click macros and integration with the tracking tool you use accordingly, or work with someone else. From a pure affiliate viewpoint, it works the same. Affiliate platforms need to forward a bunch of IDs for each click so that when there is a conversion, they can credit the right affiliate and charge the advertiser accordingly. For instance, you are affiliate 123 from NetworkX, the postback URL might look like: https://networkx.com?conversion={bool}&publisherId={pubId}&offerId={offerId}&deviceId={deviceId} The tracking SDK will then dynamically replace the {} placeholders: https://networkx.com?conversion=true&publisherId=123&offerId=456&deviceId=chkj39839h This URL is going to be fired by the SDK responsible for the conversion tracking (sitting in the advertiser's app), and as you can see it will inform networkX that there was a conversion, generated by the publisher with Id 123, for the offerId 456 and that the conversion was generated by the user device with Id chkj39839h.    Embed Quote
