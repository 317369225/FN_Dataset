★Do users pay attention to and interact with URL paths?Technical users appear to, but how much benefit is gained for regular users by having a well-crafted hierarchy of clean URLs for your website? Specifically, this is referring to the URL path - not the domain.
When developing www.peekyou.com, we carefully thought out the URL structure of the site. Our goal was really to help out with SEO, but from a user's perspective, it also allows people to conduct searches without ever having to type in a query in a search box. For any given search (www.peekyou.com/firstname_lastname) the user can simply change the inputs in the URL, and get a search result back. I think that kind of usability is important for users who are doing lots of searches (or variations of their initial query).    Embed Quote
