★Do users pay attention to and interact with URL paths?Technical users appear to, but how much benefit is gained for regular users by having a well-crafted hierarchy of clean URLs for your website? Specifically, this is referring to the URL path - not the domain.
Users do not pay attention to the URLs, thats true. But then they even do not like some random, long and tedious URL to copy/paste around. For eg: http://www.facebook.com/profile.... is a nice url or just, http://www.facebook.com/smallurl you yourself can see the difference, and these days, users too see this a lot, because of these social networks, every one is sharing their profile links with friends, to gain followers and Likes, and they all are opting for usernames on Facebook. I am sure you too must be having a username on FB, so why you shifted, from the old URL to new, just to make it simpler. So your question turns out to be a bit ambiguous. I think, non techy users too considers URLs, but it doesn't affect them if its a difficult one. I mean to say, that, they prefer a smaller URL. Though my girlfriends has never even noticed URL, but still i think she will some day. And its very simple to rewrite URL, using a very simple .htaccess file you can do that for your website too. Search for tutorials around the web, you will find it. Best of luck.    Embed Quote
