★Why do some websites have a "#!" in their URL?Lately I've noticed with the redesign of Twitter that there is a /#!/ right after the domain once logged in. I've also seen this implemented on www.hypem.com now. I've been doing a little Googling, and I think this may relate to Python.
This is done so that content retrieved by AJAX requests is exposed to indexing by Google. Normally the request and content would be hidden from a bot basically because there's no static URL where the content lives, so Google came up with a standard for how to do it. See: Making AJAX Applications Crawlable (http://code.google.com/web/ajaxc...) Edit: For bonus points I thought I'd include that, at least in a UNIX or shell scripting context, "#!" is often called a shebang, or hashbang. I prefer the former because it sounds funnier.    Embed Quote
