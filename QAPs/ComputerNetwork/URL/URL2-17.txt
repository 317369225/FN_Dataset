★What is the best URL shortener?
I personally prefer http://is.gd but I seem to come across a new one weekly if not daily.  I just came across nonl.es yesterday and today stumbled upon Google's https://www.google.com/accounts/....  My go to still remains http://is.gd though.  I prefer http://is.gd because of the fact that it has never produced a non-working link for me as ht.ly has as well as the fact that, "Is Good," simply has a nice ring to it.    Embed Quote
