★Does a URL shortener impact SEO?Assume that the URL shortener persists (is always up) and never goes out of business...
Search engines are pretty bright. They want to distribute link juice correctly. After all, they invented the concept to help them give better search results. Short Answer: Using any of the popular URL shorteners to send people directly to the page will not hurt your rankings. Long (and technical) Answer: The most common way to implement a URL shortener is to issue a HTTP redirect when someone goes to the shortened URL. There are several types of HTTP redirects, but only the 301 "Moved Permanently" redirect passes link juice. Other HTTP redirects do NOT pass link juice and should be avoided. If you are using a very popular link shortener such as http://bit.ly, https://www.google.com/accounts/..., or http://is.gd then you can be confident this is done correctly or that the search engines will work around any incorrect implementations and treat it as a direct link. One other factor to consider is avoiding multiple redirects, not only is this slow and annoying to the user, but search engines stop after following the first redirect. So be sure to avoid using a URL shortener to send somebody to a page on your site that also forwards them on.    Embed Quote
