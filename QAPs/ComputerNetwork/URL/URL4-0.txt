★Are long URLs bad for SEO?Quora uses very nice and very readable urls for its question pages.  Does the length of the URLs do more harm to SEO than the benefit gained by including good content in the URL?
We've done a bunch of analysis on this and shorter URLs are certainly more correlated with higher rankings. In our rank modeling, it appears to be a small input, but things like dynamic strings (the use of the ? character) appears to be surprisingly negative. My advice would be to worry less about length and more about making them static, using keywords intelligently (but not in a spammy fashion) and ensuring that they're also usable and sharable.    Embed Quote
