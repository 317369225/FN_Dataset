★What's the best way to track tweets of URLs?
Are you looking for all mentions or mentions by particular users? I can think of different, albeit clunky, ways in either case.  FYI - bit.ly has some new features that are great, and if you are looking for "reach", Tweetreach is a simple, free app that allows you to calc "reach".    Embed Quote
