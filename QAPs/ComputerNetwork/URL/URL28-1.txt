★Does a vanity URL shortener improve SEO?For instance, Bit.ly Pro. http://bit.ly/pro/ This is a follow-up question to Does a URL shortener impact SEO?.
I haven't seen any specific study to suggest that there's a particular SEO value to having your own shortener, but there are some reasons to consider it. First, more than anything else, you want a shortener that does a 301 redirect, as covered by Andy Johns. That ensures that credit will flow to you for SEO purposes. Next, having your own shortener helps ensure that if a third-party company crashes, you at least have the ability to save all those links by taking over the service yourself. That's still a massive job, and you might find it hard to easily track down and recreate all the URLs. But, at least you have a chance. Beyond that, I do think there's some brand value/trust that develops when you run your own URL -- which in turn might get more people to decide to tweet a URL, which in turn generates some SEO benefits. Finally, a service like http://Bit.ly Pro can nicely convert shortened URLs to your own brand, which I think further generates some trust.
