★What are SEO-friendly URLs, and why are they used?
One way that search engines pick results is to look at relevant information on a page. So if you search for London then a website with London in the domain name or page title should all things being equal place higher then one without. In a website address the bit after the domain name used to mainly refer to file names and people might call their contact page contact-us.html. As content management systems came into place they often used an numerical ID to pull out the exact content and the file name would only refer to the script which looked up the database so a lot of URL's would look like whatever.com/whatever.php?id=1234 - from a programming point of view it's a little more efficient. As it became apparent that having relevant keywords within the website address people went back to using text based URI's. There might still be an ID in there which is actually used to look up the data and the extra text is often there only for SEO purposes. Content management systems often come with the facility built in as standard now rather then being a special plugin.    Embed Quote
