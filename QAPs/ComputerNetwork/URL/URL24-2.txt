★Are Google URL shorteners banned on Facebook?Today I tried to add a link via the URL shortener and Facebook showed me a spam notice. Has Facebook really banned Google URL shortener?
I have been facing the same problem for a few weeks now! Facebook practically doesn't accept urls from Google's URL Shortener service (Redirecting) while it does accept the exact same URL if shortened using other similar services such as Bitly (bitly | ♥ your bitmarks). Although I see other people posting URLs shortend by Google URL shortener every day! Facebook seems to have different limitations for different people and pages and there seems to be no explanation out there as to why!    Embed Quote
