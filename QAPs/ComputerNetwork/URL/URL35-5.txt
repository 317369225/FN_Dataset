★How useful are URLs in Offline Media?Are URLs redundant when sharing websites? Are we better off advertising Google search terms on a movie poster and QR codes in a catalogue? Any studies which show how people respond to URLs or at least how they are used?
Not sure if this a 'US' only subject but coming from Europe, I would say URL's are definately not dead. And while 'Like xxx on Facebook' or Twitter is slowly gaining ground over here, I would definately not suggest (international) clients to focus marketing on Google keywords. Google UK gives different results then Google US or Google NL. An average 'noob' will use Google however to find the website for Facebook instead of typing the correct URL, but anyone with a bit of computer knowledge will understand and use URL's.   Until the web-url's evolve into the next step, from a corporate standpoint I would suggest using URL's as the base, if you've done your SEO right, Google will help and if you've got a good campaign going socialmedia will pick up on it.    Embed Quote
