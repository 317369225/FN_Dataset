★How does a URL-shortener work?
A url shortener is just a proxy. A proxy receives a request for a given url --www.myproxy.com/?PROXY=www.somesite.com/some/really/interesting/thing/lives/here/and/is/really/really/really/interesting.html And returns a redirect to that url. Now to be a url shortener, it also does 2 things that reduce the total length of that url from a users perspective: 1. Have a short host name eg go.gl instead of www.myproxy.com saves you 9 characters 2. Requests come in as either a counter or a message digest of the url. The simplest url shortener would just keep a database of urls and have a the publicly visible shortened url be the table index. So the first person to submit a url gets xx.xx/1, the second gets /2, etc. The handler for the server looks up the request string which is just an index into the url tables. bingo, you have a shortener.    Embed Quote
