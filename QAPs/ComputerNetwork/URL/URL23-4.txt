★Do users pay attention to and interact with URL paths?Technical users appear to, but how much benefit is gained for regular users by having a well-crafted hierarchy of clean URLs for your website? Specifically, this is referring to the URL path - not the domain.
I think the way the question has been framed is attracting techies. We love phrases like "URL paths" & can talk about them, their importance for SEO, directory structures, etc for days together. If the question is rephrased to "Webpage address" or something similar, we might get some meaningful insights. As per my experience, a normal web user does not even know the difference between a URL & a URL path :)    Embed Quote
