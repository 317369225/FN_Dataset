★What is a URL?Where do I find it?
URL (Uniform Resource Locator, previously Universal Resource Locator)   is usually pronounced by sounding out each letter but, in some quarters, pronounced "Earl" - is the unique address for a file that is accessible on the Internet. A common way to get to a Web site is to enter the URL of its home page file in your Web browser's address line. However, any file within that Web site can also be specified with a URL. Such a file might be any Web (HTML) page other than the home page, an image file, or a program such as a CGI (common gateway interface interface) application or Java applet.  The URL contains the name of the protocol to be used to access the file resource, a domain name that identifies a specific computer on the Internet, and a pathnamepath, a hierarchical description that specifies the location of a file in that computer.
