★Does URLs with UTM parameter crawled as different URLs?Let's say if I have an URL domain.com/my-first-post/ and have some UTM tracking lets say domain.com/my-first-post/?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=first-post Does Search Engines crawl these two pages as different URLs and treat as duplicate pages. If yes then how to avoid it
The answer is most definitely "Yes, both pages will be crawled and it will be counted as duplicate content." The best remedy here is to turn on URL Parameter handling in Webmaster tools, and select "No, does not change page content/ Do not crawl" for the UTM parameters.  Adding a Canonical tag will not help; the canonical tag tells Google which version of a group of similar pages should be returned in the search results. This DOES NOT remove the page from the index. If the page(s) are still in the index, then they are still seen as duplicate content.    Embed Quote
