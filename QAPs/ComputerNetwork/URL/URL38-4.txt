★What are SEO-friendly URLs, and why are they used?
One thing that comprises SEO friendly url is that it should not be dynamic with parameters appended to it. For example if you have a url asdfdsfsdf.com?a=val1&b=val2 you can change it to something like this: asdfdsfsdf.com/val1/val2 or asdfdsfsdf.com/val1:val2 Also, your url should include the keywords about the content of the page. For example, a blog post about places to visit in a city could be something like: asdfdsfsdf.com/places-to-visit in-delhi.html   This can affect the order of your page in search results if the searched keyword appears in the url itself. The various keywords can be separated by hyphen. Finally it's good to end your url with .html. Search crawlers love .html extension.    Embed Quote
