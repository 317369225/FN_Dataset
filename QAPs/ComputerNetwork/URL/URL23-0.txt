★Do users pay attention to and interact with URL paths?Technical users appear to, but how much benefit is gained for regular users by having a well-crafted hierarchy of clean URLs for your website? Specifically, this is referring to the URL path - not the domain.
If users are employing the website regularly - especially if it is in some mundane manner, that they are obliged to perform, such as completing tasks as part of their day job - and the site uses the url to determine (in some clear and readable way) whereabouts they are in the performance of a given task, then yes: those users will begin hacking the url to jump from one task to another and they will share this information with their colleagues. If you haven't built with this eventuality in mind, then this can end up seriously messing with the assumptions of the original program. If you have, then accept it, and try monitoring what paths they regularly jump between, (users are often so focussed on the performance of the actual task, that they won't be able to identify to you that they do this, if you just ask them about it). Then attempt to provide them with links, to get the same tasks done.    Embed Quote
