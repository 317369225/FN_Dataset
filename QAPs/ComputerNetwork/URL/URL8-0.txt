★What is the shortest URL shortener?
Most might think Twitter's shortener since it is http://t.co. However, following that, the actual address is seven character so the total number of characters is 19. Any person can purchase a three-letter domain with two-letter country code then use the free Yourls.org application. With this, you can create a single character address so the total number of characters needed would be 15. The shortest possible address would only be two characters less.
