★Does URLs with UTM parameter crawled as different URLs?Let's say if I have an URL domain.com/my-first-post/ and have some UTM tracking lets say domain.com/my-first-post/?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=first-post Does Search Engines crawl these two pages as different URLs and treat as duplicate pages. If yes then how to avoid it
No, it would not be considered as duplicate URL, as Google can see that this is a campaign tracking URL but not the actual URL. Though Google consider URLs with any other parameters as duplicate unless you use canonical tag or block from getting such URLs crawled    Embed Quote
