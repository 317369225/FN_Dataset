★What is the best URL shortener?
I use CloudApp for my shortener attached to my own custom domain - mrt.lu - you need a pro account which is $5.00 a month to have your own domain (plus you get a few other extras). It is so easy to use via a keyboard shortcut and you can share any files with it - not just URLs.    Embed Quote
