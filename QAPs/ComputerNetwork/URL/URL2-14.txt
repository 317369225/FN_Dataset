★What is the best URL shortener?
Best url shortener websites are the ones that provides custom alias in URL's, password protection, geo-targeting, stats of visitors and if possible custom redirection pages. I use http://get.al  as i can find all the features. Custom alias means you can use your own company name or any custom word in URL:  for eg: http://get.al/yourcustomname. Password protection to protect any shortened url's. For eg: google doc url or other important url's can be protected from public access with passwords. Geo-Targeting can be used to target users based on their geographic location using a single shortened link. For eg: users visiting the shortened url from India can be automatically redirected to the Indian version of website . Disclaimer: I am the owner of the above site.    Embed Quote
