★How does a URL-shortener work?
Essentially, your DB has 3 fields: PrimaryKey, ShortCode, TargetURL Normally the ShortCode is simply the PrimaryKey (which is an int) converted to another base. So for instance base 36 (so 0 through 9, and then 'a' through 'z'). This makes it easy to look up the TargetURL in the database, since you can just decode it to base 10 and find the primary key. You will also have short URLs since the number of URLs you can have is 36^n where n is the number of characters in the shortened URL. So you can see that just with 4 letters you can have a possible of 2,313,441 different URLs. If you use capital letters (a larger base), this gets even larger.    Embed Quote
