★Are subfolders in URL relevant for SEO purposes?Are subfolders in URL (www.example.com/directory/title-of-content) relevant for SEO purposes (compared to www.example.com/title-of-content)? What's the maximum URL length recommended?
Subfolders can help as far as giving Google and Bing a 'hint' at your site structure. Deeper URLs with more folders are assumed to be lower priority and further 'down' in the site hierarchy. Shorter URLs with fewer or no folders will get tagged as more important and higher priority, at least to start. It'll also get you better clickthru from the SERPs, which can lead to better rankings. However, a keyword-rich directory name probably won't directly help with rankings. Inserting one or two target terms into a URL isn't likely to help you rank.    Embed Quote
