★Why is  the OSI protocol  the most studied and most  accepted network structure and yet it is rarely really implemented and used?OSI protocols
Edited for the clarification that the OP is looking at the protocol family, not the model. The OSI model is widely used in current networking protocols and is very relevant today.  The OSI family of protocols is no longer in wide spread use, but the model has value because it gives a good way to separate the design of the various components.  It is worth understanding that past layer 4 the OSI model is over specified and some of the layers get very fuzzy.  The TCP/IP model is really the same ideas without layers 5-7, which most networking companies (and engineers) ignored anyway.    Embed Quote
