â˜…What's the best way to get started with firmware/embedded systems programming?
Arduino is great great, but using the IDE hides the true nature tried nature. Try embedded programming. If you have done no programming before then it is a great place to start. If you are familiar with coding then checkout the free online course to create your own OS on the Raspberry Pithe free online course to create your own OS on the Raspberry Pi (links to: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/). http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects... This is not rolling your own Linux OS OS, but it is creating a bare metal bootable device. Since the Raspberry Pi effectively uses effectively a mobile chip chip, you will learn a lot about firmware/embedded development.
