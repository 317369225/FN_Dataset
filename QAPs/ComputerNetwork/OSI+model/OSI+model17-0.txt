★In which layer of the OSI model does the operating system come into picture?
At the most fundamental level, without bringing virtualized networks and network services into play, a networking OS provides the Layer3 (IP/ARP) and Layer4 (TCP/UDP) functionality. Almost everything above that is provided by applications running in user-land. Hypervisors (Hyper-V, VMware, OpenStack, etc) can now also present virtualized network elements at Layer1 (virtual links between internal switching elements and/or physical adapters) and Layer2 (virtual switches and tunnels) Certain services that run native to the OS are starting to creep into the higher layers, as well.  The in-kernel NFS server in the Linux kernel presents functions at Layer5 (sessions that link network objects to filesystem objects)    Embed Quote
