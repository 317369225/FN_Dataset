★IEEE Spectrum: How does the physical layer work in the OSI model?
The physical layer creates and detects the electrical or photonics impulses that represent the data bits formed by the link layer.  There may or may not be error correction built in. The physical layer only facilitates the link; it may be point to point or multicast. The 8-PSK you mention goes only from station to station. The IP address is two layers up; the physical layer has no interest in the IP address. A GSM system is itself a network, so I think your confusion is treating the GSM network as a physical layer.    Embed Quote
