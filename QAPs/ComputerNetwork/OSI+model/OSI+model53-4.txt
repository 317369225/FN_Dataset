★What is the main purpose of Data link layer in TCP/IP or OSI layer?advantages of data link layer
To create frames say a packet from upper layer(ip layer) may have sequence of zeroes which has high probability to be corrupted when transferred as signals by physical layer, so datalink layer does bit stuffing, To add synchronization frames useful in multiplexing It adds crc and plays a vital role in error correction/identification as it is the first layer receiving converted digital binaries from analog signals. frequently MAC layer is associated with DLL, so it takes care of contention of the shared medium avoiding collisions through backoff, multiple acknowledgements or token ring If TCP is not the protocol in transport layer then DLL's implementation of sliding window will have pronounced effect in performance Added a blog post on this http://blogs.eskratch.com/2012/1...    Embed Quote
