★Can you design a network model with three layers using the OSI model as a reference?
Assume I need to connect  a set of devices which do only one job within a network, I can use only 3 three layers for communication. The application layer is same as in current OSI layer which takes care of application specific jobs. There is no need of a transport layer if I dont care about reliability(TCP) and there is actually no need of multiplexing and demultiplexing as there is only one job running and listening on only one port(as per assumption). There is no need of IP layer as it is intra-network routing. I dont need to deal with IPs. I need Data Link Layer which maps hostnames with mac(instead of IP with MAC). This layer  takes care of creating frames for physical interface, creating crc and implementing sliding window. The physical layer for transferring the bytes to destination.    Embed Quote
