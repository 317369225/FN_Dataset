★Why is TCP/IP often referred to as a 'stack'?How did the word 'stack' go from a 'stack of books' to how it is used in the context of computer science?
A little visual aid to complement Andrew Purcell's answer. This is what data looks like as it moves through the stack. Starting with "raw" data at the Application level, more information is added at every step along the way down. This extra information is gradually stripped off at the receiver, starting with the outer layer and moving the data from the bottom upwards. Naturally, this is a LIFO process -- the outer layer of information was the last one added by the sender and the first one removed by the receiver. Hence, stack.    Embed Quote
