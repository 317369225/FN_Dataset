★What's the best way to get started with firmware/embedded systems programming?
Sharing my some personal experience: 1. I have been working in the embedded field since the beginning of 2007, learing from the Internet, doing projects on simulators or on hardware boards. 2.But after joining the industry, what I actually missed was the most expertise of C (pointer, structures, array, linklist, and doubly linklist), Basics microcontroller (assembly language instruction sets), OS (basic OS concepts, internals, and architecture), and knowledge of Linux internals. 3. Basic memory architecture (RAM, SRAM, and flash internal architecture). 4. Networking concepts (core OSI model architecture, internals of all of the OSI model) All these things can not be learned simultaneously; you have to learn them step by step, so first you need to sharpen yourself in your C skills, then implement those into  microcontrollers (for a few days), when time come you learnt a bit then switch to ARM, and learn Linux internals parallel-y. Then you are ready to clear all interviews. But keep in mind the embedded field needs your interest of the person in particular most. I hope this could help you, all the best. But be reminded, without C you are zero (so as I). Keep learning... Keep sharing. Using the Internet is the easiest way to learn, ask in blogs. You can clear all your questions.  See my home page, www.embbsys.blogspot.in.    Embed Quote
