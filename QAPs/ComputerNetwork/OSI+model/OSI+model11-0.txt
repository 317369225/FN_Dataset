★In the OSI model, which layer’s information cannot be seen on Wireshark? Why?
This answer will include some splitting of hairs. "Technically" you can see every layer, in as much that all of the bits sent over the wire are seen. What you cannot see is the physical voltages sent over the wire, or the characteristics of the physical medium (frequencies used, resistance of the wire, collisions detected &etc) which is what people usually consider in layers 1-2 of the OSI stack. For some technologies (such as WiFi) there are utilities besides lib pcap/WinPCAP that can grab additional data from layer ”1.5" and present it via Wireshark. I haven't used these before, but I know they exist. A good way to think of Wireshark is as a program that reads binary data and parses it. It does this for various computer protocols. Wireshark itself doesn't capture any data, it relies on third party libraries to do this for it.    Embed Quote
