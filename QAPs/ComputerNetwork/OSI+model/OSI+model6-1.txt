★What factors contributed to the use of the OSI model instead of the DoD?
I presume you mean "Why was OSI used as a teaching model instead of the TCP/IP work from ARPANET (DoD)?" There is a good, compact history of the OSI vs TCP/IP universe written here: OSI: The Internet That Wasn’t. I (and two others) wrote a short letters to the editor of Network World in 1994 about the shortcomings of OSI protocols:  Network World Short version:  OSI was a lovely, elegant academic model designed for a perfect world.  Academics loved it, and taught it. People that needed to build actual operating networks faced with the constraints of the real world used TCP/IP.  It had its own elegance, but enough inconsistencies to make academics crinkle their noses at it. But hey, it worked.  So that's what we have.    Embed Quote
