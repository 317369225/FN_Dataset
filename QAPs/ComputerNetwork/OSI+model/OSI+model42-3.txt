★Give some advantages and disadvantages of combining the  session, presentation, and application layer in the OSI model into one  single application layer in the Internet model.?
The TCP/IP model distinguishes 4 levels. I don't think there could be an advantage mixing up the bottom levels with the top ones as they have different functionalities. How could you explain the Network or the Transport layer mixing it up with the physical or Data Link layer? It doesn't make much sense to me because one thing is having data moving through the cables as electric signals, other is transmitting this data over a network between two computers in terms of frames or packets, as this implies encapsulation, error checking, flow control, etc.    Embed Quote
