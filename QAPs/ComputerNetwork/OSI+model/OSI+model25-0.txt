★How could I change the OSI model or the TCP/IP model into a model with three layers?
In theory, one could create a network stack using the following layers: - Physical - Network - Application However, what you'd find is that this would be entirely unsuitable for a general-purpose networking stack. The various "in-between" layers give you a lot of benefits that allow protocols built on the OSI model to serve a wide range of application needs. I'll note that early versions of TCP/IP - versions 1 to 3 - *did* attempt to merge the Network and Transport layers into a single protocol header. This approach was eventually abandoned in version 4, which is the version in use today. (see TCP/IP Overview and History) Using IP as an example, the Transport layer (Layer 4) allows for a choice of two predominant transport models on top of IP: UDP, which is extremely lightweight but makes no warranties as to the data it delivers, or TCP, which is more complex but will retransmit errored/dropped packets in an attempt to guarantee message delivery. If the model did not have a Transport layer, then application developers would need to re-implement this on their own, either balkanizing the protocol with incompatible implementations or standardizing on implementations, creating a de facto transport layer anyway. Likewise, the Link layer (Layer 2) adds efficiency in that it allows for the disambiguation between local network transport and remote transport. Not every packet needs to be routed, but without the link layer, every packet would have to be, added unnecessary overhead to local communications. If you want to create a simplified networking stack, this may make sense for specific use cases, but don't expect to come up with something suitable for a wide range of applications.    Embed Quote
