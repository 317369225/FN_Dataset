★Does the OSI model also apply to mobile networks?Does the OSI model also apply to mobile networks like 2G,... or does it have its own dedicated set of protocols?
Yes. (I disagree with Tony Li) Like any model it is not exact - but it is universally used and it is useful The cellular standards all have their own protocols, but those map onto the OSI layers. For example, you can pretty well say a WCDMA NodeB does Layer 1 , while the RNC does Layer 2 & 3 But I'm involved in a work item now around virtualisation of LTE and re-architecting the LTE stack. Layer 1, 2, 3 is essential terminology and used frequently. We do use "Layer 0.5" (splitting the PHY) and "Layer 2.8" (split upper & lower MAC) --  extending the model but only because we all know & use the OSI model The WONDERFUL Radysys chart (everyone interested in wireless must get a copy!) shows all the protocol stacks - and the logic is based on OSI model.
