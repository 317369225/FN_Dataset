★Why is TCP/IP often referred to as a 'stack'?How did the word 'stack' go from a 'stack of books' to how it is used in the context of computer science?
Already many good answers here. A useful addition would be that just like "TCP/IP" stack, which implements TCP over IP networking layer, TCP could be as easily implemented over any other networking layer say, the ATM networking layer (which incidentally held much more promise than IP at some point in time). So, such a stack would be arguably called "TCP/ATM" stack. Similarly, we can and already have implementations of other transport layer protocols such as UDP over IP. Such a stack is referred to as, you guessed it, UDP/IP stack.    Embed Quote
