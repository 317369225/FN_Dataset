★Does the OSI model also apply to mobile networks?Does the OSI model also apply to mobile networks like 2G,... or does it have its own dedicated set of protocols?
As Rupert mentions, the OSI model is just a conceptual model and all the functions of a network entity (NE) can be mapped to one of the abstraction layers, but it is not factually correct to say that a BTS/RAN/NodeB/eNodeB implements Layer 1 and the BSC/RNC implements Layer 2 and Layer 3. Below is the basic network architecture of a 2G GSM network. Assuming it is about mapping the Air-Interface in mobile networks to the OSI model (because of the '2G' in question), the Um (air) interface is abstracted to the first 3 layers of OSI model :- Layer 1 (Physical) - Functions required to transfer bit steams over physical TDMA / FDMA channels. It provides channel coding, mapping logical channels like CCH, DCCH, TCH to physical channels, transmission power settings, etc. Layer 2 (Data Link) - It provides a reliable signaling link between the mobile station (MS) and the network. Protocol is based on the LAPDm of ISDN. Layer 3 (Network) - It takes care of the main control of the MS to network procedures. It is split into 3 sub-layers: Radio Resource Management Mobility Management Connection Management Here is an image describing the abstraction layers at various interfaces' in a GSM network to aid in visualizing the mapping to the OSI model.    Embed Quote
