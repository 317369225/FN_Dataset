★What is the main purpose of Data link layer in TCP/IP or OSI layer?advantages of data link layer
The TCP/IP (DoD) model views the datalink slightly different than the OSI model. At the OSI model the Datalink (layer2) is layered above the physical medium (layer1).   The physical medium is responsible for the modulation and raw bit transmission and layer2 (datalink) for the protocols that controls medium access and error correction for link establishment between two physical endpoints. In the TCP/IP (aka DoD) model those two layers are sort of one layer, called the "Network Access layer".  Basically a layer responsible for everything that is needed to have a physical link between two nodes established.    Embed Quote
