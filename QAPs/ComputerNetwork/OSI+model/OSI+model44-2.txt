★What are some good jokes about computer networks?
[Originals] Person 1: How did you like my HTTP 200 joke ? Person 2: It was Ok. I ran out of new IPv4 jokes. I could tell you an IPv6 one but I'm afraid, you might not understand it. If you want to hear an ICMP joke, just ping me. A SYN packet went missing since the other day. He was last known to be seen near a firewall. I will tell you an ARP joke and call it mine. You will never know if I lied. [Internet] An ARP request goes to McDonald’s and asks for a Big MAC. The best thing about 404 jokes is… wait, damnit, it’s around here somewhere… An IPv4 address walks into a bar and says: “Quick, give me a drink. I am exhausted!” I have told IPv4 joke 254 times. Then it stopped being funny. I was dressed up as an UDP packet for the Halloween. I don’t think anyone got it, but I couldn’t tell. WHOIS going to tell us a Domain Name joke? I always get jittery when making jokes in real time. Serial jokes must be told bit by bit. Computer Networking meets Hitler    Embed Quote
