★What's the best way to get started with firmware/embedded systems programming?
My vote is for the Arduino platform. It's extremely easy to get started in embedded systems using an Arduino thanks to the reasonably priced hardware, the massive online support community, and the example code that is incredibly easy to download, compile, and load on your own hardware. The simplified programming language and free libraries also offer a gentler introduction to the world of low-level software and hardware interaction that traditionally is obfuscated by the syntactical nuances of C and microcontroller/compiler-specific macros, pragmas, and data sheets. Additionally, there are tons of add on "shields" that allow for easy interfacing with different types of sensors and the outside world in general.    Embed Quote
