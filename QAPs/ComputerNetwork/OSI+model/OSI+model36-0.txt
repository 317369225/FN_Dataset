★Why is TCP/IP often referred to as a 'stack'?How did the word 'stack' go from a 'stack of books' to how it is used in the context of computer science?
It is referred to as a stack because TCP is "stacked" on top of IP in the OSI model. When data is sent from one system to another, it must be split into packets and wrapped by each layer of the model, starting at the application layer, and passing through 5 more layers before reaching the physical layer, where it is physically transmitted. When the data is received, it must be unwrapped by each successive layer, starting with physical and ending at the application layer. This successive wrapping of layers resembles a "stack" data structure in computer science, and TCP/IP reside in layers 4, 3 of the stack, respectively.    Embed Quote
