★What is the main purpose of Data link layer in TCP/IP or OSI layer?advantages of data link layer
Data-Link layer (Layer-2) is responsible for transporting data within a network. The Data-link layer packages the higher-layer data into frames.This packaging process is referred to as framing or encapsulation. The Data-Link layer consists of two sublayers:      •   Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer      •   Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer The LLC sublayer serves as the intermediary between the physical link and all higher layer protocols. It ensures that protocols like IP can function regardless of what type of physical technology is being used. The MAC sublayer controls access to the physical medium, serving as mediator if multiple devices are competing for the same physical link. The data-link frame contains the source and destination hardware (or physical) address. Data Link uses MAC address to uniquely identify a host within a network.    Embed Quote
