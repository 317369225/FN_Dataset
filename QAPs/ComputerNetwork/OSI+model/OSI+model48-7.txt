★What's the best way to get started with firmware/embedded systems programming?
Well, it's been two years since I have been learning and diving into the world of embedded electronics. The first thing you need to have is the right attitude and hunger for knowledge. I am currently pursuing B.Tech, in computer science and engineering. The world of "WIRES" BREADBOARD, CHIPSETS have always fascinated me. For starters: Get your toolkit, not an expensive one. But it should contain all the right equipment. E.g soldering iron, testers, wires!, breadboard! etc. How to start?  The answer is simple: Explore! After the second year we have to make a project in any of the domains, be it software or hardware. I chose the later, because I thought it would be a great opportunity to really make a worthy project which is just not an another textbook stuff, but will be having practical implementations too. You can think about the real world problems you face while dealing with your devices. For instance, I chose an open power monitor and tried to make it cheaper! And for about 2000/- bucks I made a simple power monitor which tracks the users' energy needs on the go. What not to expect: I have interacted with some of the people who are in this industry. First of all this is a hands-on game; theory will help you, but practicality of the hardware system is a different case altogether. Journals: Journals like EFY or magazines do help a lot. You can also get ample amount of help from some of the Facebook/Google Group related to the same. DIY: In short, do it yourself! Career: I am no braniac when it comes to what industry really wants as I am currently exploring my taste in the field of embedded electronics, but this picture really sums it up:    Embed Quote
