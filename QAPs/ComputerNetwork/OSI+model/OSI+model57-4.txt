★What is the difference (if any) between a wireless access point and a wireless router?
A wireless router is essentially 2 components : a wireless access point and a router rolled into one. In larger wireless deployments you need to usually control multiple access points and make them work in synchronization (broadcast the same SSID if you will) This is done by a wireless controller which is very close to the router module of the wireless router. A distributed wireless network servicing a large area will usually have multiple access points while a single standalone network ,usually servicing a small area would use a standalone wireless router.    Embed Quote
