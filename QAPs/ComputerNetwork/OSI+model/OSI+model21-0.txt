★What is the difference between a packet and a frame with reference to the OSI model?
A packet refers to the encapsulated unit created at the nework layer of the OSI model. One of the most commonly encountered packets is the IP packet, which contains control information such as the source and destination IP addresses, differentiated services flags and so on. Thus, a packet typically contains logical address information. A frame, on the other hand, refers to the encapsulated unit created at the data link layer. One of the most commonly encountered frames is the Ethernet frame, which contains information such as source and destination MAC addresses etc. Thus a frame typically contains physical address information. It is worth noting that a packet is encapsulated within a frame and hence the packet would always form the data part of the frame. For a transmitting host, data is first encapsulated within the packet, which is further encapsulated in a frame. This is then sent out over the physical layer as a bit stream. For a receiving host, the physical bit stream is picked up, translated into a frame and the frame headers are stripped off  (decapsulated), thereby retrieving the packet, which is then further decapsulated to retrieve higher layer information.    Embed Quote
