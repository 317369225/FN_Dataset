★Why is TCP/IP often referred to as a 'stack'?How did the word 'stack' go from a 'stack of books' to how it is used in the context of computer science?
In TCP header the checksum in is computed over the TCP pseudo header which is the TCP header as well as some of the IP header. This kind of breaks the layering. The TCP connection does know the IP endpoint, because creating it requires specifying it. TCP knows the network-layer address and uses this information. Most modern TCP implementations are coupled with IP (hence, TCP/IP) and don't follow a pure layered approach. The presence of the pseudoheader means that TCP *must* look into the lower layer a bit. - Stanford's CS 144 from Philip Levis.    Embed Quote
