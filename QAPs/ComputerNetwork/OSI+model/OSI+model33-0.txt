â˜…Why did Cloudera move to Palo Alto?This is a follow-up question to Where is Cloudera's new Palo Alto office?.
Here are a few reasons: We're trying to solve some hard infrastructure and distributed systems problems and felt that we'd have a deeper pool of engineers from which to recruit. One of our board members compared the Valley to the OSI model, with Layer 7 in SF and Layer 1 in Cupertino. We'll be closer to key contributors to some of our open source projects like Yahoo!, Facebook, and LinkedIn. We needed to be close to the Caltrain, and finding a space large enough to hold 100+ people in the mid-peninsula was difficult. Aesthetically, there's a preference for high, exposed ceilings and an open floor plan. The Fry's warehouse really fit the bill. The commute to San Francisco suffers from a "last mile" problem, in which you can spend up to 30 minutes just navigating the city, let alone traveling on the highways. San Francisco imposes a payroll tax on companies above a certain size that would have raised our costs more than we would have liked.
