★In the OSI model, which layer’s information cannot be seen on Wireshark? Why?
Generally you cannot see below layer two, because that information is never transmitted on the wire (nor usually wirelessly) as part of "normal" communication.  Two stations on an Ethernet LAN won't communicate anything about the physical state of their link back to the switch as they talk to each other and the linking process to the switch is never communicated in layer 2 frames for Wireshark to snoop.  If you have a management system that is asking (SNMP, RMON, etc) about the state of the link that information can usually be snooped, but again normal communication between hosts won't have that data. The rest of the layers are available, though some of the layers (session especially) never really developed as a distinct layers in the real world.    Embed Quote
