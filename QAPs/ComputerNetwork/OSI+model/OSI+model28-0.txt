★Does a network socket operate at layer 4 or layer 5 of an OSI model or a TCP/IP model? If it operates at layer 4, then what does the session layer actually do, when sockets are the actual connections which act as an interface between application and lower layers.I used these two sources. One mentions sockets to be conceptually at Layer 5 (Session Layer), and the other one is Wikipedia, which mentions it to be at Layer 4. Session Layer (Layer 5) Network socket
Applying the OSI model to the TCP/IP stack is like using a ruler to measure weight: you are comparing two wildly different things. Sockets (assuming you mean the BSD model and a TCP socket) give you an opaque bit stream.  The socket itself is layer 3 (transport) and then your application rides on top of it.  TCP/IP has no session layer.  And no presentation layer.    Embed Quote
