★What is osi model? And some of its componnents..
OSI is a reference model for Network Communication protocol. It has 7 layers namely: 7       Application 6       Presentation 5       Session 4       Transport 3        Network 2        Data Link 1        Physical For send operation direction for flow is 7 to 1 and for Receive operation 1 to 7 is the direction of data flow. Each layer provides services to adjacent layers. Exact specification is not given in OSI layer. For Example, Error correction is done in Data Link & Transport layer but exact which Error correction method to use is undefined. OSI is just a reference model its not a actual stack it self. TCP/IP is an actual instance of stack. TCP/IP stack defines protocols at each layer. Except MAC subpart of datalink layer and physical layer. Operation for thisl layer is defined by topology and physical media. for example Wireless media uses 802.11 specification on this layers. You can think of OSI as a basic communication model.    Embed Quote
