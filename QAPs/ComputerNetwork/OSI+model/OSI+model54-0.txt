★Smart phones can be included under which OSI layer?
Thanks for A2A. As per my understanding any end device connected to the network will most likely have certain aspects that involve all layers of the OSI model. A smartphone mainly functions at application layer via different apps (here I am considering a smart phone as a data device) but in order for it to function over the internet, all the other layers are inherently involved and your smart phone implements all of the layers functionalities. L1 (wireless medium), L2 (mac functionality), L3 (IP addressing), L4 (TCP session establishment). However its good to understand that the application layer does not define the application itself, but it defines services that applications need. For example, application protocol HTTP defines how web browsers on the smart phone/PC can pull the contents of a web page from a web server. In short, the application layer provides an interface between software running on the smart phone and the network (EDGE/3G/4G/wifi etc) itself. Also keep in mind that although the OSI model is what you study for your networking courses, we don't use OSI in real work networks. We use the TCP/IP Network Model.  The OSI model is still taught due to it's usefulness in separating concepts into modules (layers).  The OSI model is translated to the TCP/IP model as follows.    Embed Quote
