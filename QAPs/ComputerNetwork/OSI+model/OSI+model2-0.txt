★What programming languages could match the OSI model layers?I have remembered the 7 layers of the OSI model, but I was wondering if there are programming languages that are specifically good at dealing with the operations of each layer (i.e. the physical layer could be dealt using assembly, and the data layer in C or C++, while Lisp + Java would cover the operations of the network layer, and so on.)
Typically everything below level 5 is part of the OS and is usually C or C++. Everything above that is in application code and could be anything. Networking code needs to be really fast. A lot of the software tasks related to network protocols is often delegated to the hardware these days. Once you start having 100 GB/s networks, the overhead of the networking algorithms becomes so high that performance suffers. A high level language would be unable to meet the performance needs of a network stack.    Embed Quote
