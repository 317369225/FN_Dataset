★Where do network sockets go in the OSI model?
Sockets are an interface between the Application and Network layers and as such, they cannot be seen as belonging to an individual layer. Note that the reference model used is the TCP/IP 4-layer model, that compresses the top 3 OSI layers into one. So in OSI terms, Application includes the Presentation and Session layers. In more practical terms, that means that network sockets implement protocols from any of those layers. For instance, you can have a half- or full-duplex communication over a socket, or you can use cryptographic protocols (SSL/TLS) to secure your connection.    Embed Quote
