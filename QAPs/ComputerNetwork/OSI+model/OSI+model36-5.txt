★Why is TCP/IP often referred to as a 'stack'?How did the word 'stack' go from a 'stack of books' to how it is used in the context of computer science?
IP is a best-effort delivery protocol, it would try it best to deliver data packets passed to it to the correct destination, but it wont gurantee that data would remain intact or no packets would be lost. It delegates this responsibility to the higher layers & focusses on its core work i.e. to rout packets to destination. This is one of the key features of the layered approach TCP is a connection oriented protocol that works on top of IP, it does connection establishment & management between the communicating entities & also ensures reliability of data (loss of data etc).   UDP(User Datagram Protocol) can also work on top of IP, but it is a connectionless protocol.   So almost everywhere the de facto protocol accompanying IP is TCP. Thats why it is called TCP/IP    Embed Quote
