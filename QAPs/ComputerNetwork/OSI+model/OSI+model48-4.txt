★What's the best way to get started with firmware/embedded systems programming?
I suggest you to start with Arduino, because of easiness of learning and programming. There are many online resources, discussion forms to get help. You got some good answers for this question, you can rely on their advice. I would like to give tell you something different. Becoming a good Arduino programmer doesn't make you a good embedded system designer. In some complex embedded system developing projects, developers have to study hardware & communication protocols in-depth. Sometimes you have to refer hardware specification sheets to study how they actually work. I suggest you to learn Assembly language as well. Assembly is very close to machine language, Experience you get by coding assembly programs will give you greater understanding on hardware protocols.    Embed Quote
