★What is the main purpose of Data link layer in TCP/IP or OSI layer?advantages of data link layer
As far as I remember, that layer (at least in the TCP IP model) actually does 2 things: - interface with the physical media for creating and sending frames, discovering peers etc. - it usually has an implementation of a sliding window protocol for maximizing local network throughput and detecting /avoiding collisions and some rudimentary error correction/ detection. These functions are usually subdivided into the logical link layer and the media access control layer. This is obviously different in the ISO OSI model, but then, who really uses that in real life? I really hope you are not using this to finish an assignment. :-) EDIT: meant physical media not layer.    Embed Quote
