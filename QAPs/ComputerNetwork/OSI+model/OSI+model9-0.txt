★What is the difference between datagrams and segments in the TCP/IP and OSI models?
Before we talk about how they differ, let's start with how they relate.   They are both what is called a PDU or protocol data unit of their respective abstraction layer.  In simple terms it is the unit of data that the communications protocol uses to exchange information and payload with its (protocol) peers. Now, what makes them different is the kind of data they require and what its layer protocol considers information in order to make some decision.  The packet structure and header information are different. In the end they all are packets,  and the "frames", "datagrams" and "segments" (etc), are just names so people can know in what kind of layer the packet is being referenced.    Embed Quote
