★In an OSI model, it says the data link layer is either point to point or broadcast. What is the significance of this?
Data link layer allows computers in the same local network to send and receive frames. This can involve direct point to point or broadcasting. When communicating with the hosts on the other network, IP comes into play. Even then, the packets have to be sent from the sender to the nearest router using point to point communication in data link layer, so that packets will reach ultimate destination. Moreover, if the routers MAC address is not known, sender will broadcast an Arp packet. So, basically all of the local LAN data link layers use point to point or broadcasting significantly in the end to end communication.    Embed Quote
