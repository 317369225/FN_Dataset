★What is the difference (if any) between a wireless access point and a wireless router?
The WiFi router consists of 3 components WiFi access point ("AP") Gigabit Ethernet switch ("Switch") (can be 1 port but usually there are 4 ports) Single interface router ("Router") with dedicated external network connection, such as cable or DSL, through the marked "Internet" port When all 3 components are enabled you, have a WiFi-enabled switch, with AP and router capabilities. Once you disable the routing features in your WiFi router, it becomes a WiFi AP with a built-in switch. This disables the "Internet" Ethernet port on the device. After disabling WiFi it becomes a standard Gigabit Ethernet switch. I reused many WiFi routers in reduced capacity like this when I was in a pinch with clients. If you use custom firmware like Dd-Wrt.org, it is possible to reconfigure your switch ports to do a lot more than what I described above. That is beyond the scope of this answer.    Embed Quote
