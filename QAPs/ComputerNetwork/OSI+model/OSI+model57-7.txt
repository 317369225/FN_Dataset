★What is the difference (if any) between a wireless access point and a wireless router?
Lets say you have a normal router, one end of it will be connected to the internet and the ports will be left for other computers or devices to connect to the router and use the internet. A normal router will be useful for as many as 8, 16 or at the most 48 devices (these are the number of ports). Plus, you may also need as many LAN cables too. If the number of people is not known beforehand and also the hassle of wires is to be reduced, a device known as 'access-point' is connected to one port of the router where normally a PC or laptop is connected. This access point receives data from the router via the LAN cable and converts it into RF signal and broadcasts into the surrounding region upto a certain distance. Many devices (PC, laptop, smartphone) placed within the range of access point's signal can now connect or send the data through the access point, Thus we have increased the number of connected devices, increased their mobility and also freed our network from wires. Now connect more access points into many ports available in the router and we have a really large network. On the other hand, a wireless router is a device that can itself convert the data into RF and broadcasts it into nearby area without the use of an access point.    Embed Quote
