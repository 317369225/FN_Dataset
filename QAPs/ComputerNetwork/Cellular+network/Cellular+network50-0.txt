★What American cellular network performs best with the iPhone 5's LTE?What network has the best reception and speed? Is one network clearly better than the others in certain metro areas and major US cities (e.g., NYC, LA, SF, Chicago)?
As of the date you posted this and asked me to answer, nobody outside Apple has one yet. You can't even preorder it yet. I don't see how anyone is supposed to answer this… To hypothesize using other 4G LTE phones, I'd say Verizon since they have the best LTE network at this point. Second would be AT&T. Sprint's 4G sucks, and T-Mobile doesn't even have any real 4G at all.
