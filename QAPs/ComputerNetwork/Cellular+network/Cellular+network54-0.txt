â˜…What's the difference between cellular networks for phone calls and their data networks for the Internet, and why don't we just use data for all phone calls?
In older GSM systems you had dedicated channels, each of these channels was used for either an voice circuit or a data circuit (either way both were digital). The reason to separate voice and data is that the number of phone calls is a significant part of the traffic and so the most efficient mechanism should be picked. If you treat voice as data then you need extra signalling to indicate that it is voice data and this isn't as efficient if you move it a layer up. More recently LTE has added VoLTE which uses the data circuit for voice traffic but this has created significant challenges. How do you deal with emergencies? How do you deal with quality of service? How do you deal with excess traffic? These things were all well defined in previous generations and have had to be reinvented in the data world. There is talk about the UK emergency services moving from TETRA to LTE but they need LTE to be more robust and have more facilities before they can be used for public safety. More bandwidth doesn't always mean that you can do more if you loose functionality when you use a newer standard.
