â˜…What are some of the good and bad strategies implemented by Idea Cellular Network?
Marketing strategies adopted by Idea network: TV commercials Radio Internet Brand endorsement Print media Billboards They use almost every marketing strategy they can, though there advertisements aren't that great as that of Vodafone, but almost everyone has heard of Idea. That being said, many people don't know about other services that idea offers like data card. They spend a large amount of money on these services but at the end, the quality of service they provide matters where they fail to satisfy people. In my opinion, they should focus on their real services rather than those ridiculously more than needed adverts.
