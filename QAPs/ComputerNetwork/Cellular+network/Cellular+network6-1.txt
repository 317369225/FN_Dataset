â˜…Cellular Networks: How is a Protocol Implemented in Hardware?Having studied mobile comms protocol like the 3GPP2 cdma radio interface ones, I've always wondered how are these immensely detailed protocols implemented in hardware or is it implemented in software that runs on hardware.
Both. I've worked on WCDMA and LTE. The OSI layer model is very useful, especially layer 1 and layer 2. Earlier solutions started with FPGAs and DSPs at layer 1, with general purpose processors running layer 2 (think those targeted to switches, routers and embedded systems). Later, ASICs get made, replacing many of the FPGAs. The cutting edge solutions are now SoCs, with multiple processor cores, DSP and specialized co-processors.
