â˜…Why did AMPS have much better coverage than current digital cellular networks?Is it merely that there aren't as many digital cell towers as there were analog towers or is it something else? I remember my dad being able to make calls in the middle of nowhere like Death Valley and in the Appalachian Mountains with his Sprint PCS phone.
It is worth noting that digital technologies work in what we call the 'cliff edge' effect. Basically things work well, things work well, things work well, then you notice a few problems and then it fails. Analogue degrades more gracefully, so at the edge of reception you might get a more complete service but the quality might suck. Coverage plans for digital may not have been exactly the same as analogue and your phone might also be working in different frequency bands (800MHz vs 1900MHz) and the lower the frequency the better the propagation of the signal is. So if your father's Sprint PCS phone was using 800MHz and your cell phone is on 1900MHz then you will see substantial difference from the same cell tower.
