★Which cellular network is the best in coverage in the U.S?I mean I've seen many commercials that say the are the "leading company"  so clearly someone's lying
What do you mean? If it's about international sim card, I guess the best one is MTX Connect, I've got it at MWC, it's about 30 countries in a coverage zone. But unfortunately only in Europe, so travelling to Asia I need smth more.
