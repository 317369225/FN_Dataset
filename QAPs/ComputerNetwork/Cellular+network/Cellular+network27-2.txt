â˜…GSM: What can I do to get better cellular network in my apartment?I have just moved in to a new apartment (in Paris). Cell phone network is bad in here. Is there a signal enhancer of some kind that I can buy to improve cell phone reception inside the apartment?
If you have access to a window or the roof, a cell phone booster should help. It amplifies the signal, and lets you put an antenna someplace with better visibility of towers. This French company sells them. You might give them a call: http://www.myamplifiers.com/gsm_... Another possibility is a femtocell, a box that provides a GSM signal using your existing broadband connection for backhaul. This site discusses the femtocells available in France: http://www.femtocell.fr/ An amplifier will probably cost more and be harder to install, but have no monthly fee. Femtocells can be quite cheap but may have a monthly fee, and are only useful if you can get one from the same provider you use for your mobile.
