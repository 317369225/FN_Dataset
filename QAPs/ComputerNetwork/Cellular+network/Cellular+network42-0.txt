★What technology is employed for the iPhone 6/6+ to hand off calls between wi-if and regular cellular networks?Apple's new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus can make calls over WiFi and even hand off to the regular cell network if you leave WiFi range.
This technology has been around for almost a decade, otherwise known as Unlicensed Mobile Access (UMA) and is part of ongoing Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC) development. It was originally devised to reduce network congestion from cellular towers so that cell companies could reduce overall capital expenditure on buildiing more cell towers and acquiring/leasing land to build those towers. By shifting traffic to wired connections via femtocells or wifi that hooked into the wired broadband infrastructure it made it a cheaper method of increasing cellular coverage. The actual handover works using what's called a  "vertical handover", the device needs both wifi and cellular capability, a wireless gateway and a packet data gateway connected to the cell networks backend that is currently relaying the active voice call. Usually the relative signal strength (RSS) of teh WLAN and cell are compared, and if one signal is stronger than the other, the connection is handed over via the a switching of the gateways (this is a usual method cell towers handover between cells when youa re travelling on a train). For WLAN to Cell handover, it will also take into account the overall signal strength of the WLAN (rather than handing over to whoever is trongest), the users preference settings etc. There will be some form of algorithm that will decide when to handover the connection, so if you prefer to use wireless, it will won't switch over immediately even if the cellular signal is stronger.
