★Why does WiFi "relieve" a cellular network? Does it actually use a different network?
Yes, WiFi uses the unlicensed 2.4GHz and 5GHz radio bands for access compared to many different narrower and generally lower frequency bands for cellular. Because of RF physics, the WiFi bands (5GHz in particular) are better optimized for high capacity due to their much larger bandwidths and higher frequencies compared to cellular spectrum. The larger WiFi bandwidths (<=80Mhz for current WiFi versus <=20Mhz for current LTE) allow higher capacity in each WiFi 'cell', while the higher WiFi frequencies (5GHz versus e.g. 700MHz LTE) allow many more WiFi cells to be packed into a given area.   Finally, there is simply much more spectrum available in 5GHz for WiFi than there is licensed spectrum available for LTE.  These effects are multiplicative and result in WiFi having much higher capacity in those areas where you take care to deploy quality WiFi AP's at sufficient density to provide good signal at all of the locations that you wish to cover.
