★Does Cell C (South African cellular network) compete solely on price?Cell C seems to be pulling in many subscribers from MTN and Vodacom with their cheap rates, but their data coverage, in particular, seems very flaky. Are they planning on improving their network, or is their strategy to target the price sensitive segment  of the market?
You answer your own question. Cell C is unbeatable in price as it stands, but they give poor service as a result. That is not going to change, as their profit margins don't leave the same amount for investment as other providers have.   Worse yet, more subscribers on the network will actually deteriorate the service. So network updates at a certain rate along with an increase of the user base at the same rate will result in the service remaining the same.   In conclusion, best case Cell C will maintain their service level. At worst, expect it to deteriorate.
