â˜…How is the same cellular frequency spectrum shared among different cellular networks?
If you ask how many users can utilize the same frequency to communicate to the same network the response of Zahair Mu is correct. The medium access methods are implemented to maximize the capability of the radio station. If you ask how more than 1 network provider can offer their services in the same area and in the same spectrum is simple. The whole spectrum is divided into bandwidths (may not be equally divided) that are put in an auction so the network providers can buy a piece of spectrum. This way no interference is occurred. The reuse of frequencies when a range of frequency is already assigned could be: Polarization. Spatial. Subdivide the frequency range.
