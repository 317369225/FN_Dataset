★Why does WiFi "relieve" a cellular network? Does it actually use a different network?
The other answers have explained in detail how wi-fi relieves cellular networks by completely removing (offloading) traffic away from cellular networks and they are correct.  This is an additional nuance - there is a movement by operators to see if they can only "offload the air interface" using WiFi instead of cellular over-the-air and then route the traffic back to a common aggregation point inside their network. If that becomes a commercial reality, then we can see a future where wi-fi and cellular networks are inter-connected in the back-end and only separate at the front-end facing the user.
