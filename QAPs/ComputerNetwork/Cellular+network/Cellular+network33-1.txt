â˜…How were cellular networks affected by the August 23, 2011 earthquake?
Both AT&T and Verizon advised that call volume was high enough to make it difficult to complete a call successfully. I did not attempt to call anyone from my cellular phone, but did make contact with family & friends via text and social networking without any issues or delays. I think temporary service halt went more smoothly and was sorted out more quickly than previous major events. I suspect this might be due to the popularity of social networks like Twitter and Facebook. I know my family and I were more surprised than terrified during the quake, and what people wanted more than anything was a confirmation they hadn't dreamed this disturbance. Within minutes of the Earthquake, I was able to check my accounts and contact people, which avoided any panic and worry. Thankfully, we're all fine, and damage so far seems to be minimal.
