â˜…How do you simulate LTE/Cellular networks using Mininet?http://stackoverflow.com/questio...
The key is to simulate an unreliable channel. I am not quite familiar with exactly how to implement this directly. But a hack to drop packets against distribution function would give you the feel of loosing cellular connectivity. However, even simply simulating with just latency might be sufficient as newer mobile networks handle packet loss well and have better coverage. Relevant parameters in mininet are tc, loss, delay and max_queue_size applies to each link.
