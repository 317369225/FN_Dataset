â˜…What are promising technologies for next generation cellular networks?And how will these technologies improve upon current 3G/4G in future wireless networks (say in ~5 years from now)? Bandwidth / Availability / Response Times / Cost / Battery consumption etc.
First of all, advanced MIMO schemes are the one of best promising techniques for next generation wireless systems. Since MIMO antenna technology can offers higher throughput and higher reliability, it is mandated in LTE systems. Moreover, MIMO has an interference handling functions inherently, advanced MIMO schemes which are extension of original MIMO for various fields.
