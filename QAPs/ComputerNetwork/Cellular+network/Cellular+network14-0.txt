â˜…What are FDMA and TDMA in cellular networks?Simple explanation in layman terms with practical examples would be appreciated. Thanks.
Lets consider a room with many people. Now if one speaks at a time we would say that it is TDMA.TDMA stands for time division multiple access.By making one speak at a time we have divided them by TDMA.Here we can assume all of them spoke at the same volume ( frequency) Suppose we let all speak at the same time but in different volumes (frequency) then we would be using using FDMA , frequency division multiple access. Just for information , if all spoke at the same time and volume but spoke different languages ( codes) then we would call it code division multiple access (CDMA)
