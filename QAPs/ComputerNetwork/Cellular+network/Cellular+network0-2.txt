â˜…How secure are cellular networks?Specifically LTE and 3G connectivity.
It is NOT secure at ALL. I just came across your question doing some research. I just posted a video privately for a Kickstarter campaign that I am starting next week, and this is just a draft video, but has all the information in it to answer your question. Secure? You might as well shout out your window. If someone, anyone, wants to listen all they have to do is park within a mile of you, and become the tower, and begin archiving all your calls - or all the calls and sort through it later. There are no views because it's currently an unlisted video - and even though I'm sharing it with you here on this public forum - I ask that you do not promote it (at least not yet) on any other public forums.
