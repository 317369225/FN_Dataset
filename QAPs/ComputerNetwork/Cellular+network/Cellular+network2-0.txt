â˜…What are promising technologies for next generation cellular networks?And how will these technologies improve upon current 3G/4G in future wireless networks (say in ~5 years from now)? Bandwidth / Availability / Response Times / Cost / Battery consumption etc.
The promising technologies for the next generation cellular networks is going to be LTE-Advanced (a.k.a 'real 4G'). LTE-A also has an evolution path, adding more and more component technologies and features that will help solve most of the problems faced today. To give you an idea about the things you mentioned, let me list down how it will help. Carrier Aggregation will help increase the bandwidth by collating different frequency bands and fragmented spectrum. Upto 100MHz bandwidth delivering 1Gbps in DL is possible this way. Relays would help reduce the power consumption and latency Different MIMO enhancements and advanced antenna technologies to increase throughput to users and increase the cell throughput Enhanced Interference co-ordination between the neighbour cells There is a recent presentation and whitepaper from NSN that lists the developments taking place and how they will help.

And of course whether we like it or not, Femtocells (Small cells) will be a big part of the future as they will help make the cellular experience personalised and individualised.
