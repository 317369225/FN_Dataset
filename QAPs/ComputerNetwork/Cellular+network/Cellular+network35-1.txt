★How hard is it to replace a cellular network like AT&T or Verizon?
In North America, Wireless competition is fierce and  the Capital commitment required to operate/evolve a Cellular Network is monumental.  This year, AT&T will invest ~USD50MM each and every day (or ~USD 20B)in it's network.  Combined, US wireless Operators will invest north of USD 130B THIS YEAR ALONE in improving your wireless experience.  Courtesy of the Mobile Broadband networks that will come online early in 2011, you will be able to experience uplink/downlink speeds on your wireless phone equivalent to those made available via your wired home modem only in the last 3-4 yrs or so - it is expected that this throughput gap (measured in revenue/bit or cost/bit) will continue to close until 2017 or so, at which point, for the consumer, wireless service will be to wired what digital is to analog.  This unprecedented investment in increasing personal productivity and bringing friends/family closer has certainly helped me put the relative cost of my monthly bill in context.
