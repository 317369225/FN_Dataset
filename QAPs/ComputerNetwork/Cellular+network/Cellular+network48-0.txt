â˜…Cellular network strenght in iPhone is less then the other phones. Why is it so?Some days back i bought myself iPhone 5. I noticed that the cellular network strength in iPhone 5 is less then the other phones. I have my colleagues sitting next to me with a different made phone and the same network service provider, having better signal strength. Why is it so ?
I usually have better network than my friends, and I'm also using iPhone 5. I had the same problem as you with my iPhone 3GS, and i wen't to Call Me (Danish Network provider), where i had bought the phone. They sent it to Apple support, and they replaced it. The new iPhone had much better network, so i think it's a try worth.
