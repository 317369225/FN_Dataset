â˜…Why did AMPS have much better coverage than current digital cellular networks?Is it merely that there aren't as many digital cell towers as there were analog towers or is it something else? I remember my dad being able to make calls in the middle of nowhere like Death Valley and in the Appalachian Mountains with his Sprint PCS phone.
Two reasons More users. So you may not get a signal far out because people have already filled capacity. The bigger the cell (long range) more people. Selective memory. Service these days is a lot more reliable, and people use their phones more. So you tend to notice if it doesn't work. Twenty years ago, cellphones were more of an event and it would be "wow - look - I have got coverage even out here!"
