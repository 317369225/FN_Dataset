★Will iPhone apps work with wifi if the phone is not on a cellular network?I'm considering switching to a different device, but I would still like to access the apps on my iPhone for testing purposes. Will the apps still work if the phone is no longer associated with a cell account?
In general, yes.  Once the phone is no longer on a cellular network, it becomes a glorified iPod Touch.  Any app that works with the touch will work just fine on the non-cell phone iPhone.  Some apps that don't work on the touch will still work, as you have the extra hardware such as the camera that the Touch does not have. Obviously any app that uses the cell network will not work (phone will not dial, SMS will not go out, etc.)
