â˜…Which are the most famous cellular networks in the Honolulu, Hawaii area?
This site seemed helpful Page on deadcellzones.com The verizon and At&t networks seemed to have the best coverage while I was there in Oct 15. I can only speak for Oahu, but it seemed like Honolulu, Waikiki, Manoa area all networks were fine. I had problems with T-Mobile networks so I'd stay away from those if possible.
