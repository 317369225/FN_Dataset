â˜…Where can I find a good overview of the technologies in cellular network infrastructure?In particular, I am looking for a better understanding of technologies including base stations, RF power amplifiers, distributed antenna systems, etc...
I'd recommend starting with 3GPP's (awkwardly named) Master LTE Faster tutorial site. It has a lot of useful info on the technologies and protocols that go into 3G and 4G mobile networks: http://www.masterltefaster.com/ Beyond that, I'd recommend reading some white papers on wireless technology. The 3GPP links to some: http://www.3gpp.org/Industry-Whi... Tech Republic has plenty (free registration needed): http://www.techrepublic.com/whit... And industry players such as Qualcomm, Nokia Siemens, Ericsson, Cisco, etc. publish a variety of white papers on their sites. Here's Ericsson's page: http://www.ericsson.com/news?cat... I'd recommend taking some of the opinions in company white papers with a small dose of salt, since companies often use them to promote their pet technologies and product architectures over alternatives. But they can still be useful.
