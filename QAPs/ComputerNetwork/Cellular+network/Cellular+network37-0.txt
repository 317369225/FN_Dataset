â˜…In 2013, what will be the default US cellular network technology?4G LTE, HSPA+, 3G, a mix?
What do you mean by default? In terms of installed base it will be a mix of cdma, GSM, HSPA, and LTE But in terms of 'what should I build?' it will clearly be LTE. As a user then it is going to be irritating: either a choice between a dual mode cdma+LTE device or a GSM+HSPA+LTE device. My feeling is that the former will have the better network (Verizon's cdma is big, and their LTE will have a head-start) While the latter will have the best devices (as there is a larger world market for that combination)
