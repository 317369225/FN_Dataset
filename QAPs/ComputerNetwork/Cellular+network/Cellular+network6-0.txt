★Cellular Networks: How is a Protocol Implemented in Hardware?Having studied mobile comms protocol like the 3GPP2 cdma radio interface ones, I've always wondered how are these immensely detailed protocols implemented in hardware or is it implemented in software that runs on hardware.
They are implemented in the form of protocol layers. All this complex functionalities are broken down to layer wise functions (as they are in 3GPP specifications also) .These layers are much like the OSI layer model of the network. Each technology or interface has its own protocol stacks (not necessarily 7 as suggested by OSI model). Each of the layers having defined duties and responsibly. Each layer sends data in the form of packets called PDU's to the lower/higher in case of sending/receiving data respectively. For Eg : When u click a link on a mobile browser. Almost a 100 (surely more) times a packet is appended and stripped off  the original data ( the URL) you send. This extra info is called header. Each layer adds(while sending) and remove(while receiving) this headers.   In some cases layer 1 (even layer 2)  functionalities are often implemented on specialized hardware like DSP chps etc... Rest most of the embedded processors work good. Many of the hardware are chosen for special type of applications. Code is usually in c language (sometimes c++ also). DSP code might be in some proprietary language  or assembly c.
