★Why can't apps use data from cellular network to determine user's location?Maybe this is a dumb question. Cellular providers such as AT&T and Verizon must know our location close enough as they serve us data. Why can't smartphone apps use that mechanism to determine our location, instead of requiring us to enable a separate "location" setting that drains battery life?
The carriers can geo-locate a user pretty accurately with a simultaneous ping from 3 or more cell towers.  In fact, the FCC requires carriers to be able to provide a location for emergency calls for first responders and crime tracking. For network-based solutions: 100 meters for 67 percent of calls, 300 meters for 95 percent of calls; For handset-based solutions: 50 meters for 67 percent of calls, 150 meters for 95 percent of calls.From: Page 3 on FCC Testing Guide for E911 Systems Now just because they can, does not mean you can. GPS is global, carrier LBS belong to each carrier.  The device hardware knows what this is without the carrier.  At the carrier level, you'd need to have a relationship with every carrier or *hope* that carriers can all agree on a uniform standardized API to give out location data for its subscribers to anyone who asks for it. Triangulation is a post-thought solution.  They built cell towers for cell service, and then said "wow, if we get 3 or more, we can figure out where people are" - its not meant to provide LBS data at scale for apps. It wont work on WIFI.  Then your app will drop to IP like how google maps works in your browser (ex. W3C Geolocation API) The good news is smartphones are getting better by the minute at processing GPS data without crushing the battery. Regardless of everything, the user will still have to "enable" whatever technology you use because this is sensitive personal data.
