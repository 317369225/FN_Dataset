â˜…Which cellular networks have the best coverage in Albuquerque, NM?
According to cellreception.com's user reviews: Since Nextel only has 2 reviews, I'm assuming they're old and from Nextel's glory days. Sprint is shutting down the legacy Nextel network this year. I'd go with Verizon. I have it as my personal service and have great coverage all over the US.
