â˜…What are the cellular networks which would work in the Leh-Laddakh region?
Pre-paid SIMs purchased in other states won't work. Postpaid SIMs from BSNL, Airtel and Aircel work in the area. In case you are planning to wander a bit farther from the Leh/Ladakh area, BSNL provides the maximum coverage among the three providers.
