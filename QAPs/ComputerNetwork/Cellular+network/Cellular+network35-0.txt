â˜…How hard is it to replace a cellular network like AT&T or Verizon?
Firstly, I think it is misleading to look at the context of sunk costs and operating costs from the perspective of retail pricing. I think the points made in the question largely underplay the costs involved in establishing, and operating, and continually upgrading a wireless network. As pointed out by Mike Mullineaux, running wireless operations is a *really* expensive affair. And to these operating costs, add the cost that carriers have paid to acquire spectrum and you have definite reasons why you can't wish away the carriers. I understand there is lot of antagonism towards US carriers with respect to service and pricing, but for someone to think that a new player can come out overnight with an alternate network to solve all such issues is, IMHO, wishful thinking.
