â˜…How were cellular networks affected by the August 23, 2011 earthquake?
As far as I know, the only effect on cell networks was the typical heavy traffic load that happens after a major event. I tried to call my dad (who was born in California) right after the earthquake and couldn't get through. As I live in a fairly rural area, I can only imagine that it was much worse in Northern Virginia and Richmond.
