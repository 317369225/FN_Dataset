★Why do mobile broadband and smartphone apps cause signaling problems on cellular networks?
A simple answer to the above question is that the PCs and smartphones that are used today allow a lot of Apps to be installed. A lot of these Apps (like Skype, Viber, Whatsapp, etc.) need to keep sending small chunks of information to the server regularly. And not only these Apps, other applications like E-mail as well has to keep regularly polling the server. To save the power the network bandwidth, cellular technology traditionally establishes a connection and once the job is done (after certain idle time) tears down the connection. Due to these loads of Apps, the mobile device has to continuously keep establishing and releasing the connection. Each time a connection is established and released, it causes signalling messages to be sent. An example can be seen in the picture below where in Fig. 3 it gives an example of when and how many messages would be send in case of LTE. All these signalling messages from hundreds and thousands of devices including smartphones and dongles are overloading the networks and causing problems. I recently wrote a blog post explaining this problem further. Its available here:  http://3g4g.blogspot.co.uk/2012/...
