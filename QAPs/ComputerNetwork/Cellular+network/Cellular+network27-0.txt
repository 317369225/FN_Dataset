â˜…GSM: What can I do to get better cellular network in my apartment?I have just moved in to a new apartment (in Paris). Cell phone network is bad in here. Is there a signal enhancer of some kind that I can buy to improve cell phone reception inside the apartment?
Some US providers like AT&T offer "femtocells" -- basically little cell towers that live in your home and communicate over your broadband connection. The tacky part is you have to pay for the device, and your monthly cost doesn't go down, even though you're effectively removing yourself from their network while at home.
