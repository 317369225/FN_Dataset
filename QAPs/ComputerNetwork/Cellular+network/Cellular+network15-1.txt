â˜…Is there an iOS app that gives information about the cellular network?I can find tools that will tell me about wifi signal strength, ping times, current bandwidth and latency, etc. I want this functionality when on cellular data. (i.e. sometimes my phone shows 3G data and good signal strength but nothing gets through - I want to know if e.g. packets are being dropped.) Thanks!
From what I've found, it seems that the app you want doesn't exist on the official appstore. However, you can always jailbreak your iPhone and look around for apps on Cydia that accomplish this. Cydia is the 'most official unofficial appstore' for the iPhone. If you need help jailbreaking your iPhone, there are tons of tutorials online. In the sources below I linked to a jailbreak application that seems to fill some of your needs. Sources: Getting cell tower information in an iOS application?
