â˜…What's the difference between cellular networks for phone calls and their data networks for the Internet, and why don't we just use data for all phone calls?
All cellular traffic is data. They charge you a different tarriff for voice a) because it takes more 1s and 0s to encode analog to digital than digital to digital and b) because they can, because there is a distinction in your head. Voice v. data is only relevant over PSTN.
