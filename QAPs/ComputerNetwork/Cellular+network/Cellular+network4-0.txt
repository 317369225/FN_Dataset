★Which is the best cellular network in the IITK campus?
Working perfectly fine for more than 4 years! Udpate 1: As Adarsh Jagannatha commented: It  works within the lift, inside walled server rooms and almost always on  full strength! Though, their quality of service is very bad, it almost  never connects to the right number in first try! Also outside campus  I've not had that good experience with them, though better than docomo  at most times.
