★GSM: What can I do to get better cellular network in my apartment?I have just moved in to a new apartment (in Paris). Cell phone network is bad in here. Is there a signal enhancer of some kind that I can buy to improve cell phone reception inside the apartment?
Which operator are you on? SFR has femtocells and do not charge. FREE (Iliad) is going to have femtocells. Orange do have them, but primarily for small businesses and they charge (quite a bit). Bouygues do not, as far as I know. So if you are on SFR or could change to them then that solves the problem easily (or FREE soon).   John Levine mentioned repeaters / boosters - those are illegal in most of Europe. There is a variant called the Cell-Fi which is supported by some operators and is legal, but I'm not sure if Orange France supports that. http://nextivityinc.com/  Some handsets are better: Nokia will be a bit better than others, for example.   btw I editted the question to replace 'GSM' with 'cellular' to keep it more general. I susprect you are using 3G anyway, not GSM.
