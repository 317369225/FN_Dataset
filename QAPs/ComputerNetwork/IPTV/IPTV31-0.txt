★How many retail and ecommerce companies with YouTube channels are considering IPTV?
I've worked for an Israeli IPTV company, and given some of the content we streamed through our broadcast software i'd say this content would be very boring! This said, what is the plan you have in-store? Is dead-air time okay? or are you looking to loop content over again to avoid dead air? Either way, still seems like there isn't a whole bunch of hours of content to begin with and getting a consistent stream of simultaneous unique viewers might be a hard target metric to achieve. May not be worth paying the salary of full-time employees to consistently be cranking out content that not many people are going to see.  Of course this is all just one man's opinion, but someone who's seen channels like FashionTV and CurrenTV, both of which were OTT channels w/ seemingly much more interesting content than say a "Target TV" or "dolce-gabbana TV," fail (we broadcast both through our network) i'd say lack of premium content and demand is the main reason why brands won't be flocking to IPTV anytime soon.
