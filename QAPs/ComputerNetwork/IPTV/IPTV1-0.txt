★What is a good scheduling system for IPTV?I am looking for a software that let me create video playlists and schedule the playlist to broadcast in a live stream
Choosing broadcast equipment for your Tv station's workflow is like picking a couch for your living room. We are all so trilled to buy the beautiful, Italian one, exposed in the extremely expensive showroom in the neighborhood. Ok whatever, let's go emotional. And why not, after all It is a well known brand, that a lot of people are recommending. What could possibly go wrong?! And here you are standing with your perfect, extremely expensive, 4,5 meter long couch, in front of your well arranged, 4 meters long living room. The conclusion- What is a good scheduling system for IPTV? Good guess-The one, that will fit your “living room”. If you are seriously looking to buy such a software and you want to go professional, you should definitely start being the person, that is mainly answering the questions, not asking them. This should be a good start: What kind of TV station we are talking about(music, news, films, mixed)? Do you need only a software to schedule your playlists, or also you want a software to play them out(broadcast a live stream)?Etc...?
