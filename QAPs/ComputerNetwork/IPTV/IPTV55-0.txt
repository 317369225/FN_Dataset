★IPTV: What sort of ARQ (automatic repeat request) and FEC (forward error correction) capabilities are built into streaming media servers?Specifically, I am working on a client / server pair for IPTV streaming which is highly loss resistant.  In that effort, I am trying to understand how many of those error correction tools are already built into the stack or the server platform - or do I need to develop / acquire applications to recover data on top of the RTP streamer.
SMPTE 2022 is one standard for error correction over IPTV but it's more on the professional side. On a traditional IPTV platform which would be multicast based there would be no such form of ARQ.
