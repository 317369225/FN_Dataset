★Why don't IPTV boxes like Apple TV and Roku offer subscription channels or local channels like cable TV?For example, the Discovery channels, Viacom channels like Nickelodeon, NickJr, Comedy Central, etc.  (I'd happily pay monthly for these if it was the same price or less than TWC charges me.)
DISH just announced that they would be offering a bundle of international channels on Roku called DISH world.  What is most significant about this is that the channels are not going direct to consumer, they are being repackaged by the satellite company and then getting delivered OTT over competitors' networks. I doubt very much that DISH could get buy-in to try this with US networks, but given the ad-skipping features they just launched, it seems they may be willing to test some boundaries.
