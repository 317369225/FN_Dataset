★What is stopping IPTV from gathering steam in India?While one could say that the laying new copper does not have a business case and a large portion of the existing copper cannot serve broadband, these are supply side issues that should manifest in an unmet demand.  What is questionable is that even in areas where IPTV is technically feasible, demand does not seem to be picking up.
I guess it boils down to solving a non-existent problem. IPTV offers a compelling solution, but does it offer a superior proposition to what DTH players are offering currently? I believe the satellite players have done a great job of educating the market on why they need to be paid a premium for their service (which, in sheer quantity often falls short of what the local operator offers). Moreover, for telcos that have the capability to serve competitive double-play and triple-play packages, Airtel for instance, their focus on satellite is not helping the cause of IPTV. For an IPTV player, the challenge is to really create/source both compelling local content (a potential differentiator from satellite) and find a good way to get into the home thro' a bundle (PC/TV/telco). Also, although it did not really work out all that well for France Telecom, acquiring rights to premium content (Cricket, Cricket, Cricket) can potentially help in driving the initial uptake, given the seemingly insatiable appetite for such content. And yes, as noted in the question details infrastructural issues on the supply side are a big hindrance in and of themselves, and for IPTV to gain any meaningful traction, they will need to be sorted out first.
