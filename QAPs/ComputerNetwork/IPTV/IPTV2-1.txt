â˜…What is the most relevant design metaphor for UX on IPTV?There are a number of existing metaphors out there like the video rental on Apple TV or the desktop like Google TV. Are these suited? Are there alternatives?
Since "list" or "program" based interfaces obviously don't scale in the infinite world of IPTV, the web (understood as a collection of interlinked documents) seems to be the correct metaphor. However, there is a new gravity center: the player (and its viewer, who is always striving for minimal entropy). So when the lazy viewer signals that he doesn't know where to go to next, we should be able to catch him in a web of documents, possibly trailers, recommended to him by his social graph, based on his taste, his subscriptions, the suggestions of an editorial team etc. When the viewer remains passive, the player should switch to autopilot, playing things that it has accumulated while the viewer was active.
