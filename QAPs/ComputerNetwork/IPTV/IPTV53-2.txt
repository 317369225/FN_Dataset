â˜…Does factory reset of router help in any way if I have problems with my IPTV service?
No, it doesn't make any logic as long as your configuration is correct.. Configuration : Depends on the network infrastructure, contact ISP. I know it's also true that if you complain to customer care guys about any interruption in services, first thing they gonna recommend is to reboot your modem :) Reason being... your they are taught to start troubleshooting from "physical layer" and to make sure that atleast connectivity & modem is proper (sometime modem gets hang due to device fatigue or drops in network).
