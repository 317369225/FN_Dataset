★Where is there more revenue opportunity via second screen interaction?  Tablets and IPTV, or Smartphones and Digital Signage?  What's the basis of your answer?
It's important to understand that unless the transaction is occurring directly through the second screen (e.g. the customer is paying for it through that touch interface), that revenue is generally not generated with the interface. Rather, the interface is transformational toward a revenue generating opportunity. What I mean is that tablets, smart phones, digital signage, etc. are a means to an end. They are designed to get you to spend money down the road. Consider a couple of points: with Smart phone apps, most of them have a purchase capability after you go through the experience a little (think a free game with in-app purchases). For digital signage, it's really just sexy advertising to get you to spending your money elsewhere (in the store or at home later on your computer). The revenue opportunity comes from a couple of solutions. One is advertising. Are you allowing someone to advertise on your technology (meaning do you have a channel - digital signage, tablet platform, etc.) on which other people want your audience's eyeballs? They'll pay for it (although not a lot). The other is the efficacy of your experience. If you have a great experience that moves people on the path toward purchasing, then you have a solid solution in place. Second screen interaction is a means to an end, and therefore a cost center. You'll have to pay to get that experience just right. But, if done right, the revenue opportunity is attainable.
