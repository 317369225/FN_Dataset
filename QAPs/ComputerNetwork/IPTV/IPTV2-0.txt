★What is the most relevant design metaphor for UX on IPTV?There are a number of existing metaphors out there like the video rental on Apple TV or the desktop like Google TV. Are these suited? Are there alternatives?
I don't think there is a single metaphor that exists that will map directly to IPTV as it has some significantly different use cases. The complexity lies in the fact that usage of a TV falls into three main buckets:   Entertainment consumption / distraction (normal tv watching as well as any form of rental or streaming) Information (news, weather etc.) Interactive device (games, and possibly research if used as a computer) The first two might be combined, but I think the use cases are different enough to separate. In particular, informational use cases have already adopted many Web-like metaphors. For example, the use of sidebars and tickers on 24 hour news stations. Sports programming does the same as do a few other channels.   The big issue I see is trying to mix the first two and the third item. People don't enjoy watching others control a game if they aren't playing or browse the Web. I could see a lot of fights breaking out if a couple are on the couch watching a news program and one of them picks up the remote to dig into a sidebar item, while the other is interested in the story being presented. I don't think we've even started to solve some of these problems, much less fully understand the metaphors we'd use to describe the interactions.   So, I think it's important to use metaphor appropriate to the use cases, and in time, we may see a new standard metaphor come to life.
