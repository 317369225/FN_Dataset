â˜…Do IPTV services, such as BT Vision in the UK, run on the "open internet", or do they use separate networks?
It's a straightforward question, with a not so straightforward answer. BT Vision currently runs over the 'open internet' in the UK, which of course is predominantly underpinned by BT's own network. Corporately, the two divisions are completely separated - BT Retail, which provides Vision, is a separate legal entity to Openreach, which provides the last mile copper/fibre connectivity, and BT Wholesale, which manages the core internet backbone. However, what makes it interesting is that BT Wholesale have just launched a new offering, Content Connect, which they have integrated with a content delivery network. This means that internet service providers (such as BT Retail, and their Vision service) can pay BT Wholesale for IP-TV grade connectivity with local content caching, making the TV viewing experience more seamless, and also managing network capacity in a more intelligent way. It could be read into this that BT Vision is likely to not run over the 'Open Internet' in the near future, which has caused a bit of controversy relative to the whole 'net neutrality' debate, but to me it's too simplistic to see it this way. What BT Wholesale have done here is spot a huge problem in the UK internet marketplace - video streaming is consuming massive bandwidth quite inefficiently - and have offered a solution that enables ISPs to manage their capacity better and ultimately offer a better service to consumers. I'm prepared to be shot down for that comment :), but hopefully it answers the question about whether BT Vision operates over the 'open internet'. The major IPTV competitor to BT in the UK is of course Virgin Media - currently their offering is only available in cabled areas, which of course means that their TV service runs over Virgin Media's own fibre/coaxial network.
