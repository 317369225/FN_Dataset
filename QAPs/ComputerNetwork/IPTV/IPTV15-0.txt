★Which of the cable and satellite provides are moving into IPTV?As Comcast and TWC declare to move into IPTV platforms, what are the intentions of other providers regarding this?
All of them in the sense that almost every pay TV provider is moving toward IP infrastructure (usually combined with a smorgasbord of legacy infrastructure).  That also allows them to sell broadband on which they make 70-80% margins. Pay TV providers are facing massive headwinds with content costs (over $50 billion/year in the States) and a max monthly bill customers will pay for their services.  Their future is bundling and pay TV is becoming a sunk cost of selling more profitable offerings.
