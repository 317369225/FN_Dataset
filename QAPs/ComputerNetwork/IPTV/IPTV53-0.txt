★Does factory reset of router help in any way if I have problems with my IPTV service?
Generally, a router reset can clear a persistent glitch or unexpected behavior. But Kok-Yong makes a great point... It is likely that your router has a settings-file export feature. Use it before resetting. Then, upgrade to the latest firmware after the reset. Don’t do this if the router has custom firmware features or settings to support your ISP/cable company. Either check with them or study the router version history to determine if you are likely to overwrite custom firmware). If all else fails, try swapping routers. Note, that I said “swap” and not “substitute”. That means, try installing a good router on your network while also testing your original router (suspected to have problems) at another home or network that was working properly before the switch. When you suspect component failure in any complex system, installing a new component is never as revealing a full swap test. Good luck!
