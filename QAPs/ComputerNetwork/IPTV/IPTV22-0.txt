â˜…how effectively data used for IPTV is managed?
A subset of the question will be, how do IPTV companies optimise data-storage and transmission. 1. CDN Technology Most IPTV providers use CDNs to deliver content. The goal of a CDN is to serve content to end-users with high availability and high performance. CDNs typically achieve their goal by caching data at multiple nodes and delivering content to the user from the most optimal route. CDN's also provide a platform to let content providers push data into their network. 2. Adaptive bit-rate Adaptive bit-rate as now supported by many protocols adjusts the quality of stream based on the network congestion level. This technique allows users to continue getting streams at the highest quality that network can support. 3. Compression Technologies Most video streams are compressed using H.264/H.263/AVC codecs. Similarly high quality audios is compressed using AAC, ALC, SLS standards.
