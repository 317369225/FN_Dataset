★Why don't IPTV boxes like Apple TV and Roku offer subscription channels or local channels like cable TV?For example, the Discovery channels, Viacom channels like Nickelodeon, NickJr, Comedy Central, etc.  (I'd happily pay monthly for these if it was the same price or less than TWC charges me.)
Josh is right on about DISH World.  I noticed it on Roku yesterday.  By they way, a vast array of subscription channels are available on Roku.  Simply put, the pay TV model is far too good for most TV nets and broadcast affiliates to offer full services OTT.  Pay TV channels collect billions in subscriber fees from service providers (led by ESPN, of course), broadcast nets are charging local affiliates (reverse retrans), and local affiliates are charging big bucks to service providers (retrans) to carry local stations that still have a vastly larger audience than almost all cable channels.  Nevermind their tens of billions in annual ad revenue, tidy ancillary revenue through pay TV VOD and new licensing cash for TV Everywhere streaming rights. Exceptions to this trend include Wealth TV (great net, on pay TV, first in the pool on Roku with a full 24/7 channel and 3D channel, also available on other connected platforms) and Entertainment Studios (great content, six nets available on Roku and other platforms).  It's a tightrope but there are ways channels can use their OTT presence to drive their pay TV audience.  But that's another discussion.
