★What is the IMS client for Ubuntu which can support IPtv?I have been trying UCT IMS client and it crashed and MyMonster TCS too
IMS is Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem.  One example : This IMS system have 6 component : P-CSCF  -- The Proxy  Call Session Control Functions S-CSCF  --  The Serving Call Session Control Functions I-CSCF  --  The Interrogating Call Session Control Functions HSS  --  A Home Subscriber Server Media Broadcast Server  UCT IPTV (UCT Advanced IPtv) as server      UCT may have crashed due to dependencies problem. Post this question in Ubuntu forums for more information and solution to your problem. Are all the six components present in your system ? If not install the missing.
