★Is there any technical data available to support claims of “best HD picture quality” when choosing a satellite, cable or IPTV service provider?Can anyone truly lay claim to having the best HD picture quality?
It's extremely hard to quantify "best" in a way that will satisfy everyone, and even more so to do it in a way that can be objectively measured. You can measure things like resolution, and bit-rate for a channel, and claim that a channel delivered with a higher bit rate will always be better than one with a lower one, and as a rule of thumb, that's broadly accurate. However, there are other factors too - for example, a live stream may need a higher bit rate than a recorded one which has been subject to multi-pass encoding. If capacity on an IP link is not sufficient, do the bit rate and resolution matter, if you only receive a few seconds of perfect HD before the system pauses and buffers? Codecs differ, and even when using the same codec, different encoders can behave differently at the same bit rate; when the BBC HD channel in the UK introduced new encoders, certain types of material (some fades) caused serious problems for them. And, in some cases, viewers find that the effects that are used, such as a 'film' effect, or facial processing, can have an impact on perceived picture quality, over and above issues such as bit rate, as of course can other aspects of the filming or production process. At the extremes, a channel that broadcasts pre-recorded, multi-pass encoded pictures of static objects, or slow pans over beautiful scenery, could produce pictures that look better, at a lower bit rate, than one that is relaying a busy live sports event in real time at a higher bit rate. So ultimately, while the technical parameters of a service will give you some idea of what to expect, they can't really form the basis of a verifiable claim to have the best quality, in isolation. You have to consider the type of content too.
