â˜…How does Boxee's content compare to other IPTV offerings in Australia?
I don't know the IPTV market in Australia but boxee is more a service hosting different applications like feeds, and some multimedia content like youtube or vimeo. You can also add some repositories you find on the web. You can also add Navi-x which is a great video services with lots of movies, series and networks. I would recommend searching on the net for specific australian content.
