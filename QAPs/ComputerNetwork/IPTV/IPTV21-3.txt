★Why don't IPTV boxes like Apple TV and Roku offer subscription channels or local channels like cable TV?For example, the Discovery channels, Viacom channels like Nickelodeon, NickJr, Comedy Central, etc.  (I'd happily pay monthly for these if it was the same price or less than TWC charges me.)
They do! here is a sky version of Roku box, steaming high quality sports channel in the UK. Live Sports Online - Stream Live Football, Rugby and more Whats more It's only for a tenner (£10).
