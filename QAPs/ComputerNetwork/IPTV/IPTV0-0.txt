â˜…How is IPTV advertising bought?
It depends on whether you mean service provider sponsored IPTV or a direct to consumer offering. Generally, direct to consumer offerings like Hulu, amazon prime and others employ what's called "ad networks" each of which provide sell side tools to brands against all of the video and display ad site traffic they partner with. This follows an internet CPM impression as a model. The more traffic the more money they charge brands. From a service provider perspective I.e. Cable and telco operators it's a new hybrid model that joins the previous approach to their legacy digital program insertion and employs their existing "own" ad sales groups to sell to brands. At the present time as their viewers on IPTV are still less than on set top boxes, they seem to "throw it in" with their existing ad relationship for free until such a time where viewer numbers get large. However it's already been proven that targeted advertising videos on IPTV in stream are extremely more effective than set top box legacy based ones operators provide.
