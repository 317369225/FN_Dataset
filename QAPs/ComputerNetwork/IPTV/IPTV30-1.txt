â˜…IPTV: Who are the big players when in comes to video on demand services in Europe?I'm working on a list of European prospects for a service designed to boost sales for video-on-demand/online film rental/movie streaming services.I need to find players that address consumers through any and all digital channels - IPTV set-top boxes, web, media players, tablets, smartphones etc. Someone who can help me?
As far as I know in the UK and the Nordic countries Netflix is pretty big. For Germany I can say there are 4 VoD services Lovefilm (also UK), Watchever, Maxdome and Snap (Sky). Here in Germany the whole VoD thing is just starting so I can't really say which one is the biggest.
