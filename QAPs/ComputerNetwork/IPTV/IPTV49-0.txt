★IPTV: Why do some content providers heavily restrict the availability of their content online?
There are various reasons that content doesn't go on-line: 1. Security: some content providers are fearful of the internet, believe it to be the Devils work and that no amount of software can protect their precious. 2. Rights: some times the rights that are negotiated don't allow a service to put content on-line, I have seen this done because an artist, writer or producer wouldn't sign off on this (but this is increasingly rare) but mostly this is because the rights for broadcast and on-line are separated, thus if a show airs on a network they may not want to pay extra for the on-line rights as well or the rights provider may be holding out for a different deal. 3. Physical media sales: some content providers still believe they can maximise their revenues through the sale of physical copies of their content. Extra sources of that content are may reduce the physical media sales volumes. Thus if the content is only available on Bluray or DVD then people will be compelled to go down that route. 4. Cable competition: If content is available 'off net' and is available on-demand or 'à la carte', instead of in a cable subscription bundle, then a cable company might see and increase in 'churn' from subscribers leaving to go to a cheaper on-line package. The balance to this is that if a cable company makes their packages available 'off net' they may increase their reach beyond their physical network and increase customer satisfaction.
