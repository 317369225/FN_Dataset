â˜…What can an IPTV set-top box do that Android TV can't?Can we not have an IPTV set-top-box? Can't we use an Android app on the Android TV instead? Is this technically not possible right now?
Talking about Sky Box. Pause, rewind, schedule and record up to 200-400 hours of content. Get content directly from Satellite, on data rates that Internet based platforms can only dream off. (about 10Mbps per channel and 100s of continuous channels in HD). Obviously it can also use Internet connection for VoD if available. Have a proper remote, not fiddling with poorly designed things they call remotes. Most importantly it has the content, sports, movies, TV shows that cannot be shown on other platforms legally.
