â˜…Are MCN and IPTV the next big things in media distribution?
That would depend on what you mean. IPTV is not new and has been around for over a decade so I wouldn't say it was the next big anything. However, OTT video and http streaming video are still being adopted and there are many cable providers who still have not moved to embrace this, so for them IPTV and OTT video may be the next big thing. So I guess the answer is - yes for some people and not for others.
