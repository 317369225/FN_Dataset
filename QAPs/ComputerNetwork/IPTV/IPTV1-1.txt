â˜…What is a good scheduling system for IPTV?I am looking for a software that let me create video playlists and schedule the playlist to broadcast in a live stream
This is generally going to be called Master Control software, and it will manage the scheduling of the video events, as well as optionally graphics events, and other important events, like affilate tones and what not. Miranda's Omnibus, Pebble Beach, Building4Media, and Sundance all make serious Master Control Products. Playbox and a few others make 'station in a box' solutions that will schedule, play clips, and over lay GFX all in one box.
