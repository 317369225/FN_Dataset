â˜…How do iptv box service providers get access to stream content like aljazeera, discovery channel, etc?Is it legal?
This could be tricky, both HW and SW shall be able to support external internet content. IP connection, codec support, enough CPU and memory, etc If the box software stack support Internet elements at least partially (html for content navigation, hls or smooth streaming transport, h.264 codecs) then you need to adapt the UI and integrate the service through ab internet connection. This assume the HW is capable and content isn't DRM'd; if it is then the box shall have the content provider DRM integrated and integration with the content provider DRM license server (usually imply an agreement with the cp) If the box doesn't provide an internet enabled stack then real time transcoding at the head end is a possibility although non optimal In any case non trivial
