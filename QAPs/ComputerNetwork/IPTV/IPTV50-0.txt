â˜…What is the best conference to go to / have a booth at if you're a B2B tech startup with a product for cable, iptv and vod providers?MIPTV? MIPCOM, IBC, NAB Show? SXSW? Other?
NAB and IBC are both heavily attended by real industry folks - nothing else is. Broadcast Asia is OK if you want to put a lot of effort into that part of the world, tho most of the real players in Asia attend NAB. I've done CCW, HD World, etc - and nothing else really feels worth it.
