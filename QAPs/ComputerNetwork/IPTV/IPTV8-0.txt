★What is stopping IPTV from gathering steam in India?While one could say that the laying new copper does not have a business case and a large portion of the existing copper cannot serve broadband, these are supply side issues that should manifest in an unmet demand.  What is questionable is that even in areas where IPTV is technically feasible, demand does not seem to be picking up.
Broadband penetration is abysmal overall, and even in major cities, the reliability of internet providers is quite poor.  My experience is that the digital satellite and cable providers are more reliable.  When the power goes off in my neighborhood, the internet always burps, but the cable and digital satellite continue, provided that you have a battery backup.  It will take quite a while before IPTV can be a reality for more than just a few in India.
