★Where is there more revenue opportunity via second screen interaction?  Tablets and IPTV, or Smartphones and Digital Signage?  What's the basis of your answer?
Producing video is expensive. I like to think revenue comes when the customer whips out their credit card and makes a purchase on their desktop computer or mobile device in some cases. This process, I like to think can best facilitated by the Web, though I have no evidence to prove this is the case yet. Cost wise multi / second screen interaction is best done on the Web.
