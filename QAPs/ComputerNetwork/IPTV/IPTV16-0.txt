★What's the next big thing in IPTV?
The so-called "unbundling" of cable.  HBO led the way by announcing a standalone HBO service, to be available in 2015. This was immediately followed by CBS, the only US broadcast network that does not put new content on Hulu (they do have catalog content there) launching it's own Hulu-like service called CBS All Access. The legacy broadcasters are putting their shows online as a response to Netflix's success with original programming, while not trying to hurt its longstanding businesses.
