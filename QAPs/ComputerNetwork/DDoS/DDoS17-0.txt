★Does AWS EC2 offer DDoS protection?
Scaling up additional server instances will cost you a lot off money also . There is an Apache module that was created to prevent a DDoS attack, Follow these steps to  install the module. 1. Open your terminal window ssh to your server . 2. Issue the command sudo apt-get -y install libapache2-mod-evasive. 3. Issue the command sudo mkdir -p /var/log/apache2/evasive. 4. Issue the command sudo chown -R www-data:root /var/log/apache2/evasive. 5. Open the /etc/apache2/mods-available/mod-evasive.load file (using sudo and your favorite text editor) and append the following to the bottom of that file (this is one configuration per line): DOSHashTableSize 2048 DOSPageCount 20  # maximum number of requests for the same page DOSSiteCount 300  # total number of requests for any object by the same client IP on the same listener DOSPageInterval 1.0 # interval for the page count threshold DOSSiteInterval 1.0  # interval for the site count threshold DOSBlockingPeriod 10.0 # time that a client IP will be blocked for DOSLogDir “/var/log/apache2/evasive” DOSEmailNotify admin@domain.com 6. Save the file and restart Apache. You should now be better protected from DDoS attacks.
