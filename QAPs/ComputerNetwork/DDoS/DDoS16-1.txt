★What is the scale of a real-life DDoS attack?
About 25% of all DoS attacks studied in a 2006 paper involved more than 200 source IP addresses [Mao 2006]. A March 2011 attack against WordPress.com involved "multiple Gigabits per second and tens of millions of packets per second" [WordPress 2011]. Even if we assume that the attack saturated the 5 Mbps (on average) connections of infected zombie hosts, it must have used more than 1200 zombies. That's the lower bound based on a conservative assumption that the rate was 20 million of 40-byte packets per second. For 60-byte packets and 1 Mbps average zombie bandwidth, the estimated number of zombies would grow to almost 10,000. The most powerful attack during Q2 of 2011 reported by Kaspersky Lab used up 500 Mbps of bandwidth. The average power of DDoS attacks was 70 Mbps [Kaspersky 2011]. Out of more than 600 DDoS attacks that Highload Lab was asked to mitigate during 2010, 15 attacks were more than 1 Gbps, 4 attacks were more than 3 Gpps and 2 attacks were more than 5 Gbps [Lyamin 2011]. In another incident where a Russian tech news site was attacked, Highload Lab reported 9000 requests per second at peak and 4500 unique IPs [Habrahabr 2011]. Prolexic reports on a largest DDoS attack on an Asian e-commerce company that reached 25 million packets per second from 176,000 zombies. Typical attacks previously involved from 5,000 to 10,000 bots [Prolexic 2011]. The largest DDoS attack recorded by Akamai in 2009 reached 125 Gbps peak traffic, 795,000 requests per second, 98,000 unique IPs in 30 minutes and 300,000 unique IPs total [Akamai 2011]. A user of the Google App Engine issue tracker described two types of attacks they encounter regularly. The usual type was 10,000–20,000 bots with unique IPs, 20–50 Mbps. The less frequent type was 50,000–70,000 bots, 50–500 thousands requests per second, 200–400 Mbps peak [Max oizo biz 2010]. [Mao 2006] http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/...
