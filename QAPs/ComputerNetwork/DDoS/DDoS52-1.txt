â˜…How does the "Anonymous" hacker group DDOS such a large website such as Mastercard/Visa/Amazon?Where do they get that power?
Nathan's response is on point, but it is also important to point out that DDoS attacks are most often successful as a result of a vulnerability in the target's defenses. We learn through the media that major companies sometimes fail to plan for such attacks, resulting in somewhat embarrassing repercussions. Financial companies in particular have generally focused on the confidentiality and integrity of their information services and many failed to adequately plan for attacks against availability. My company recently consulted for one bank who required protection against what they believed were 40 Gbps attacks. Upon implementation, we discovered that the actual problem was less than 1 Mbps of traffic against a highly vulnerable online banking platform, which would buckle under the pressure of only a few thousand SSL requests. This problem was compounded by the fact that their main web site was tied into the online banking platform, causing each malicious request against the site to impact the vulnerable system. This years attacks by the al-Qassam Cyber Fighters against U.S. banking infrastructure has caused banks and other financial institutions to rethink their approach on DDoS defense.
