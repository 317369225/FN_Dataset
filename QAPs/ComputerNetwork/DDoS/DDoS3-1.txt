★How dangerous is a DDoS attack?
It would be good to define "dangerous". A DDoS makes your site unresponsive (somehow or completely) If you are in online business then it means money loss and reputation loss. If this is how your company or organization is visible then it means reputation loss. If the site depends on other sites (or vice versa) then it may mean loss of data, or integrity problems. Your site may not run after the attack and data may be inconsistent. If the site is used for operations involving human safety (some kind of c&c service for instance) , then human safety is at stake. If the site is my blog nobody notices. A DDoS attack is meant to disrupt your visibility and accessibility on Internet,  it is not usually meant to "hack" you in the traditional way (i.e. find vulnerabilities to get into the site and do bad stuff on data). So it really depends on how you define danger for a specific case. This is called a risk assessment.
