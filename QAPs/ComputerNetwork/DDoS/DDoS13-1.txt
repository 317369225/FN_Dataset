★How does one perform a DDoS attack?
Go outside your favorite shopping center with 100 of your friends.  All at once, have everyone try to walk in the front door at the same time.  Since the front door can't fit everyone you'll end up stuck outside the door. When everyday shoppers try to use the front door, they won't be able to get in past your mass of friends.
