★What is the state-of-the-art in DDoS protection?I am looking for a technical review. How does Amazon, for instance, protect against DDoS, having been a victim multiple times in the past?
I have no idea.  However, a thought occurred to me: The best defense against mass, distributed PC misbehaviour, would be mass collaboration by routers.
