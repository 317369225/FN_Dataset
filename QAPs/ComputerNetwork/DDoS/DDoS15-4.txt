★What are the plug-and-play solutions to DOS/DDOS attacks?Is there any software or system that you can use or put in front of your servers that can protect your servers from DOS/DDOS attacks? What are the approaches of companies like Facebook/Google/Twitter/Quora to DOS/DDOS?
Getting behind a cloud based CDN can and will solve your problem. Prolexic provides a good service but it will cost you and 300Gbps is much too much for most sites. 9 time out of 10 best DDos protection can be achieved simply by prevention. What I mean is, for most a DDos attack will start with a visit from a scanner bot that will try to estimate site security measures and vulnerabilities. After all, unless you own a prominent website, you won`t be singled out by a potential attacker. The truth is most sites get DDos simply because they posses detectable vulnerabilities.  So, best and most "cost-effective" solution will be a cloud CDN bundled up with WAF and other bad bots blocking features. I work at Incapsula (Imperva subsidiary) and here we offer you a PCI compliant cloud based WAF for "front-gate" protection and a global CDN network for "after the fact" DDos mitigation. Our main goal is to provide the same affordable high-grade security for all members of our community, be it fortune 500 companies or small and medium businesses. http://www.incapsula.com/ http://website-security-and-perf...
