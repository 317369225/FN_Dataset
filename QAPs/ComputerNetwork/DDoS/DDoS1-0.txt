â˜…What is DDoS?
Let's start with DOS. It is "Denial Of Service". A "service" is basically provided by a "server". Google provides "Search" service. Gmail provides "Email" service. StackOverflow provides "Q&A" service and the list goes on. In the era of information security, attackers target these servers and make them useless such that they cannot provide service. This attack is termed as "Denial Of Service" attack. Well, the term DOS, itself explains this much. Now pretty often if a server is attacked from a single source then it is termed as DOS attack. This suits well in situations where server is weak in handling load. The servers nowadays are pretty huge and can handle great loads. It is not possible to attack them from a single source, so the attackers attack the server from various sources and hence that is called "Distributed Denial Of Service" attack. How does attackers do this is a whole new concept in itself. To be short, here comes the concept of botnets. I hope this will clear your doubt.
