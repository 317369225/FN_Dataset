â˜…How does the "Anonymous" hacker group DDOS such a large website such as Mastercard/Visa/Amazon?Where do they get that power?
"They" download the LOIC program, coordinate their attacks on IRC, and once a target is determined in the hive, the LOIC can be set on "autopilot", allowing the participating Anon's computer to send thousands of requests to the targeted site at the direction of the HIVE. essentially, It's like a protest: tons of people congregating in front of a building to slow down access to that building and draw attention to their cause. Instead of people and buildings, however, it's computers and websites. The effect of a DDOS attack is the exact same as a massive surge in the number of people viewing that site. It does no damage to a site: again, just like a protest, it simply slows down access to prove a point. As for coordinating, the current model they seem to use has a small number of people with access or control of botnets to initiate the attack. Once publicized (Such as YourAnonNews on Twitter) the less informed/skilled folks who self-identify with Anonymous join in with their own computer.
