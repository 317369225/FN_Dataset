â˜…Is there any specific algorithm to prevent a DDoS attack?I am looking to know if there is any specific algorithm(flow diagram) to differentiate between a legitimate user and a malicious user? If there is no specific algorithm, then how exactly does Arbor Network and similar security providers implement DDoS mitigation/prevention attacks? It would be nice if the answer could hold sufficient explanation (if any algorithm mentioned).
The set of all possible types of DDoS is very large. No single algorithm can solve this problem. It is better to consider the problem in reverse -- you have only so many resources, how do you fairly share them to your best/real users. Most people focus on DDoS as a 'block the bad' but it could also be thought as 'favour the good' and perhaps be more successful. This requires integration with the application layer -- application intelligence, which is not something most applications have. But ultimately it's where we'll have to get to to better solve this problem. Also, we should be measuring our network application throughput capabilities -- how many requests CAN they handle? How does the application perform under different types of workloads? This step, if done even in a basic way in a day, is invaluable as most organizations do not know the upper limits of what performance can be reached by a deployment of a technology. This is not the same as load/stress testing in QA and application development. Once an application is deployed in the real world it becomes part of a complex system of inter-connected dependencies that should be tested.
