★What is the state-of-the-art in DDoS protection?I am looking for a technical review. How does Amazon, for instance, protect against DDoS, having been a victim multiple times in the past?
This question was interesting so I tried to do some digging but no luck on if there is actual proceses used to stop DDOS attacks.  From the articles I read seems that Amazon is simply too large for a DDOS to effect them.  'Anonymous' basically didn't even try when they realized they didn't have the resources to take on amazon. http://money.cnn.com/2010/12/09/...
