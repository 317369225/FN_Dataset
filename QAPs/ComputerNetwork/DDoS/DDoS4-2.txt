â˜…What is a DDoS attack?
Ddos in layman terms means filling anything more than it's capacity to break it down. For example if a bridge can hold 100 people at a time and you fill it with 1000 it will eventually stumble and fall down. Other small scenario of ddos which most of us have experienced is during result declaration on university websites. It is not based on os like linux or windows but rather on networking capacity. Therefore ddos can work on any os with networking capability. Wikipedia it for more technical description and poc of ddos attacks can be found on hacktivits site like exploit-db. Ps. Ddos is illegal without permission ,so use it for educational purpose
