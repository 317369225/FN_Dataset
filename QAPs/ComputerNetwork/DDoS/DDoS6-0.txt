★Who was responsible for the DDoS Attack on Reddit?
Most of the DDOs that happen do not have a big time motive as such, anyone with a  large enough  botnet and feeling bored usually hit's any of the popular sites. In some cases like the huge attack few weeks ago has clear motives but majority of them are just  techies trolling the web. It could be any of the hundreds of a hacker groups and a single hacker himself trying to just show off. On average google gets hit 10-20 times a day from different botnets. I tried looking up any mentioned somewhere on the deep-net for any mention of who it maybe could not find anything.
