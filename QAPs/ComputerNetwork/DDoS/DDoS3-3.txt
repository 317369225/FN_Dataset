â˜…How dangerous is a DDoS attack?
It depends on the target that is being DDoS'ed and which functionality is affected. Go back to the simple meaningof DoS, which is Denial of Service. Now to know how dangerous it can be, think how dangerous would it be for the service provider not to be able to offer it, and how dangerous to the service receiver if he doesn't receive the service. This can vary from the very benign inability to offer an online game with a little number of users, to being fatal if it affects a life supporting system. That's how dangerous a DoS can be, to understand how dangerous a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)can be, just multiply the level of danger of a DoS by the number of attackers it's emanating from to make it "Distributed".
