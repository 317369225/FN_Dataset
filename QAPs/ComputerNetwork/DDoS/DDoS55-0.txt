â˜…Will the linking of Baidu analytic scripts to the Github DDoS attack hurt Baidu?
I'm not an expert on this kind of thing, but i seriously doubt it will hurt Baidu in any real way. It might be put under pressure to do whatever it can to prevent this from happening again, but I don't see any real negative outcome for them because: 1. I had no idea Baidu existed prior to this incident and I don't think that many people outside of China did either. As a result of this, I think most people might have some sort of "meh" attitude towards Baidu itself at this point. 2. I'm not sure the people that actually use Baidu would really care. There might be a lot more disastrous repercussions if more people become convinced that the attack was perpetrated by Chinese officials, and that it is an act of war.
