â˜…What is a DDoS attack?
Distributed Denial of Service. First of all, a "denial of service" attack is any attack that prevents legitimate users from accessing a service. This can be done a number of ways depending on the type of system and what kinds of DoS attacks it's vulnerable to. For example flooding a web server with a large amount of fake traffic can prevent it from responding to real users. A distributed denial of service attack uses many computers around the internet, often under control of a botnet, to overwhelm the service. The resources of the system (bandwidth, CPU, RAM, etc) are consumed by this traffic, preventing users from accessing it.
