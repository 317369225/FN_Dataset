â˜…Why would someone DDoS an unimportant site?Our site (Umbra Software) has been under a DDoS attack on/off for a couple of days now. As we are in b2b business, our traffic is quite small and we have not done anything controversial that would anger hackers. Why would anyone target our site for DDoS?
