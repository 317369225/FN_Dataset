â˜…What are the plug-and-play solutions to DOS/DDOS attacks?Is there any software or system that you can use or put in front of your servers that can protect your servers from DOS/DDOS attacks? What are the approaches of companies like Facebook/Google/Twitter/Quora to DOS/DDOS?
As a service based provider of DDoS mitigation solutions, I often consult with and field test hardware solutions that are made available to us. This question is now about 18 months old, and our industry is very fluid so I feel an update is in order. As Faisal mentioned, Arbor is a dominant force in the U.S. market however on the global stage one must also consider NSFOCUS. Our company has been using a substantial amount of NSFOCUS gear in the past year with resounding success. I believe that Radware is also worth of consideration. For those not wishing to purchase hardware, there are many plug and play service offerings available such as cloud based WAF services for those only needing to protect a web site or BGP routed solutions for those needing to protect entire networks. Service based solutions are extremely popular as it can take over 10 years to realize ROI on a hardware solution. Unfortunately, not all hardware solutions are nearly as viable as I would like. The best in breed 10 Gbps systems I have tested are all priced in the realm of about $200 - 300k due partially to the fact that these systems are ASIC based, or in other words are purpose built for DDoS attack filtering and capable of line rate handling. There are x86 based platforms that fail to perform under heavy load despite manufacturer claims.
