★How many people need to participate in a DDoS attack for it to take effect?In the Anonymous DDoS attacks on Scientology and Mastercard etc. there were thousands of participants it seems, but is it necessary with this many?
One single person can take down a network of sites. It all depends on attack methods/types. Early Anonymous attacks used low-level tools (like LOIC) and depended on number of participants to take down high profiled targets, However, other types of DDoS can be executed single-handedly.  For example, if you gain access to website, you can inject it with backdoor and use it as a DDoS attack station. In this case you will be using server resources, which will allow you to do much more damage then you could with your own PC (like in Anon attacks). Here is an example of one such scenario. http://www.incapsula.com/the-inc... Also, today you can simply rent a Botnet  (cluster of compromised PCs and/or servers) and use them for DDoS. Price tag can be as low as just $50.... This may sounds cheap and ineffective but in reality such attacks can cause a lot of damage. Here's one example: How I stopped Zeiko - A lesson in good manners (or why Lucia was banned from T-I) It's not about the numbers anymore, and even Anon is now breaking into smaller groups that work independently while still following the same general agenda.
