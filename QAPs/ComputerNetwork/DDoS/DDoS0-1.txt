â˜…Is a DDoS attack illegal?What laws govern the legality of DDoS attacks? How do laws work for attacks across national borders?
Between countries that have signed it, the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime could also apply if the DDoS attack was planned by a group of people (very likely), even if the source country doesn't have a specific law against DDoS attacks. If the target country has an applicable crime on the books which carries a sentence of at least 4 years, the source country would have to investigate and likely extradite the perpetrators. For example, if a group in Belarus launched a DDoS attack against a target in the US, the US could demand cooperation under the Convention even if Belarus didn't have a law against DDoS.
