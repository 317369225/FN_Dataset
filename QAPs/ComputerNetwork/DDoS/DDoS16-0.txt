â˜…What is the scale of a real-life DDoS attack?
Largest DDoS encountered was about 10Gbps as reported by the Hosting Provider (in this case Rackspace). DDoS size was about 3 million PPS almost. About 8,000 unique IPs, lasted for about 1 hour almost until the IP that was being attacked was null-routed (I'm sure the attack could have lasted much longer). The Honeypot project keeps a good job at managing such IPs. You also might want to go to www.dos-attacks.com - and look under the Resources tab on the right for additional links.
