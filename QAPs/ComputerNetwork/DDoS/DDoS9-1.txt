â˜…Is Android phones prone to DDOS attacks?
I would think that you would need to have a service you're providing - the s in ddos. Something listening on some port on your phone for some reason to get overwhelmed. I'm not aware of apps that would work like that, hosting a web server or something. To push data to an android client, there are apis that go through Google servers through a secure (?) channel to particular apps rather than sending raw tcp to the phone from the wild Internet. Presumably they could throttle them and have security etc. I guess some non android server that android app uses could get slammed which may cause a particular android app to be unresponsive. One wonderful and terrible thing about android is that it's relatively easy to write an app that does anything, so while I think that ddos isn't generally an issue on android, one could theoretically write an app that is vulnerable. But that app would have to be popular enough that evildoers know about it and can be looking for it to hit. Finally, I don't think that android clients can easily have static ip addresses or dynamic dns entries, so there's no easy way to find the phones, except through Google apis. That said, I'm no android security expert, and for all I know there are particular defenses like firewalls in place, or there may be some something that listens on some port.
