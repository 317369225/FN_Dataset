â˜…What are the best practices to protect yourself from DDos attacks on AWS?
Here are a couple ideas. There are a number of strategies in addition, but this should get you started. Also realize that amazon gets ddos'd on a frequent basis and their systems tend to have a few heuristics that harden them (and therefore you) from these attacks, particularly if you are using Elastic load balancing, which you should be using anyway. Use a CDN -- they often have ways of detecting and defending against ddos. Akamai, mastery, or amazons own cloud front. Use iptables to blacklist offensive ips. The more tooling you have around this, the faster you can blok/unblock Use throttling mechanisms to prevent large numbers of requests Automatically deny requests that are very large (say greater than 1-2mb; unless you have a photo uploading service or similar) before they get to your application Prevent cascading failures by placing a limit on the total number of connections to other components in your system; for example, dont let your database server become overloaded by opening a thousand connections to it. Hire a good operations engineer. ;)
