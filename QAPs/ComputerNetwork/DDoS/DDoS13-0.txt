★How does one perform a DDoS attack?
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attacks can be done in two ways only: (1). By employing a collaborative "people" power. Meaning, having a coordinated group consisting of 100s if not 1000s of people sending traffic (genuine and/or malicious) to a target to take them down (e.g. Anonymous Group and their attacks by using LOIC) (2). By employing a collaborative "computing nodes" power. Meaning, having a coordinated (read: controlled) group of computer in the 100s if not 1000s sending traffic (genuine and/or malicious) to a target to take them down (e.g. a Botnet). Hosts (or Targets) are bought down by a combination of two scenarios below (either or both): a. So many requests are sent in that the server's ability to serve these requests are overwhelmed and it cannot do so (this could equally apply to the router and its ability to handle packet processing load).  In this manner, the incoming traffic load per second, way exceeds the per second serving capability of the host infrastructure. b. Alternatively, you can have hosts with very high computing and serving power, but you can flood the street, i.e. flood their bandwidth pipes, saturate them with so much bogus traffic that even genuine requests would have a hard time getting through. Say, your host has a 1,000Mbps pipe for its web traffic. If you were to send an attack traffic of 1200Mbps, not only do you flood the pipe completely, you have excess 200Mbps traffic that is fighting to get in. Now imagine 1Mbps of genuine traffic trying to get in - a lot many requests for genuine traffic would be denied. Today, most of the attacks done are via privately controlled Botnets. Though I will not tell you how to put together a botnet, suffice to say, if you are able to get your hands on one, they will usually do the DDoS for you.
