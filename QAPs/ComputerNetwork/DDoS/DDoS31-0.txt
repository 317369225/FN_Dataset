â˜…How do sites like Quora, Facebook, Yelp handle DDoS attacks?Are there any libraries that people use to handle these?
I doubt with the size of Facebook, etc. Fb will actually request the IP transit to blackhole. two reasons for this: 1. FB runs its own ASN (32934) and you can see their peering diagram here - http://www.robtex.com/as/as32934... - so FB can do all the blackholing or filtering etc. themselves. The do not rely on upstream providers to do this, and to the best of my knowledge, FB does not employ such, because of the global audience they cater to. 2. FB (for example) employs various devices for DDoS mitigation, primarily amongst them being Arbor Networks. 3. Large organization like FB et. al., are very uniquely able to handle 10 millions of requests per minute or even second. A DDoS attack they can filter via varying mechanism, (for example the Arbor Network device they employ - PeakFlow SP) along with TMS (Threat Management System), they can very easily identify, filter/block and scrub the offending packet off their network. This is done by by Network Behavior Analyzer (NBA), which learns to understand baseline (genuine) traffic and any anomalies. Because of the very large setups (both in BW and in Computing) it is not an easy task to take FB down via virtue of a HTTP request or by SYN flooding it for example.
