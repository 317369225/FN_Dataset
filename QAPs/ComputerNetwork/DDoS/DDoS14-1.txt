★How do you plan for a DDoS attack?
If you are planning to launch a DdOS attack then you have two options. 1. If you are using Windows then you can use LOIC (Low Orbit ion Cannon, available in Sourceforge ) but for that .NET framework 3.5  should be installed on your computer. 2.If you are using Linux then you have got plenty of options for doing that. you can use Slowloris, PyLoris etc. :)
