★How much does it cost to protect your website against DDOS, by tier?
Hi Today you don`t need "Google money" to have a DDoS protection. Our company provides enterprise grade DDoS mitigation + PCI compliant WAF +  CDN acceleration for very affordable prices. We can achieve this by using global Cloud CDN network and many of our clients are SMBs and not just fortune 500 companies. Our service is base on a layered protection module. Layer 1 - Our bad bot protection features. Regarding DDoS, these will stop scanner bots that act as a vanguard for the attack to come, thus preventing it from ever happening.  Layer 2 - Our Imperva enterprise grade WAF that acts a a "front gate keeper". This is a game-changing technology and its the only Cloud based WAF in existence. This will sop application DDoS, SQL injections and other hack attempts. Layer 3 - Our Global Network itself that will "swallow" up all DDoS attempts that got thru the first 2 layers. If you want to try us our we offer full support and 14 day trial policy and you can also contact me for any additional details. Best Regards, Igal @Incapsula
