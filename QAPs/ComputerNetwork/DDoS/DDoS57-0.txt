â˜…How does the "Anonymous" group set up and decide on websites to DDOS?
Anonymous is not a specific group and many factions of Anonymous will often disagree with each other. They'll often remind us, "We are Anonymous, not unanimous." Targets of Anonymous are most often groups or companies which impede upon the rights of others. Anonymous members generally consider themselves online activists and use DDoS as a form of protest. They're typically very left leaning and have been involved in numerous causes over the years. Some of their attacks have been against fringe religious groups, companies with allegedly poor environmental practices, or any other entity that the Anonymous collective decides, essentially through a "show of hands" impedes upon the rights of others. Anonymous DDoS campaigns have been of varying success. Recently, many of their DDoS efforts have completely fizzled such as OpIsrael from earlier this year (see: Experts hope for another failure in next Anonymous attack). My first hand experience with Anonymous has been in providing DDoS protection for the Westboro Baptist Church, no introduction required. While the site did receive some DDoS attacks, they were not effective. Anonymous was more successful in leveraging their power in numbers to protest the group online and in person, effectively preventing them from picketing after the Newtown school shootings. My company remained neutral throughout the evolution by continuing to guarantee DDoS protection to the group's information systems, while donating all proceeds (see: Hired by the Westboro Baptist Church, web security provider to donate revenue raised to charity). While Anonymous has power in numbers, their lack of unanimity impacts their ability to effectively launch coordinated attacks, known in Anonymous circuits as Operations.
