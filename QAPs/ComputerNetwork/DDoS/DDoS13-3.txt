★How does one perform a DDoS attack?
It's not too hard. Step 1.  Get a bunch of computers together. You could do this by building a botnet, or commandeering a bunch of computers at your university's network, or just renting a lot of AWS servers, or whatever.  A botnet that has computers around the world that don't share many characteristics will be the most robust. Step 2.  Have all the computers you control start sending tons of traffic to the thing you want to attack. Ideally, this will overwhelm the victim's servers.  If the requests all look legitimate, then they won't be able to separate out the real requests and serve them appropriately.
