â˜…How many people need to participate in a DDoS attack for it to take effect?In the Anonymous DDoS attacks on Scientology and Mastercard etc. there were thousands of participants it seems, but is it necessary with this many?
There cannot be a 'minimum' number. For DDoS, the 'distributed' implies there is more than one source (or origin) from where the attack packets are originating from, this means strictly for DDoS attack = two or more computers. For DDoS to happen successfully, the more the merrier, this is simply because it becomes very hard for the edge gear to keep up wit the 1000s of IPs that are attacking it. The main goal of any DDoS attack is to saturate the bandwidth (pretty hard to do nowadays with the multi-10Gbps circuits) at the carrier level, but very easy to go at a distribution switch or server level. The ultimate goal is to render the server and/or accompany approaching gear to the server useless by overwhelming it. This can be achieved through a wide variety of ways, but essentially three types of attack classifications hold true: Bandwidth Attack: Saturate the destination network's bandwidth. PPS Attack - Packets Per Second Attack - overwhelm and kill the router - by sending more packets per second that what it is rated to do and also to take into account, it might already be operating at a certain level (say 40%) and to send enough packets to just make it peg the scale to 100+ % Application Level Attack - this can be slow or fast, to overwhelm the server's resources and max it out, so that no new (genuine) connections can be made for serving up the web pages. Having said this, most high-profile websites will distribute their websites across 1000s of servers and 100s of points of presence. In this case, a large army of attackers is required to be able to bring it all down, or a major portion of the website's visibility down to be able to pin the 'DDoS successful' badge onto it.
