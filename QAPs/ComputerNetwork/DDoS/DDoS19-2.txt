â˜…How do I protect a VPS from DDoS attacks?
With a VPS, your options are usually significantly less than with a dedicated server. Services like Cloudflare or Incaspsula (already mentioned) can help, but if they decide they don't want to take the hit any longer, then your VPS is toast. Usually your VPS host will nullroute your IP (making all packets sent to it just be dropped silently), or they'll have the Datacenter/upstream provider nullroute it, and they may suspend your VPS, or potentially charge you or terminate your service. With a VPS, the biggest thing is that it'll affect others on the node, which hurts the hosts business.
