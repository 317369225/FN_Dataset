â˜…How do I protect a VPS from DDoS attacks?
DDoS Attacks can obviously be thwarted and mitigated to a great extent. The issue that arises is the cost of such mitigation. When you are paying US$ 50, or $200 per VPS/Server, and your incoming DDoS is say 1Gbps, it will cost you a couple of multiple of your monthly to protect your from a DDoS attack (which many users are not willing to pay). If the attack is small in its size (both bandwidth-wise and PPS: packets per second) then you can seek very economical solutions like CloudFlare (www.cloudflare.com) or Incapsula (www.incapsula.com). If the attack goes large, both these providers will null route your IP or by pass the traffic via DNS so that it hits your origin server directly. Just an added clarification, Incapsula bills you on bandwidth used. CloudFlare does not. If your VPS is not hosting anything significant and you can afford to let the site down, then accept the null route, let the DDoS fade away and then go live once it has gone. Not a pragmatic solution, but then options with VPS are limited.
