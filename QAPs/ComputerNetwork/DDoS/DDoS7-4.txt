★What is the state-of-the-art in DDoS protection?I am looking for a technical review. How does Amazon, for instance, protect against DDoS, having been a victim multiple times in the past?
Hi John, after reading your answer (a great answer I might add) I think you should check out our service:  Incapsula. We provides the same CDN based acceleration and protection technology as Akamai and Cloudflare, but we offer an additional layer of protection in form of Cloud WAF (the only one out there) that uses advanced intelligent filtering and other security measures created by us and our parent company Imperva. Good CDN can and will protect you from DDos but if it dose so by simply "swallowing" your extra bot traffic it really dose not solve the problem and most of the time this kind of solution will be quite costly since DDos can last for a while and use a lot of resources and as a customer you do pay all for the extra bandwidth you use. Thanks to our added security features we offer better protection and identification and thus provide a more complete solution and save you some money in the process. .
