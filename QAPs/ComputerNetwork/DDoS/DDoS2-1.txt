â˜…Is ddos illegal?
Is smoking marijuana legal? Well by the people- depends! The attack has stages but in general its always the innocent victims who are used to attack the target are the ones that get caught. So tracing back to the attacker is pretty difficult hence if you get caught it's definitely illegal. If you don't then I guess you are pretty good !
