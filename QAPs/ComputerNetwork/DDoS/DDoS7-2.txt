â˜…What is the state-of-the-art in DDoS protection?I am looking for a technical review. How does Amazon, for instance, protect against DDoS, having been a victim multiple times in the past?
Avinash More mentioned Rackspace's Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack mitigation service. To put things in context, that's a mid-range offering. Servers are sometimes attacked with such intensity that "same network" mitigation is ineffective. In those cases, investigate using Prolexic and/or DOSarrest: http://www.dosarrest.com/ http://prolexic.com/ and anyone else who presents a credible claim of being their "competition" (beware, however, Content Delivery Network solutions presented as DDoS mitigation; those differ greatly). I can 100% guarantee that neither the DDoS mitigation services nor the large websites like Amazon (company) and eBay and PayPal and such will be willing to divulge much detail on exactly how they mitigate DDoSs. They guard extremely closely every piece of knowledge regarding how they fight botnets. The more the bad guys can learn about them, the easier it is for the botnet attacks to make their offerings ineffective. The overviews you'll get will only present things they know the bad guys already know, and nothing more.
