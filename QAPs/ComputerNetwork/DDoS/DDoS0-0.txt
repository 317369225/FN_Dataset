â˜…Is a DDoS attack illegal?What laws govern the legality of DDoS attacks? How do laws work for attacks across national borders?
In both the UK and the US it's specifically prohibited, by the Police and justice act 2006 in the former, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse act in the latter. Most other countries have similar laws. As for international DDoS, it depends on whether the victim can push for the case to be heard under their laws, since the law was broken in that country, regardless of the laws elsewhere (an example of this, not strictly DDoS, but still digital to another country would be the pirate bay case).
