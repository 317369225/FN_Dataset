â˜…How expensive is a DDoS attack?For a DDoS attack, the aggressor needs control over a large amount of computers, e.g. a botnet. This botnet has costs - either opportunity cost or direct cost (if the aggressor rents it). As with all in life, money governs - so it would be helpful to know the economics of the DDoS aggressors. Example: what do they pay for 1,000 computers for 1 hour?
Botnet owners offer mind bogglingly sophisticated service levels which guarantees N number of machines where you can select the geo-location or even upstream provider and resolution for botnet leases are in minutes. The complexity and service quality of these networks are comparable to many platform as a service providers (AWS, Rackspace, etc.) as of today if not sometimes better. The pricing changes if you want to run your own binary on the zombies or use botnet owner provided packet flooders, protocol fuzzers or scripted Layer 7 interaction. Packet flooding is the most expensive option after running your own binary; because it greatly increases the chances of a zombie machine to stand out and get disconnected by the owner or network administrator. As a ballpark figure (from 2009-2010); 5000 node botnet could be hired for an hour of packet storm for as low as $500. Majority of the zombies will be from China, Russia and Southern Asia. It might not be that much effective if your target is not in this region. Also AS (Autonomous System) reputations of the ISPs of the zombies will be generally low so major carriers will be trigger happy to null route the traffic before it arrives the target. A botnet comprised of machines from US universities, European corporate networks or the ones which has an upstream from a Scandinavian high-speed residential ISP will trade for maybe orders of magnitude higher prices.
