★Is there any specific algorithm to prevent a DDoS attack?I am looking to know if there is any specific algorithm(flow diagram) to differentiate between a legitimate user and a malicious user? If there is no specific algorithm, then how exactly does Arbor Network and similar security providers implement DDoS mitigation/prevention attacks? It would be nice if the answer could hold sufficient explanation (if any algorithm mentioned).
I don't know of any algorithm for this, but there was a poster( in Student Research Symposium poster session) presented recently at the HiPC -- High Performance Computing conference titled  'Distributed Capabilities-based DDoS Defence' by Manjiri Jog(NBN Sinhgad School of Engineering, Pune), Maitreya Natu(Tata Research Development and Design Centre, Pune ), and Sushama Shelke (NBN Sinhgad School of Engineering, Pune) PS: I don't know any of them personally.
