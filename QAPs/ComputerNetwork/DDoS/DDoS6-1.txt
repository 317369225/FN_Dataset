â˜…Who was responsible for the DDoS Attack on Reddit?
At the time of the Reddit DDOS a single /r/news thread reporting (read: breaking) updates from police scanners on the Boston/MIT bombing/shooting was getting a lot of independent traffic. I'm skeptical that it was a malicious DDOS and not just an influx of traffic to that one thread. Or perhaps someone was attacking that thread? At some point the police asked that people not listen to the police scanners so perhaps someone felt it was moral to attack Reddit in order to shut down the thread. EDIT: Oicial Reddit announcement: DDoS dossier : blog
