â˜…After bridging to the physical network card of a host with a static IP address, what IP address will the VM get given the DHCP service is not supported by the academic network provider?
In bridge mode VM act as physical machine. So in case DHCP isn't configure in network and you are working with linux system, It won't take any IP. But if you are working on Windows system and DHCP server isn't available in network it will autometically self configure itself with IP in range 169.254.0.1-169.254.255.254 and Subnet of class B i.e 255.255.0.0. This range of IP also known as APIPA (Autometic Private IP Addressing). A Windows client uses self configured IP address untill a DHCP server become available or user configure it's IP manually. The APIPA service also checks regularly for the presence of DHCP server (every 5 minutes, according to Microsoft). If it detects a DHCP server on the network, APIPA stops, and DHCP server replaces the APIPA address by dynamically assigned address.
