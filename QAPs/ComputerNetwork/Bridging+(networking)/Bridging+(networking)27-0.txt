★What is a debugging proxy?
Though I've never called it that, to me a debugging proxy is a process that allows you to remotely debug a process from a different machine.  The Debugging Tools for Windows include a tool called dbgsrv that can do this.  Dbgsrv allows you to, for example, run your debugger of choice on your workstation while debugging a process running on a machine across the Internet. This is particularly handy if you can't place symbols on the remote machine.  If you're interested in seeing a real life example of how this is useful, I wrote up a blog post about an issue I solved using this method: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ntdebugg...
