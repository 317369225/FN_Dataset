★What is the difference between Linux's "network interface bonding" and "network interface bridging"?
Bridging is the function that interconnects two link layers by performing L2 learning and forwarding.  The bridge learns MAC addresses by observing the source addresses on each segment and populating a MAC address table. Packets for known MAC addresses are forwarded if they are not on the correct segment. A useful bridge speaks STP, so that multiple bridges don't create a forwarding loop. Bonding is the aggregation of multiple parallel segments into one logical segment.  Effectively, two interfaces are treated as one, and traffic is distributed across the component segments.
