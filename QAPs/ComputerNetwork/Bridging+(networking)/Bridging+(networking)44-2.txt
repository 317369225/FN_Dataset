★What are some advantages to being a LinkedIn Open Networker (LION)?If your answer is why you shouldn't do it, I'll probably downvote you, unless you have a really great reason I didn't think of.
One great advantage is they are important in the fact that they bridge networks of closed people. From Linkedin point of view to connect people you already know, does not expand networks. One of the advantages, from the LION point of view is that it expands your list of contacts by the bucket load. That  means you are able to research thousands, if not millions of people in  your broader network. This is great if you want to use LinkedIn to  understand people, where they work and how they may help you. Another one it is how other people may view me when they look at my profile.  Many headhunters may look at the richness of my connections  and who’s in my network.
