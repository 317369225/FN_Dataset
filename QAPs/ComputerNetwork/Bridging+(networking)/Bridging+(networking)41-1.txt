★My daughter wants to set up a server for Minecraft on our PC. Is this safe?I'm not sure I'm even asking this right, but my daughter says she needs to use our pc as a host so she can play with her sister when she is away at school. I am confident she will follow the directions she has from the Minecraft site perfectly. Are there any risks?
There are, as far as I know, no known vulnerabilities in the Minecraft server that can be exploited to damage a host computer.  That being said, any software that you allow to be accessed from the Internet carries some risk.  If you are really worried, you have two options: Use virtualization software like Virtualbox or Virtual PC to create a virtual machine.  Run the minecraft server in the VM.  The VM is a "sandbox" and software inside it can not harm the PC.  You will have to use bridged networking.  You probably want to use a static IP, so you can easily set up port forwarding to the VM on your router If the above sounds too complex  then consider hosted Minecraft servers.  These are affordable and most support mods.Here are some hosting providers: Minecraft Server Hosting | MCProHosting Minecraft Server Hosting | GGServers | $3/GB Quality Minecraft Server Hosting
