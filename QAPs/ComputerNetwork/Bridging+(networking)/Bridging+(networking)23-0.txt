★Why aren't the networks comprising the internet interconnected through bridges at the data link layer, instead of being  interconnected at the network layer through routers?
Mark the difference between L1, L2, and L3 devices: A Hub does not separate either a Collision Domain or a Broadcast Domain. A Switch separates Collision Domains, but not a Broadcast Domain. A Router separates both Collision Domains and Broadcast Domains.   Thus, if the Internet were controlled by bridges / switches, any broadcast MAC (an ARP, for example) would be received by all hosts, everywhere. This is not scalable.   Furthermore, each switch must know the MAC addresses for every host out a certain port. Unknown MAC destinations are broadcast out every port.   Finally, switching protocols such as Spanning Tree Protocol are not scalable across networks as large as the internet.
