★How can I bridge two Networks?I have 2 separate networks in my startup. I need to bridge those so that all the employees can communicate with each other over the LAN / WLAN. Is there any Way?
There is a way. Plug a network cable between the LAN ports of devices. WLAN usually allows filtering/firewall/etc. settings in the router to keep internet somewhat separate. if configured right.   WARNING: make sure that only ONE DHCP Server is running if you are bridging on the same subnet (192.168.1.x to 1.1x for example) otherwise 2 devices assigning the same IP could cause troubles.   Alternatively you COULD 'bridge' the routers together (lan plug to lan plug) and keep the traffic on each side separate/faster and allow the traffic to flow from one side to the other ONLY WHEN one network needs to talk to another device across the way. To do so take Router 1 and set to the 192.168.1.x range and leave DHCP on (unless another DHCP solution is in place). Router 2 set the IP range to 192.168.2.x range and leave the DHCP on. 1.x will assign 1.x IP range and the 2.x will assign 2. range.   One router for example could contain HR department that share the same printer, databases, office, etc. and the other could be 'SALES'. So HR can work independently from sales but if HR needs to access a document on the sales side, it can hop the network form 1.x to 2.x and retrieve the data. Both sides will work faster though with less traffic/fighting for traffic bandwith.   hope this helps.
