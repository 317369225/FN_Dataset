★Would trying to hack through Kali Linux inside a virtual machine be equivalent to hacking a system with Kali Linux installed?
It would be just about the same. The only difference is that if the tools you are using within Kali require special hardware, they won't work. Keep in mind you'll have to set up the networking in bridged mode. This way, the VM can talk to the target network. Bridged networking is fairly easy to do, but it does not work easily on wireless cards as a host device (i.e., use an Ethernet cable). Once that's done,  the majority of the tools should be usable.
