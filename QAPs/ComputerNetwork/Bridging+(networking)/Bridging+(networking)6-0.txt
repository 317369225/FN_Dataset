â˜…What are the usual common business cases for Linux networking bridging?
Assuming you're not bridging two networks (either remotely, or of different types, such as linking a wireless network to a wired network), I think the most common type of use now is with Virtual Machines. If you want the VMs to connect directly to the LAN and not via internal private networks within the host machine, with external communications via NAT'ing to the LAN/WAN, then you need to setup a bridge with the network port and then attach the VMs to the bridge. I certainly have more instances of this kind of configuration than any other now in operation, both at home and at work.
