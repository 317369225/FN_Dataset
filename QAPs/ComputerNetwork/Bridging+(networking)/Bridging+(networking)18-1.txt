â˜…Electronics Engineering: Why do we use bridge rectifier?If we already having a center tap rectifier with just two diodes doing the same work then why there is a need to use four diodes or the so called Bridge rectifier.
because center tap transformer is expensive..so to reduce cost of rectifier circuit we use bridge rectifier.
