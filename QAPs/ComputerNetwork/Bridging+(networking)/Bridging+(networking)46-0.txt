â˜…Is it possible to share files between Windows host OS (Windows 8.1) and Linux guest OS (RHEL6.5) without VMware workstation?I have VMware player but not workstation.
If your VM Hypervisor (i.e. VMWare Player / Workstation / etc.) doesn't come with its own variant to share folders between the host and the guest, then you're stuck with having to do it the "normal" way: You need to see your guest as "just another computer". And you thus need to link to/from it through a network. That might mean the settings for the VM needs something like a bridged network connection instead of the default NAT, but not necessarily. Then you need to share the host folder as normal, ensure your Linux can "see" Windows shares (usually requires that you install Samba) and simply link to that as if its just another computer on your network. Note most VM Hypervisors have an "automatic" method to share local files with the guest(s). At least most type 2 HVs, with type 1's it doesn't make any sense to do so (seeing as with type 1 there is no host OS so there's nothing to share). Personally, I find there's a bit of a compromise when you use a "free" HV. E.g. using VMWare's free Player as your HV it's a bit hamstrung on sharing. But then using the "free" VirtualBox from Oracle instead its sharing (folders, drag-n-drop, and clipboard) works brilliantly (from my own experience with Linux host - VMWare Player's networking is a bit idiotic and rarely works perfectly tending to force me using bridged instead of NAT - thus requiring a switch so the computer can "talk" to itself by using the network cable through the switch, which is A LOT slower than the NAT in VBox). But then Player's graphics acceleration is decades ahead of VBox's.
