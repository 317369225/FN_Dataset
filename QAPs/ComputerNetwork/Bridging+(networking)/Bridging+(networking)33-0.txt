â˜…Is it possible to run Django on Windows 7? If so, how?
I'm guessing you want to develop with Django in a Windows 7 system and not use it for production hosting you django site (that would be weird). You can find the official installation instructions at http://docs.djangoproject.com/en... . First you will need to install python in your system. You can either download the windows installer from http://python.org/download/relea... or from http://www.activestate.com/activ... (it's supposed to be more windows friendly). Make sure to pick the latest 2.6.x version as I'm not sure if django has been tested with the latest python 2.7 or 3.1 releases. Then you need to set up django. I recommend to use virtualenv to setup django. If you installed activestate python, virtualenv is preinstalled, so see the activestate help on how to use it. If you have installed the 'official' python installer, you need to install it yourself. After you have created a django virtualenv, activate it and then do a 'pip install Django' or 'easy_install Django' and you are done.
