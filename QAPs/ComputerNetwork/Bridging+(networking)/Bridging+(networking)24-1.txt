★How can I connect a Ubuntu 13.04 running in VMware in a PC to another Ubuntu similarly running in VMware in a different PC?The two machines are connecting with each other from windows command prompt.But each time I'm setting  the IP address to a fixed value in vmware,it fails to connect with the other vmware ubuntu of other machine.
I think you'll have to setup a bridged network in both of your virtual machines instead of NAT or host-only mode. Bridged network connects the virtual-machine with the network of the host machine. If the two hosts are already connected, VMs should also get connected with them in bridged network mode.
