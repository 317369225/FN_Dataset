â˜…With a bridge established between host and VM, while the IP address had been assigned to the VM, could the host OS be reached with that IP from external any more during that period?
What Vladislav said is one thing, but I think you are asking a simpler question, so I'll try that... If I understand you correctly, you have a host and a VM. The VM is using a bridge on one of the host's network devices, lets say eth0. The bridged eth will appear as eth0 inside the VM, while it will also appear to the host as eth0 (br0). No they can't talk to each other through the bridge, or share the same IP, that would be a loop. There are ways to get information back and forth between host and VM, though the basic idea of virtual machines is to maximize the separation. In addtion, many schemes use randomized MAC addresses, making it hard for the host to know the address of the VM. Now of course, the software - vmware, kvm, xen that does the work of hosting the VMs knows what the MAC address is.
