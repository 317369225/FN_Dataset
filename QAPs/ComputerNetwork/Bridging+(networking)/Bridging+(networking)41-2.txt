â˜…My daughter wants to set up a server for Minecraft on our PC. Is this safe?I'm not sure I'm even asking this right, but my daughter says she needs to use our pc as a host so she can play with her sister when she is away at school. I am confident she will follow the directions she has from the Minecraft site perfectly. Are there any risks?
There is also the possibility to rent a Minecraft server, and having the patching of the servers done by the company that you are renting this from. This can be seen as a trial period for yourselves, as the costs are not that steep for renting servers. The plus side of this is that you will have the possibility to setup passwords and control who can log in to the server. wiki.multiplay.co.uk/Minecraft_Server_Starter_Pack Buy Minecraft Server Hosting - Multiplay Gameservers TOP 35 hosts - Rent Minecraft Server - Must Look!
