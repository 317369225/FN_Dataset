★What are some advantages to being a LinkedIn Open Networker (LION)?If your answer is why you shouldn't do it, I'll probably downvote you, unless you have a really great reason I didn't think of.
Access to other peoples connections once connected and being able to invite connections into your groups are great reasons to be a LION.  If you update or publish articles internally on linkedin, you'll have a potential larger reach by simply having those connections (until linkedin turns more into Facebook by forcing you to pay to reach your connections.)
