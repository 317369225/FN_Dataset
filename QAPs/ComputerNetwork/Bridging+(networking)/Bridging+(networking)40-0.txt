★I installed ubuntu 13.10 on windows 7 by using vmware workstation .Im facing following problem in vi editor my backspace is not working and I cant install packages even though I logged in as a root?
First of all, never log in as root.  Use sudo.  The people who say otherwise are either joking or inexperienced.  Some programs will even refuse to run as root. Check your networking.  You likely lack an internet connection within your VM.  See if you have an IP address with "ip addr".  If it's just down, try "sudo ifup eth0".  You may be lacking an interface altogether, though, or VMware may be misconfigured.  I've never had any problems getting networking to work in VMware Workstation on 13.10 with bridged networking and NAT.  If you're choosing something other than bridged networking or NAT, you probably don't understand the option that you chose. Just a tip: vim is a lot better than vi.  Using vim may fix your issue.  Make sure your terminal emulator or SSH client is sending ^? for backspace, not ^H.  If Ctrl + Backspace works the way plain Backspace is supposed to, but Backspace alone doesn't work, it's probably reversed.  vim understands both ^? and ^H, so you shouldn't have that problem in vim. In vi and vim, backspace doesn't delete line breaks.  In other words, you can't delete or join lines with backspace.  If you want to change this, add "set backspace=indent,eol,start" to your .vimrc file.  If none of that fixes it, check the vim wiki: Backspace and delete problems.
