â˜…My daughter wants to set up a server for Minecraft on our PC. Is this safe?I'm not sure I'm even asking this right, but my daughter says she needs to use our pc as a host so she can play with her sister when she is away at school. I am confident she will follow the directions she has from the Minecraft site perfectly. Are there any risks?
If you all are living in the same house and all of your family's PCs are connected together to the same network, then it shouldn't be a problem, because the traffic will flow within your local network, and probably your home router already blocks direct traffic from outside network. If you are living in a separate place, or your daughter is planning to invite someone on the net to connect to your PC to join the game remotely via internet, you have to be very careful that the PC won't expose unnecessary ports to the internet (that operation usually requires router reconfiguration).
