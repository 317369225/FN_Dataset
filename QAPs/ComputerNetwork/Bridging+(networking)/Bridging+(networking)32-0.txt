★Is there any way that I can use VMware player to have multiple unique IP addresses connected to the internet from the same physical computer?It would be pretty darn cool to have several distinct devices on the same comp. I have tried the bridged network on VMware player, but it won't detect my wifi card and won't connect to the internet. So I have NAT which basically uses the same IP as the host. If you have a way to get bridged to work then that is good so long as it actually does what I think it does.
While I agree with Thirumal Venkat's answer, I'd add, what's wrong with using the NAT in this context?  Unless you have a direct routable Internet connection to your host computer, you're probably going to be using NAT anyway to get out to the Internet...and, in a home environment, you usually get only one IP address from the ISP, which is why you need NAT in the first place. I will note that, at IQNavigator, we have a VMWare host set up that will house our new set of "DevLabs" developer-controlled virtual servers, to provide development teams a place to set up shared code bases and run against them before involving our QA process.  (I'm involved in setting up and configuring these servers.) This host uses a series of addresses in the 10.101.10.0/24 block for its VMs, supporting both static-allocated and DHCP addresses in this block.  All these addresses are accessible from anywhere within our internal network, including via VPN.  The implementation works fine and lets both the servers hit the Internet when they need to, and lets outside machines (like my workstation) hit them.  This works adequately for what we need. If I may: What is this particular scenario intended to accomplish?  Is this just idle curiosity, or do you have a use case in mind? Hat tip: An anonymous Quoran for the A2A. Only you know who you are!
