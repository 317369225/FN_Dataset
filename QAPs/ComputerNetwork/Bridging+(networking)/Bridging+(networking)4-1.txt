â˜…What is a BRIDGE (a network component)?How it works? And how Spanning Tree Protocol works?
I/III - A bridge is a used to divide a LAN network into two to reduce congestion. Just like like a real bridge where one side is small area and other side is also a small area and a bridge in between . A MAC table is maintained. II/III - watch this video once [ ] -(This video is available in hindi language only )- III/III - STP is introduced just to reduce collision and wastage of bridge device in LAN. In my views, working can not be explained in text, you have to go through some video . This is best of my knowledge . If you still need working , just reply me once . I will arrange it.
