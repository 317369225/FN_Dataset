â˜…How can I disable any of my VMWare virtual machines from being configured to use a bridged networking mode?This question pertains to VMWare Fusion. I've been told that a configuration file exists outside of the VM directory that allows a firewall to be setup for all virtual machines. Where is this file? Is there a way to override it?
The networking configuration is host (Mac) specific. VMware Fusion 6 Professional includes a network editor for creating new virtual networks with the most common options. (See VMware Fusion > Preferences > Network) A free 30-day trial is available if you're using an older version. More control/options can be found in the networking configuration files, see /Library/Preferences/VMware Fusion, in particular "networking" and vmnetX/* files. There are a couple of caveats: * The networking components need to be restarted for changes to these files to take effect. Shutting down all VMs and quitting Fusion should be sufficient. * Customizations to these files might not survive an upgrade. * The format and content of these files is undocumented. They could change in any future versions.
