★VMware: What is the best configuration to run ubuntu as a virtual environment on windows?I wanted to know how much RAM should I allocate to the virtual ubuntu and other settings so that I can have maximum output from Ubuntu as well Windows ?
Concluding from what I have been using, 1. If you're using 64-bit Ubuntu, don't forget to check for VT-x in boot settings. 2. RAM up to 2 GB is more than enough for a Linux based Operating System. 3. Video Card could be raised to 128 MB. 4. If you're concerned with you network, try to set up a bridged network only.         And if you have a experience with network ,you can try playing around with         multiple adapters.
