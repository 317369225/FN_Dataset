★Is there a way to bridge  Wi-Fi and WiMax network signals so that devices on them communicate?For an example, consider a WiMax USB modem used with a laptop and a Comcast based Wi-Fi signal used by another computer,  though other devices and configurations would apply, too.
Set-up a VPN server on a computer connected to Wireless Router (Comcast or whom ever).  Create a dynamic DNS account that associates the IP to a host name to use for your client connections(in case your IP changes). Some routers natively support dynamic DNS  be sure to check and see if you can set it up in the administrative console otherwise you can run updating software from the DNS provider on the computer that runs the VPN service, also forward the appropriate ports to that computer.  Log into the VPN  from your WiMax computer using the dynamic DNS hostname  and then you can remotely access your network  computers and files. Here is a list of dynamic DNS providers: http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/In...
