â˜…Electronics Engineering: Why do we use bridge rectifier?If we already having a center tap rectifier with just two diodes doing the same work then why there is a need to use four diodes or the so called Bridge rectifier.
Apart from saving expenses that you would incur from a center tapped transformer, you also save money on the diodes. Yes, bridge rectifiers require twice as many diodes but since the peak inverse voltage is half as that of a full wave rectifier, the diodes need not have the ability to withstand larger reverse voltages without breaking down so they end up being cheaper.
