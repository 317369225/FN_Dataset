â˜…What are some of the best strategies for bridging the gap between online and offline social networking for businesses?
I think social media is easier to get the reach in the initial stage of any venture.According to me it depends on the consumer behavior country wise.Example country like india where internet users are less if we calculate in terms of population but usa uk it is on the Page on peak.So in terms of Indian market we can start with online presence but campaigning need to be done through online.But in us and all we can start with ooh and then use the online platform to reach the target consumer.
