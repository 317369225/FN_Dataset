Quora in combination with a video channel "Living Bridges TV" should be part of the equation. Kind of this: There is a regular video conferencing and web tv event, a weekly opportunity to gather around the campfire (McLuhan, you know) Quora supports debate before and after this eventPerspective: This combination results in much engagement in topic selection and refinement Engegament to understand a cause/project/context deeply Saves the results for later learnings and knowledge sharing (e.g. have a web panel of 5 people about the experiences with collaborative leadership, 50 are watching live, 500 watch the video capture later)
