â˜…Is it possible when using a network extended by WDS to tell which physical router/bridge you are connecting with?I am using an Airport extreme extended by an airport express.
Sure; you just need the BSSID (which is the MAC address of the access point you're currently connected to.) On OS X, this is really easy: just Option-click the wifi icon on your menu bar to show the BSSID and some additional text about your currently connected network. You can find the MAC address of the Airport devices either through AirPort Utility, or by looking on the devices; it's printed on there somewhere.
