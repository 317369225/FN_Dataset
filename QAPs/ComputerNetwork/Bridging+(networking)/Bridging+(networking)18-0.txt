â˜…Electronics Engineering: Why do we use bridge rectifier?If we already having a center tap rectifier with just two diodes doing the same work then why there is a need to use four diodes or the so called Bridge rectifier.
Because they require a center tapped transformer. With solid state electronics using a bridge rectifier or four diodes lets you reduce system cost by saving on the transformer. In the days of tubes, this wasn't the case as vacuum tube rectifiers had a higher initial and maintenance cost, but silicon bridge rectifiers nowadays are quite inexpensive and reliable.
