â˜…Is there any way that I can use VMware player to have multiple unique IP addresses connected to the internet from the same physical computer?It would be pretty darn cool to have several distinct devices on the same comp. I have tried the bridged network on VMware player, but it won't detect my wifi card and won't connect to the internet. So I have NAT which basically uses the same IP as the host. If you have a way to get bridged to work then that is good so long as it actually does what I think it does.
This is just a guess.. I personally use VirtualBox and not VMware and I hate setting up things even if I have to do it for myself. So I won't be able to help you out with configuring things etc. Bridging a network requires you to have promiscuous mode to be supported by your adapter. This is important because bridged networking directly intercepts packets from the host's network card rather than going through the TCP/IP stack on the host operating system. Most wireless adapters don't support promiscuous mode. This might be the reason you're not able to get it working with your wireless card.
