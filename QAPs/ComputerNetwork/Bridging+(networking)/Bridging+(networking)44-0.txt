â˜…What are some advantages to being a LinkedIn Open Networker (LION)?If your answer is why you shouldn't do it, I'll probably downvote you, unless you have a really great reason I didn't think of.
There are number articles on the pros and cons of open networking but I will share my personal experience. During the 2008 Great Recession, my career had plateaued but then some one talked me into being an open networker. Since then my career has taken off with opportunities that wouldn't have come my way, if I was not an open networker.
