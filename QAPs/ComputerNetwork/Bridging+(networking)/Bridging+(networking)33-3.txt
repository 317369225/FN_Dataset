â˜…Is it possible to run Django on Windows 7? If so, how?
Am a new web developer and run django python on my windows 7 machine. I use eclipse as the IDE. To use python django things that we need to do are 1) Install Eclipse (http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spri...) 2) Install Python http://python.org/getit/ 3) Install Pydev on eclipse http://pydev.org/manual_101_inst... 4) Install Django https://docs.djangoproject.com/e... 5) Create a new project with pydev django perpective. http://slacklabs.be/python/tutor... EDIT: Page on Lowcoupling The last link will give in detail all the steps involved. Hope this helps EDIT : Problems I faced were in installing django in python. For which one can try to do the following - 1. Open up cmd.exe and if you have added python to your environment variables' path, proceed to step 2. 2. Change the current directory to the one in which you have unpacked/unzipped django and now type python setup.py install That's all where i was facing the problem, rest worked like a charm for me.
