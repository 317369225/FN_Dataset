★IP Masking from inside of a VM - is it possible?Would an IP masking utility work if run inside a VM, or would it be futile ?  If so would bridged networking with the host be the appropriate way to implement it?
It's possible, it may be useful, and it is in fact quite common to implement security appliances this way. You can either use bridge networking or you can attach the virtual interface to one of the physical interfaces in the host server. There are a number of reasons to do it, but also some concerns. Many security professionals were (and may still be) worried about running security appliances inside a virtualized environment. Some people prefer these things to run inside dedicated hardware. But running security appliances in a virtual environment adds a lot of flexibility. You can build an entire system using virtual appliances, and if you know how to config networking, you can make a very interesting topology using virtual networks and conveniently placed virtual appliances.
