★What is the best app on Facebook for recruiting?
Work4 Labs develops the #1 recruiting application on Facebook, ‘Work for Us.’ The app leverages the world’s largest, data-rich social network for both recruiters and candidates. The app allows companies to post jobs on their Facebook Page either manually or with an ATS integration. Recruiters can launch highly targeted, automatic Facebook job ads, as well as distribute jobs through optimized viral features. The app contains a powerful referral system that matches a user’s friends with a company’s jobs. The user can also use multiple social features to broadcast jobs, as well as apply directly within Facebook. The app’s powerful features have allowed thousands of large and small companies to move beyond buzzwords and to begin recruiting socially. Its 5,000+ users include Accenture, Disney, L'Oréal, Adecco, Manpower, Michael Page, KPMG, Deloitte, PwC, and Roche. Work4 Labs was founded in 2010, and has offices in San Francisco and Paris.
