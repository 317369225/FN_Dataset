â˜…Electronics Engineering: Why do we use bridge rectifier?If we already having a center tap rectifier with just two diodes doing the same work then why there is a need to use four diodes or the so called Bridge rectifier.
Bridge rectifier uses less energy. Size of a bridge rectifier is lesser compared to a centre tapped transformer type rectifier. Also, since a bridge rectifier contains diodes, it can be embedded. The ripple factor in case of a bridge rectifier is lower than compared to the centre tapped transformer type. It is easier to maintain than the centre tapped transformer.
