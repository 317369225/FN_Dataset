★Is it possible to run Django on Windows 7? If so, how?
I'm working on doing this now, and the formula I'm using is: Python 2.7 from http://python.org/download/ Python setuptools from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setu... PostgreSQL 8.4 from http://www.postgresql.org/downlo... Visual Studio Express 2008 from http://www.microsoft.com/express... (note: make sure to install the 2008 version, not 2010, per python.org mailing lists.) After doing the above, and following all their reqisitie install pages, you'll have to easy_install psycopg2 and PIL.  For the rest of my application, I have a zc.buildout script (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.b...) to install Django using djangorecipe (https://launchpad.net/djangorecipe) and any other dependencies I'm using.  Using the setup as above, I'm able to develop in either Linux or Windows, and deploy to Linux.   zc.buildout saves a lot of extra system dependency management.
