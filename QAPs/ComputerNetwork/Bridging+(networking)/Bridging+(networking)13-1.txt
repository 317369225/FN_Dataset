At least as far as computers and training, it's hard to beat Free Geek Technology/Computer Reuse, Education, Recycling & Sales in Portland, OR. Volunteers take donations of gear, turn them into usable computers for sale or grant to non-profits. If you can't afford a computer, but can volunteer, you can earn your way to one easily, plus get training on how to use it. All powered by Xubuntu. They get a lot of corporate support, as it takes perfectly good equipment if dated equipment and puts it to good use. Plus they have a kickin' resale shop, a source of great bargain gear for your various projects (not just computers but switch gear, oscilloscopes, all sorts of random stuff), Highly recommended.
