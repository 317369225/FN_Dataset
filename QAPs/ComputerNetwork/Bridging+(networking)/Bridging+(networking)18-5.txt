â˜…Electronics Engineering: Why do we use bridge rectifier?If we already having a center tap rectifier with just two diodes doing the same work then why there is a need to use four diodes or the so called Bridge rectifier.
Center tapped transformers aren't so common in usage and moreover the peak of the pulsating DC output from a center tapped rectifier is half that of the peak of secondary voltage of transformer. While in the case of bridge rectifier, both the peaks i.e., that of rectifier output and transformer secondary are same. Hence to get the same peak in output of rectifier, you would need to use a secondary having twice as many windings as required in the case of bridge rectifier for a center tapped based rectifier. This cost for more windings is far more than the cost of two extra diodes that a bridge rectifier has in it. Hope this helps..:-)
