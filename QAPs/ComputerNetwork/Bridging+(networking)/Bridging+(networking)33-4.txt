â˜…Is it possible to run Django on Windows 7? If so, how?
You might consider setting up a virtual machine with VMware or VirtualBox and installing Ubuntu in it. Set it up so that it shares the IP address space with the subnet that your Windows box is on, using bridged networking, not NAT. Ubuntu doesn't automatically set up a firewall the way some distributions do, so your web app should be available on the subnet, for instance from a browser running on the Windows box outside the virtual machine. If your Internet provider keeps port 80 open and you fiddle with forwarding on your modem, you'll be able to serve to the outside world.
