â˜…With a bridge established between host and VM, while the IP address had been assigned to the VM, could the host OS be reached with that IP from external any more during that period?
If you're talking about Host-Only Networking and not Bridged Networking, then no, you have a virtual ethernet adapter on the host and no communication ever happens on your real ethernet card - everything is in-memory. Your real ethernet card is not even put in promiscuous mode, so it will ignore any frames with an incorrect MAC address (not that anybody can get an ARP reply for that IP - the guest OS doesn't receive packets that arrive on the host adapter, so there's no way for someone on the network to determine where to send data for the guest IP, even if he somehow knew it). If you are talking about bridged networking, where the guest OS directly uses the host adapter to join the network with its own IP & MAC address, then still no, because your host OS TCP/IP stack, even though the ethernet card is running in promiscuous mode, ignores all packets that aren't for any of its own configured IP addresses (the VMWare virtual adapter probably hooks somewhere around this point). However, you may be exposing the fact that you're running a virtual machine, because your host OS will start responding to packets with the host IP, but wrong MAC address (as the ethernet card will forward everything to the IP stack, which will see one of its own IPs and reply, not noticing the wrong MAC address). TL;DR: Any operating system's TCP/IP stack ignores packets not for its own configured IP addresses. Such packets are not unusual, and they get dropped without ceremony. But in host-only networking even this is not necessary, because the guest and host talk only via memory buffers.
