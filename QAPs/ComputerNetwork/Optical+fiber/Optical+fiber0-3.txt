★What is the future of optical fiber networks?
Since last few decades fiber optics have changed the way of communication and it is still evolving and creating a difference in today’s lifestyle. 1. Fiber optic cables form the backbone for a substantial part of communication. 2. Different configurations of optical fiber provide OPGW solution. 3. Fiber optic-based backhaul systems integrate advantages of high-capacity networking solution. That is why it is in strong demand in 3G space and wireline-based broadband networks. 4. FTTH and GPON technology is mainly based on fiber optics.    Embed Quote
