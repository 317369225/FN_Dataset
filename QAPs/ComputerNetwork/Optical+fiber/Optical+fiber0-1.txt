★What is the future of optical fiber networks?
There is a lot of prospective future in the term of optical fiber network as well as radio network. I'm working in optical network field and could our technology towards to giving a broadband access to user in their devices. Optical fiber network leverage to the next generation. In the term of Backbone network, technology such as WDM for 10GbE or STM-64 getting obsolete in remarkable paced to be upgrade with 100GbE and soon 400GbE will become economically deployable. Every single vendor is in race to compete giving a solution for most bandwidth at affordable price. The declining price on each vendor solution (Hardware and service) to deployed is a good sign that these technology still advanced in right track. In the term of access network we might see soon Fiber-To-The-Home network deployed in every customer premises equipment in houses, apartement, office building, public services building, and many more. While ISP or cellular operator upgrade their backbone capacity to support LTE deployment. I can see we are facing big data era, video streaming era, anything that application-reality era that consume massive bandwidth. As long as application growth, the need of bandwidth with direct correlation to optical fiber network will be grow.    Embed Quote
