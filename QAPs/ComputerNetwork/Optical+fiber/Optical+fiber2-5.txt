★What determines the bandwidth of optical fiber versus copper wire?
The velocity of waves in confined waveguide structures (for e.g Cu wire or an optical fiber) is generally a function of the various waveguide modes that are supported by the waveguide structure and the frequency of the wave. This property is referred to as dispersion. The input wave into a waveguide structure has both a spectral and spatial distribution and thus can either excite multiple modes and each mode will propagates at a different wave velocity. In addition, even for the case of a single mode propagating, different spectral portions of the input wave will propagate at different speeds. Thus, the output signal at the end of the waveguide will have an increased temporal distribution compared to the input as a result of the various dispersion mechanisms.The dispersion effects increases linearly with increasing waveguide length and leads to a limited bandwidth in Cu wire systems after relatively short lengths. However, I should note over short distances (10 to 100s of meters) it is certainly possible for Cu wire type systems (twisted pair, co-axial) to achieve Gbits/s data rates. In single single mode optical fibers (those used for long distance transmission) there is only 1 waveguide mode that can propagate and thus no mode dispersion. In this case the spreading of the temporal distribution is only limited by material (chromatic) dispersion (i.e. variation of optical wave velocity with wavelength), which is a significantly smaller effect compared to Cu wire based systems. Signals can then propagate 100s of Km without any appreciable temporal broadening. I should also point out that low dispersion of optical fibers would be moot if it were not for their exceedingly low absorption losses (~0.3 dB/Km). Using a technique called wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) whereby different signals are assigned specific wavelengths it is possible to significantly extend the transmission rates to rates to ~ 170 Gbits/s and a distance of 240 Km. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fib... http://www.ece.vt.edu/swe/lwa/me... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dis... http://www.csus.edu/indiv/t/tatr...    Embed Quote
