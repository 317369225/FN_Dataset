★What would you say is more complex to study in depth: optical fiber communication or satellite communication?I'm studying Electrical Engineering and starting to focus on Telecom and was wondering about this. Also (I know this is not the kind of question for Quora but maybe you could help me): would you say it's "not smart" to specialize in Satellite Communications Systems today, because of the recent advances in Optical Fiber? I'm very interested in Satellite systems but really worried about this.
I love satellite communications so my bias there is clear. It is a global business with a range of customers from telecommunications companies, government, military and the more fun television. There are a range of aspects to work in from design or systems integration, to space systems and operations. The risk of satellites isn't that there might be a lack of work, satellites isn't a very risky business because it is evolving and adapting to the changes in the business environment. But the options for places to work is more restricted and opportunities for progression might need some creative thinking. There aren't many manufacturers and limited numbers of operators. Fibre optics is an interesting area but has less operational excitement (in my opinion) because you deal with more varied environmental conditions in satellite. From a development point of view I think there are less opportunities in fibre but operationally there is more geographic diversity. The fibre business is probably bigger as well but more competitive.    Embed Quote
