★How would it be possible to double the speed of light in a hollow optical fiber?
With the widely use of Internet,our life become more and more Page on convinient.in order to make the world more tightly, fiber optic manufacturer in china is doing their efforts to produce various of fiber optic products.Today we will have a simple realization of fiber optic splice.   What is fiber optic splice?This must the first reaction when talk about it.I am here to tell you that fiber splice unit is mainly used in optical communications cable construction and maintenance, so it is also called cable splicer. This is not the same as fiber optic cable products,such as the fiber optic adaptor produced by fiber optic cable supplier.But they are samely important in fiber optic working.General working principle of this machine is to use high-pressure arc melting of the two fiber sections with high accuracy at the same time promoting the smooth movement mechanism allows two fibers fused into one, in order to achieve the coupling fiber mode field.   What area would use fiber optic splice?Does people just make fiber optic adaptor wholesale? The answer is that fiber welding machine is a widely smainly used in: telecommunications operators, telecommunications engineering companies, institutions cable line construction, maintenance, emergency repair; teaching and research related to major institutions in fiber-optic communications professional; experiment, production and testing of optical devices; research .    Embed Quote
