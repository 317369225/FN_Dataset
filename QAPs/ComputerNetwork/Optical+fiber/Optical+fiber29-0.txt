★If we trap light in an optical fiber loop and can convert it to electricity later is it more efficient than chemical batteries?
Light doesn't store long in an optical fiber loop.  Even in a non-bent, high purity low-loss optical fiber, it still attenuates to the tune of about 0.5dB/km (when bent it's much worse), and given that light travels at about 300,000 km/s, catching light in a fiber loop can yield at best losing 90% of its power every 20km =~ 66 microseconds. That's hardly an effective storage technique. To get it to last a full second (that is, loses 90% of its power every second) that'd be 10dB/300000km.  That's an extremely low loss -- achievable by only high-vacuum conditions.  And no mirrors, because they're too lossy.    Embed Quote
