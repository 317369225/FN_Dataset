★Which company(ies) sells or manufactures D-shaped optical fiber?D-shaped fiber is pulled from a preform such that the cross section along the entire length of the fiber takes on the shape of the letter "D". The flat edge of the "D" is typically designed to expose the optical core of the fiber for either direct or evanescent coupling.
I used to work with D fiber.  The company we got it from was KVH Industries.  I don't know of any other supplier of D fiber. There were two different kinds of fiber that I used -- horizontal core and vertical core.  I used horizontal core more often (for evanescent coupling), but others in my group used vertical core in order to perform core replacement. The flat part of the cladding isn't thin enough to directly do evanescent coupling, but after a 30 minute etch in Hydrofluoric acid it was close enough.  With a clever polarization setup for birefringence measurement, we could actually measure how close to the core we had etched.
