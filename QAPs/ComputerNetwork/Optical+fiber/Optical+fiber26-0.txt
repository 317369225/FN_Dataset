★Optical Fiber: Which companies are manufacturing DWDM solutions that support 10G and FC framing? Who has the largest market share?
The obvious and short answer would be Ciena and Cisco, probably in that order of market share and maybe Adva.  Given Nortel's close relationship with Brocade and the acquisition by Ciena, they know as much about it as anyone. I am not really strong on FC but I am sure both vendors are certified by the various SAN suppliers. Not sure if they are at 10G FC or only 8G, but wavelengths are 10, 40 or 100G now.  Alcatel-Lucent, Infinera, Transmode, Fujitsu, Optelian and others probably have or claim to have FC solutions.    Embed Quote
