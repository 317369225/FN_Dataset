★How feasible are optic fibers to be set-up?Upto 40% of electrical energy might be wasted in its transmission. Use of optical fibres as wires might be an option for it. What problems will be faced in setting those up and can those be efficient enough?
Probably not cost effective for power transmission yet, I think. First most optical fiber in use today is designed for signalling / communication. And one of the side effects of attenuation whether in copper wire or optical fiber is heat. so the packaging of the fiber for utility scale power transmission would need to be very different, especially since the polymer layer on the outside of the fiber is  critical to resisting breakage. 75% efficiency for a 8 km length (as shown in this wikipedia article on Optical fiber) is still way below transmission efficiency for copper wire on a high voltage line. The advantage of electricity is that we master the technology for boosting transmission efficiency very well: transformers!    Embed Quote
