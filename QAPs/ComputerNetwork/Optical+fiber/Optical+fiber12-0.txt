★What would you say is more complex to study in depth: optical fiber communication or satellite communication?I'm studying Electrical Engineering and starting to focus on Telecom and was wondering about this. Also (I know this is not the kind of question for Quora but maybe you could help me): would you say it's "not smart" to specialize in Satellite Communications Systems today, because of the recent advances in Optical Fiber? I'm very interested in Satellite systems but really worried about this.
As my thesis adviser used to say, in theory, the difference between theory and practice is smaller than the difference between practice and theory, in practice... If you're just talking at the theoretical level, I think the edge barely goes to optical. We're at the point where most of the engineering level advances have been realized and we're starting to wander into the realm of needing to make laws-of-physics level breakthroughs to keep pushing bandwidth per strand of fiber up and up. Although some of the software defined radio stuff is pretty dang interesting. However, if you're talking about maximum studly deployment engineering, you can't beat satellite. One-shot-only deployment, massively hostile environment, unbelievable reliability requirements (it's where I learned about something that used to be called stitch-weld, where components were literally low-voltage welded to the boards because wave solder joints fail in vacuum) plus all the complexities of managing impossibly shitty signal to noise ratios, transmitter-receiver misalignment, and all sorts of other gnarly stuff. If you'd prefer to enjoy some of those challenges in a less challenging environment, then let me turn your attention to something called free space optics. It's like a microwave shot, done with laser. I started playing with this in the early 80s, it's come a long, long way - but it's no where near as well funded or popular as shooting light down fiber.    Embed Quote
