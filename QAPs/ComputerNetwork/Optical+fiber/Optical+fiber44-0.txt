★Optical Fiber: What are the barriers in laying submarine cables?
This is a decent intro: Other major issues that I know about: - Getting the cable tension just right is critical.  If the tension is too high, the cable snaps.  If it is too low, it snarls. - Cables are always getting damaged by earthquakes, ship anchors, and marine life.  Choosing the path to minimize these threats is hard. - Getting landing rights where there is fiber right of way, power to the beach, and the ability to build a landing facility are all hard. - Maintaining the cable, where you have to splice it after deployment is also exceeding challenging.    Embed Quote
