★Why does optical fiber require magnetic shielding?
To avoid polarization of light. Although the magnetic field doesn't directly affect the light, it affects the polarization currents in the material the light is passing through. With a magnetic field parallel to the direction of travel of the light, the charges will be displaced perpendicular to the plane of polarization, and will add a component of the other polarization. Quoting Wikipedia about Faraday Rotation: In physics, the Faraday effect or Faraday rotation is a Magneto-optical phenomenon, that is, an interaction between light and a magnetic field in a medium. The Faraday effect causes a rotation of the plane of polarization which is linearly proportional to the component of the magnetic field in the direction of propagation. Formally, it is a special case of gyroelectromagnetism obtained when the dielectric permittivity tensor is diagonal. This Faraday effect can create Birefringence.
