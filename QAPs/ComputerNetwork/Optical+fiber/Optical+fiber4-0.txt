★What are the uses of optical fiber?
Broadly, there are two primary uses for optical fiber.  The first is purely decorative.  You shine a colored light down one end of the fibre and you get a interesting strand of color hanging from the ceiling, standing vertically, or wrapped around someone. The second use, which is far more serious is in communications.  Fiber turns out to be an excellent way of transmitting digital information.  Take a laser, point it down the fiber, wiggle it in the right way, and you can send bits.  And if that's not enough fun, you can use multiple colors of light, all at the same time, giving even more bits.    Embed Quote
