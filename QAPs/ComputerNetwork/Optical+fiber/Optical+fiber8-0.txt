★What is optical fiber?
It is like a tube based on the phenomenon called Total Internal Reflection (TIR). For optical fibres, the critical angle (the minimum angle required TIR) is easily achieved, and hence light from source to the end by reflection. It is used by doctors to see the inside of the body.    Embed Quote
