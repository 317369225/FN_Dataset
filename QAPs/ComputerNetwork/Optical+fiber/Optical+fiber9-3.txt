★Can electricity be transmitted through optical fibers (optical fibre electrical transmission)?
No, but you know very well it can't. You give it as an advantage of optical fibre. Which it is. I agree that there are very useful applications but I don't see the optical fibre as a feasible alternative for the conducting power lines (yet).    Embed Quote
