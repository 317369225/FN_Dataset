★How is packet switching done in optical fiber communication and how is packet traffic handled?
The light doesn't go end-to-end across the network anymore than the electrical signals on a wired network go end to end.  From an infrastructure point of view, fibers replace copper cables.  Routers and switches are connected to each other by fibers instead of copper, but they photons still terminate on the receiver in the router or switch, get turned into electrical signals within the router or switch, and are treated just like any other connection.  If the next hop is also on fiber (which it doesn't have to be), then the transmitter (a laser in the case of fiber optics) will create new photons and sends them to the next router or switch. From a topological and protocol point of view, absolutely nothing changes when fiber is introduced into the path.  At Layer 1 you have photons moving through glass instead of electrons moving across wires.  Other than that, there is no difference.    Embed Quote
