★What are the uses of optical fiber?
Optical fibers are widely used in communication. Type of optical fiber depend on the distance of transmission - a. Multimode fiber is used mainly for the shorter transmissions. There is lot of scope for the LAN systems in these days. Each and every company is choosing this option and they are able to get their work done with great ease. b. On the other hand there is a single mode fiber, which is used in the telephones and as well in the televisions. These two options demand very longer transmissions. Single mode fiber is used for this type of transmission. The demand for the optical fibers is very huge, as the whole planet needs the above-mentioned needs. Both of these fibers are used for transmitting the LED lights. Generally plastic is used for the manufacture of these materials. 2. Medical - It is also used as light guides, imaging tools and also as lasers for medical surgeries.    Embed Quote
