★How feasible are optic fibers to be set-up?Upto 40% of electrical energy might be wasted in its transmission. Use of optical fibres as wires might be an option for it. What problems will be faced in setting those up and can those be efficient enough?
Well, I think there are some excellent answers here already. Vinayak-Kaniyarakkal is right that energy loss doesn't need to be 40% Electric power transmission and distribution losses (% of output). Tom Byron is right up to the point that we're really looking into shifting back to DC power, because the loss at transformation is trumping the loss in transportation. Optical fiber isn't a feasible alternative for traditional power lines and most likely never will be, but who knows.    Embed Quote
