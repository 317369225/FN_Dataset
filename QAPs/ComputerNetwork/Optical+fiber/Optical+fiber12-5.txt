★What would you say is more complex to study in depth: optical fiber communication or satellite communication?I'm studying Electrical Engineering and starting to focus on Telecom and was wondering about this. Also (I know this is not the kind of question for Quora but maybe you could help me): would you say it's "not smart" to specialize in Satellite Communications Systems today, because of the recent advances in Optical Fiber? I'm very interested in Satellite systems but really worried about this.
William Emmanuel Yu and Carlos Ribeiro make good points about sat comm.  Another aspect of sat comm is mechanical imperfections and misalignments.  Little nicks can scatter the beams, and a 0.1° alignment error results in 40 miles of beam pointing error.  The RF engineer will have to know how to handle those. Razwan Baber make good points about the physics of optics. So sat comm is mainly about RF propagation and imperfections, optical is about cool physics.    Embed Quote
