★Are communication satellites doomed to be completely replaced by optical fiber?If not, for what will they still be useful in the future?
LOL no. Sure, the bandwidth is limited in virtue of the fact that infrared is overshadowed by black body radiation(in the greater picture of things) and lower THz (proposed next-gen high frequency radio electronics) are too easily absorbed by the atmosphere. But GPS is here to stay and will be in the K band (18 GHz) for the foreseeable future. And I don't see how it could go completely extinct either, as it is a reliable technology, unless someone comes up with a MEMS chip/method to detect the absolute position based on <insert random fudge effect>. Satellite TV,radio, internet and telephone will still have it niches. you might be tempted to say that you can drag a cable across a desert. Ok, my dad's a sailor. Satellite telephone makes it possible for me to speak with him when he's in the middle of nowhere for 2 weeks or longer at a time. The demand is there, and while many of the things regarding satellite communication are at mid-90s tech level at most, at the very least, the network forms a strategic, self-sustaining, last-resort way of communication for tough environments and situations. If, God forbid, I ever get stuck on an island in the middle of the ocean, I hope I have a working satellite phone. To make a crude analogy, consider what AM radio meant for prisoners in the second world war. As we speak, someone's survivability may depend on it. Also, like analogue radio, the next big technology that fully replaces it (digital audio broadcast) needs to be several orders in magnitude more complex. GPS itself is a marvel of contemporary science and uses quantum relativistic principles. What will replace it? I don't know.    Embed Quote
