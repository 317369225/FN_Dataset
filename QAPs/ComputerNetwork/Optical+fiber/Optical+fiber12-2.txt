★What would you say is more complex to study in depth: optical fiber communication or satellite communication?I'm studying Electrical Engineering and starting to focus on Telecom and was wondering about this. Also (I know this is not the kind of question for Quora but maybe you could help me): would you say it's "not smart" to specialize in Satellite Communications Systems today, because of the recent advances in Optical Fiber? I'm very interested in Satellite systems but really worried about this.
The study of satellite system is the study of radio communications. It is just a specific use case where the end points are separated by a really large distance. Radio communications is a very hot field today. Everything from high capacity microwave relays to the latest mobile phone technology are anchored in radio technology. So both fields have developments worth pursuing and have a lot of active research. If you are specializing in these as part of your undergraduate studies then you will cover both anyway. You can then assess after taking some more course where your interest truly lies.    Embed Quote
