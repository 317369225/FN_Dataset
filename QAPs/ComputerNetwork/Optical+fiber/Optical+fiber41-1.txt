★In the optical fiber network, what is the length in km of the fiber drum usually used?(to count the number of connectors and their losses in the power budget)
Normally, the drums holds between 3 to 6 cable km. When installed this can vary immensely, due to plant design ou incidents like cuts. Highway, long haul deployments have longer spans than metropolitan areas deployments.    Embed Quote
