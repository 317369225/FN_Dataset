★Which company(ies) sells or manufactures side-polished optical fiber?Side-polished optical fiber is typically a standard fiber having a short length that is side-polished (typically by mechanical polishing) to form a flat edge that exposes the core of the fiber for either direct or evanescent coupling of light into neighboring media.
A ton of suppliers sell tapered fibres which would serve the same purpose. Tapered fibres couple light in and out of micro toroidal cavities through evanescent coupling. Atoms can also be trapped along the tapered fibre by dipole trap formed by the evanescent decaying light.    Embed Quote
