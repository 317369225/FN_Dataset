★Are communication satellites doomed to be completely replaced by optical fiber?If not, for what will they still be useful in the future?
Absolutely not, at least not in the next 25 to 50 years. Even if in the distant future fiber (or even copper) reaches the most remotes places in sparsely populated regions (Australia's outback, the Canadian tundra, Siberia, the Amazonian rain forest) which currently make no economic sense, satellites or other wireless methods will be used to serve the aeronautical and maritime markets, the Communications on the move market (COTM), the broadcast market, the offshore drilling market among others. We're just now experiencing a new stage in the satcom industry with the High Throughput Satellites. We're far from seeing their use peak.    Embed Quote
