★Optical Fiber: What is a good quality, reasonably priced OTDR test unit?We operate several metro fiber rings as part of our network footprint.  We are looking to purchase an OTDR so we can do panel-panel testing of our dark fiber rings when we have an issue.  Looking for some recommendations on good ones to evaluate.
Hi, you can find a lot of OTDR price at: Fiber Optic Products Supplier for PON ODN FTTx from China    Embed Quote
