★Can electricity be transmitted through optical fibers (optical fibre electrical transmission)?
Standard optical fibers, no - they're glass of some sort, and thus very good insulators. There are conductive, transparent materials like tin oxide that could in principle be used, but I'm not aware that this is done. I speculate that this is because they need to be very transparent (because you're sending light through them for long distances), as well as mechanically strong, and they don't measure up. If you need to send electrical signals or power in close association with the optical signal, the normal route is to choose a fibre with a parallel (or concentric) copper conductor built in. But this has fire and electrical safety implications so you don't do it if you don't have to.    Embed Quote
