★What is attenuation for a optical fiber?
Attenuation in general gives the rate at which a signal loses its power while propogating. It is expressed in dB/km (decibel per kilometre) In optical communication, attenuation may be due to Dispersion Scattering Bending (internal or external) Intrinsic or extrinsic absorption losses Optical fibers have been fabricated with losses as low ad 0.15 dB/ km. This makes it ideal for long haul communications. Note: Attenuation must not be misunderstood with distortion. Distortion is change in the shape of signal due to noise or disturbsnces.
