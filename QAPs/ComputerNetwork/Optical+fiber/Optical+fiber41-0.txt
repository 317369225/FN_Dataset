★In the optical fiber network, what is the length in km of the fiber drum usually used?(to count the number of connectors and their losses in the power budget)
I'm unclear as to what your question is, so I apologise if this is not the answer you were looking for. Commercial optical fibre is made in 40km sections. This comes from the size of the glass preform and the ability to handle the primary coated fibre. You can buy the fibre on these 40km spools, and they are often used like that is development labs and universities. The  primary coated fibre is then coated in more layers of plastic to make the standard yellow or orange fibre that you normally see, and then wrapped in more layers to make cable you can lay outside. The 40km spools are spliced together to make whatever distance you like inside the cable. At one extreme, a trans-pacific fibre is spliced together at the factory as a single complete unit of 6000km. At the other end is a 30cm patch cord. For land-based networks, we normally engineer them with 80km optical amplifier spacing, so that is a common length for a fibre cable.    Embed Quote
