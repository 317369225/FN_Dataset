★How feasible are optic fibers to be set-up?Upto 40% of electrical energy might be wasted in its transmission. Use of optical fibres as wires might be an option for it. What problems will be faced in setting those up and can those be efficient enough?
The biggest problem with fiber optics is the fact that they are much more expensive than normal copper wires. While it is true that once installed, they last longer than copper wire and they are much faster in data transmission, still, cost matters. The second problem with optic fibers is that they are very fragile. These fibers can be broken easily when you have curves of only a few centimeters radius and when you have a lot of them installed in a single place. Due to its tenuous nature, it becomes very difficult to install them in a complex network. Finally, on a much larger scale, to solve the world electricity problem; (I am not so sure about this one, so I recommend that you research more on this point) you would have to go to each and every house, each and every server, each and every router which uses copper wires and replace them with fiber optics-- this can be a very tedious and expensive thing to accomplish. Once done, they may last longer and we would have faster internet access, still, they would be very vulnerable to damage.    Embed Quote
