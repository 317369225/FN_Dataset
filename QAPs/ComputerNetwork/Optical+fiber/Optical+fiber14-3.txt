★Can Elon Musk's satellite internet compete with optical fiber networks on bandwidth?I totally see the latency advantage of free-space vs fiber - but in terms of bandwidth, what can beat light? Will they use laser light for communication? That would of course work in space, but how about earth-satellite connection (think e.g. of clouds)?
The SpaceX proposed system will not compete with fiber or wired Internet or even wireless Internet. It will complement them: It seems that the SpaceX system will be able to reuse a lot of the research from Teledesic and combine this with Google's Loon. SpaceX obviously has the advantage that the cost of launching satellites will be so low that cost comparisons with Teledesic will be meaningless. The proposed technology for cheap ground transceivers also didn't exist in 1998 and have been developed for Loon. Teledesic would have implemented about 840 satellites with the income coming largely from businesses operating in Africa, SpaceX will probably start with 700 satellites and increase this as capacity requirements increase. Income would be from a much broader base. For many wireless applications LTE would be superior to this SpaceX network, but LTE is short range. The SpaceX technology would dominate where LTE is not available, away from densely populated areas. In practice it is likely that the SpaceX link will be used as a backbone for LTE routers because LTE will be ubiquitous. This means that you will use the same laptop modem and mobile phone in your Manhattan office (accessing the Internet via Verizon or AT&T) or from your Landrover in the Sahara desert. You just need to stick the router somewhere on the Landrover where it can see the SpaceX satellites.    Embed Quote
