★How feasible are optic fibers to be set-up?Upto 40% of electrical energy might be wasted in its transmission. Use of optical fibres as wires might be an option for it. What problems will be faced in setting those up and can those be efficient enough?
Optical figures are optically transparent materials (traditionally glass) used to transmit light, manufactured in long tubes with cladding to ensure that total internal reflection occurs place for most anglesof incidence. They are used to transmit data as light signals. However to use them as a medium of energy transfer is impractical with today's technology. This is because as of yet we cannot efficiently convert light into other useful forms of energy. Even the transducers army it's ends can only convert the data transmitted ad light into a few meagre volts of potential difference that to with an input of D.C. However the transmission efficiency of data is very high: only about 5%light is absorbed in a few kilometers. Also it is the fastest medium of transfer of information (at the speed of light!). The 40% loss you talk of is in transmission of electricity via high voltage cables. This unfortunately is so high in India as: We transfer current as high voltage AC. Use of High voltage direct current is more efficient. Lack of maintenance. This is the one of the biggest problems that ails India. Not just in this case but in general. Illegal tapping of wires to divert the current which is also accounted as loss.    Embed Quote
