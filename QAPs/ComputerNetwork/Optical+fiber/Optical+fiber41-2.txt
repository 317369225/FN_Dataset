★In the optical fiber network, what is the length in km of the fiber drum usually used?(to count the number of connectors and their losses in the power budget)
A2A The length of the Optical Fiber has no relationship with the power in general, you can theoretically have a really big roll of drum of optical fiber as long as there is no bending loss or damage of the external protective layer. But, since I'm not an expert in how the fiber optics is being produced. I'll think this document will give you more insight on the kind of usage of the optical fiber ofsoptics.com    Embed Quote
