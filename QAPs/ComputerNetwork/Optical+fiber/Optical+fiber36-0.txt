★Why does interference does not happen in optical fiber?
Interference in metal wires occurs due to production of magnetic fields by the metal (which produce currents in the metal) due to time varying electrical signals through them. The signal can also be distorted by the presence of electric/magnetic fields close to the wire. Basically anything that can induce or vary an electric/magnetic field in a metal wire would cause attenuation and interference. In optical fibers, the signal is transmitted using light. An optical fiber consists of 3 parts: core, cladding, and buffers. Transmission of light signals takes place in the core and the cladding while the buffers protects the fiber from the outside environment including extraneous light signals, i.e interference. Hence no interference occurs in optical fibers.    Embed Quote
