★Are communication satellites doomed to be completely replaced by optical fiber?If not, for what will they still be useful in the future?
Just adding this. The biggest bottleneck of communication satellites is the bandwidth . Not between them but between each satellite and any ground terminal. That's because they use radio/microwave through an absorbing, diffracting soup: the atmosphere (and part of the ionosphere). A current topic of research is how to best use light (from microwaves to ultraviolet) in uplinks and/or downlinks. Laser light. It would be directional (much more difficult to intercept or jam) and be able to carry a LOT more bits. So, NO, satellites are far away from doomed as ad-hoc point-to-point means of communication.    Embed Quote
