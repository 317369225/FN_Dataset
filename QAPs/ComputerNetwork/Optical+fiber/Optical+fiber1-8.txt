★How feasible are optic fibers to be set-up?Upto 40% of electrical energy might be wasted in its transmission. Use of optical fibres as wires might be an option for it. What problems will be faced in setting those up and can those be efficient enough?
Optical fibers are nothing but Glass strands and are actually not an electrical conductor. Transmission through FOC ( Fiber optic Cable) is pulsed light or lasers of varied intensity. which get reflected and are used for data transmission. To test a fibreoptic cable we don't use Megger as we use for resistance and continuity testing for electrical cables. We use OTDR ( Optical Time Domain Refractometer). Saying that as of now I don't know of any technological development as yet by which we can trnsmit transfer electrical power through Fiber Optic Thanks for asking    Embed Quote
