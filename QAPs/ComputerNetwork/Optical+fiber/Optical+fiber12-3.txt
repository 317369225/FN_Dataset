★What would you say is more complex to study in depth: optical fiber communication or satellite communication?I'm studying Electrical Engineering and starting to focus on Telecom and was wondering about this. Also (I know this is not the kind of question for Quora but maybe you could help me): would you say it's "not smart" to specialize in Satellite Communications Systems today, because of the recent advances in Optical Fiber? I'm very interested in Satellite systems but really worried about this.
I would think your best bet is to take lots of courses and get exposure to all kinds of data communications techniques. You should not box yourself into a very narrow area as the theory and practice, although seemingly different have to solve many of the same problems. If you are well grounded and not much experience then you can start working in either area. If you are particularly successful either by skill or being in the right place at the right time (or better yet, both) then you can finish your career in one or the other. I think cross-experience would be a plus.    Embed Quote
