★What determines the bandwidth of optical fiber versus copper wire?
Its more than just bandwidth. Copper's bandwidth is very much a function of length. Which means I can get wide bandwidth at short lengths but at longer lengths the bandwidth falls off rapidly. But optical fiber keeps its bandwidth almost independent of length. This is due to the fact that the optical fiber is a waveguide. of course both are also limited by attenuation per length. Even fiber signals become unusable after a certain amount of attenuation, but its also much, much lower per km than copper. Jacob's reply has some great technical stuff on the science behind this. P.S. A final note: copper is used in baseband mode. where the carrier is the data rate. Fiber uses carriers such as WDM which allows multiple parallel communications at different wavelengths, in effect having multiple (like 10 or 20 or more terahertz channels on the same fiber, all of which can carry hughe bandwidth.    Embed Quote
