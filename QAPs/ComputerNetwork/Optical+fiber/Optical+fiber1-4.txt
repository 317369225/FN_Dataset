★How feasible are optic fibers to be set-up?Upto 40% of electrical energy might be wasted in its transmission. Use of optical fibres as wires might be an option for it. What problems will be faced in setting those up and can those be efficient enough?
Thank you for a2a Optical fibers are for signal transmission. It can't transmit large quantity of energy. Even if it can, the energy at other end is obtained as light energy. Unlike electrical energy, light can't be easily transformed into useful work. But there are other ways to reduce transmission lose like super conductors. (google it if you are not familiar with it). Another harsh reality: 40 % transmission lose happens only in India. In most countries, it's about 3 or 5 %. Unfortunately primary reason is that people steal energy from transmission wires.    Embed Quote
