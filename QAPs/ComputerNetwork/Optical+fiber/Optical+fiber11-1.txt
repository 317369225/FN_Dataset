★What is it like to build optical fiber networks?
I'm currently on an internship in the communications department of a Canadian power utility, much of what we do is with fibre networks. In my opinion, it is extremely boring and not very technical at all. A lot of the work involves simply knowing what drawings are for what and how they for together, then knowing how to properly edit a drawing and send it to the field to get built. Most of the design is all standardized and you just have to make small modifications for the specific site, it is rare that you solve actual technical problems. The drawings are also riddled with small errors and inaccuracies which cause a lot of headaches. There are thousands of drawings... It could definitely be interesting from a project management prospective, but for me, I find it pretty boring. It's mostly about managing/working with infrastructure and field workers and keeping things organized. You also wouldn't really need an engineering degree at all to do the job. Field visits are kind of cool though...    Embed Quote
