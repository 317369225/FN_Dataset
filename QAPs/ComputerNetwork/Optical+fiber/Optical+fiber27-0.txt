★Are there ways of increasing optic fiber Wi-Fi range?
Like Jason said- optic and fiber are two different technologies so maybe you can clarify a bit what you mean?  Ways of extending the reach of optical networks includes FEC (forward error correction), increasing power, moving to a coherent detection technology, using different amplification or adding mid-stage amplification, and cleaning up bad fiber by removing unnecessary jumpers or fixing bad splices. Increasing wifi range is a matter of knowing the environment and propagation characteristics of the signal you're trying to extend. Adding more noise to an already noisy wifi environment may not help at all so understand what existing wifi signal is in the area you're trying to extend to. Changing to a technology that has antenna diversity or does beamforming or active management of APs can help greatly.    Embed Quote
