★How feasible are optic fibers to be set-up?Upto 40% of electrical energy might be wasted in its transmission. Use of optical fibres as wires might be an option for it. What problems will be faced in setting those up and can those be efficient enough?
A2A . I see most of them for use in audio / video linking aspects only . Otherwise , they are used in medical imaging I hear . I don't know anything else about this , so you might want to ask en electrical engineer . They say it is cheaper than normal copper wires , but is the cost advantage being outweighed somewhere ? I don't know . _/\_    Embed Quote
