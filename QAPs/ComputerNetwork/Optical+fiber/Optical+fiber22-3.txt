★Optical Fiber: What is a good quality, reasonably priced OTDR test unit?We operate several metro fiber rings as part of our network footprint.  We are looking to purchase an OTDR so we can do panel-panel testing of our dark fiber rings when we have an issue.  Looking for some recommendations on good ones to evaluate.
Our company is using the one OTDR, Multimode, Single Wavelength 1300nm for a half of the year and it is ok!    Embed Quote
