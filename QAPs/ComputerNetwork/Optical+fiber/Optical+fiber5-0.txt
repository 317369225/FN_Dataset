★Are communication satellites doomed to be completely replaced by optical fiber?If not, for what will they still be useful in the future?
There are places you can't run optical fiber to, whether due to harsh conditions or due to lack of business viability. Example: an airplane. Fiber also has point presence, rather than pervasive availability, which can be a serious downside in some applications. For an analogy, imagine replacing the earth's oxygen atmosphere with a terrestrial network of breathing tubes. Any circumstance in which that might be a bad idea, would also likely apply to the satellite vs fiber question.    Embed Quote
