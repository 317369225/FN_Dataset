★What are the uses of optical fiber?
Optic fibres are used in communication, especially for high speed data transfer. For details you can see the wikipedea articles(link: Optical fiber). IIRC optical fibre were discovered to make such kind of instrument, which could bend the path of light. I guess another non-technical use of optic fibres is for amusement in clubs by using partially-transparent optic fibres(link: fibre optic waterfall - Google Search). As I said optic fibres can be used to bend the path of light, this fact is useful in physics experiments, where you need to direct some LASER beam at a particular point. One use could be to demonstrate total-internal-reflection:   I guess optical fibre can be used to project holographs appropriately. But that is my speculation; I'm not sure. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
