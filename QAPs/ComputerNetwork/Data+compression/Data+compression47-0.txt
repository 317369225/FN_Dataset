★Is there any correlation between the data compression ratio of a piece of text and its information density?
Yes, there is a correlation, but if you compare children's book with a novel then you basically compare the ability of the writer to explain with many different or many redundant words.   Example 1: If you create a textfile filled with 1,000 "hello" then the desity of information is very low (related to the file size) but the compression ratio is high (because of the high redundancy).   Example 2: Create a textfile with a small story, then the desity of information depends on the words you use (but it is still higher then in example 1) and the compression ratio is lower than in the first example.     What do you think, is it better to compress data and encrypt later or encrypt first and compress later? Take a look at the examples and the answer should be easy :-)
