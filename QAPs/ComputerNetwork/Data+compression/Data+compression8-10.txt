â˜…How does file compression work?zip, tar, gz, rar etc. How does a file become 'smaller'?
When you use a smaller font size, your file takes less space. JUST KIDDING! Seriously though, compression is just finding commonly repeating sequences and replacing them with a much shorter code that represents that sequence.
