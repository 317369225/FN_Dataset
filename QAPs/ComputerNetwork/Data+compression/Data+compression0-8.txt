â˜…Is there a theoretical limit to data compression?If so, how was it found?
On the theoretical level, you can create a program, that would magically know the contents of the data and transform it to exactly one unique value. That IS IMO the theoretical limit. Because if the value would not be unique you would not be able to decide which of the source data you should decompress it to. That's for lossless compression. For lossy compression the above is not the limit - because for example two different images may be compressed to one exactly same result. There the limit is dependent on the type of data and the type of result you need. You can say that crc32 is pretty good lossy compression :)
