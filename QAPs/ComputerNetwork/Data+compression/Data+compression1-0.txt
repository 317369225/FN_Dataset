★What algorithms does Dropbox use for data compression?
I was asked to answer, but I do not work for Dropbox. I work for Serwis społecznościowy nk.pl - platforma komunikacji dla wszystkich internautów - nk.pl, though, and our communicator supports 'attachments' which are arbitrary files up 100MB. Most of the files sent by users are JPEG, MP3, or Zip, which means they are already compressed - compressing such files any further is quite challenging and not worth the effort (unless you happen to work for JPEG committee). What you could possibly do is to de-duplicate files - for example, we've noticed that the same file (minecraft.exe :D) was shared thousands times, so we considered for a while replacing all the files with same MD5 with a single copy (plus some reference counting algorithm). It turned out however that possible gain here was just a fraction of total space, and was not worth sacrificing the simplicity of current solution. Another thing we could possibly do is to compress files which are not natively compressed (.txt, .bmp, ..) but this is also a tiny fraction of the volume. What we've eventually did to limit the space usage, is brain-dead "garbage collection" - we simply remove files older than 3 months.
