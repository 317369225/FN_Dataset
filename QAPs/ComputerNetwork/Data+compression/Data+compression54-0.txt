★Data Compression: How should I go about reducing the size of a TIFF file without compromising the quality of the image?
Most image editors (or viewers that allow you to save images as different formats) give you an option to compress (losslessly) your TIFF.  By default, TIFFs are uncompressed, so if yours uses no compression, you should start there.  There are at least two compression methods that your app will support, as per TIFF's standard.  You can also save the file in a newer (but less compatible) TIFF 6 format which has more available compression methods (check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag...) If you are not constrained by file format, there are a couple of other formats which use lossless compression that might be advantageous.
