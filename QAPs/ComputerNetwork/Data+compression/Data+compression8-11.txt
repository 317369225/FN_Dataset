★How does file compression work?zip, tar, gz, rar etc. How does a file become 'smaller'?
I once wrote the compression algorithms and the decompression algorithms used in our videos games way back when I programmed games on SNES, NES, and Genesis platforms. There were a couple of interesting things I did. I tried about 12 different compression schemes, and selected the best one for that particular data file.  One of the schemes was "no compression" because there are always data which don't compress well - aka the compressed data is larger than the uncompressed data. I put into the header of the file which scheme was used, and then the decompression code knew which way to decompress. It worked fine - I actually spent very little time on this - aka few bugs were found.
