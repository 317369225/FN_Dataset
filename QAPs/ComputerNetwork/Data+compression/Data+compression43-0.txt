★What data compression techniques can be used to post more than 127 characters on Twitter?
Well, that depends on your audience; compression requires decompression. The standard English language is not the most "effective way" of transmitting information; it has a lot of redundancies. Let's take the example sentence: "A fox is crossing the street" [28 characters] 1. step: remove spaces: "AFoxIsCrossingTheStreet" [23 characters] 2. step: remove "unnecessary" vowels: "AFxSCrssngThStrt" [16 characters] 3. step: go American: "AFxSXingThStrt" [14 characters] As you can see, it becomes harder and harder to read, but given enough time, you'll still be able to understand it. The shortest way I know of, is using Chinese: "狐过路“ [3 characters] (The full version would be:一只狐狸在过马路 [8 characters], but no one would write that on Chinese Twitter). If you are looking for a way to "trick" twitter and still what to address the average English-speaker, you might be able to develop a new font based on UTF-16 and build characters that encode two or multiple letters. However, the reader would then need to install your font before he/she can read your message.
