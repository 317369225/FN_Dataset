★Data Compression: How deflate algorithm works?How does Gzip Algorithm exactly works. Can you give some example?
There are documents explaining the different algorithms and how they work (and there are many different ones, even in a single compression program), but even a trivial explanation is much too long to post on Quora (or even in an email).  Search the web and find a document.  When you see how long the explanations are, you'll understand. Simplistically (and this gives new lack-of-meaning to "simplistic"), the decompression process reverses the compression process (which you have to understand first).
