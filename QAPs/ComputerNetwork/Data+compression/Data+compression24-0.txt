â˜…How is a 170Mb file compressed to 60Mb by data compressing software?
A2A. There are a lot of compression techniques that can be used, depending on the type of file. Suppose you have an English text file. If you use ASCII coding, each letter in the file will use 8 bits. But, from the figure below, we see that all letters of the alphabet do not appear equally often. (Source: Letter frequency) So if you assign smaller bit codes to more frequently occurring letters, the average bits per letter will reduce. You can read the details here. If you have an image file, you can compress it exploiting a different property. Most natural images will have large regions with similar colors. So, if you represent the color of one pixel using, say, 8 bits, then to store the colors of neighboring pixels, you do not need 8 bits, because the difference between the two pixels is a small number that can be represented using fewer bits.
