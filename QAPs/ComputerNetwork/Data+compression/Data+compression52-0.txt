â˜…How do I find somebody in Western Australia to help investigate about a potential algorithm for lossless data compression?
Why do you think it's more secure to tell someone in person? Are you imagining some third party is wiretapping your phone? How would they know that you have this great idea? If you are worried about your interlocutor stealing your idea, they could do it in either case. It seems you are acting irrationally, and that makes your claim a priori unlikely.
