★What is good way to understand sub-band coding in data compression?I have online material: http://www.seas.gwu.edu/~ayousse... I can understand DCT or FFT will get high or low frequency of data, but I think in data compression, what we need mostly is low frequency(will indicate the contour if that is image), why do we also differ the high and low frequency? and I do not understand key idea of sub-band coding.
It is very hard to learn any new material by browsing powerpoint slides.  Do yourself a favor and go borrow a book on data compression from your local library (K. Sayood's Introduction to data compression is a very good one; check chapter 14). The principle of sub-band coding is simple: divide the signal into sub-bands, then quantize (or remove) those sub-bands that are not considered "useful" (or perceptually relevant). Because it is not block-based, it offers some advantages over block-based coding methods, but of course it has its own disadvantages.
