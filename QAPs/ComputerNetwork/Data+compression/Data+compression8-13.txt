★How does file compression work?zip, tar, gz, rar etc. How does a file become 'smaller'?
basically There are Two types of compressing algorithms... 1. Lossless 2. Lossy. In lossless Compression, as the name suggests, the data upon decompression doesn't loses it's detail. Whereas on the other hand the lossy algorithms tend to miss out the minor details of the data involved. Now from the encoding perspective we have many algorithms Which tend to make use of the  statistical redundancy to Compress, apart from making use of the sine wave formats like the DCTs and the MDCTs We know small differences in color are more difficult to perceive than are changes in brightness.The picture in a video or a frame is represented using pixels. these pixels in turn are stored in the form of 1' and 0's( may be common frequency etc of sine waves in the data). The Trade off in lossy algorithms is to Manipulate these lilttle differences in the data. Further Refrence :- Data compression
