â˜…What are some data compression done with financial data?
For general purpose archival purposes your standard gzip, bzip2 or zip are most commonly used. For realtime data, FIX Adapted for STreaming (aka FAST) is commonly used for real time market data feeds. Among a couple other data compression techniques used in the protocol, FAST compression can take advantage of the fact that market prices typically change in increments smaller than what can be represented in 32 bit or even 16 bit integers. Rather than send the whole integer or decimal fixed points that take up 32 bits, the protocol can send deltas (i.e. add/subtract 1 cent to/from the previous price) represented by fewer bits.
