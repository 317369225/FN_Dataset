★Can the application of a  data compression algorithm to analytical data increase the speed in which it is processed?Data compression is essentially a form of feature detection. Can compressing the data beforehand (as it is incorporated) and decompressing it after offer improved speed and insight?
Compression simply reduces the number of bits required to represent your original data.  In lossy compression, it can be considered a form of filtering. To compress you try to identify similarities among your data, and compression does require processing.  If you don't need to compress the data, you may be better off spending your CPU power to analyze your data for what you really want to find. However, if you do need to compress them, it is possible to combine the two processes (analysis and compression).
