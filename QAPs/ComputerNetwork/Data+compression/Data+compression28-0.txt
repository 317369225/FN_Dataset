â˜…Have the memories of older people undergone more "data compression" than those of younger people?
No one knows how our memories are stored. The paradigms, including "data compression" we use to simulate "memory" with our simpleton (binary for G_d's sake!) machines are, in my opinion, not applicable to the biology of human memory.
