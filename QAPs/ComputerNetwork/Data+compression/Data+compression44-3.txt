★Can the application of a  data compression algorithm to analytical data increase the speed in which it is processed?Data compression is essentially a form of feature detection. Can compressing the data beforehand (as it is incorporated) and decompressing it after offer improved speed and insight?
you can measure the similarity of time series or data by building a compressor model and then compress another data with the same compressor model. If it compresses well, your data is similar to the first one. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ent...
