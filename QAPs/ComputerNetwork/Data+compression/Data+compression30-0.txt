â˜…Data Compression: What is the most powerful file compressor in terms of size reduction?
First, you have to ask yourself is: are you interested in lossless compression (that is, you want no information to be lost in the process of compression), or lossy compression (that is, you want the majority of the information to be retained, for example, you want to compress an image or a movie, but it's OK if some small details are lost). Then, it's important to know that the answer depends significantly on what is known, and what assumptions can be made, about the files you will be compressing. In general, if you are compressing specific data type, you should look at specialized compression algorithms which take into account the intrinsic properties of the data they will be fed. For example, if you are compressing images, look at implementation of the LZW algorithm (for example, PNG). If you are okay with a lossy compression, then specialized algorithms will perform significantly better than generic ones, even for a comparable amount of data loss.
