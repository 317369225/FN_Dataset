â˜…Is there still a long way to go in data compression algorithms?
Communication infrastructure is broadbend, storage capacities rise day by day, for the same amount of money, data compression becomes less and less important, but, yes, there is a long way to go in data compression. It's the matter of time when somebody will come up with pretty clever algorithm for even bigger compression ratio than we have today.
