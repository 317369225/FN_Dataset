★Data Compression: Does bzip2 work as well on gzipped files as it does on uncompressed files?Is there any difference in net compression depending on whether you apply better compression algorithms in sequence or start with the raw data and go straight to the best compression algorithm?
Compression basically works by recognizing repetition and redundancy, replacing less efficient representations or encodings of information with more efficient ones.  By eliminating the original inefficiency, it also eliminates the things that any other compression method would look for.  The more closely related the two compression algorithms are, the more severe this effect will be.  Encryption also destroys the things that compression algorithms look for, when it replaces plaintext with ciphertext (which is by design pattern-less).  Therefore, trying to compress encrypted or already-compressed data is a waste of time.  You're always better off applying the best available compression algorithm to the original data.
