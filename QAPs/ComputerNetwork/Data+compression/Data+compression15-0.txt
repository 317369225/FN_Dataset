â˜…Which data compression algorithms support compression in-place?
ZLIB (zlib) supports the deflateBound function, which provides an upfront estimate of the maximum possible output size given an input size, provided that certain conditions are followed in terms of the subsequent API calls made to ZLIB (zlib). zlib 1.2.8 Manual Specifically, if you do not perform any flush in the middle of the stream - only to perform a single flush at the very end of the data, then the output upper bound estimated by deflateBound is guaranteed. The number is calculated from a worst-case inflation ratio (where the output data is slightly expanded due to incompressibility of input data - see Pigeonhole principle under "lossless compression algorithms"), plus a header size. A code implementation would be outside the scope of a Quora question, but you are welcome to share your implementations on GitHub, if you will.
