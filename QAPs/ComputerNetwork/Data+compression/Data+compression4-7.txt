★Is data compression a dual of learning? If not, why?Just like the reverse version of MDL
Compression is not a dual of learning. It is a dual of (arguably) a specific type of learning called overfitting which can be understood in layman terms as mugging. To make it more clear : Lets say you have lots of data about a physics experiment on amount of force applied and the acceleration produced. Compression would be trying to write down all that data is a coded format so that it can be used as cheatsheet.   Learning in this case would be inferring mass of any input object from the F applied and acceleration values observed.
