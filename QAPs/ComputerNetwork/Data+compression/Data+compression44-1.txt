★Can the application of a  data compression algorithm to analytical data increase the speed in which it is processed?Data compression is essentially a form of feature detection. Can compressing the data beforehand (as it is incorporated) and decompressing it after offer improved speed and insight?
Not sure if this is the example you're after, but certain spam filtering methods use compression algorithms to detect spam. In other words, compression IS the processing.
