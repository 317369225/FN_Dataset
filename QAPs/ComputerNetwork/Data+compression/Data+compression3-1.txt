â˜…How does data compression works?What are some good data compression algorithms and what programming language is most suitable to create data compression tools?
There is so much theory to say and writing it all in one or two lines is not possible - at least to me. One way of putting the idea is that we make a highly correlated data to less correlated, having still the possibility of getting back as much data as possible. Dimensionality reduction is one such basic approach.
