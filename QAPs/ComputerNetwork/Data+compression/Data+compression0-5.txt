â˜…Is there a theoretical limit to data compression?If so, how was it found?
Suppose you have a program that compresses your data in a smaller file. Now you feed all possible files into the compressor. It turns out that HALF of your files didn't get smaller at all. One quarter got it's size reduced by exactly 1 bit, one eight by two bits, etcetera. The fact that you can cut off kilobytes from the average file tells something about its needless complexity. However, using the same compressor, there is one possible file that gets reduced to one bit. THAT's the theoretical limit.
