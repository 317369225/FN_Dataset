â˜…Compressed Sensing: How can apply CS in FMCW radar to get the range and azimuth data?
An FMCW radar uses frequency chirping to determine range. The radar carrier signal starts at a low frequency and increases linearly with time. After some maximum frequency is reached, the carrier drops back to its original frequency. This signal is transmitted. If it its a target, it will reflect back. The reflected signal will look just like the original, but it will be delayed in time. The time delayed return is mixed with the original signal. Since the are both increasing in frequency with time and the time delay is constant, when mixed, the beat signal will be a constant frequency. The longer the time delay, the greater the difference between the two signals and the higher the beat frequency will be. Therefore, the beat frequency represents time delay which in turn is easily converted to range. Typically, the two signals are represented by a time versus frequency chart where the two signals are plotted and it becomes apparent what the time delay is and how that results in a beat frequency. Thus, FMCW will give you range, generally for much lower emitted transmit power than a pulse radar. It is not obvious how this will provide azimuth data. There isn't anything inherent (that I am aware of) in the FMCW signal that could be exploited to provide azimuth data. In general, this will be a function of the antenna. Off axis signals will be transmitted in a different direction. It may take longer for that signal to return and can be exploited to provide azimuth data.
