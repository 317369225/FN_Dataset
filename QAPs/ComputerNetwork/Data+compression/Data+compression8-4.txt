★How does file compression work?zip, tar, gz, rar etc. How does a file become 'smaller'?
One way compression works is by taking advantage of redundancies. Lossless compression schemes, like zip, gz, etc, build a "dictionary" of frequently used "words" (say, "the", "ar", "pre", "and"), etc.) and instead of sending those words, they send an index to the dictionary.  No need to send the actual dictionary, because the decoder can build it on the fly as well.
