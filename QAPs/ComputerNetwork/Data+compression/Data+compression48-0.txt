â˜…How will you explain "Data Compression" to a layman?
Imagine that you need to carry a thousand balloons (the kind that you put all around in the room during birthday celebrations) from one place to another. If you carry them in their inflated form, you would need a truck. Instead, you deflate them, carry an air pump, put all the deflated balloons in a small plastic bag and you are good to go without the truck. At destination, re-inflate the balloons. This is how data compression works. Usable information (inflated balloons) is analyzed and a smaller set of data is created using a conversion logic (deflation of balloon). This conversion could be lossy (you cannot recreate original data from the compressed data exactly as it was before) or lossless (otherwise). Storage and Transmission savings are huge due to compression. The decompressing software reads the compressed file header (meta-data) to identify compression logic and accordingly interprets compressed data and regenerates decompressed data using the reverse logic. the initial balloons = the decompressed voluminous data, the deflated ones = the compressed data, the technique of deflating the balloons = compression algorithm, the air pump = the decompression algorithm the savings in transport cost and effort of balloons is the advantage of saved network/storage bandwidth that you derive out of data compression. Sorry for being too verbose! :P
