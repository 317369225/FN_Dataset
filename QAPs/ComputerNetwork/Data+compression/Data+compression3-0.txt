★How does data compression works?What are some good data compression algorithms and what programming language is most suitable to create data compression tools?
I assume you are talking about loss-less compression, that data is recovered into the exactly byte stream as before after compression and decompression procedures. Most famous software were combining LZ based algorithm with a entropy coding algorithm. The initial LZ77 algorithm was quite simple, however programmers had made many variants and used many tricks in implementation. Here are some algorithms by keywords: 7-zip (LZMA) :   LZ77 + Range Coding, with hash chain or binary tree match finder, optimal parsing, FSM context modal for range coder, BCJ/BCJ2 preprocessor on executable files. Zip/gzip/deflate:  LZ77 with 32KB dictionary size + Huffman Coding RAR all version:  LZ77 + Huffman Coding,  larger window size. Bzip2:  BWT(aka block sorting) + MTF + Huffman Coding LZ4 / LZF / Snappy / LZO / QuickLZ :  All are LZ77 variants. All of them were initially written in C. Since data compression emphasize on performance, I think C should be the best choice.
