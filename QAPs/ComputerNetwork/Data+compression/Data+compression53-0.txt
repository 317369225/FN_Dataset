â˜…Data Compression: Which video compression methods take historical and prospective data to estimate the data for any point in time in the video?Please excuse my lack of computing knowledge in regard to data compression. My background is Statistics and so I understand the benefit of using limited data before and after a time point to paint a picture of what happens at that time point. I want to know if popular compression methods are based on this line of thinking or if they are more based on other ways of thinking.
Almost all standard video compression methods (MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.264, etc.) take into consideration both past frames and future frames. VP8 was one of the few codecs that did not consider future frames.
