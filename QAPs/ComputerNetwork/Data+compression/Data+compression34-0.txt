â˜…Information Theory: What is the relationship between intelligence and data compression algorithms?
Data compression algorithms work by exploiting redundancy in data. What is redundancy? In a way it is finding a pattern which the data might exhibit even though it is not very obvious if glanced at cursorily. Data compression algorithms are very good at finding this, and exploiting it to represent the data in a much shorter way. Intelligence might be quantified by how fast you are able to identify similar things in a seemingly non random data-set. Thus the two concepts might find a relationship there. But intelligence would be a super-set of data compression algorithms because just noticing patterns and exploiting them to achieve your goal might only be one of the few things that would really be considered intelligent.
