â˜…Is data compression a dual of learning? If not, why?Just like the reverse version of MDL
In Lempel-Ziv, the most common lossless compression scheme, the encoder tries to create a dictionary of the most common patterns in the source. Then, whenever the same pattern is encountered, it replaces it with an index to the dictionary. From [1] "At each stage in compression, input bytes are gathered into a sequence until the next character would make a sequence for which there is no code yet in the dictionary. The code for the sequence (without that character) is emitted, and a new code (for the sequence with that character) is added to the dictionary." Thus, in some sense, the encoder tries to learn what are the most common sequences in your source to improve compression. [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lem...
