★How does file compression work?zip, tar, gz, rar etc. How does a file become 'smaller'?
They use various compression techniques. I'll give you example of a simple technique. It's called huffman maximum variance technique. Here, You first read the file and then find the probability of every symbol occurring in that file..and write that in descending order. So, the symbol most occurring in file will be at the top.[Here, Symbol A] Combine least two probabilities and make a new temporary symbol. [Here, combining D and E makes a symbol E'(not shown in figure, Temporary symbol is just for your convenience)] Do that until there are only two symbols. Now, This is how your tree looks like.                 A'            A           B''                     B'      C'                    B   C   D   E   Assign lest side of the branch to 0 and right side of the brach to 1. Now, Codeword of A = 0. Codeword of B = 100   Codeword of C = 101   Codeword of D = 110 Codeword of E = 111. If suppose your file was AAAABCDE. Here, symbol A occurs most. Before compression, you will be sending 8 bits for each symbol. So, it'll be 64 bits. After compression, you will send 0 0 0 0 100 101 110 111. That's only 20 bits. There are other techniques you can use like LZ77, LZSS or LZ78 approach.
