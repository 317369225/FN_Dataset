â˜…What are the suggested papers and readings one should read before working on a project related to data compression? some of the algorithms like LZW,huffman etc.i am planning to do a project related to compression of files. Though i have found some papers related to that but i am clueless how to begin and take a move.
When you start exploring a new topic, you never start by reading papers, at least not if you can find a good book. I suggest you start by reading an introductory book, such "Introduction to data compression" by K. Sayood ( Introduction to Data Compression, Fourth Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Multimedia Information and Systems): Khalid Sayood: 9780124157965: Amazon.com: Books ) or something similar. After you understand the basics, then you can dive into papers and other literature.
