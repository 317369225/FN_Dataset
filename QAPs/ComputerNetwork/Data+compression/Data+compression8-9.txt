★How does file compression work?zip, tar, gz, rar etc. How does a file become 'smaller'?
Perhaps the file -- in bits and bytes -- looks like this: 01100100110100101100000100111010110101100100... You see how that "011" pattern re-occurs six times above?  Maybe I'll try to save some space by just substituting the letter "A" every time I see "011." So now my pattern looks like: A0010A01001A0000010A101A01A00100... See?  I just potentially saved (compressed) 12 slots -- turned 18 slots into 6 slots.  My sample file is now ~73% the size it used to be (32 of an original 44).  Yes, when it is time for me to "un-compress" the file, it will take me a few seconds to go back through and re-substitute "011" in place of every "A," but that's the time-space tradeoff you make when you start compressing things. The true compression mechanism is a bit more complicated (prefix coding and such, need to make sure nobody gets "011" confused with "01" and mis-substitutes) -- additionally, modern-day compression algorithms use long tree structures, or even a weird overlapping-five-circle diagram that looks a bit like the Olympic rings -- but that example hopefully conveys the general idea.
