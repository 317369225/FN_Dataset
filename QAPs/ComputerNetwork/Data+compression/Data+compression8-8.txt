★How does file compression work?zip, tar, gz, rar etc. How does a file become 'smaller'?
OK, the best description I have come across is that file compression looks for repeating sequences of characters and replaces them with single character codes when it can.  So, a common word in a text file would be 'the'.  The compression algorithm might replace this with a '1', say.  It would do the same for other words, and then finally bundle a lookup table into the file so that it could be meaningfully decompressed. So far, I've just repeated what others have said in this thread, but there is one very salient addition to all of this.  You cannot efficiently compress a totally random file as repeating patterns tend to be absent.  But compression itself randomizes a file's contents.  So, this implies that you can only compress a file so far.  Once you've eliminated all the redundancy, you're left with a dense, unyielding set of data. The only way you can compress any further is to go for 'lossy' compression, and that only works in certain circumstances, for example by losing fine detail in video sequences.
