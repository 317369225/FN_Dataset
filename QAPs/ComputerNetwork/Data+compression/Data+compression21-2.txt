â˜…What is the best way to learn about data compression algorithms?
Find a good book or tutorial on general theory of data compression and maybe a good book or tutorial on practical implementation, preferably with code or pseudocode, study them, dig through the repositories -- like github or sourceforge -- for actual working implementations, preferably in the computer language of your choice (but any language will do), read the code, take notes. For a better understanding, design and implement your own package or library of compression and decompression routines/objects/whatever, and test them out against any existing zip files or tarballs or compressed data thingamabobs you can find or come across. See if other decompression programs can correctly handle what your stuff compresses -- assuming, of course, implementations of the same compression scheme(s). You will probably be surprised at the errors and inconsistencies you find.
