â˜…What are the suggested papers and readings one should read before working on a project related to data compression? some of the algorithms like LZW,huffman etc.i am planning to do a project related to compression of files. Though i have found some papers related to that but i am clueless how to begin and take a move.
I strongly recommend you to read "Data Compression Explained" by Mat Mahoney, it's free online (Data Compression Explained) That book will give you excellent background and the algorithms from the foundations (Huffman,LZ) to the most advanced ones. The Block Sorting Paper by Burrows and Wheeler is something I always recommend because it shows how sometimes you can create a solution almost out of the blue. It's a beautiful read. The title is "A block sorting lossless data compression algorithm"
