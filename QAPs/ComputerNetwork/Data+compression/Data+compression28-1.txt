â˜…Have the memories of older people undergone more "data compression" than those of younger people?
Data compression is the process of condensing stories (memories) into abstract knowledge, understanding, and insight. Age only leads to memories becoming less well-recorded, in other words forgetfulness. Contemplation leads to data compression. Older people may have had more time to contemplate, but that doesn't mean they've done it.
