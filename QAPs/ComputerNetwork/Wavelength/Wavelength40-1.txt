★Why is the colour of light normally specified by its wavelength and not frequency?Wavelength will vary according to the refractive index of the medium it is travelling through so red light with a wavelength of 700 nm in space will have a wavelength of 500 nm in a glass or liquid with refractive index of 1.4. This is the same wavelength as green light. Surely it would be more sensible to define colour by frequency which will be constant for a colour regardless of medium refractive index?
The color of light is specified by its wavelength because the receptors in our eye pass on different signals to your brain depending on the wavelengths of the light that falls onto them. It's a beautiful system, an interplay of the physics and biological world, and thanks to that we can see the world around is in all its wonderful colors! The refractive index of a translucent material defines at what speed light travels through that material and - when entering the material - to what extent the light is bent (dispersed). How much the light is bent, depends on the wavelength of it, so not all light bends the same entering the same material. This causes a white beam of light - that consists out of many different wavelengths afterall - to split in different colors when entering a material such as glass under a favorable angle...  Which is why a glass prism renders a rainbow. I think this is a more accurate way to describe what happens when light enters a translucent material then saying that its wavelength changes.    Embed Quote
