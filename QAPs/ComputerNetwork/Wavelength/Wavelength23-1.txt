★How can I calculate the distance of LASER beam if we know the wavelength?e.g I have a LASER light of 630-680nm. What will be the distance which it will cover ? The power is about <1mw
As other repliers have noted, you can't determine range from wavelength. Wavelength would have little impact on range, except for losses from absorption and scattering. For example, green laser pointers are wonderful for teaching astronomy because their beams scatter enough to make them show up well. Red light doesn't scatter as much, so you don't usually see the beam. From that, it's reasonable to conclude that if you had two 5 mW laser pointers, one red and one green, the red one would have a greater range. It never works out that way (at least, not for laser pointers), since our eyes respond better to green light than to red. The analysis has to consider many, many factors.    Embed Quote
