★Why is the colour of light normally specified by its wavelength and not frequency?Wavelength will vary according to the refractive index of the medium it is travelling through so red light with a wavelength of 700 nm in space will have a wavelength of 500 nm in a glass or liquid with refractive index of 1.4. This is the same wavelength as green light. Surely it would be more sensible to define colour by frequency which will be constant for a colour regardless of medium refractive index?
Light is green when it enters our eyes, it has no "colour" in air, glass or a vacuum. It is relatively easy to measure the wavelength of, say, a green light source, using tools that have been available for at least 200 years - Thomas Young measured the wavelengths of different colours in 1802!  It is much more difficult to measure frequency, even today.    Embed Quote
