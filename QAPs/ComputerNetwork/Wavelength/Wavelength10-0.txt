★Why do long wavelengths travel further than short wavelengths?
This is true only when light travels through some medium where scattering can take place. The intensity of the scattered light by a particle is inversely proportional to the fourth power of its wavelength, which means shorter wavelengths are scattered more strongly. This implies the energy of shorter wavelengths get dissipated faster in the form of agitation of molecules and they penetrate lesser distance than long wavelength light. This is the reason why the sky appears 'reddish' during the evenings. Due to sun's relative position near the horizon, the light has to cover a greater distance and the "bluish" end of the spectrum is scattered away in its early stages of traveling the atmosphere, leaving the reddish hue.    Embed Quote
