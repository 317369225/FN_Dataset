★Does the world really have colours? Or is it just our brain's interpretation of the wavelengths?
Our brains and their wavelengths are part of the world. Are you asking if objects have intrinsic qualities that cause us to perceive them as having different colors? If so, the answer is yes. Oranges and bananas don't seem to have different colors to us just due to some trick of the mind. They have different surface structures that react differently to light. Those structures are very real. Are you asking if our brains translate the data that comes into them, and are you suggesting those translations don't map perfectly onto the stuff that generated the data? In other words, are you asking if our brains interpret? If so, the answer is yes. This question is kind of like asking if the message you receive that's written in morse code really means anything. Yes, it does. It's an encoded version of real information. That's what your perception of color is.    Embed Quote
