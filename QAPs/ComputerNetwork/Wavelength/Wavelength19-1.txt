★Does the wavelength of light change relative to your speed?As you go faster, does the wavelength of light shrink with space?
Yes. The Doppler effect also exists with electromagnetic waves. If you move towards something it will, from your perpective mind you (!!), blue-shift (the wavelength will become shorter), if you move away from it it will red-shift (the wavelength will become longer) Source: Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Studying and Observing the Accelerating and Expanding Universe    Embed Quote
