★What is the longest-wavelength laser that exists?
It depends on what you understand as a laser. Laser were pre-dated by maser (Microwaves by stimulated emission of radiation) which work from the physical point of view exactly like lasers. The only difference is the wavelength. A popular one is the Hydrogen Maser running at 24 GHz which is equal to a wavelength of about 10 cm. If you allow free-electron lasers and microwave tubes to be lasers, you might find devices with wavelength up to 30 cm. In these devices electron transitions amplify the radiation, similar to lasers using electronic transition. However, these electrons are free and not bound to anything as in other laser.    Embed Quote
