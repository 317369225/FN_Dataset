★The wavelength of light determines its colour. But how does a 'blue' photon differ from a 'red' photon?
Photons differ from each other by the energy they carry from the equation E=hf  (h is the planck constant). A blue photon has a higher frequency than a red photon thus is more energetic.    Embed Quote
