★Does the world really have colours? Or is it just our brain's interpretation of the wavelengths?
This has been a premise of philosophy since ancient times, that objecst have no property of color (the spelling of which telegraphs my national origin), and all color is producd in the mind of the observer.  As a question of physics, this seems to hold true to a degree, as color we perceive is a consequence of light absorption, emission, reflection and refraction when light strikes a particular surface and is directed back to our eyes, which have specialized cells to respond differently when excited by incoming light energy.  Most animals see in monochrome or limited color spectra as determined by experimentation and examination of the cells of the retinas of those animals which were tested. One could argue that objects have color properties in respect to absorption and emission, etc., and humans have the ability to perceive these occurances.  From the philosophical point of view, objects have no quality of color because when the light that shines on them is of limited spectra, the color perception changes.  As a thought experiment, consider shining a blue light on a tree which is not illuminated by any other source of light; since it would no longer be perceived as brown bark and green leaves, one could conclude that the tree really contains no quality of "brownness" of the bark and likewise no quality of "greenness" of its leaves.    Embed Quote
