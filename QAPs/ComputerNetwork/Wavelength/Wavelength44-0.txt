★Electromagnetic Spectrum: What is the longest wavelength we can detect?And what is the shortest?
0.1 Hz is the lowest frequency detected (3,000,000km wavelength) RADIO WAVES below 22 kHz 3-30Hz are actually used for communications with submarines but most of the radiation at this long wavelength are produced by the earths magnetic field and lightning. Extremely low frequency The shortest wavelength is that of Gamma rays with a wavelength in the range of 10 picometers    Embed Quote
