★If I mix a beam with e.g. a wavelength of 700nm (red) and another beam of say wavelength 400nm (green), is the result a beam with a color which cannot be expressed by a single wavelength?My question arises from the use of the RGB color encoding scheme. RGB uses three dimensions to specify a single point in a color space. Can be interpreted as three beams of different wavelengths, and the amount can be interpreted as beam amplitude(?). My question is if the mix of RGB can be expressed as a beam of light with a single wavelength?
Physically, your resulting beam is just a bunch of 400nm and 700nm photons mixed together.  They don't merge to average out...  So the answer is no, not all RGB colors have an equivalent frequency.  The simplest example is white, which can easily be achieved with RGB but cannot be replicated with a single frequency. It's your eyes and brains that do the interpretation and it's not a simple formula because your eyes don't respond equally to all frequencies.  There is a great mathematical explanation called "CIE 1931 Color Space".  See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE... .  Hope you're good in math... There is also an interactive color calculator at http://www.easyrgb.com/index.php... which may solve your problem without having to do the math... (select the XYZ system, not RGB) Also, please note that 700nm is very near infrared and 400nm is in the "blacklight" (near-uv) frequencies, not green...  In both cases, your eyes will see something but not very much since you are at the extremes of our seeing capacity.    Embed Quote
