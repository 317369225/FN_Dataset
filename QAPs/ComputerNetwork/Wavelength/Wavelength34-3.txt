★Why is the visible spectrum of light visible?I am not asking about the Physics involved behind it, I know how our eyes work and I am also aware of the wavelengths we can normally perceive. But when compared to other living beings that can see colour, why do we see only light in this particular range of EM spectrum, is there any reason based on theory of evolution behind the way our eyes evolved to see 'visible' spectrum of light?
Because our sun has been shining in a particular way for milions of yers and via evolution we developed sensing organs (eyes) specially designed for that piece of EM spectrum. Deep-water creatures haven't. Shrimps see much more than we do.    Embed Quote
