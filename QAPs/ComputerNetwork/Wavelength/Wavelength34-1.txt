★Why is the visible spectrum of light visible?I am not asking about the Physics involved behind it, I know how our eyes work and I am also aware of the wavelengths we can normally perceive. But when compared to other living beings that can see colour, why do we see only light in this particular range of EM spectrum, is there any reason based on theory of evolution behind the way our eyes evolved to see 'visible' spectrum of light?
One reason could be via evolution. For human beings, the spectrum of the light which could save from more predators and locate prey is more useful. For bees, they need to find out flowers with nectar and pollen. You can see here how we see the flowers( left ) and how bees see flowers( right ). A bee's vision lets it locate nectar quite easily!
