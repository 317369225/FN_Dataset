★The wavelength of light determines its colour. But how does a 'blue' photon differ from a 'red' photon?
The  difference is its energy level. The more energy available to particles  the faster they're able to move, we see this as heat. With light of  course it's a faster wavelength. Heat  up a piece of metal and it'll soon become hot enough to emit photons and  the metal will begin to glow a dull red. Increasing the heat/energy  further will see the red become brighter until it becomes orange, and on  to yellow. Beyond that we'd see the  metal become white hot, but that's because it's now too bright to look  at, it is still giving off yellow light. The  blue glare of Xenon headlights is due to the extreme temperatures  achieved within; the photons emitted having far more energy thus faster  wavelength than those emitted by red hot metal.    Embed Quote
