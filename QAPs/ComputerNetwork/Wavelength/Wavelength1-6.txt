★Why does the light's wavelength change, and not frequency, during refraction?
Giordon Stark's answer is pretty good. In fact, any answer must refer to the boundary conditions as he did. But there is another way to view the "quick math": imagine a simple plane wave incident on the boundary come from the left (Stark's boundary conditions did up/down, I find it easier to visualize left/right). The electric field on the left must be a sum of incident and reflected waves, the electric field on the right must also be a simple plane wave. But at the surface, the left and right must equal each other (the boundary condition Stark gave). This means that one harmonic function must equal the sum of two others. But the only way this can happen (try it: it is high school trigonometry) is if all three have equal frequencies.    Embed Quote
