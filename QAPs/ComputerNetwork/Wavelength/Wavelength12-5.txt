★Does the world really have colours? Or is it just our brain's interpretation of the wavelengths?
That depends upon your definition of "colours". If you define it as the perception of light wavelength, then it existss only within one's own hull. If you define it, on the other hand, as narrowed-spectrum wavelengths, then colo(u)r is everywhere that visible light exists.    Embed Quote
