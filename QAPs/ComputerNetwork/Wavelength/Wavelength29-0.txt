★Can the Wavelength of light change in air / vaccum? If then, How?
Yes, in air definitely, and in vacuum it is predicted to do so above the Schwinger limit. The basis for wavelength change is non-linear optics. At high enough intensities the non-linearity in the medium will cause wavelengths to change and also new wavelengths to emerge by self phase modulation. Raman effects will also lead to the wavelength changing. A quantum mechanical explanation - multiple photons raise electron energy levels to virtual energy levels. The electron comes down to the ground state subsequently emitting fewer photons that excited the electron to begin with.    Embed Quote
