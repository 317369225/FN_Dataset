★Does the wavelength of light change relative to your speed?As you go faster, does the wavelength of light shrink with space?
Sort of. The relativistic Doppler effect is what you're looking for. A warning: don't think of wavelength 'shrinking' with space. Space is not a tangible medium, it's not compressible. Your measurement of successive wavelength changes, that's all. In any case, there is a whole Wikipedia article on this phenomenon. Do look into it.    Embed Quote
