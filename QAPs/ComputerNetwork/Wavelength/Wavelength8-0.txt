★What determines the wavelength of different colors?
The wavelength is a property of the photon. The photon gets that wavelength depending on how it was emitted. The color you perceive it as is a property of your eyes and your brain. You have three overlapping sensors, roughly for photons in short, medium, and long wavelengths. The relative stimulations are interpreted by the brain as different colors. (And allows you to fake colors by using two different photons to mimic the same signal that one photon would make, which is how red + green -> yellow.) The full physiology and neurophysics of Color vision is still being worked on, but the wavelengths themselves are a matter of physics which is (at least in this sense) considerably simpler and well-understood.    Embed Quote
