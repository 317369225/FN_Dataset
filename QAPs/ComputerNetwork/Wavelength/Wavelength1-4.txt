★Why does the light's wavelength change, and not frequency, during refraction?
I'll take the particle/Quantum Mechanical version of this (for the wave version, take a look at Huygen's principle - which is very similar).   Actually, neither change. Not really.   Refraction occurs in a medium. In that medium, the photons are absorbed and re-emitted over and over again. Photon hits electron, it rings for a bit, then spits a photon back out. Rinse, repeat. This ringing part takes time, which slows the progression of the photon. It'll have the same frequency. It'll have the same wavelength. Because in those little hops between it's still travelling at the speed of light - photons never travel at any other speed, unless you're looking at them statistically.   There are other clever effects which come into play, such as phonons, and boson behavior, and quantum electrodynamics (such as the sum-over-history model of the photon's path) (heck, the key part of this question is why Feynman got a Nobel prize), but I'll leave that for further reading.    Embed Quote
