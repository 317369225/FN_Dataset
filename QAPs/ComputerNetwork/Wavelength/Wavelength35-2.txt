★Why is it easier to detect radio wave than measuring the shorter wavelengths?
Radio waves typically range from the size of your hand to the size of skyscrapers. Resonance based antennae (simple wires) require that the length of the antenna be wavelength/2 or wavelength/4 to be able to cause 'constructive' interference in the movement of electrons within the antenna; This 'resonance' causes a substantial measurable signal. As we go to lower wavelengths, we'd require smaller and smaller antennae to be able to detect waves using this method and other methods, as mentioned in Shreyas' answer are needed, which are more difficult than using a simple wire.    Embed Quote
