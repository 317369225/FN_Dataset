★How did we know the wavelength range for visible light?
Use a prism to produce a solar spectrum.  On one extreme people with good color vision will see red.  On the other they will see violet.  Direct the most extreme part of the red light through a diffraction grating with a known number of etched lines per centimeter.  Measure the angle between the resulting red lines emerging from the grating, and use the derived formula relating the angle and lines per centimeter to the wavelength (found in any good introductory physics book), and do the calculation. Do the same for the extreme part of the violet light. It's easily done, and can be done by high school students with equipment in a well stocked physics lab.    Embed Quote
