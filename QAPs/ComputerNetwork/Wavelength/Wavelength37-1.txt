★When light is passed through the prism, it undergoes refraction or bending. The extent of bending depends upon the wavelength of photons. Why is radiation of longer wavelength bent to a smaller degree than the radiation of shorter wavelength. Explain the reason?
I always find 'why?' questions to be a bit dodgy in a physics context unless it's clear that 'why?' is being translated as 'by what mechanism?' rather than wandering off into philosophical wastelands. That said, Jacob VanWagoner and Keith Allpress have covered all of the bases, unless you now want to know 'why?' electric dipoles resonate the way they do.    Embed Quote
