★Is there a concept of a negative wavelength?
"Negative" refers to direction. On a linear axis, one direction is labeled "positive" and the opposite direction is labeled "negative". Wavelength is just like any other length... a measure of how far something extends along a particular direction. If you are measuring the length of a wave along the positive direction, you can report the wavelength as a positive value. If you are measuring the length of a wave along the negative direction, you can report the wavelength as a negative value. To keep things from being too confusing, quantities are most often reported along the positive direction. It is a mater of your frame of reference.    Embed Quote
