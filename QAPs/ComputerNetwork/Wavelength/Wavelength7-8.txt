★If there are wavelengths, are there wave heights?For clarification: is there measurement for how much space a wave takes vertically, assuming you're looking at it move horizontally through space?
The "height" of a wave is its amplitude. It is definitive in describing how intense the wave is. Large amplitudes mean louder sounds, or more intense light. http://www.indiana.edu/~emusic/a...    Embed Quote
