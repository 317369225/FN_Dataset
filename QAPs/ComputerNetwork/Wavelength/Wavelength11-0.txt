★What colors/wavelengths are the best for your eyes?I recall that green is a really good color to look at when your eyes need a break.
Your eyes focus and detect different colors, well, differently. The human eye can focus best on red light. However, it is most sensitive to shorter wavelengths (e.g. blue light). So... If you need something to be really bright (e.g. a laser pointer on a well lit screen), you want something that is green or blue. But, if the wavelength is too short (particularly common with blue and near-UV light), you will have difficulty focusing (i.e. may see multiple spots, items will appear fuzzy). Because of this, most people prefer a red-ish or "warm" light for most day-to-day tasks.    Embed Quote
