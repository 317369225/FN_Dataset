★If there are wavelengths, are there wave heights?For clarification: is there measurement for how much space a wave takes vertically, assuming you're looking at it move horizontally through space?
What you are talking about is amplitude. However, a wave is not usually measured by looking at how much space it takes up (there are cases where the actual size of a wave packet is important, but we won't bother with that). Think of waves as sinusoidal oscillations. What oscillates could be an electric or magnetic field. These types of waves are called transverse waves, where the oscillations are perpendicular to the propagation direction of the wave. Longitudinal waves, like sound waves, compress the air in the direction that the wave travels. One typically measures the intensity of a wave, which is equivalent to the amplitude squared.    Embed Quote
