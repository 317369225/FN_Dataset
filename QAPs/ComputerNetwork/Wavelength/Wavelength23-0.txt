★How can I calculate the distance of LASER beam if we know the wavelength?e.g I have a LASER light of 630-680nm. What will be the distance which it will cover ? The power is about <1mw
The wavelength is not remotely enough information to say. You also need to know the power of the beam (a laser pointer might be 1 mW, but an industrial laser might be ten thousand times that), what it's competing with (daylight vs. moonless night), and how closely it approaches the ideal Diffraction-limited performance.    Embed Quote
