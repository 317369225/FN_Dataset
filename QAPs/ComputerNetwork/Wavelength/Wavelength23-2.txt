★How can I calculate the distance of LASER beam if we know the wavelength?e.g I have a LASER light of 630-680nm. What will be the distance which it will cover ? The power is about <1mw
As others have answered, the wavelength is pretty much a red herring.  What is the total power?  How much divergence is there with this laser?  What is the medium, air, water, vacuum? How good is your detector? Naked eye?    Embed Quote
