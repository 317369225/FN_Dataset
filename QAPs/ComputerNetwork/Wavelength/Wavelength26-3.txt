★If I mix a beam with e.g. a wavelength of 700nm (red) and another beam of say wavelength 400nm (green), is the result a beam with a color which cannot be expressed by a single wavelength?My question arises from the use of the RGB color encoding scheme. RGB uses three dimensions to specify a single point in a color space. Can be interpreted as three beams of different wavelengths, and the amount can be interpreted as beam amplitude(?). My question is if the mix of RGB can be expressed as a beam of light with a single wavelength?
There is no link between the colour of light and the wavelength of the light beam. Color is what the human eye sees and labels any arbitrary mixture of light of different wavelengths. Colour is just a label your brain applies to that combination.    Embed Quote
