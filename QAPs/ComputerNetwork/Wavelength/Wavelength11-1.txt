★What colors/wavelengths are the best for your eyes?I recall that green is a really good color to look at when your eyes need a break.
Surprisingly, blue light is actually hazardous if you look at it too much over a lifetime. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hig... Also, blue light suppresses melatonin production, which can interfere with sleep if you're exposed to too much of it right before you sleep. Generally, the lower the energy, the better. By "energy" I also include resonance effects, although visible light is unlikely to trigger any resonances, so in the case of visible light, red is almost always better than blue. But in practice, the difference doesn't really matter.    Embed Quote
