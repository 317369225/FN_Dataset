★Why is it easier to detect radio wave than measuring the shorter wavelengths?
Radio waves interact with matter on larger length scales. In particular, when they fall on a metal, they result into flow of a current which can then be amplified and detected. On the other hand, higher frequency waves (light waves, UV, and above) have higher energy and hence they interact with matter at smaller length scales. They can cause transition between atomic/molecular energy levels but, on their own, they can't make the current flow in a metal like radio waves do. So, their detection may not be as 'direct' as for radio waves. One may need to use an additional layer of instruments to convert the atomic/molecular level changes into a current signal. However, this doesn't mean that the detection of radio waves is "easier" than the detection of higher frequencies in all cases. For example, to detect the presence of UV radiation all we need is a piece of some fluorescent material like Fluorite, or Gypsum.    Embed Quote
