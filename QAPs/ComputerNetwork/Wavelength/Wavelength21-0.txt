★What is wavelength vs. absorbance?
Wavelength vs. Absorbance is a commonly used graph used in UV-Visible light spectrometers. Spectrometers are commonly used to identify the presence or relative quantity of chemicals such as molecules or protein in solution. What a spectrometer does is that it shoots rays of light with variable wavelengths (different colors, to an extent) to a cuvette containing a sample. The light will hit the sample, and like all waves, some will be absorbed by the sample and some will be reflected by the sample. Certain molecules will reflect light at certain wavelengths with much higher intensity than others due to a physical property known as resonance.  As you can see in the above example, the numbers next to "Adenosine" are in Molar units, a unit of volumetric concentration. The graph spikes at around ~210 nm and ~270nm, a "fingerprint" of adenosine that shouts "There's Adenosine here!" The higher the peak, the more adenosine there is per unit sample (the more concentrated the adenosine is in the sample). UV-Vis Spectrometry has extraordinary applications in biochemistry and other chemistry-based disciplines, not only for identifying small molecules but also macromolecules, such as protein complexes. It is indispensible in research, so be sure to learn it well! Graph taken from: http://openwetware.org/wiki/User...    Embed Quote
