★Why does the light's wavelength change, and not frequency, during refraction?
At every individual point the wave travels through, cycles arriving equals cycles leaving. So unless the source and detector are in relative motion (the Doppler effect scenario) so that the detector is eating up cycles at a different rate from that at which the source is laying them down (net buildup or consumption of cycles actually propagating), the frequency has to be the same. Then, since the speed of light is different on either side of the surface, the wavelength has to be different (imagine a line of cars going past a changed speed limit sign - they'll spread out or bunch up). But, the component of the wavelength measured along the surface (as opposed to the usual way perpendicular to the wavefronts) has to match, so that the crests and troughs line up along the surface. Equally, if a wavefront hits the surface other than straight on, one side will hit first, and start to speed up or slow down first, and this will have the effect of tilting the wavefront to face, and propagate, in a different direction. The net effect is as per the linked picture of a wave tank. Waves are coming in from the right and refracting off a prism-shaped shallow area where the wave speed is lower. Note the bunching up of the wavefronts in the prism and the matchup of crests and troughs at the boundary. Refraction-ripple-tank.JPG    Embed Quote
