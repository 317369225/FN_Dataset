★Why is it easier to detect radio wave than measuring the shorter wavelengths?
Detect? Ping? Or do you want a picture? It all comes down to sensitivity versus resolution. You - given that you might be a sun-bather - have absolutely no difficulty detecting sub-optical light photons - you hold up your hands on the yummy hot beach and thank your travel agent for the deal. And the sper-optical ones? Yes! Them too! Suntan; sunburn; melanomas. Your bosy has no difficulty detecting these even shorter wavelengths. However: you can't hear AM or FM radio waves worth batshit. Nor terahertz waves. Nor ultra-long radio waves used for messaging submarines. So what's this 'easier' crap?    Embed Quote
