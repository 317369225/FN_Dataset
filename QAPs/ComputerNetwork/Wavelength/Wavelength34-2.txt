★Why is the visible spectrum of light visible?I am not asking about the Physics involved behind it, I know how our eyes work and I am also aware of the wavelengths we can normally perceive. But when compared to other living beings that can see colour, why do we see only light in this particular range of EM spectrum, is there any reason based on theory of evolution behind the way our eyes evolved to see 'visible' spectrum of light?
You might think it´s because the sun`s emission is strongest in the visible spectrum, but, since the eye evolved while ''we'' were still in the sea, it's more like because visible light is the only light that's not absorbed by water. Water absorbs strongly in the UV and IR regions. So, that it is also the sun's maximum is just a coincidence.    Embed Quote
