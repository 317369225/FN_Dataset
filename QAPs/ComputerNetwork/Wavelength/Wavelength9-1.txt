★Is there any wavelength gap in electromagnetic spectrum?Refer to literature on electromagnetic spectrum with the latest publication in 2010.
No, there is no fundamental scale in the electromagnetic spectrum. The same laws apply for radio waves, light and x-rays. Practically there are wavelengths at which we have no good (bright, coherent) sources - people talk about a "Terahertz gap" due to the fact that there are good microwave sources up to 100GHz, and good infrared sources (100THz) but in between the sources and detectors are hard to manufacture, or grossly inefficient, in terms of Watts in to Watts out.    Embed Quote
