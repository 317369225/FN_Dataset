★How does intensity affect wavelength?By playing with a dimmer switch; changing the amount of current in the wiring, the color of a light bulb can be made to vary from white to red.  This variation affects the intensity of heat emitted by the bulb, but how does this variation affect wavelength?  In other words, how does intensity of heat influence light coloring?
The intensity of light is independent of frequency. However, another effect is causing the change in observed colour of the light. When the current is switched on, the filament in the light bulb heats up and emits light. This is known as blackbody radiation. (While filaments are not black, this provides a reasonable approximation.) Consider the following graph: When the bulb is at a relatively low temperature (the red line), more red light is emitted, resulting in a reddish glow observed. However, as temperature increases (green and blue line), the amount of red light tends to even out (as a percentage of all visible light), resulting in a more whitish glow. Hence, dimming the light does not "increase the wavelength of light emitted" (which wouldn't make much sense for white light anyway) but more of changes the proportion of each colour emitted, changing the overall observed colour.    Embed Quote
