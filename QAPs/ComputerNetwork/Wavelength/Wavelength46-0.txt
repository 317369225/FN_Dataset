★The wavelength of light determines its colour. But how does a 'blue' photon differ from a 'red' photon?
In exactly the same way. The blue photon will be seen as having a wavelength corresponding to the color blue (~475 nm) while the red photon will be seen as having a corresponging wavelength to it's color (~650 nm).    Embed Quote
