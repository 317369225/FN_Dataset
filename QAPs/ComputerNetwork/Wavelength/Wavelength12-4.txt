★Does the world really have colours? Or is it just our brain's interpretation of the wavelengths?
Yes, the world really has colors in the sense of light of different wavelength. A machine such as a spectrometer can accurately and numerically measure the color content of a particular light beam without humans being around. In astronomy, we can use the detailed color content of light to know what distant stars are made out of because certain chemicals have certain color signatures. The meaning, feeling, and perception of colors is human-dependent. For instance, a machine can measure the light coming from a laser pointer and tell you it has a color of 632.8 nanometer-red. But it takes a human to say that the light from the laser pointer is an aggressive color, a vivid color, a color that grabs your attention, a color that makes you angry, etc. All of this meaning and perception attached to colors is a result of human biology and psychology. But the colors themselves are pure physics. Distant stars had colors long before humans were around.    Embed Quote
