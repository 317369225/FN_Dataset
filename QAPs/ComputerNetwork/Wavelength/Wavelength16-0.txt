★What is the shortest-wavelength laser that exists?
If you define laser as a device that operates on the principle of stimulated emission without feedback, then the shortest wavelength you can get out of a laser is in the x-ray region.  The device is often referred to as a Xaser. Most commonly they'll get stimulated emission out of very highly ionized plasmas, in order to create an energy population inversion using the inner shell electron states of the elements in the plasma. Normal laser systems require feedback in order to operate efficiently in a narrow band, but reflective x-ray optics and/or guided x-rays are very troublesome and more often than not too lossy to even bother considering creating a feedback system, so the Xaser is more like an amplified spontaneous emission source than a traditional laser oscillator. If you're looking specifically for a laser oscillator that uses feedback in order to get decently narrow linewidths, then you might consider the tin plasma laser that generates 13.5nm laser light for EUV lithography.    Embed Quote
