★How does intensity affect wavelength?By playing with a dimmer switch; changing the amount of current in the wiring, the color of a light bulb can be made to vary from white to red.  This variation affects the intensity of heat emitted by the bulb, but how does this variation affect wavelength?  In other words, how does intensity of heat influence light coloring?
Intensity is the number of photons, absolutely nothing to do with wavelenght.. Velocity= Frequency X Wavelength... so only these 3 things are interdependant.. nothing else    Embed Quote
