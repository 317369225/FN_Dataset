★Why is the visible spectrum of light visible?I am not asking about the Physics involved behind it, I know how our eyes work and I am also aware of the wavelengths we can normally perceive. But when compared to other living beings that can see colour, why do we see only light in this particular range of EM spectrum, is there any reason based on theory of evolution behind the way our eyes evolved to see 'visible' spectrum of light?
Why did we evolve to see those frequencies?  Because that's where the light is: It's easy to see why we don't bother to see ultraviolet, but we sure are missing a lot by not seeing in the infrared. Let's add in Mason Moore's suggestion about our eyes evolving when we were in water, where IR light is absorbed at a much higher rate than near-ultraviolet light: You can see why the visible spectrum is optimal. Hmmm.... I wonder if modern humans can see further into the red spectrum than ancient humans, since we've been out of the water longer....    Embed Quote
