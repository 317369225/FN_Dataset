★What is the wavelength of the color black?
Black contains an even mixture of all wavelengths of visible light, adjusted for the sensitivity of the human eye. For daytime color vision, our eyes are more sensitive to light of wavelength 555 nm than to any other wavelength, with a curve tapering off in either direction. Thus, the curve would have to be perceptually flat. The same applies to white and neutral gray. Besides a flat spectral curve, black also needs to be considerably darker than it's surroundings. In a dark one room, one sees, not black, but "brain gray." True black requires contrasting elements.    Embed Quote
