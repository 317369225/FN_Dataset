★How does the optical activity depend on wavelength?
I would rephrase the question and say that optical activity and its relationship with the frequency of light. You see wavelength, velocity and frequency are all inter connected as we learn from high school and specially for light with the frequency being inversely propotional to wavelength. However we might even remember that higher the frequency of light, higher is the energy. Most optical activity is frequency dependent like optical absorption, fluorescence and even photo electric effect. So it is more the energy dependence and thus frequency dependence which matter s most.    Embed Quote
