★When light is passed through the prism, it undergoes refraction or bending. The extent of bending depends upon the wavelength of photons. Why is radiation of longer wavelength bent to a smaller degree than the radiation of shorter wavelength. Explain the reason?
The effect is called chromatic dispersion.  It's because the refractive index of the material is different at different colors. Going a step further back, you can picture the material's response to the light as a bunch of electric dipoles on springs.  When you vibrate the springs at different frequencies, they're going to respond a little differently. The fact that the dipoles don't respond with exactly the same magnitude at different frequencies is why you get a refractive index that's different at different frequencies.    Embed Quote
