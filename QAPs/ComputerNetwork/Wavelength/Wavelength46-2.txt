★The wavelength of light determines its colour. But how does a 'blue' photon differ from a 'red' photon?
A red photon has a larger wavelength, and a blue one has a smaller one. Consequently, the blue photon has a higher energy as compared to the red one.   Energy of a photon = Planck's Constant X Frequency. Frequency of Light = Speed of Light (c) / Wavelength    Embed Quote
