★Does the world really have colours? Or is it just our brain's interpretation of the wavelengths?
I need a rubber stamp that says, "When you can tell me what difference it makes, you'll probably already have your answer". EDIT: I've been asked to elaborate on this. Questions like what the world "really" has don't "really" mean anything. The fundamental question you always have to ask is, what difference does it make? Once you can define the distinction you're trying to draw, you'll be on your way to an answer. Whether color "is" a property of the way the photons interact with the world, or the way they interact with the retina and brain, is just an arbitrary definition. The photons are there; the objects are there; the retina and brain are there. Which part "really" constitutes color is between you and the people you're trying to talk to. (In fact, even the photons and the retina and the objects being "really" there are matters of even more distinction-drawing, when you get right down to it. In the appropriate context we can drill down into them as well.)    Embed Quote
