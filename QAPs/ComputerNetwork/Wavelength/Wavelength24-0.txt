★What is the relationship between frequency and wavelength?
It's complicated. For electromagnetic waves in vacuum, frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength. The relationship between the two quantities is But this relation doesn't hold for all waves. In de Broglie waves for example, the relationship between wavelength and frequency is In fact, the relation between frequency and wavelength comes in many different forms, and is all important in understanding how waves behave. The relation tells us many things about how fast waves move too, allowing us to compute quantities like phase velocity and group velocity. The relation between frequency and wavelength in waves is so important that it has a special name, known as the dispersion relation. In short, there isn't a good answer to this question, but each wave has a dispersion relation that encapsulates this relationship.    Embed Quote
