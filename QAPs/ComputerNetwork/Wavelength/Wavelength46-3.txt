★The wavelength of light determines its colour. But how does a 'blue' photon differ from a 'red' photon?
As you already note by your use of 'quotes' around the names of the photons, color is not a true trait of photons. It is a perception of the human visual system when a photon of X energy is absorbed by a receptor. Rohan explains here that these photons have different energy, different wavelengths. But the actual color assignment is not a fundamental property of photons, it is a value we assign as part of the destructive process of measuring its energy.    Embed Quote
