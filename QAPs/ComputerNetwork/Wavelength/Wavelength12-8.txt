★Does the world really have colours? Or is it just our brain's interpretation of the wavelengths?
Although this sounds strange, what color is in human terms is very culture-specific and organism-specific (and species-specific too! Some insects see in the ultraviolet). As far as color naming and identities, things became a bit complicated. Consider how you can name colors. A color name is really a unique name for a unique particular complex curve - a curve that is a function of wavelength across the visible spectrum. Many particular curves are given their own name. But since there are almost an infinite number of curves - each one made up at each wavelength point by a position on a just noticeable difference (JND) scale, there are millions of possible nameable colors. Here we have several colors, and you can see each one is a complex set of values that we lump together under one color name. Now imagine that there are millions of possible curves, and assignable names for their collective color So, man has his own names for colors, but in nature, reflectivity and emission of light is governed by physics and is very fixed and often has complex functional curves, which are colors.    Embed Quote
