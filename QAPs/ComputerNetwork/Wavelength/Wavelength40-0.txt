★Why is the colour of light normally specified by its wavelength and not frequency?Wavelength will vary according to the refractive index of the medium it is travelling through so red light with a wavelength of 700 nm in space will have a wavelength of 500 nm in a glass or liquid with refractive index of 1.4. This is the same wavelength as green light. Surely it would be more sensible to define colour by frequency which will be constant for a colour regardless of medium refractive index?
In principle yes, but the frequency of visible light is so ridiculously high (some 430–790 THz) that for many years it was not experimentally accessible directly and had to be inferred from wavelength and the speed of light. By contrast, the wavelength of light makes itself readily apparent in all sorts of interference and diffraction effects. Thus there's a long tradition of working with wavelength values. Nobody is unaware that the actual wavelength is different in say water, but you'd never operate an interferometer in a tank of water if you could avoid it - messy wet things are for chemists.    Embed Quote
