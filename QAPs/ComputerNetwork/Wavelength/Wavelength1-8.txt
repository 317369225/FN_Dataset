★Why does the light's wavelength change, and not frequency, during refraction?
Can I add a short one? In physics, frequency IS energy. So if you changed the frequency of light in the medium you'd change its energy, and (since energy is conserved) where would you put it? Also, when the light left the medium, it would need the energy back to get the original frequency back, and where would it GET it?  All of these are embarrassing problems, so nature usually just arranges for them not to happen. ;) [As has been pointed out, sometimes they DO happen in non-linear media (like the crystals that changes your IR laser pointer to green). But most media don't interact with the light that much, and if the energy isn't added or subtracted, the frequency stays the same.]    Embed Quote
