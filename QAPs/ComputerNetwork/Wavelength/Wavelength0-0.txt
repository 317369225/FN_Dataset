★Does graviton have a wavelength?I know that graviton is hypothetical particle never discovered, but theoretically is there some thoughts or even theory that describes graviton with some properties, especially with wavelength?
As with any other particle, for the graviton we must have that is furthermore, since the graviton is theorized to be massless, it should travel at the speed of light, making the following equations valid as they are for photons and in particular the wavelength is then given by    Embed Quote
