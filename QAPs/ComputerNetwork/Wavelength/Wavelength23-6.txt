★How can I calculate the distance of LASER beam if we know the wavelength?e.g I have a LASER light of 630-680nm. What will be the distance which it will cover ? The power is about <1mw
As others have noted, the answer is dependent upon multiple additional factors, as well as your definition of "distance". The light can travel an extremely long distance, but the further away you are from the laser, the more diffuse it will be; if you shined a laser pointer at the moon, for instance, it would not illuminate a single point on the Moon, but have its light scattered over a fairly substantial portion of its surface, thus making it impossible to see. The tightness of the focus of the laser - as well as how much distance it is covering through some sort of matter-filled medium - determines the area of the laser at any given distance. A laser can get to the Moon without issue, but it would be extremely dim when it got there. If you mean the area that the laser beam would cover at a distance, that's primarily determined by the focus of the laser, though atmospheric scattering (or scattering in water or some other medium) would increase that.    Embed Quote
