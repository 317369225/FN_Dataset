★When light is passed through the prism, it undergoes refraction or bending. The extent of bending depends upon the wavelength of photons. Why is radiation of longer wavelength bent to a smaller degree than the radiation of shorter wavelength. Explain the reason?
Here's my best intuitive guess. The longer wavelength is more like a straight line, thus having more convergent or linear energy. The shorter wavelength is more divergent and has more tangential contact with the prism. Would be interested to hear from someone more educated.    Embed Quote
