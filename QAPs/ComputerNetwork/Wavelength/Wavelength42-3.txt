★How is an atom smaller than light if the wavelength of a photon is the distance between the orbits that the electrons jumps between?
You can't have an atom "smaller than light", since light is not a physical quantity. Also, you can't say the wavelength of a photon. You can say the wavelength of a photon's path (that exhibits wavelike characteristics). A photon is a packet of energy. When you talk about size, you're typically talking about inter-atomic interaction. So it's not possible to give a size to a single photon, per say. Light (a photon) is produced by a drop in an electron's orbit.    Embed Quote
