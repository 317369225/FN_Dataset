★If there are wavelengths, are there wave heights?For clarification: is there measurement for how much space a wave takes vertically, assuming you're looking at it move horizontally through space?
On a musical instrument, when you pluck the string, it makes a standing wave and the height is the amplitude.   Water waves clearly have a wave height.   Sound waves have a physical size which is their amplitude, but sound goes in all directions so we don't refer to it as "wave height". There are other types of waves where we think of amplitude as wave height, such as voltage and radio waves, but that is just how we visualize it, it doesn't have a physical basis like the other examples.    Embed Quote
