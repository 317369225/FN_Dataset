★How is an atom smaller than light if the wavelength of a photon is the distance between the orbits that the electrons jumps between?
Photons are produced when electrons jump between energy levels.  But other quantum mechanical interactions produce photons too.  The fusion in the core of a star produces photons and I don't think that involves electrons jumping levels.  Don't confuse wavelength/frequency with the size of the orbits.  The electron orbits are not like planetary orbits.  They are considered being more like shells.  Also, (more confusion?) most of the atom is empty space.    Embed Quote
