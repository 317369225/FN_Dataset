★If there are wavelengths, are there wave heights?For clarification: is there measurement for how much space a wave takes vertically, assuming you're looking at it move horizontally through space?
I like this question.  The answer of course is yes.  In Quantum Field Theory the world is made of fields that exist everywhere – they are a property of space.  The waves are fluctuations in the strength of these fields that propagate through space the same way that water waves propagate through water, and the field strength at the maxima corresponds to the height of a water wave.  There is just one caveat: These quantized fields are not described by simple numbers, they are described state vectors in Hilbert space, but this need not concern the non-mathematical reader. Further, if the field equations contain a mass term, as do matter fields, then this term also creates waves, and it is because of this that the famous equation e = mc2 , as I say in my book (see Understand Physics Through Quantum Field Theory), “pops right out of QFT.  Einstein had to work hard to find it (it was published in a separate paper that followed his first breakthrough paper on relativity theory in 1905), but in QFT it appears as an almost trivial consequence of the two previous results. Since both mass and energy are associated with oscillations in the field, it doesn’t take an Einstein to see that there must be a relationship between the two. Any schoolboy can combine the two equations and find (big drum roll, please) e = mc2.  Not only does the equation tumble right out of QFT, its meaning is seen in the oscillations or “shimmer” of the fields.” So there’s one more reason, Quorans, to give up the old particle picture and WAKE UP AND SMELL THE FIELDS.    Embed Quote
