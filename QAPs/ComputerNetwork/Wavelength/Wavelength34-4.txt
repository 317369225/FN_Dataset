★Why is the visible spectrum of light visible?I am not asking about the Physics involved behind it, I know how our eyes work and I am also aware of the wavelengths we can normally perceive. But when compared to other living beings that can see colour, why do we see only light in this particular range of EM spectrum, is there any reason based on theory of evolution behind the way our eyes evolved to see 'visible' spectrum of light?
Dan Dee gave you a great answer. I'd only add that much of the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum reflects about equally well off of objects of every color. So if my vision were in the IR spectrum, I'd pretty much see a monochromatic world where radiating bodies would be brighter, and cold ones darker, but I'd completely miss the beauty of a lovely red rose nestled in its surroundings of green leaves.    Embed Quote
