★Why do higher wavelength electromagnetic waves travel farther than lower wavelength ones?
The main advantage of higher frequency is that antenna height is reduced, and they required shorter antennas for decent reception quality, and  that is important for mobile  devices. They also allow wide band for modulating signals, so you can obtain higher frequency transmission. Longer waves are diffracted by the earth atmosphere and so can cling to the surface of the earth , whereas shorter waves just goes out into space because they are easily absorbed by the molecules in the air. Higher frequency are more sensitive to reflection, so they have harder time passing through walls and obstacles in general. At the same time they are more easily leak through holes:a rule of thumb is that you have a hole of the size of the wavelength, the signal can leak through it, but at the same time you can't rely on it for good transmission. So I would say limit is quite fuzzy.    Embed Quote
