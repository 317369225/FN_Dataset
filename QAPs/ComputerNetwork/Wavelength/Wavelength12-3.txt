★Does the world really have colours? Or is it just our brain's interpretation of the wavelengths?
This gets into some wacky stuff that draws from Plato's Allegory of the Cave and inevitably leads to an existential crisis. Sound, color, shape, and...well everything boils down to your brain interpreting something. Even your perception of your own body is skewed: (Cortical homunculus) Instead of thinking of it in terms of whether or not colors actually exist, think of it as something more like this: A man is juggling in a crowded street, and 20 people watch him. Some folks are blind, some are deaf, some short, some tall, etc. Afterwards, you ask those 20 people what happened. You'll get 20 different interpretations and experiences. The fact remains that a man did juggle in the street. The tricky part is how you perceive it.    Embed Quote
