★What is the wavelength of the color blue in the light spectrum?
Technically, there are an infinite number of different blues in the visible spectrum, however the range of the various blues is in the vicinity of 450-500 nanometers wavelength.  Look at an image of a visible light spectrum--at what specific point does blue become green?  There are no boundaries that distinguish one color from another; the different colors just blend into one another across the spectrum from violet to red.  The spectrum continues on either end into the ultraviolet and infrared ranges that our eyes cannot detect, and beyond that into other types of light.  Each different "color" is a representation of a different wavelength--a slight color difference means a slight wavelength difference.    Embed Quote
