★Why do higher wavelength electromagnetic waves travel farther than lower wavelength ones?
That's not true in general. It's true for, say, certain radio waves because of the way that they interact with the medium in which they are propagating (i.e., the atmosphere) and obstacles in their path. AM radio waves in North America, for example, have a wavelength of around 500 m, so things that are significantly smaller than that, like most buildings, are effectively invisible to the waves. VHF waves used for television, on the other hand, have a wavelength of around 1 m, so they are easily blocked and reflected by human-scale structures that contain conductive material (e.g., steel framing). Longer wavelengths are also reflected by the ionosphere, leading to so-called "skip" communication where the wave repeatedly bounces between the ground and the ionosphere, thereby propagating for great distances. Shorter wavelengths aren't efficiently reflected by the ionosphere, so their energy dissipates much more rapidly over distance.    Embed Quote
