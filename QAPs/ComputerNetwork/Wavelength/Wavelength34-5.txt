★Why is the visible spectrum of light visible?I am not asking about the Physics involved behind it, I know how our eyes work and I am also aware of the wavelengths we can normally perceive. But when compared to other living beings that can see colour, why do we see only light in this particular range of EM spectrum, is there any reason based on theory of evolution behind the way our eyes evolved to see 'visible' spectrum of light?
Anthropology is the study of historical humans. It has more to do with technology, tradition, laws, customs, art, etc. These things do not genetically alter our visible spectrum. It might alter it epigenetically, but we don't have enough evidence to support that. It can however alter it phenotypically (observable traits). Removal of our lens does allow us to see ultraviolet light. It can alter it technologically by using devices that pick up infrared, x-rays, etc then convert into colours our eyes can pick up. Full alteration requires cybernetic enhancement of eyes, optical nerve, and visual cortex.    Embed Quote
