★How does intensity affect wavelength?By playing with a dimmer switch; changing the amount of current in the wiring, the color of a light bulb can be made to vary from white to red.  This variation affects the intensity of heat emitted by the bulb, but how does this variation affect wavelength?  In other words, how does intensity of heat influence light coloring?
What we perceive as White light is composed of number of wavelength ranging from 400-700nm(the visible range) It would be clearer if you could tell me the type of bulb that you are using because it has something to do with the emission spectrum of the bulb. However i can guess the following explanation- The bulb appears white because of a number of  atomic transitions taking place in the bulb. Now higher energy transitions need higher energy than the lower energy transition. When you are operating the bulb at the fullest supply, all the energy transitions are taking place which gives it an appearance of white light. As you keep on decreasing the input current the energy produced is insufficient for the higher energy transitions, as a result the major part of the spectrum shifts to the lower frequency region which makes it look redder. Intensity of heat produced controls the allowed transitions which controls the apparent color. Still i might explain better if i knew the type of bulb being used.    Embed Quote
