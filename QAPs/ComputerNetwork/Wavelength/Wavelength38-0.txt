★What is the wavelength of the color blue in the light spectrum?
Some people over at Laser Pointer Forums have a variety of blue lasers at wavelengths of 445, 450, 460, and 473 nm. They upload photos, then discuss whether the photo seemed to accurately capture the color. The consensus is that 445 and 450 nm look blue with a tinge of violet, 460 nm looks like pure blue, and 473 nm is more like sky blue. The relationship between hue and wavelength can vary depending on a number of factors, among them Bezold–Brücke shift, Abney effect, and metamerism. You can see pictures of the laser by type in LPF blue laser and the wavelength number in Google Images. However, not all the pictures that come up in the search engine are of the correct wavelength. You have to click on the picture and read the text to find out what wavelength it actually it.    Embed Quote
