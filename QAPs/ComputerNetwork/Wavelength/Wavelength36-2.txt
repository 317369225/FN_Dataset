★Why does white light consist of many different wavelengths?In terms of energy states
It doesn't. Light with the colour white can be obtained by mixing only red, green and blue lights. We have 3 types of cones in our eyes. They respond differently according to the wavelength of light. When the response is equal for every cone type, you see gray/white. Light with all wavelengths does that.    Embed Quote
