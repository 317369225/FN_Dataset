★What is an intuitive definition of Wavelength and Frequency?Please explain me these terms so that I can make some sense out of the texts (I am an IIT aspirant). I want to make physical sense of these terms in my brain so that I can understand the text properly. Thanks for your detailed answers.
Imagine a ball bouncing on the floor, consider the air drag to be absent and the ball keeps on bouncing for infinite amount of time, we have also fixed the speed of the ball. Now the ball can do two things bounce for longer times reaching a greater height, or it can have short bounces and hit the floor more times The ball can not do the two things together. now let us look at an image of the bouncing ball you might think that the height of the two waves are same so this analogy would fail, but the wavelength is defined as the time taken to reach the floor again after bouncing which matches with the definition of wavelength i.e. the distance between consecutive corresponding points of the same phase. The number of times the ball hits the floor is the frequency of the wave, which is defined as  the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. If you are wondering what the speed should be, it would be nearly the speed of light. Hope it helps...    Embed Quote
