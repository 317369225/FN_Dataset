★Why does white light consist of many different wavelengths?In terms of energy states
White Light is a very vague term. Let's say I hand you a laser that operates at 652 nm. What color would you say that is? Red. Why? Because that is the way the color spectrum is defined I can give you a 532 nm laser. Green. We relate the wavelengths (and thus energies) of the light to what color it is. What if I gave you a laser that outputs multiple wavelengths (a broad band) from 400 nm to 750 nm? What color would you say that is? White Light. You see all colors at once, all wavelengths.    Embed Quote
