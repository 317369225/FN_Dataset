★What is the wavelength of the color black?
In physics, the term black means that an object does absorb the entire electromagnetic spectrum. A blackbody at room temperature in thermal equilibrum with the environment will of course reemit the energy as infrared radiation. Infrared radiation is not in the visible spectrum for a human eye. If you "see" a black color, the retina of your eye in fact does not detect any electromagnetic wave, and in fact there is no electrical impulse sent to your brain. The lack of an electrical impulse is then interpreted by your eye as "black". So to be 100% clear. A black object does not radiate visible light. That also means that there is NOT an interference pattern of different colors that somehow cancel to make the object look like black. Addition: One question you may ask is: How come that mixing three different colors (paint) can create black? The answer is: A color, say blue, means that the specific surface that is painted blue absorbs the visible light that is not blue. As such the body reflects only blue. If you now mix other colors that absorb blue then you all visible light gets absorbed and you end up with a black surface.    Embed Quote
