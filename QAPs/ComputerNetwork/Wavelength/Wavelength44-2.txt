★Electromagnetic Spectrum: What is the longest wavelength we can detect?And what is the shortest?
Red is the longest wavelength of light which is visible to human eye. Visible light waves are the only electromagnetic waves we can see. we can see these wave as the color of the rainbow. Each color has different wavelength. Red has the longest wavelength and violet has the shortest wavelength. when all the waves are seen together, they make white light. When the white light pass through a prism then, it will broken into the colors of the visible light spectrum Where Radio waves have the longest wavelength in E.M spectrum. These waves can be longer than a football field or as shorter as football. They also carry signals for Television and cellular phones. Gamma-rays have the smallest wavelegths and most energy of any other wave in E.M spectrum. These wave generated by radioactive atoms and in nuclear explosions. Things like neutron star, pulsars and black holes are all the sources of Celestial gamma-rays.    Embed Quote
