★What is the shortest-wavelength laser that exists?
The shortest X-ray laser emits light with a wavelength of 0.14 nm. This Xray laser is a free-electron laser. In these lasers free electrons undergo stimulated emission processes to produce a laser beam. As making optics for Xrays is very difficult these lasers have no mirrors. That has consequences. While you still get that very nice beam you know from a laser pointer its frequency spectrum varies from shot to shot. For a laser pointer that would mean its color varies every time you use it. This kind of laser is VERY big. For example, the Xray laser in the USA is the LCLS facility, which gets its electrons from an old linear accelerator of about 1 km length. Such facilities are of course very expensive. Nevertheless in many countries such lasers are constructed as they make unique research possible like studying the structure of viruses. Other countries building or operating such lasers are Germany (Flash, X-FEL), Japan (Riken), Italy (FERMI).    Embed Quote
