★What is the shortest possible wavelength of a photon when approaching an object of infinite gravity?Guess: Planck length
Your question lacks needed details and sets up an impossible scenario. Are you asking what wave length light is when it enters a black hole (from the frame of reference of the black hole)? The wavelength gets lengthened, not shortened, so this question doesn't make sense. But yes, the shortest wavelength is Planck's length. The energy of such a photon would be ridiculously high.    Embed Quote
