★Why does the light's wavelength change, and not frequency, during refraction?
In fact, frequency can change due to nonlinear refraction, see the Self-phase modulation page on wikipedia. The previous answers all implicitly required a linear system. For example, energy conservation of the EM field of a certain frequency is NOT guaranteed in nonlinear situations, wherein nonlinearity can couple excitations at different frequencies, and energy can transfer from one frequency to another. This is in actually a feature of some optical systems - see Second-harmonic generation . In linear (energy conserving- no absorption) refraction, however, a Fourier transform in time decouples the equations completely, and so energy of a single frequency is conserved.    Embed Quote
