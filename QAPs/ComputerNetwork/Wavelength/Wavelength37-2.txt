★When light is passed through the prism, it undergoes refraction or bending. The extent of bending depends upon the wavelength of photons. Why is radiation of longer wavelength bent to a smaller degree than the radiation of shorter wavelength. Explain the reason?
When light passes through prism, refraction takes place. The extent of bending of the original light is dependent on the incident angle and on the refractive index of the material. The refractive index is dependent on wavelength and hence different lights bend differently. How much the different lights bend is governed by Snell's Law:- where A and B are incident and refractive angle with respect to the normal. n1 and n2 are the refractive index of the mediums. Now, the angle is thus different because it is dependent on refractive index which in-turn is dependent on wavelength. where lambda0 is the wavelength of that light in vacuum and lambda1 is wavelength of that light in the medium. So, longer the wavelength, lower will be the refractive index and hence lower will be the angle that it bends.    Embed Quote
