★The wavelength of light determines its colour. But how does a 'blue' photon differ from a 'red' photon?
Thanks for those answers guys, but I was thinking along these lines: since all photons of whatever wavelength have no mass, no charge and a set 'speed' (momentum?), how can its energy level be a variable?    Embed Quote
