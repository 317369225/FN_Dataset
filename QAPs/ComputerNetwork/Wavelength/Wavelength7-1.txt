★If there are wavelengths, are there wave heights?For clarification: is there measurement for how much space a wave takes vertically, assuming you're looking at it move horizontally through space?
If you are talking about a vibrating string, then this distance is called "amplitude."   But I see the question is tagged also as "Electromagnetic spectrum".   It would be incorrect to think of light waves as being literally like a string.  There is in fact displacement and it can be measured, but it is of a field, not a string.   So with light amplitude is a measure of the intensity of the light.    Embed Quote
