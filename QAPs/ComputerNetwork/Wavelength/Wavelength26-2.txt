★If I mix a beam with e.g. a wavelength of 700nm (red) and another beam of say wavelength 400nm (green), is the result a beam with a color which cannot be expressed by a single wavelength?My question arises from the use of the RGB color encoding scheme. RGB uses three dimensions to specify a single point in a color space. Can be interpreted as three beams of different wavelengths, and the amount can be interpreted as beam amplitude(?). My question is if the mix of RGB can be expressed as a beam of light with a single wavelength?
My understanding has been that RGB colouring works because of what the cells in the back of your retina do with the three incoming light wavelengths, not because of anything actually happening to the light. You perceive a colour whose true amplitude would be of intermediate wavelength. It's more complicated, than that, of course, because relative intensities (brightness) of light (i.e. numerical value to the colour channel) dictate the 'shade' of light you percieve, as well.    Embed Quote
