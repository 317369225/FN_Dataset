★If I mix a beam with e.g. a wavelength of 700nm (red) and another beam of say wavelength 400nm (green), is the result a beam with a color which cannot be expressed by a single wavelength?My question arises from the use of the RGB color encoding scheme. RGB uses three dimensions to specify a single point in a color space. Can be interpreted as three beams of different wavelengths, and the amount can be interpreted as beam amplitude(?). My question is if the mix of RGB can be expressed as a beam of light with a single wavelength?
The answer is yes -- if you mix light from a laser (monochromatic light) at 700 nm with another laser at 400 nm, the resulting radiation will be different from any monochromatic light. That's true in two ways...                                         Read it on the Web.    Embed Quote
