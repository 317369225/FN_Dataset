★Can the Wavelength of light change in air / vaccum? If then, How?
I am unsure about what does the question mean exactly. But if a source is stable (no chemical or physical change), the light emitted from it will be also of same wavelength. But a distant  observer may perceive an increase or decrease in wavelength depending upon the relative motion between him/her and the source. If the observer moves away from the source he will observe an increase in wavelength termed as Redshift (red colour has the max wavelength in the visible spectrum) and if he moves towards the source he will observe a decrease in wavelength termed as Blueshift. Both are examples of the Doppler effect. In fact astrophysicists consider Redshift as the conclusive proof of Big bang. Another way in which the wavelength of light can change is when it passes from one medium to another.    Embed Quote
