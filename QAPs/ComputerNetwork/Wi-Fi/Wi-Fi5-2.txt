★Why doesn't Caltrain have Wi-Fi?Has this been proposed before? Why didn't it pass?
This is entirely speculation on my part.  Most people that care have 3G cards or smartphones already. The Caltrain budget is tight and getting tighter.  Given the choice between avoiding service cuts and WiFi, they are probably going to pick the service. Technology such as WiFi is rapidly outdated - Caltrain could invest in WiFi for the whole network only to see it become irrelevant in a few years time. http://www.caltrain.com/faqs_wir...    Embed Quote
