★Can you use a push-button WPS Wi-Fi setup with the iPhone/iPad?Many routers have a button on the front to pair devices over WiFi, without typing in long access codes. Do the iPhone and iPad work with WPS push-button setup?
Bradley Ringel's answer is correct, but it's also worth noting that this isn't something that a third-party application would be able to do on iOS either, as third-party apps do not have access to the Wi-Fi settings.    Embed Quote
