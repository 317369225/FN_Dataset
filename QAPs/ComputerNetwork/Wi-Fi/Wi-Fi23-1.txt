★Why does my download speed through wi-fi become zero when i place my mobile just above my wi-fi router?
The most likely reason is that the signal strength is actually too high for the AP and/or the client device to process.  WiFi devices can process a limited range of signal power levels due to cost constraints.  When the signal strength becomes higher than a certain level the RF front-end or analog-to-digital conversion 'saturates' as the automatic gain control reaches its design limit.  The resulting received signal is too distorted to decode, similar to what happens with a microphone recording when there is too much amplifier gain. Usually this effect goes unnoticed because it just takes a meter or so of distance (depending on the devices) to avoid saturation.    Embed Quote
