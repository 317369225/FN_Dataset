★What are the dangers of using public Wi-Fi?Is there any research done on this topic? If yes, could I please get the links?
The principal disadvantages to using public wifi are, respectively, passive and active. Passively, your traffic can be sniffed or intercepted by other parties on or near the network - without even being connected if they place their card in "monitor" mode and home in on your network card's nominally unique address. Using tools such as Wireshark, they can then intercept email, listen to VOIP conversations, read IM's and otherwise enjoy your traffic, including stealing cookies to authenticate themselves as you to web sites. Actively, you become vulnerable to "Man in the Middle" (MiTM) attacks, which allow an attacker to intersplice themself between you and a web page you are visiting - one famous tool replaces all images loading on pages with those of sheep - or even usurp the identity of the router altogether. This allows them to hijack an incautious user's banking sessions, access all kinds of porn under your address, and generally prank you to hell and back, not to mention injecting hostile code on otherwise trusted pages which can then infect your computer with a more lasting lament. A common technique for protection in potentially hostile network environments is the use of an Encrypted Virtual Private Network (VPN). While that is beyond the scope of this answer, I wrote a 4500 word article on this general topic a while back, which I'm linking from the Wayback Machine (towards the end, just search my name): Full text of "188045763-PenTest-StarterKit-04-2013-Teaser.pdf (PDFy mirror)"   Other references include: Researchers prove Wi-Fi at risk for malware attacks Kaspersky Personal & Family Security Software How to Protect Your Privacy on Public WiFi Networks    Embed Quote
