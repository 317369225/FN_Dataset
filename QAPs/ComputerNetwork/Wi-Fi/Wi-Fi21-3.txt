★What is the right pronunciation of the word 'wi-fi'?
There are two possible ways, and they have both a different motivation. If you look etymologically, Wi-Fi is, similarly to Hi-Fi, an abbreviation of Wireless Fidelity. It would be logical to pronounce it the same way and based on the original, like Wahyfahy. However, in a lot of countries this way to pronounce the i is not native, so the pronunciation becomes like Weefee. In English though, I see no reason to use the second way over the first way.    Embed Quote
