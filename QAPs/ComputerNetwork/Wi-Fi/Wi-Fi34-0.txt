★How does in-flight Wi-Fi work?
These are some of the details available from service providers. Gogo Inflight Internet: Aircell owns and rents a total of 92 towers that cover North America, including Canada and Mexico, and up to 300 miles off-shore in some areas. The towers are cellphone towers that have been outfitted to point their signals at the sky rather than along the ground. The aircraft picks up the signal through a receiver installed on its underside. Once in the aircraft, the data signal is distributed throughout the cabin via a Wi-Fi system. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gog... OnAir: This new service is limited to use the Inmarsat Satellites, with high speed services using the broadband satellite receivers from Inmarsat's fourth-generation (4G) system. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnAir Row 44: In contrast to other providers that use ground-based antennas to link the aircraft to their networks, Row 44 leases capacity from the existing HughesNet satellite Internet access system enabling them to provide worldwide services even over water.[5] Row 44 and HughesNet entered into a 15-year contract.[4] According to Row 44, their equipment, including an antenna atop the aircraft, can be installed on an airplane in just two aircraft overnights and weighs merely 150lb compared to Connexion by Boeing's 800lb hardware.[6] On August 5, 2009, Row 44 received permanent authority from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to operate its satellite-based broadband system aboard commercial aircraft over US airspace.[7] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_44    Embed Quote
