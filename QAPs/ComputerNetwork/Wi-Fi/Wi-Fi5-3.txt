★Why doesn't Caltrain have Wi-Fi?Has this been proposed before? Why didn't it pass?
Because, the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board, being a public agency rather than a private business, isn't very motivated to do anything innovative or risky to improve  Caltrain. There was an incident a couple of years ago that perfectly illustrated this lack of motivation. The special car on each train for bicyclists was becoming so popular that they were having problems with crowding. A businessperson would think, "Great, let's put another car for bicyclists on all our rush hour trains." Instead, the Board's initial reaction was to propose getting rid of the special cars for bicyclists.    Embed Quote
