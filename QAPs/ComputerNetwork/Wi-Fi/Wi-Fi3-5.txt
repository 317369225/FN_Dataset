★Can you use a push-button WPS Wi-Fi setup with the iPhone/iPad?Many routers have a button on the front to pair devices over WiFi, without typing in long access codes. Do the iPhone and iPad work with WPS push-button setup?
Yes you can connect but not by pressing the button. First you need to use a laptop PC and use that to get the password, right click the network connection, click properties, and show characters in the tab with the password. It will be ridiculously long. Staying at an apartment with free wifi this was the only way to connect to their wifi as no password was provided, just the WPS button.    Embed Quote
