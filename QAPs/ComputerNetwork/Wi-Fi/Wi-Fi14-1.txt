★How do wi-fi routers work?
Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) is a wireless networking tool that allows a user to connect to a network without being tied to a specific location. Because of the industry standard known as 802.11, hardware such as printers, game devices, and other operating systems can be universally connected. Wi-Fi is a technology that uses radio waves to transmit data packets between devices. A signal containing data packets is sent from a remote server to a local modem. This modem is most often physically connected through an Ethernet cable. Once the modem receives the packets, it decodes them and sends them to either a local computer or server, which in turn, passes it to a router. The router, takes the packets, decodes them, and then re-encodes them into a wireless radio wave signal. The signal is then broadcast to any device that has an active wireless modem. This modem will then decode the wireless signal, and if it is authorized, will use and/or display the data as necessary. The process is then reversed from the wireless device to allow it “to speak” to the network.    Embed Quote
