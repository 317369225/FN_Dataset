★Why would Wi-Fi signals stunt the growth of plants?
This kind of experiment is a challenge, because a few other parameters (e.g. amount of incident light, temperature, airflow, local humidity, etc.) are going to be different for different locations, even within the same room. WiFi emits electromagnetic radiation in the Gigaherz range (for example, in the US, 11 channels are in the 2.4 GHz range). Which Wi-Fi Channel is Best for Your Network? You'll want to look for texts that list high-frequency electromagnetic effects (e.g. changes in capacitance of a material surrounded by an ionic fluid) and not low-frequency electromagnetic effects. This is a good research topic, and your daughter should publish the results in a journal.    Embed Quote
