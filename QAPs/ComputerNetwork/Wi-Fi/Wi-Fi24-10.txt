★How does one hack a wi-fi network?
Thanks for A2A. by the time I saw that you asked me to answer this, many good answers are already here, so I would just highlight on some points. Vinay Kumar D's answer is quite detailed. I reommend you learn Linux commands first. You will find many such tools on linux (specifically backtrack or kali) than others. Also prefer kali over backtrack5 since it is outdated now.  Also Wifislax might work smooth being a dedicated one. I haven't used it though, looks like worth a try for pen testing.  I presume you are new to this, so start better with airmon-ng and aircrack-ng after learning linux commands.    Embed Quote
