★Arduino: What is the cheapest Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller system?An Arduino needs an expensive Wi-Fi shield to connect to a wireless network. A basic Freescale Freedom board is only $12 but needs a $35 Wi-Fi module to connect to wireless. A Raspberry Pi can use a cheap $12 Wi-Fi USB adapter, but costs $35 and needs a separate USB power supply. Is there a sub-$20 solution to Wi-Fi enable a device?
I'm the CEO of Spark IO (https://www.spark.io); we just announced our next-gen Wi-Fi development kit called the Photon that might be what you're looking for. The Photon is an open source development kit that costs $19 (which hits your sub-$20 goal), and it has a Wi-Fi module on-board called the P0 that we sell for $10 in single units. You can program the Photon/P0 using Wiring (the embedded programming framework used by Arduino), and we also provide a cloud back-end that provides a REST API for the device and a mechanism for over-the-air firmware updates. The hardware is a 32-bit ARM Cortex M3 microcontroller (specifically an STM32F205) paired with a Broadcom Wi-Fi chip (specifically the BCM43362). Both of these are contained within the P0 Wi-Fi module. The microcontroller is significantly faster than an Arduino Uno and has a lot more memory (both flash and RAM), so if you're used to working with an Arduino, you'll have a lot of power and breathing room. However it is a microcontroller, so it won't run a general purpose OS like Linux. Closer to an Arduino than a Raspberry Pi.    Embed Quote
