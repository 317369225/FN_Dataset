★How does one hack a wi-fi network?
There is nothing called hacked when psk given in wiki.. but i tell you a pretty good trick.. small but worthy.. When you Get a access of some wifi.. Open or psk.. just think that,you somehow connected to the network.. then find gateway ip.. if you connected through mobile you get it from detail about connected network.. When it's a lappy or pc, same, find it from detail.. then type this address in your address bar.. then this window ask you to give username and password.. Give, Username: admin Password: admin  .... if the router option open.. Then you successed.. if shown wrong username/password ,then badluck friend.. Try another.. if you successed then now you can operate the router now as you can.. then goto wireless option, then goto wireless mac filtering, then find your device mac address .. input this and then enable mac filtering.. before mac filtering set you mac address enable. okkkk complete, now wirelessly only you can connect through this network.. And all are rejected.. Can't connect.. :-)    Embed Quote
