★How easy is it to hack a password-protected Wi-Fi network?
It depends on which encryption the WiFi uses. 1. If it uses WEP (Wired equivalent privacy), it's easy to break it using backtrack linux distro, which contains tools like aircrack for this purpose.         (i) You need a WiFi (wireless) adapter capable of packet injection.         (ii) Download the Backtrack linux live cd from: www.backtrack-linux.org         (iii) Boot your computer with the live cd.         (iv) Now comes the hard work. You need to follow some instructions to run/operate the program which cracks the wireless network. Find them on: http://lifehacker.com/5305094/ho... 2. If it's WPA, it is relatively harder (afaik). Severe flaws were found out and thus this standard was replaced by WPA2. 2. If it's WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II, also known as IEEE 802.11i-2004), it's computationally unfeasible to crack the network, as far as I know. This is because it uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Although, I am not sure whether the NSA can do it or not. DISCLAIMER: All the advice/information that I gave was purely for educational purposes. I do not condone hacking a wireless network until and unless you are the owner of that network. I strictly disapprove any acts of piggybacking others' wireless network.    Embed Quote
