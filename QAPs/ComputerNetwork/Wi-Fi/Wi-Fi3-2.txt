★Can you use a push-button WPS Wi-Fi setup with the iPhone/iPad?Many routers have a button on the front to pair devices over WiFi, without typing in long access codes. Do the iPhone and iPad work with WPS push-button setup?
Nope, u should consider not using WPS though, as it has some security issues.    Embed Quote
