★Arduino: What is the cheapest Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller system?An Arduino needs an expensive Wi-Fi shield to connect to a wireless network. A basic Freescale Freedom board is only $12 but needs a $35 Wi-Fi module to connect to wireless. A Raspberry Pi can use a cheap $12 Wi-Fi USB adapter, but costs $35 and needs a separate USB power supply. Is there a sub-$20 solution to Wi-Fi enable a device?
You can use carambola2 , though a SoC it can be bought under 20 USD and has basic IO RAM , RAND and Flash. For uC you can try WiSmart EC32Lxx , at 1k units < 20 USD , samples are around 20 USD / piece. The cheapest setup would be a Ar9331 based SoC from china ( 3g router board ) , they go for around 9 USD - 12 USD. But do not expect much support for them. But if you are comfortable with OpenWRT you will do just fine.    Embed Quote
