★Arduino: What is the cheapest Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller system?An Arduino needs an expensive Wi-Fi shield to connect to a wireless network. A basic Freescale Freedom board is only $12 but needs a $35 Wi-Fi module to connect to wireless. A Raspberry Pi can use a cheap $12 Wi-Fi USB adapter, but costs $35 and needs a separate USB power supply. Is there a sub-$20 solution to Wi-Fi enable a device?
There is now a Kickstarter campaign for Oak by Digistump. It costs 13 USD only, it is Arduino compatible, programmable via Wi-Fi (and also has "serial over Wi-Fi" debugging), has underlying cloud with REST API. So far it looks like a best package for me, easier to use than ESP8266 and not as expensive as others.    Embed Quote
