★Arduino: What is the cheapest Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller system?An Arduino needs an expensive Wi-Fi shield to connect to a wireless network. A basic Freescale Freedom board is only $12 but needs a $35 Wi-Fi module to connect to wireless. A Raspberry Pi can use a cheap $12 Wi-Fi USB adapter, but costs $35 and needs a separate USB power supply. Is there a sub-$20 solution to Wi-Fi enable a device?
I use standard Android Tablet. They cost USD 70 and has 7 inch screen, WiFi and even a USB OTG port and Audio output. Program them in Jave and they are good to go.  Expensive than Ras-Pi + WiFi but provide you with a display and comes with adapter and on board memory. Here is a video of one such device    Embed Quote
