★Are Line and Kakao blocked in China on Wi-Fi and/or cellular?Is the Chinese government trying to regulate foreign mobile messengers? Why?
As answered by many ppl, LINE is likely blocked. I don't know what is Kakao... Why trying to regulate? I guess it's because if ppl use LINE to organise events against the govt, the govt cannot easily detect them before the events take place...    Embed Quote
