★What are the dangers of using public Wi-Fi?Is there any research done on this topic? If yes, could I please get the links?
The dangers, as noted in Phillip Remaker's answer, are from connecting unencrypted to websites or without verification on the encryption.  If you submit login details over HTTP, your username and password are often submitted in plain text and it would be trivial for anyone listening in to intercept them. The main solution is to connect over verified HTTPS.   If you have your connection encrypted and verified by a Certificate Authority (CA), your information will be mostly safe.  Adversaries will no longer be able to determine the exact page you're visiting, or your login information. This is true when the URL in your browser has the green lock and "https:" prefix. The lock signifies that the connection is verified through a CA and the https prefix signifies that the connection is encrypted.* It's still possible to determine what websites (but not the exact page) you're visiting though, based on the IP addresses you access.  You have to connect through a VPN to prevent access to that. Here's a paper that speaks briefly on the dangers of public WiFi: WiFi: what's next? * Most major website login via HTTPS even if most of their pages are served over HTTP though. In order to verify that the login is actually insecure, you need to inspect the login requests, you can do this with software like "TamperData".    Embed Quote
