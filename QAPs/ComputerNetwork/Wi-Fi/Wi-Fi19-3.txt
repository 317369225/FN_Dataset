★How easy is it to hack a password-protected Wi-Fi network?
As Arpit Chauhan wrote, it depends on the configured encryption, but it also depends on the device security.   Modern wifi routers support the function WPS and this makes many of them vulnerable even if you use strong encryption.   Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) Vulnerable to Brute-Force Attack   And don't underestimate the vulnerablility of the client system and the user ... what I want to say is ... if you can identify the owner of this wifi router (e.g. by SSID made of family name) you could send the owner a trojan horse by mail and spy on the configured passphrase.    Embed Quote
