★Why would Wi-Fi signals stunt the growth of plants?
Problem: Your source website is exceptionally terrible. The experiment itself wasn't done by actual researchers, and certainly not peer reviewed. It was done by children under the same imperfect kinds of conditions that you have at home, and it relied on some assumptions at that. It's nice that young people get involved with science, but this is by no means reliable professional work. Let's look at the website as a whole. It has a very strong anti-west/"alternative"/conspiracy theory bias in everything it has published. Most of their articles, on any topic, fall short in citing any sources for their claims, let alone focusing on peer reviewed science. Maybe WiFi affects plants, maybe it doesn't. It's hard to test this with properly managed variables and a good sample size in your own home. Kudos for trying, though! My point is that you cannot take anything on this "Global Research" website at face value because its biases are so very strong. Seek out better sources using http://scholar.google.ca/ or your local public library may give its members access to academic journal databases. And if you want to do more experiments at home, you'll have to make the light equal (not just close), and account for temperature, humidity, and air flows as well as using as many test plants as you have space for.    Embed Quote
