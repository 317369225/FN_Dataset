★Arduino: What is the cheapest Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller system?An Arduino needs an expensive Wi-Fi shield to connect to a wireless network. A basic Freescale Freedom board is only $12 but needs a $35 Wi-Fi module to connect to wireless. A Raspberry Pi can use a cheap $12 Wi-Fi USB adapter, but costs $35 and needs a separate USB power supply. Is there a sub-$20 solution to Wi-Fi enable a device?
Since the question does not clarify the use case I have answered in 2 ways since sometime wifi is mentioned when in fact the requirement is wireless. For Wifi (TCP/IP stack and web connectivity) and for a wireless solution: Wifi You can wifi enable a Raspberry Pi as you mention with a $12 dongle. Power is a different requirement as all the boards  listed will need external power. If this is to be a headless solution then a Raspberry Pi Model A uses about 100mA rather than the min 500mA needed for the Model B. So using a Model A (which is also cheaper) and you should be able to use battery power for this solution.  Still higher than an Arduino but depending on your use case the additional processing power and storage may be deciding factor. As the wifi shield for the Arduino is so new I would expect that before the end of 2013 there will be clone boards available that cost far less than the current price so over time like all technology this will get cheaper. Wireless If the need is to communicate wirelessly between 2 devices then the RFM12B transceiver may meet your needs. It would be a <$20 solution and there are various tutorials and libraries available to support it on Arduino This would work for short range communication but not for TCP/IP    Embed Quote
