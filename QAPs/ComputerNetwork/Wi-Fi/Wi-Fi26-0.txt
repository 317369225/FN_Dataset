★Why hasn't Wi-Fi calling been created?
Wi-Fi is just a layer below TCP/IP, like is your DSL or Fiber or ethernet cable or PS (packet switch) on the mobile network. On top of all of those there IP, on top TCP and UDP, and on top Apps that provide calls via standard SIP or non standard protocols. Besides a dozen apps like Skype and FaceTime, the operators also do the same. Some operators provides applications that gives you access to your calls, video-calls, sms and mms, including dual ringing and dual deliver, all over quasi-standard SIP. Joyn/RCS-E is also usable over any TCP network. 4G Voice over WiFi is, again, standard SIP calling, but with all the logic behind capable of handing over the call between 4G WiFi, 4G mobile (VoLTE) or 3G CSD (regular call).    Embed Quote
