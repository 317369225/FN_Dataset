★Why doesn't Caltrain have Wi-Fi?Has this been proposed before? Why didn't it pass?
This has been proposed in the past, and in fact CalTrain Caltrain has gone through multiple RFPs for the service.  The top issue is budget.  Installing WiFi on their full fleet would require a several million dollar investment.   At the same time, with the increasing number of internet enabled sensors, security camera solutions etc. the ROI equation may be improving for a general deployment that could also be used by passengers.  It's certainly a great demographic!
