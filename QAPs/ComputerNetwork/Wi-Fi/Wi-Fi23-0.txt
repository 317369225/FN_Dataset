★Why does my download speed through wi-fi become zero when i place my mobile just above my wi-fi router?
Because signal strength is the amount of power coming into your receiver antenna.  The transmitter antenna emits power, but the power isn't the same in every direction.  Your typical dipole antenna (the one that's just a rod sticking up) emits in a donut-shaped pattern: So directly above the dipole, the transmitted power is zero, and it gets gradually better until you reach the plane perpendicular to the antenna. Edit:  This is factually correct for a dipole, but not applicable to this case since it's not an ideal dipole or even a single antenna.  A real router has multiple antennas and the signal will reflect off of walls, making it equivalent to having another weaker antenna on the other side of the wall. More likely it is signal saturation.  The electronics to amplify the incoming RF signal from the antenna has an automatic gain control to adjust to different signal levels.  If the signal is too low, it can't read, and if the signal is too high, then the RF front end amplifier will saturate and distort the signal.  It is therefore most likely that your RF front end amplifier is saturated and the automatic gain control cannot reduce the gain enough to avoid saturation.    Embed Quote
