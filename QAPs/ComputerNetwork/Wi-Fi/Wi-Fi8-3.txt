★Does Wi-Fi work underwater?
WiFi could theoretically work underwater, but would face great attenuation issues from two fronts - the mass of the water itself, and also the reflective or conductive state of the water based upon the salts and sediments contained within the water, as well as the motion of the water. There is a rather dated study from 1987 regarding this concept by Lloyd Butler VK5BR, however I would say that it all still holds true today : http://users.tpg.com.au/ldbutler...    Embed Quote
