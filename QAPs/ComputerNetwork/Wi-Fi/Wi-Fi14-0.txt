★How do wi-fi routers work?
Wi-fi routers are basically consisted of two parts, router and wi-fi access point. Router functions to route and forward packets coming from your network (in this case, from the AP) to the nearest hop. In case you want to connect to internet, the nearest hop would be your default gateway. Wi-fi access points, on the other hand, are the configured nodes, which transmit and receive radio signals, the communication medium used in wlan protocol. There are a lot of articles or RFCs you could read that specifically discuss the protocol used in implementing these things. Good luck.    Embed Quote
