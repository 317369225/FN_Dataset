★Are Line and Kakao blocked in China on Wi-Fi and/or cellular?Is the Chinese government trying to regulate foreign mobile messengers? Why?
i don't know much about Kakao. But for line, which is blocked, I think China is showing its anger toward Japan, which is making a big move toward militarism.    Embed Quote
