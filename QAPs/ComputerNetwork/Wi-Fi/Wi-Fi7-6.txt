★Arduino: What is the cheapest Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller system?An Arduino needs an expensive Wi-Fi shield to connect to a wireless network. A basic Freescale Freedom board is only $12 but needs a $35 Wi-Fi module to connect to wireless. A Raspberry Pi can use a cheap $12 Wi-Fi USB adapter, but costs $35 and needs a separate USB power supply. Is there a sub-$20 solution to Wi-Fi enable a device?
The ESP8266 is definitely the cheapest option, around $4 - 5. It can be programmed with the Arduino IDE, it has got input and output pins. This means that you don't even need an Arduino to use this, in fact it has got twice the memory and 5 times the processing power (64k and 80mHz). Some people claim that it's not too reliable but they talk about the first generation of this board. There are more advanced boards available based on the ESP8266, for example the one from Olimex: This chip can even be used as a web server to host simple websites to control your device. If you want ultimate reliability, then look at the Spark Photon.    Embed Quote
