★Why does my download speed through wi-fi become zero when i place my mobile just above my wi-fi router?
When you say "just above" could this mean one floor above?   If the distance is actually 20-30 feet above, then you may also be suffering interference - another wifi router in a nearby room or house.    Embed Quote
