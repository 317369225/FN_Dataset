★Does Wi-Fi work underwater?
Microwave radiation (such as Wi-Fi) is very easily absorbed and reflected by water - it's the entire premise on which a microwave oven works. If you were to put very dry food in a microwave it would not cook well (unless it happened to contain a great deal of some other type of polar molecule, or acted as an antenna) Microwave a container full of water for even a relatively short period of time and you may find it gets hot much faster than the rate you generally expect from your microwave oven. Wi-Fi does very poorly indeed in, or even nearby water. Raindrops are sufficient to cause noticeable disruption to Wi-Fi. A body of water acts like a gigantic rough (read: jagged surface) mirror for Wi-Fi, which will cause horrible interference, even if it is not along the path between the AP and the station. Water will randomly scatter the microwave radiation, which will now bounce about on hundreds of random  (read: inconsistent, changing over time) paths, very likely interfering with the paths of nearby Wi-Fi signals. Final note - submarines use much lower frequency signals in part because of this (but also for their long range)    Embed Quote
