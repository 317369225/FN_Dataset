★Can we combine two wi-fi networks?
What is the meaning of "combine 2 WiFi networks"? Please explain. Do you mean bandwidth of two WiFi n/w  - Not feasible Do you mean ability to switch between two WiFi n/w - Default implementation for any device. Do you mean one is a broadcasting network and another will have to be a hotspot - Yes. Depends on device you are using. For phones and tablets you can tether from 3G/2G to WiFi. WiFi to WiFi does not happen. On a laptop too the scenario is identical. Additionally you can share LAN wired connection over WiFi. Connect WiFi router with a cable to laptop and share the connection over the laptop's WiFi Do you mean you have two WiFi routers - Then one WiFi router broadcasts and the other WiFi router both receives and broadcasts. YES in this case. I have run out of ideas about the meaning of "combine". I don't know if this helps nevertheless here are some URLs:    Embed Quote
