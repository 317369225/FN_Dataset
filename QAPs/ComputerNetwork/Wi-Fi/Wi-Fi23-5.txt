★Why does my download speed through wi-fi become zero when i place my mobile just above my wi-fi router?
A dipole antenna radiates/receives RF signal best in directions perpendicular to the axis of the dipole, and least in the direction of the dipole's axis. You can put your mobile above the router by turning the latter's antenna to the horizontal instead of the vertical.  If the antenna is inside the case, see whether the router has an alternative mounting for its base, to turn it on its side or back.  Also, hold your mobile flat over the router, to maximize the mobile's antenna gain.    Embed Quote
