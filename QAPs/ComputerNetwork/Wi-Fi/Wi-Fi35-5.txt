★Why would Wi-Fi signals stunt the growth of plants?
2.4 GHz electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by water, this is why Microwaves use this frequency to cook food. Also why this frequency is unlicensed in the USA. It could be the water in your plants are being slowly, very slowly, cooked. More likely it's something else because the energy levels WiFi operates at are very very low.    Embed Quote
