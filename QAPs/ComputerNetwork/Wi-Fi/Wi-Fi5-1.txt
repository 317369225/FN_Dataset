★Why doesn't Caltrain have Wi-Fi?Has this been proposed before? Why didn't it pass?
It's been proposed before, and I think it got far enough along for Caltrain to provide an estimate for when they could deploy the Caltrain WiFi (IIRC, they estimated it to be built by 2009). Of course, the financial crisis came, and with much of Caltrain's budget still very dependent on three financially-strapped entities (SamTrans/San Mateo County, VTA/Santa Clara County, SFMTA/San Francisco), WiFi plans had to be scrapped in favor of priorities such as minimizing schedule cuts and future rail electrification. I don't think that Caltrain's quite out of the budget woods yet, as just last year, it took a major grassroots effort to lobby each of the agencies to at least maintain their funding levels to preserve the existing level of service - and that's even with the fare increases coming next month.    Embed Quote
