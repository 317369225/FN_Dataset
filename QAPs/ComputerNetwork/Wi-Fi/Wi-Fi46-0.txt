★What are the new developments in Wi-Fi?
The latest significant development toward (much) higher speeds is WiGig (see Wireless Gigabit Alliance) which relies on new 60GHz chips and antennas. It can communicate at 7Gbps (4.6Gbps quoted elsewhere) or ~50X IEEE 802.11n. The standard includes provision of phased array beam forming to concentrate the power  more narrowly in an arbitrary as needed direction. There is a discussion and a picture of the board in today's MIT Technology Review online edition here Superfast Wireless Heading to Laptops and Smartphones in 2015 | MIT Technology Review . Other than the error in paragraph 3 (5MHz should read 5.8GHz) it is a nice summary. See Google for more reading.    Embed Quote
