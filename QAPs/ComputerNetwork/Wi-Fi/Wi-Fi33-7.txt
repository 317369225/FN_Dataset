★Are Line and Kakao blocked in China on Wi-Fi and/or cellular?Is the Chinese government trying to regulate foreign mobile messengers? Why?
LINE had been blocked even if launched on partnership with one of major local service, Page on 36o.cn. BAND, sibling product of LINE, was been peaked at that time around. My guess is that Chinese are looking for alternatives.    Embed Quote
