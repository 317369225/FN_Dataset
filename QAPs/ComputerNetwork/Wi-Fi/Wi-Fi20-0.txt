★Can Wi-Fi signals cause health risks?
It is still a topic of research.  The general consensus is that there is low to no risk. A number of studies are poorly conducted and fall victim to the Placebo Effect.  There are anecdotal stories like the ones listed at  Oh, no! School wi-fi is making our kids sick! (2012 edition). I have seen no good double-blind studies that make a statement one way or the other, and WiFi has not been around long enough to have evidence of long term effects. You cannot "prove" a negative (see: Evidence of absence), but since there have been no credible studies that indicate that WiFi is harmful to the general population, I have no reason to believe that WiFi poses any more health risks than other ambient EMF radiation.    Embed Quote
