★Arduino: What is the cheapest Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller system?An Arduino needs an expensive Wi-Fi shield to connect to a wireless network. A basic Freescale Freedom board is only $12 but needs a $35 Wi-Fi module to connect to wireless. A Raspberry Pi can use a cheap $12 Wi-Fi USB adapter, but costs $35 and needs a separate USB power supply. Is there a sub-$20 solution to Wi-Fi enable a device?
Electric Imp is an ideal solution for many cases. For $25-29 you get a CPU about 8 times faster than a typical Arduino ATMega, integrated WiFi (you program and test it through a web-based IDE, from anywhere in the world), and a cloud service that provides a RESTful API to your device that you define. It also lets you offload intensive computation tasks to cloud servers, and be responsive to incoming API requests even if your device is offline (for example, if your device is battery powered and only comes online periodically to poll for new information).    Embed Quote
