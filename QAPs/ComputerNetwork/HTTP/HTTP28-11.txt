â˜…If HTTPS is more secure than HTTP, why don't all websites use HTTPS?
Ok, this might read like a rant... If it is "why" you're asking, then my answer is laziness. I can't even begin to count how many free (including "free" as in "freedom") or non-free software vendors distribute binaries, not just some content, with no means to check authenticity. Seeing how often security against man-in-the-middle attacks gets pushed to the bottom of the to-do list, if at all considering the complete lack of effort in some cases, I can only conclude it's some form of laziness, ignorance or incompetence. It's not my intention to insult, but raise awareness. You can't really be in this business if you can't do this one simple thing, yet many of them go as far as claiming to be in the business of developing security-related or secure software. As others noted, it's pretty cheap these days. It's often not an issue of money or computing resources. I also agree HTTPS is sort of awful, yet it's a lot better than nothing. Don't listen to those saying they don't implement HTTPS due to some of those reasons; they most likely haven't done any other effort, nor are they planning to, towards improving security through other means. I have enough examples to provide, if necessary. Market penetration of correctly-implemented cryptography, at least from a practical perspective, is quite sad these days, I'm afraid.
