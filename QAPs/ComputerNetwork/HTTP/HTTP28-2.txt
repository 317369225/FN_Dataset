★If HTTPS is more secure than HTTP, why don't all websites use HTTPS?
Because HTTPS is more complex and resource intensive than HTTP and certificate management is a pain in the ass. Faster CPUs and hardware acceleration help the former; Let's Encrypt is working to address the latter. I'm personally infuriated when sites use load balancers that are fully HTTPS capable, but they don't install certificates at those sites.  I'm looking at you, Los Angeles Times, San Jose Mercury News, and Huffington Post. Recommended browser extension: HTTPS Everywhere will attempt to make an HTTPS connection in place of an HTTP connection on any site that has answers on port 443 with a valid certificate. Brickbat: Hey, Quora, can you please add a Subject Alternative Name for http://qr.ae so that I can make an https connection to that as well?
