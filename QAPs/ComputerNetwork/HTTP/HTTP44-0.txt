★Is http://jeeadv.iitkgp.ac not loading?
We all are facing the same problem and JOCSAP is hosted on kgp site, so no point trying other IIT sites. I don't know the details of why it is down ,but seems a bit ironical that the IITs, famed their engineers couldn't keep a half decent website running on the day of deadline of counselling. P.S. I am assuming you want acess to JOCSAP. I was lucky enough to correct the order and lock choices. Have you tried emailing them? Update: "Due to technical problems in the JEE(Adv)-2014 Server on 24 June 2014,  the deadline of Online Choice Filling will be extended appropriately to  compensate for the down time."
