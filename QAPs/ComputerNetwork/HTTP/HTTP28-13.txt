★If HTTPS is more secure than HTTP, why don't all websites use HTTPS?
Latest from Google is that they are advocating 'HTTPS Everywhere', their latest blog post on their webmaster blog talks about how they have incorporated HTTPS in their own services and go on to say: Beyond our own stuff, we’re also working to make the Internet safer more broadly. A big part of that is making sure that websites people access from Google are secure.One of their first steps to encourage this to happen is to include HTTPS as a ranking signal in their search results. So when Google sorts the search results for a user, this will be one of the over 200 factors Google will use to order the results. Though at the moment they aren't giving much weight to this particular factor, they believe only 1% of all global searches will be affected by this change. At their latest developer conference I/O 2014 they went into detail as to why HTTPS should be used for all sites and tried to put to bed many of the concerns website developers may have over using HTTPS for their website, such as speed and cost, though there is no denying it is more difficult to serve your site via HTTPS rather than HTTP. So it is looking likely we may begin to see more sites making the switch to HTTPS and for the most part this will be a good step forward for the internet.
