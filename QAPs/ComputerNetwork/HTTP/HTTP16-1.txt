â˜…Is there a difference between HTTP Streaming and HTTP Live Streaming?
HTTP Streaming delivers a single byte stream of data in a progressive download method to a client. HTTP Live Streaming delivers access to multiple adaptive byte streams that a client to switch to in real-time according to the available Internet connection speed. For example, if a user is watching a video in a high bandwidth WiFi hotspot at 1.5Mbps, then the WiFi signal degrades, the client can compensate by switching to a 750Kbps tier of the stream without interruption to the user. Another quality of Live Streaming technology is better security on data delivered to a client due to small 'chunks' of data transmitted and appended in real-time for playback by the client. Meaning downloading a full video from a URL of a Live Stream is not likely.
