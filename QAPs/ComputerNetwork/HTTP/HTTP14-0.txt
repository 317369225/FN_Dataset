â˜…What is the difference between http://medium.com/ and http://feathe.rs/ ?
From what I can tell by briefly looking at Feathers site and having now used Medium for a few weeks is that Medium is geared towards the sharing and spreading of great ideas through a quality writing platform. Feathers may have a similar idea but is going for a platform that purposefully removes all of the fluff that comes with other blogging platforms (ie tagging, theming, etc). Medium still allows its writers to curate their work (and the work of others) through the use of collections - something that seemingly would be contrary to the Feathers manifesto. Ultimately, they are two different takes on the idea that content is king, and too often, blogging (or writing in general) is impeded by all the extra fluff that blogging platforms have standardized. I haven't gotten any experience or heard about Feathers till now, but I have come to love Medium and have started writing because of how incredibly seamless and effective the product is.
