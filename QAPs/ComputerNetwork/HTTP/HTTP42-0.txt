★What is Breather? (http://www.breather.com)
Mark Schneider has a very good answer, but let me give you an inside perspective (I'm the CEO/co-founder of the company). By lowering the barrier for getting private space, what Breather is trying to do is grab dozens, or hundreds of use cases that are normally reserved for public place. As well as competing with traditional business centres, our real uses are as varied as: - business meetings; - phone calls; - charging your phone; - breastfeeding your child; - actors rehearsing for a play; - using Breather as a temporary warehouse; - a total replacement for your office; - a place for an off-site - a place to nap; - etc. The world over, there are paid, hourly usage services, from sketchy hourly love-motels in Latin America, to manga cafés in urban Japan. But hourly usage of private space has been mostly non-existent in America for a bunch of reasons. We made a big bet early-on that this could change. Seeing precedent for it in other cultures was an early signal that it could happen here too. In our company, we think we can revolutionize the way people use space, make it more efficient, make more money for landlords, make cities more livable, and a lot more. All of this can happen just by making private space easy to access by mobile phone, and making it pleasant to use. This has turned out to give our product significant word-of-mouth, strong retention, good unit economics, and a lot more. We're just at the beginning of our mission, but if you try the service for yourself and see how it can fit into your life, we think you'll be pleasantly surprised. :)
