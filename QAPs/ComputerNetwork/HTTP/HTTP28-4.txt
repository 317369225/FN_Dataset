â˜…If HTTPS is more secure than HTTP, why don't all websites use HTTPS?
The simplest answer is: history. HTTPS is much more expensive in terms of the computing power needed. This mostly impacts the server-side where many thousands of requests (or more) are handled. Back in the 1980's, I looked at using fully encrypted communication for a distributed application, and concluded it was simply far too expensive. In the 1990's when the web started to take off, computers were much faster, but the cost of an SSL connection (the "S" in HTTPS) on the server side was still very heavy. So most websites (for good reason) were built to use HTTP where possible, and HTTPS only when needed. In the present, computers are faster and cheaper, so the cost of using HTTPS is less. Also we know of too many rude folk who expend time and money to spy on others, when general usage of the web is far more common. Yes, it seems that we have reached a point where HTTPS should be more common, and perhaps universal.
