★Why would HTTP long-polling be used instead of HTTP Streaming to achieve real-time push notifications?
There are a number of ways to implement HTML Streaming, including multipart-replace, SSE, receiving the appropriate events from an XHR and the hack that is foreverframe.  You might even include websockets in there, depending on exactly how you see the HTML streaming world. Hardly any of those techniques work in any version of IE.  You can do something similar with a forever frame, but that can lead to memory leaks and a rather messy API.  Given this, if you want a reasonably clean API that will work in lots of browsers including IE (and you don't want to use a library that abstracts these decisions away), long polling is not a bad choice.
