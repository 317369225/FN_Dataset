â˜…What does Ifttt think of adding a HTTP request channel?Adding a HTTP Request channel would allow developers to build their own custom channels. For example, you could connect your Pinboard to a custom script that saves the bookmark's HTML to a Dropbox. Developers could even publish these as recipes that anybody could use.
I have asked this to IFTTT multiple times, from Sept 2012, using twitter. Every time they replied something like: "future versions, really like to do this, bla bla bla". It's not going to be there soon i think :( Screen Shot 2013-12-14 at 01.19.35 am.png I did find some sort of wordpress IFTTT hook hack, which basically enables you to use PHP to do whatever and hide under a wordpress post, kind of cool. Haven't tried it though. ifttt-channel-extensions Haha, i've asked this question AGAIN here: Partnership inquiries Curious if i will get any response whatsoever.
