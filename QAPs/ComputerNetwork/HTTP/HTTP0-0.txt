★What is HTTP?
Technically is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. In common words: "Is the language/grammar used by  browsers (such as Chrome, Explorer, Safari, etc) used to talk to web servers". When you open your browser and point to some web page, that web page resides in a web server (HTTP server) so the client (your browser) and the server needs to talk the same protocol to understand which resource is required: web page, image, others. A common HTTP request issued by a browser:   GET /somefile.txt HTTP/1.0 a common response from a HTTP server   HTTP/1.0 200 OK   Content-Type: text/plain   Content-Length: 24   this is fhe file content as you can see the browser performed a GET request (which means read/retrieve) over the file somefile.txt using the HTTP protocol version 1.0. Then the server replied back with status 200 which means: the resource (something.txt) was found and is being delivered to you. It says also the content type of the file and after the protocol headers it sends back the file content which length is 24 bytes (you can count the characters) That is HTTP, a protocol to exchange information in a specific way, nowadays one of the widely used protocols on Internet.
