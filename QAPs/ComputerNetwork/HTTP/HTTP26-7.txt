â˜…What does Ifttt think of adding a HTTP request channel?Adding a HTTP Request channel would allow developers to build their own custom channels. For example, you could connect your Pinboard to a custom script that saves the bookmark's HTML to a Dropbox. Developers could even publish these as recipes that anybody could use.
HTTP Requests would be a very very cool feature. But it should be really tricky to ensure : Low bandwidth, Secure request (often with private token) RESFull request (with session) :-( Instead of PUSH by Request, Ifttt.com should at least provides a Channel to PULL RSS events. (Actually you have to use Google Calendar or Blogger as proxies)
