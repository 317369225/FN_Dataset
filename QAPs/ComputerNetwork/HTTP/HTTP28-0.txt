â˜…If HTTPS is more secure than HTTP, why don't all websites use HTTPS?
10 years ago I would have agreed with the other answers that HTTPS is unnecessary for most web sites. Today, I'm no longer convinced it's optional. Encrypted connections reduce the opportunity for ISP and government tracking, both a problem in most countries, including the US. Encrypted connections reduce the opportunity for on-the-wire malware and spoofing. Encrypted connections make up for the inadequacy of the insecure DNS infrastructure to some extent. The browser enforces a slightly higher security policy for HTTPS connections, reducing hack opportunities on the client regardless of the communication channel. If HTTPS is not present, even once, for one web site, a user is vulnerable to all of the above attacks or tracking. A computer which is hacked even once is owned by the hacker, forever or until it's reformatted and restored to a safe state. The cost of HTTPS are also minimal for each web connection. The CPU cost of 256-bit encryption is very low, comparable or lower than compression algorithms. The extra ~500ms latency of the 7-way SSL handshake only occurs once per web connection. The benefits far outweigh the costs in the modern computing environment on the Internet.
