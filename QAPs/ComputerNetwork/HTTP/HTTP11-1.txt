â˜…Why would HTTP long-polling be used instead of HTTP Streaming to achieve real-time push notifications?
In our experience, after implementing all the required algorithms and heuristics for choosing the correct transport and for managing the client-side memory, HTTP Streaming works perfectly on all browsers. There are only two reasons for supporting Long Polling too: 1) To pass through some combinations of proxy servers and antivirus that block any form of streaming because they want to download and inspect the full HTTP response before forwarding it to the client. (Usually HTTPS does not suffer the same limits). 2) To adapt to very slow clients, or to very high message rates, so that with Long Polling the client smoothly finds its own update rate, rather than having it forced by the server. In Lightstreamer we implemented the automatic switch from Streaming to Polling for both the cases: for the first case via the 'Stream-Sense' mechanism; for the second case via the 'slowing heuristics'.
