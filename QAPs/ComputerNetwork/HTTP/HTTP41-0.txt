â˜…For downloading, is HTTP or FTP better nowadays?FTP seems to have fallen behind both in terms of clients and servers, if these two protocols are to be compared by download capabilities, which will win, and why ? Are HTTP a better choice nowadays ?
For smaller files (as well as for single file transfers), FTP is a technically better choice. Each HTTP request includes headers which increase the amount of data transferred. Conversely, FTP requires a lot more commands sent between the client and the server, and each transfer is done as a separate connection, which also has a good amount of overhead to set up and tear down. When transferring files in bulk, however, it's way easier to use FTP. FTP actually 'understands' the concept of directories with files in them, whereas HTTP doesn't. When launching a website, for example, I much prefer to use FTP because I can just select a folder and that folder structure will be recreated on the server. Of course, the average person has a web browser and not much else, which is why most single-file downloads these days are offered over HTTP. Purely looking at the protocols, both FTP and HTTP have been stable for years now, but looking at clients there are far more people using HTTP clients (aka browsers). FTP still has a purpose, but if you have a website and you're looking to reach the greatest number of people, serve up your downloads over HTTP. Source: http://daniel.haxx.se/docs/ftp-v...
