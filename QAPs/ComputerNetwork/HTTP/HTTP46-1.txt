★How much slower is https than http?
Depends on your definition of 'slower'. If you look at the data stream of a big transmission, https (ssl/tls) does add very little overhead. There is, however, a big overhead to set up the transmission. So if you have many connections (which you have, most of the time), https can be anything from 'a little bit slower' to unusable. In addition, data transmitted via https is often not cached, requiring that all parts of the page are reloaded every time. So in the end, it all depends on your application and use case. If you have a modern 'ajaxy' web app which only gets the data it needs via dynamic requests, it should be no problem. If you try to just slam https on a legacy web app with lots of items on the page, without the support for connection-keepalive, without caching support, and maybe even behind an authenticating proxy, it can be your worst nightmare.    Embed Quote
