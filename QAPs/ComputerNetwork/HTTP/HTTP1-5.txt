So which method I have to use for video delivery to make video to run smoothly and to load faster even on heavy traffic ??? And what are the advantages & disadvantages of using these mathods ???
It really depends what you're using your video for... RTMP is a more secure form of streaming. It means that the whole video file is streamed in small chunks so that the entire file is never there in one piece for someone to download. It's also conservative with your bandwidth (because only the section that your viewer is watching gets streamed) so if you're looking for the most cost efficient way this could be the one. However, because RTMP streams your video in chunks it never loads ahead of time and viewers on slow speed connections might experience a bit of buffering as they wait for the rest of the file to stream. For the smoothest playback we at vzaar generally recommend HTTP because it DOES load ahead of time. The best choice really depends where your priorities lie - security or smooth playback
