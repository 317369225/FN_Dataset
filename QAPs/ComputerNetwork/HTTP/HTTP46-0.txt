★How much slower is https than http?
Here is a specific answer for you. TLS (HTTPS) will add 1-2 round trips of delay in setting up the connection from a purely networking perspective. As others point out, the processing delay for handling the encryption is fairly minimal assuming modern equipment. (The cost is not but this isn't your question) So the real question: is this a lot? Like with many questions of this nature, it depends on your users. Let's say your typical user's round trip time is a handful of ms; they are on a wired high speed connection close to your server. Two additional round trips is not such a big deal. On the other hand let's say they are on an old EDGE wireless connection with a round trip time of 500 ms or more. Now this cost is 1 second or more. In terms of web app KPIs this will have a serious negative impact on performance.    Embed Quote
