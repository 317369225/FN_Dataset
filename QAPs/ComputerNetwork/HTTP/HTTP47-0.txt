 Registrant Name: Peter DePaulo Registrant Organization: Registrant Street: 179 Deer Trail Cir Registrant City: Arroyo Grande Registrant State/Province: CA Registrant Postal Code: 93420 Registrant Country: US Registrant Phone: +1.8057098547 Registrant Phone Ext: Registrant Fax: Registrant Fax Ext: Registrant Email: peterdepaulo@gmail.com Perhaps Peter DePaulo knows. :) Update [April 19, 2014] Someone anonymously suggested an edit to replace the above WHOIS record with [information redacted].  So, I just checked rebootcodeschool.com's WHOIS record again and it's now private. I also took a look at Reddit and saw that there are only a few RBC-related links, none of which have traction  (http://www.reddit.com/user/reboo...). These facts lead me to believe that whoever asked this question is just astroturfing on behalf of ReBoot Code School.    Embed Quote
