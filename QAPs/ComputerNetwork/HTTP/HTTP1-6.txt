â˜…HTTP Streaming: Which method is better , HTTP Downloading or RTMP Streaming?For my video sharing website, I am using Amazon Cloudfront(CDN) service , Here there is two option for video delivery HTTP Downloading and RTMP Streaming . So which method I have to use for video delivery to make video to run smoothly and to load faster even on heavy traffic ??? And what are the advantages & disadvantages of using these mathods ???
While RTMP is a more mature streaming protocol, it does however have a limitation.. it works on port 1935. While this may seem of no great importance to users sitting on home or mobile broadband, it can affect delivery to users sitting behind corporate (or any other) firewalls. Most secure corporates block all ports except 80 for employee internet access, which means that http (which works beautifully over port 80) might be better suited here. Note: RTMP can used for live streaming while http live is done using the much newer Adobe Dynamic Streaming/Silverlight Smooth Streaming. I do agree with the other folks on this post that http is also great for newer mobile devices (read droid, ios). HTTP live (Apple HLS) is simply awesome on iOS devices while most newer droid variants support flash. Hope this helps! Cheers...
