â˜…If HTTPS is more secure than HTTP, why don't all websites use HTTPS?
I would add another (very important IMHO) reason that has not been (suprisingly IMHO) listed in other answers. SPDY and QUIC are now "stable" and widely used on Google's sites, Twitter or Facebook. While HTTP2.0 is still a work in progress, everyone who faces a big traffic should consider using it. And they both require the use of SSL/TLS (so we can ignore the "tunnel" part and consider calling it "HTTPS"). In addition, using QUIC or SPDY widely reduces the extra CPU cycles, more than the one pointed by Piers Karsenbarg and really speeds up your end users experience (opposed to Liam O'Flynn).
