â˜…What does Ifttt think of adding a HTTP request channel?Adding a HTTP Request channel would allow developers to build their own custom channels. For example, you could connect your Pinboard to a custom script that saves the bookmark's HTML to a Dropbox. Developers could even publish these as recipes that anybody could use.
This is definitely something that's needed. Automating web work for me means also allowing me to define which APIs to use and how.
