â˜…If HTTPS is more secure than HTTP, why don't all websites use HTTPS?
There are actually quite a few reasons, and I'm surprised they haven't been discussed in the answers yet. 1. The most common type of SSL certificate requires that each Web site has a dedicated IP address. Shared hosting allows many sites on a single IP address; if we were to have every site on its own IP address we'd soon run out, assuming we don't switch to IPv6 (which has its own problems). There are ways around this, but they're not universally supported in all browsers. 2. It raises the bar for having your own Web site. In addition to finding a host and setting up your site, you'd now have to buy an SSL certificate as well. These can be expensive. You can get them for low or no cost from places like StartSSL, but they require a great deal of technical expertise to install, and many Web hosts won't install SSL certificates you get from other places, or will charge you money to do so. 3. Doing SSL everywhere can break caching servers. Caching servers can't 'see' the content of encrypted connections. 4. It can be more complicated to set up than you might think, especially for large, complex sites. It's not as simple as just flipping a switch. If you have a busy site with multiple servers, load balancers, and so on, enabling SSL everywhere can require quite a lot of work to fine-tune site performance. And its surprisingly easy for things like sloppy coding to result in hard-coded http (rather than https) links, which can play merry hell with your site. These are not insoluble problems, of course. But I've noticed a lot of folks do tend to handwave around them.
