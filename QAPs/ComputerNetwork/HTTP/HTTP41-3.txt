â˜…For downloading, is HTTP or FTP better nowadays?FTP seems to have fallen behind both in terms of clients and servers, if these two protocols are to be compared by download capabilities, which will win, and why ? Are HTTP a better choice nowadays ?

Users are the most comfortable interacting with browsers, and hence as a natural extension, HTTP is gaining the most prominence.

Hence, more than a question of being technically better, HTTP is now the easiest way to download anything. Click-and-go!
