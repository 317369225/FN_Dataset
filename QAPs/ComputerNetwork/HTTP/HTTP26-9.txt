â˜…What does Ifttt think of adding a HTTP request channel?Adding a HTTP Request channel would allow developers to build their own custom channels. For example, you could connect your Pinboard to a custom script that saves the bookmark's HTML to a Dropbox. Developers could even publish these as recipes that anybody could use.
Forget a HTTP channel. Add a Femtoo channel. Femtoo uses cQuery to track whether certain parts of webpages are updated, and can create virtual APIs for time zones, currency conversion and Amazon prices. I love Femtoo, as it lets me track changes to webpages (using XPath or CSS selectors), and email me when they change.
