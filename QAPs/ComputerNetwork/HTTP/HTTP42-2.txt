★What is Breather? (http://www.breather.com)
It's a very interesting idea and it could be disruptive vis-a-vis Starbucks.  Breather looks to be a start-up aimed at what Starbucks' founder, Howard Schultz, called the "3rd place", a place between your home and work.  Breather is serving up peace and quiet and is a commercial space take on AirBNB and differs from traditional competitors such as Regus, which rents by the month.  Starbucks, on the other hand, is serving up ambient sound and coffee to give you a cafe experience.  It's hard to predict the success without knowing the founding team and how exactly people will use these spaces (which may be much different from what the founders expected).   My gut reaction is I don't think it will be close to being as successful as Uber, but it could become a moderate success like  ZipCar.
