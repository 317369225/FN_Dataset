â˜…HTTP Streaming: Which method is better , HTTP Downloading or RTMP Streaming?For my video sharing website, I am using Amazon Cloudfront(CDN) service , Here there is two option for video delivery HTTP Downloading and RTMP Streaming . So which method I have to use for video delivery to make video to run smoothly and to load faster even on heavy traffic ??? And what are the advantages & disadvantages of using these mathods ???
I'd have to disagree on RTMP always being higher performing. If you do progressive over http the user can buffer content (and the browser can pre-buffer content with caching) which significantly improves performance. If your connection isn't great RTMP will always lag behind. If you look at both Youtube and Vimeo they choose progressive delivery for this very reason. HTML5 is the future, and RTMP is rapidly becoming a piece of the past.
