â˜…If HTTPS is more secure than HTTP, why don't all websites use HTTPS?
From the point of view of the small web-development company, the simplest reason is lack of a variety of resources: 1) Money - SSL Certificates cost money, sometimes more than the hosting package for small sites, although they have become more economical. 2) Time - The application process can be tedious, requiring proof of identity and various loopholes to verify your identity with the issuing body. 3) Experience - Generation and installation of public/private certificates tends not to be a user-friendly pointy-clicky routine. Remembering to renew the certificate and install the new updated one before the old one expires is another administrative task that might be overlooked. 4) IP4 Addresses - until relatively recently you needed a unique IP address for each site. This can be an added expense, depending on the hosting provider. In the face of these obstacles, the arguments for SSL, privacy + security aren't very strong when the client isn't handling sensitive data. HTTPS is slightly slower, as it increases the workload on both the server and the client, and data usage is higher. The barriers to HTTPS are lower now, but habits die hard, and the development community are always being pushed on price, so they are unlikely to try selling something if the client sees no clear need for it.
