★If HTTPS is more secure than HTTP, why don't all websites use HTTPS?
Until there actually is a world-wide initiative for websites to provide reliable security, users can actually take this issue into their own hands with HTTPS Everywhere, a Firefox, Chrome and Opera extension which enforces (pretty) secure browser communication on any/every site that supports HTTPS. HTTPS Everywhere is "a collaboration between The Tor Project and the Electronic Frontier Foundation" (see the webpage above).  This extension can typically be found in your browser's own "Extensions and Add-ins" page...  Oh, and see also this Wikipedia article: HTTPS Everywhere Note the lack of support for IE.  But you're not using IE, are you?  Certainly not if you're interested in security, privacy and authenticity.
