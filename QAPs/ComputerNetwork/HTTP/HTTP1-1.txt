So which method I have to use for video delivery to make video to run smoothly and to load faster even on heavy traffic ??? And what are the advantages & disadvantages of using these mathods ???
Streaming will always outperform basic HTTP, because most streaming technologies incorporate dynamic bitrate to support changing network contention. Apple has also developed an HTTP-based specification that works on Apple devices to change the bitrate on the fly similar to how RTMP works, but it isn't widely supported outside the Apple walled garden. Unfortunately, mobile devices that don't support Flash make using RTMP very difficult, so most are using HTTP. Wowza appears to offer an excellent product in this space and it comes highly recommended.
