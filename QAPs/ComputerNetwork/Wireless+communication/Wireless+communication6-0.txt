★What is the current research in wireless communication?
The hottest 'new' areas in wireless tech have been around for some time in theory, but are picking up attention now that they have the potential and infrastructure to generate money: 1. Device to device and Internet of things: connect machines to each other and the internet wirelessly, now that we have super-small chips available. 2. Body Area Networks/ Personal Area Networks - Wearable sensors have just started being marketed by big firms in earnest 3. Indoor Positioning - using wifi routers/bluetooth/cellphones (just about anything wireless) to find out your location within a mall/complex and then sell targeted ads. In the traditional world of cellular communication, these (and more) technologies are being intensely explored for 5G: 1. Massive MIMO: Place hundreds of antennas at the base station to form narrow signal 'beams' towards your mobile device, minimizing interference and saving energy. 2. Single Frequency Full Duplex: Transmit and receive at the same time, smartly cancelling the self-interference of your transmitted signal. 3. Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP): Collect and combine signal from multiple base stations, which was till now rejected as interference. (Already part of 4G+). 4. Cognitive Radio: Allow several wireless technologies to share the spectrum by adaptively finding unused frequency resources. Filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) is a key enabler 5. mmWave: ultra high frequencies (30-300GHz) that contain humungous amount of unused spectrum right now.    Embed Quote
