★Wireless Communication: What are the main differences between RF and audio as transmission media?With audio, the medium is matter, and with RF, the medium is electromagnetic waves. How does this affect diffusion, reflection, attenuation, frequency response... How do things like humidity and temperature make audio different from RF?
Probably the best way to explain the difference is to hold RF transmission as the "standard" and compare audio against the standard. RF transmission covers the frequencies from 100kHz to THz frequencies. There are multiple modulation schemes and significant control over the spatial dimension of emission. In space, there is little difference in propagation conditions with frequency. In the atmosphere, there is propagation differences according to altitude and absorption. Audio emission is significantly limited in range, modulation technique, data rate, and spatial control compared to RF. The atmosphere is very lossy as a transmission medium. There is poor spatial control as compared to RF. Finally the data rate will be much lower. In summary, the biggest differences are range, much lower for audio, data rate, which is much lower for audio, and spatial control, which is much worse for audio.    Embed Quote
