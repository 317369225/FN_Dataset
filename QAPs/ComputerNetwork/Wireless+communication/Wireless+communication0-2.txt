★What are the limitations of TCP/IP to handle wireless communication?
Although TCP can cope with any amount of loss by using sequence number, timeout, re-transmission..., it performs poorly with wireless. TCP was designed for wired network where the loss of packets usually assumes to be due to congestion in the network. The nature of loss in wireless network is quite different since it is usually due to bit errors such as interference with other RF signals... People propose multiple solutions for that bit errors problem, but those usually happens at the link layer not the transport layer.    Embed Quote
