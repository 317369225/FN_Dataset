★Is it true that Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower and his plans to build such "magnifying transmitter" towers at other places would have peppered the globe with free electricity and wireless communication as early as the 1920s?
There are currently two Russian scientists who are attempting to actualize this wireless transmission system. check link. Global Energy Transmission The efficiency of transmitting energy is something worth researching, so we can get exact measured results to base our thoughts on. 100 years since his work, and this has yet to be reattempted at the scale that Tesla tried, as far as I'm aware that is. Second, the energy would be as free as the source it comes from. For example, the two Russian scientists referred to earlier, imagine placing such a tower next to a massive pile of solar panels in the Sahara desert. The area of the solar panels are such that they provide all the energy required by our civilization and then wirelessly transmitted across the globe. Since no one "owns" sun light, it would be technically energy free of cost, compared to say energy gained from coal.    Embed Quote
