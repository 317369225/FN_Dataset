★Is there any form of wireless communication technology that cannot be intercepted or jammed?
Any signal that is transmitted is encrypted and/or uses spatial and/or frequency techniques to make the interception more difficult. It is after all, an algorithm/method that makes this possible (for the signal to be transmitted) and then be received by the authorized receiver and be decoded. By this virtue alone, a key exists for decoding (however improbable that may be to solve). One of the most secure methods of transmission is what Andy Lemke has described, coupled with one-time use cipher pads. Because there isn't a long enough sequence to decide patterns or a cipher to break per se, one-time bursty transmissions were/are next to impossible to break/eavesdrop.    Embed Quote
