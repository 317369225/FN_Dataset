★What are low-cost ways to implement wireless communication in embedded systems?
AxSem makes some low-cost 400 and 800MHz band transceivers such as the AX5051 (http://www.axsem.com/web/documen..., http://www.mouser.com/ProductDet...) for about $3 plus the cost of additional components (resistors, capacitors, inductors, an antenna). TI also makes some similar components such as the CC1000 (http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/fo...) for around $5-$10.   Distributers such as Digikey also have a wide selection of modules supporting WiFi, Bluetooth and ZigBee, in the range of $50-$100 if you are willing to spend more for a more complete wireless module.    Embed Quote
