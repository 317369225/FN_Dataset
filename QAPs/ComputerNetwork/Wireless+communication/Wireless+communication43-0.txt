★Can wireless communication be done under water? If not, how do submarines communicate with the outside world?
they can raise their opto-electronics mast, what you used to consider the periscope, above the water while mostly submerged and communicate with an antenna on it. The old periscope has been replaced by a much smaller optical camera assembly that leaves a less detectable radar and optical indication. Still they would only raise the mast when absolutely necessary and communicate as quickly as possible as it is a potential location giveaway. Submarines also can use a very long wave, low frequency communications that can penetrate water. the resulting transmission speed is very slow and they can only send a  few characters per minute but they can do it from completely submerged.    Embed Quote
