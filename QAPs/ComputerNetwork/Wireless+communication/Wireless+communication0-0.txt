★What are the limitations of TCP/IP to handle wireless communication?
TCP was invented and intended for a medium where there was some packet loss, but where it was normally a rare occurrence.  It doesn't do well with loss rates above a few percent. Unfortunately, poor WiFi connectivity can easily have loss rates well above that.  To compensate, wireless communications (and 802.11 in particular) have a local retransmission scheme that gives a very low loss rate in the face of most conditions.  Unfortunately, that retransmission scheme is also very expensive. It's really unfortunate that there wasn't a middle ground that worked better for both.    Embed Quote
