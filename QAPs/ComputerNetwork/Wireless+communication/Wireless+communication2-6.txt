★What are low-cost ways to implement wireless communication in embedded systems?
As with any embedded project, you'll have to evaluate tradeoffs among power, performance, form factor, and cost.  That being said, Sparkfun and Adafruit both carry a selection of WiFi and ZigBee compatible shields for Arduino, in addition to helpful datasheets, code to get you started, and active communities that can answer your questions.    Embed Quote
