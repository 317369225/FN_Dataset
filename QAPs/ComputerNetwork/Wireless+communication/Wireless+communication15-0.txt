★Wireless Communication: Why does OFDM involve the FFT?
Lets start at the beginning. Focus on the expansion of OFDM. {Orthogonal Frequency}. {Division Multiplexing}. Data multiplexed over orthogonal frequencies. Lets assume you have a data stream @2 kbps. This means you have to send a bit every 0.5 ms. You modulate the amplitude of a sine wave with a period 0.5ms to transmit this data. This is single carrier AM system. Instead, what you could do is split your data in 2 data streams of 1 kbps each and transmit them in parallel (think of it as a serial -> parallel conversion). You do not want the data to get mixed up, so you use 2 orthogonal frequencies for each data stream Fig: Three orthogonal pulses carrying 3 data streams in "parallel". Note that the "final" pulse is the sum of all these 3 pulses, which is not shown here (unfortunately) Not all frequencies are orthogonal though. For n frequencies to be orthogonal to each other, they must have exactly an integral number of cycles in a symbol time. So, you could transmit data streams 1 and 2 as: stream1 = (data1)*sin(...*f*t...) stream2 = (data2)*sin(...*2f*t...) transmit = stream1 + stream2 Incidentally, "transmit" exactly turns out to be the 2-point IFFT of (data1, data2)!! You use IFFT as a handy tool to multiplex data streams onto orthogonal subcarriers. At the receiver, you need to de-multiplex this data (parallel -> serial) to a single stream. Naturally, you do a FFT. OFDM converts a single carrier system to n-carrier one. The advantage is that data rate of each subcarrier is 1/n of total data rate, which expands symbol time by a factor of n. We love large symbol time as it makes the system robust against intersymbol interference (ISI). Tradeoff is the increased bandwidth compared to a single carrier system. We have found that in usual scenarios, OFDM leads to an increase in bandwidth efficiency.    Embed Quote
