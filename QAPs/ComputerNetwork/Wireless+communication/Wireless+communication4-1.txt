★Is wireless communication through a biological interface possible?Is it possible to generate varying current inside a fully functional brain to produce EM waves?
Theoretically, biology currently uses wireless communication in the form of chemicals.  Cells transmit and receive molecular information via neurotransmitters, hormones, etc., that trigger specific responses.  This is by definition a wireless communication system. One could transmit chemical information over long distances as pheromones are, for instance, and convert the chemical signals to electrical information if needed.    Embed Quote
