★What is the best solution for electricity and wireless communication in African countries?
As Don Onwunu mentions, existing technologies meet needs in developing countries pretty well. Cell phones are affordable and useful for communication, banking and information sharing. This article from All Africa has interesting information about cellular penetration rates: http://allafrica.com/stories/201... Note that cellular penetration is as high as 50% in Kenya. There's no need for specifically new technology here, although affordable and portable ways to charge the phones would be useful. At this point, people who live in villages without electricity charge their phones with diesel generators or by taking their phone to be charged in the nearest town with electricity every week or two. This limits the usefulness of cell phones for commerce. Micro-entrepreneurs with solar chargers could have an opportunity to travel through small villages to provide convenient and affordable charging services. As to electricity, local micro networks based on solar generation are viable. Schools, hospitals and other institutions  are already creating their own solar generation systems in off-grid areas. Here again, existing technology meets the need, but more rugged, affordable and portable solar panels would be useful. Small (even tiny) dams are another viable source of off-grid electricity generation.    Embed Quote
