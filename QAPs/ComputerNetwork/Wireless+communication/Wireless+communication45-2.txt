★How important was Claude Shannon's "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" article to the fields of information theory, encoding, wireless communication, and compression?
Tellingly in the intervening year between the publishing of his original paper by Bell Labs and it's republication as a book the title was actually (and rightly) changed from "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" to "The Mathematical Theory of Communication." Because of his work in this paper and his MIT Masters Thesis which essentially expanded George Boole's work in mathematical logic into what we now know as digital logic that powers all the world's electronics, he's often considered the father of the digital age.    Embed Quote
