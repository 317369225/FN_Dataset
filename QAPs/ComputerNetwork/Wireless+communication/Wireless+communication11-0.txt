Full duplex (like KUMU) Disttributed MIMO and similar (like pCELL Is pCell, from Artemis, really "the Holy Grail of wireless networking"?) Cloud RAN Non-othorgonal frequency modulation Very efficient PAs (eg ET) Then around IoT Very low power Very scalable ultra low data rate / ultra low range wireless Cognitive Radio Spectrum sharing Zahid Ghadialy has a good blog 3G and 4G Wireless Resources, Tutorials and FAQs that touches on many of these    Embed Quote
