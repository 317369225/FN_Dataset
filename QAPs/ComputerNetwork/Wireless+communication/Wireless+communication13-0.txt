★What's the Viterbi algorithm, and how is it applied to CDMA/3G/4G wireless communications?I know it has something to do with hidden markov models, and Andrew Viterbi was a cofounder of Qualcomm, but can someone explain the algorithm in plain english? And is it what makes CDMA-like digital communications possible?
Adding to Jesse/Sridhar's answer, and looking up the CDMA applications in particular, it looks like Viterbi is an especially efficient algorithm in order to somewhat-robustly send transmissions over noisy channels--essentially, a useful type of error-correcting convolutional code. No communication channel is perfect, and so every standardized form of electronic communication has some kind of way of detecting and resolving errors in the messages that come from that channel. There is actually a way to calculate how much 'clear' information you can send over a 'noisy' channel (the Shannon limit on channel capacity). Because different applications will have varying computational power available to them (from your cell phone to your network card, etc) as well as different profiles of channel 'noise', there are specialized algorithms for each context. What Jesse says about trellis diagrams is especially relevant here: when a physical object receives the (possibly noisy) communication, it can determine whether the communication was corrupted in some way by seeing whether the output sequence is even possible in the convolutional encoding scheme. It can then use the Viterbi algorithm to solve quickly from the encoded channel signal back to the decoded original signal, looking for the 'closest' (in the maximum likelihood sense) valid communication that could have been sent. For certain applications (short constraint codes, and the availability of parallel hardware), Viterbi is the cheapest/fastest solution.
