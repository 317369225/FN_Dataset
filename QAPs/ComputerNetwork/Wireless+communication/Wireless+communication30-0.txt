★Which are the best encryption algorithms used nowadays in network security for wireless communication?
Not too much new in Wi-Fi security. It's still the WPA2 using AES, or if you set it you could go for the older WPA+TKIP (just stay away from WEP). You may also find some EAP extensions as they've been accepted into the Wi-Fi standards in 2010. These of course are only concerned with access restrictions. For network-wide encryption on larger networks you'd usually have something like a Cisco SACS / Microsoft IAS / etc. server to handle access control (instead of stuff like pass keys on WPA/2). But still that's only applying access control - the data sent across the network (wired / wifi) is still unencrypted (or at best mildly encrypted). If you're referring to the end-to-end encryption, that's usually not part of the actual wireless hardware. It's mainly implemented on the application layer instead - in which case any encryption might be used. That depends on the software, e.g. the encryption between the web server and your browser when viewing https pages.    Embed Quote
