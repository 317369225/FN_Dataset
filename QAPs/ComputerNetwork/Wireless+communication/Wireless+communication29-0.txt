★Today's wireless communication is primarily using electro-magnetic waves. What's beyond using light in future?
Molecular nano communication networks is one. Here information transmission/reception occurs via molecular propagation. However, tools from nanotechnology will need to mature to manufacture such nano devices at low cost. [Pic courtesy MoNaCo: Molecular]    Embed Quote
