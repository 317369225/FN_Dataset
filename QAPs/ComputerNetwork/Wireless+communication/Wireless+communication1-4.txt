★Wireless Communication: What is the difference between TDD  and FDD?
Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) and Time Division Duplex (TDD) are the two most prevalent duplexing schemes used in fixed broadband wireless networks. FDD, which historically has been used in voice-only applications, supports two-way radio communication by using two distinct radio channels. Alternatively, TDD uses a single frequency to transmit signals in both the downstream and upstream directions. In fixed wireless point-to-point systems that use FDD, one frequency channel is transmitted downstream from a radio A to radio B. A second frequency is used in the upstream direction and supports transmission from radio B to radio A. In fixed wireless point-to-point systems that use TDD, a single frequency channel is used to transmit signals in  both the downstream and upstream directions. In TDD, both the transmitter and receiver operate on the same frequency but at different times. Therefore, TDD systems reuse the filters, mixers, frequency sources and synthesizers, thereby eliminating the complexity and costs associated with isolating the transmit antenna and the receive antenna. An FDD system uses a duplexer and/or two antennas that require spatial separation and,  therefore, cannot reuse the resources. The result is more costly hardware. TDD utilizes the spectrum more efficiently than FDD. FDD cannot be used in environments where the service provider does not have enough bandwidth to provide the required guardband between transmit and receive channels. TDD is more flexible than FDD in meeting the need to dynamically reconfigure the allocated upstream and downstream bandwidth in response to customer needs.
