★Wireless Communication: What causes bathrooms to usually have poor cellular and WiFi signal?
1. Bathrooms are usually enclosed by walls which cause attenuation. Rooms, on the other hand, have windows which allow cellular/wifi signal to enter and propagate more easily 2. Bathrooms might have metal sheet on the door to prevent its wood from getting soaked. This reflects away most of the RF signal 3. There is a network of pipes which impedes signal and creates multipath 4. Water (and moisture) absorbs radio signal at higher frequencies. This is why microwave ovens operate at ~2.4GHz, which incidentally is the same as WiFi    Embed Quote
