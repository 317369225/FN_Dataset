★What is the best solution for electricity and wireless communication in African countries?
Maybe the question should be rephrased - Africa is not a country, so every country within it should be treated on a case by case basis - this does mean letting go of the one-size-fits-all approach. No one lumps Greece and Germany together as having the same problems, therefore no one should class Liberia and Ghana together - two countries within Sub-Saharan Africa yet with very different levels of Electricity and Communications infrastructure. Ignoring my own advice - for those African countries with good levels of Governance and low debt - the answer really lies somewhere between attaining progressive leadership and an ability to raise 'good cheap' capital, honest capital inflows (without conditions) and an infrastructure capable of channelling those capital to the right places, and of course an indigenous professional workforce you can employ to maintain and engineer these projects. Unfortunately most fail at the first hurdle! African countries do not need special technologies - those already exist and more are being worked on everyday, one of major problems is poor leadership and institutional corruption.    Embed Quote
