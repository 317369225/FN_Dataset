★Is there any form of wireless communication technology that cannot be intercepted or jammed?
You cannot completely prevent interception, as for that you'd have to control the airspace between transmitter and receiver completely. Even worse, for normal radio communication (including Wifi) the antenna transmits 360 degrees around you... You can lower the risk of interception by sticking to frequencies that only work on your line-of-sight and use highly directional antennas - but even then, somebody could put an antenna directly into your radio beam (or even BEHIND your antenna) to intercept the message. Optical transmission by Laser also is an option, of course - but technically that only means the beam is narrower - it's NOT the same width on the receiving end as it is on the sending side, over distance it WILL grow wider forming a narrow cone, which then can be intercepted again with a receiver small enough that doesn't block the whole beam but only portions of it (or simply retransmits it). As for 'scrambling' that usually means encrypting your traffic - I suppse you mean jamming the signal so that it gets lost? That's going to be tricky, you'd need to look into frequency hopping, wide-spectrum transmissions etc. to make it as difficult as possible to drown out your signal by a more powerfull noise source.    Embed Quote
