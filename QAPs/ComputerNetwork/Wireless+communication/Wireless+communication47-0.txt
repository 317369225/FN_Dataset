★What are some of the fascinating open problems in wireless communication and networking as of now?
I'm just writing a blog on some of these ideas - many of which will feed into 5G.

New error correcting codes Increasing frequency (28GHz, 70GHz, etc) Better ways of linking IP to wireless (current systems are not optimised)    Embed Quote
