★Which is best online course for wireless communication(Something like Coursera or edX)?
Wireless Communication by Prof Ranjan Bose on NPTEL (http://nptel.iitm.ac.in/video.php?subjectId=117102062) I haven't taken any Wireless Communication course before.But have attended his Image Processing class at IIT Delhi.  He makes sure that fundamentals gets clear and leaves no loose ends to ensure that. He then gradually adapts the students to face tougher and bigger challenges by applying concepts from the shear basics. His strategy is to make you love the subject and not just understand it.    Embed Quote
