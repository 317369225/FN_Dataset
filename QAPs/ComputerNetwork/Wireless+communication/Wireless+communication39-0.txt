★What are the best wireless communications technology certificates for an engineer?
If you are looking for certifications in the field of Networking, then Cisco certifications are valuable. CCNA, CCNP and few others depending upon the level you are looking for. I also posted a question on the similar lines and waiting for responses. Is Wireless Certification Exam (WCET) conducted by IEEE worth it ? Does it add value to profile?    Embed Quote
