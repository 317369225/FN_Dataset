★What is the most interesting way of studying wireless communication?I am trying to study the subject from "Wireless Communications: Principles and Practice By Rappaport". But the book seems to be like a history book. It is causing me to loose interest in the subject. How can I conjure up interest in the subject? Like, is there some hands on that can be done in any practical project, or is there any book which is more engaging and interesting?
I'd think much the same as any other: try a MOOC on Coursera or TedX I don't know why classes or teachers are especially good, but there'll be reviews If you want hands on, then there are a lot of SDR kits - many of which are based on Arduino or Raspberry Pi    Embed Quote
