★Wireless Communication: What are the legal 2-way radios in India which can be used without a license?I have found some good walkie talkies and 2-way radios online stores, but not sure if I can use them with out a license. Here are some of them. TriSquare TSX100R-2VP, Cobra  CX110 FRS/GMRS 2-Way Radio,Royal 29233U 22-Channel FRS Two-Way Radio Wristwatch, Midland GXT1000vp4 etc.
The Two-Way Radios - Motorola Solutions India page suggests the existence of 10km two-way unlicensed radio in the MOTOTRBO line.  See:  MOTOTRBO- Walkie-Talkie. It looks like FRS and GMRS radios are not legal in India.    Embed Quote
