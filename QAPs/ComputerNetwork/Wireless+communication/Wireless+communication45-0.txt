★How important was Claude Shannon's "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" article to the fields of information theory, encoding, wireless communication, and compression?
AFAIK, most people believe Shannon's work to be definitive. That is, he's one of those rare people who opened and closed a field simultaneously. The only serious stab at generalizing Shannon's work that I'm aware of is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qua.... If we eventually have quantum computing of arbitrary scope, it seems to me that then, and only then, will we have surpassed Shannon's accomplishments.    Embed Quote
