★What's the Viterbi algorithm, and how is it applied to CDMA/3G/4G wireless communications?I know it has something to do with hidden markov models, and Andrew Viterbi was a cofounder of Qualcomm, but can someone explain the algorithm in plain english? And is it what makes CDMA-like digital communications possible?
I learned about HMMs and the Viterbi algorithm in the context of statistical NLP, so I can't answer the second half of your question. The Viterbi Algorithm answers this question: given a sequence of outputs from a Hidden Markov Model, what was the most likely sequence of state transitions? Because the state transitions (though unobserved) obey the Markov property, we can use a trellis plus dynamic programming to store the relevant probabilities and then back-track through the trellis to calculate the most likely sequence. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tre... In statistical NLP one use of this algorithm is in part of speech tagging, where the observations are the words as spoken and the states are the underlying parts of speech, e.g., noun, verb, adjective, etc.    Embed Quote
