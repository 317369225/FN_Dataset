★What are low-cost ways to implement wireless communication in embedded systems?
For mesh networking, use XBee modules ($20-40).  XBees connect to a UART (or SPI if you get the SMD version), and act either as a transparent serial connection, or you can use the XBee protocol which gives you more options. Alternatively there's Ciseco who do various modules also capable of mesh networking, which are lower cost than XBees. For bluetooth, you can get a cheap bluetooth module (<$15) from ebay .  Low cost bluetooth modules typicall use a UART, and would act as a serial port. For WiFi, you can get a low cost CC3000-based module on ebay: CC3000 Wifi Module  there are others modules if you search for "wifi module" or similar, typically you're looking at about $35-45 Again, these are generally UART, but you may have to deal with configuring the device. For regular low-cost point-to-point, you can pick up seriously cheap modules from ebay: rf module | eBay these are pretty basic in terms of feature and performance, but you're looking at <$5 in cost. Plenty of options, look around, check places that sell hobby parts like SparkFun Electronics and Adafruit Industries    Embed Quote
