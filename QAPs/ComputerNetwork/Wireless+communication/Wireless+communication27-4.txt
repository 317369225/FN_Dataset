★Is it true that Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower and his plans to build such "magnifying transmitter" towers at other places would have peppered the globe with free electricity and wireless communication as early as the 1920s?
As others explained, no. Tesla's one great set of inventions was poliphase alternating current system making *wired* long distance power transmission feasible. His wireless communication inventions were groundbreaking, but far from practical - it took Marconi's refinemets to make radio actually useful. As for Jovanka Broz being his relative, well, in tiny and sparsely populated Lika almost everyone is related to everyone else :o)    Embed Quote
