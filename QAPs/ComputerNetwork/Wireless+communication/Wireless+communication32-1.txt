★Wireless Communication: What are the legal 2-way radios in India which can be used without a license?I have found some good walkie talkies and 2-way radios online stores, but not sure if I can use them with out a license. Here are some of them. TriSquare TSX100R-2VP, Cobra  CX110 FRS/GMRS 2-Way Radio,Royal 29233U 22-Channel FRS Two-Way Radio Wristwatch, Midland GXT1000vp4 etc.
It looks like CB radio is your best bet, there are fixed base stations, handheld and vehicle radios available. India has particular allocations and frequency use in CB so it is worth studying further. But that should be legal and not get anyone into trouble.    Embed Quote
