★What are some good companies involved in research and development in wireless communications?
Qualcomm is supposed to be one of the world leaders in wireless. They have a lot of patents in OFDM, which is the air-interface standard for LTE/LTE-A downlink. Alcatel-Lucent (formerly Bell labs) is another great company which does a lot of niche work in wireless. Their R&D group is particularly strong and has housed some of the best brains in the wireless research community (it still does). I think it is safe to say that Bell labs has revolutionized the wireless industry in a profound manner. Also, every mobile phone manufacturer would have a small R&D team. Samsung, particularly, is pushing hard to be on top of this space... not just in the cellular phone sector, but also in the indoor high-speed wireless communications sector (for streaming HD video from set top box to TV, laptop to TV, etc). I heard that off late, they've been hiring a lot of PhDs for high-end research.    Embed Quote
