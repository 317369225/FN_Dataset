★What are the physical layer issues in wireless communications?What are some of the physical layer issues that are taken in to consideration when comparing the benefits of different wireless communication techniques?
Spectral efficiency or bits/sec/Hz is of one main physical layer consideration that motivated the transition from 1g to 4g.the fading state of the channel also decides the received snr and hence the bit error rate leading to a certain choice of source- channel coding strategy for guaranteeing a certain QoS(quality of service). Eg amr is one standard for switching coding strategy based on snr for voice data in mobiles.the advent of mimo technology has opened gates to unlimited spectral efficiency at very low powers, with large number of antennae. The problem is how to accommodate large number of antennas on ever decreasing mobiles sizes with very less coefficient of correlation among them.the complexity of detection strategy at the receiver is also of concern. Interference management is also of new concern. The impact of these questions are researched in spacetime coding/ precoding , mac cross layer protocols,cognitive radios research, information theory etc.    Embed Quote
