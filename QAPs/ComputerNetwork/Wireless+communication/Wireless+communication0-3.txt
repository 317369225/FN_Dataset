★What are the limitations of TCP/IP to handle wireless communication?
Packet loss rate is the most significant impact. TCP will downgrade dramatically when loss rate increase. Based on my previous test, TCP performance would drop from 100Mbps to 10Mbps at 1% loss. In wireless environment, packets loss always happen, especially when there are obstacles or wireless signal pollution happens.    Embed Quote
