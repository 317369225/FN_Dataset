★Wireless Communication: What are the main differences between RF and audio as transmission media?With audio, the medium is matter, and with RF, the medium is electromagnetic waves. How does this affect diffusion, reflection, attenuation, frequency response... How do things like humidity and temperature make audio different from RF?
The length of the antenna used is directly proportional to the wavelength. Since for audio, the wavelength is more, the antenna length will be so big as to be inconvenient. Modulate over a high frequency, the length of the antenna becomes so small and handy.    Embed Quote
