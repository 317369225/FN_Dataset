★How do I prepare myself for graduate school for an MS in wireless communications?I have been accepted into a top university in Canada with a Research Assistantship and have around 2 months of free time. What are the basics or things that I should master?
Sit back.relax.spend enough time with family and friends.You will have enough time to prepare once you start.Go with an open mind,once the course starts you can put all the work into it.    Embed Quote
