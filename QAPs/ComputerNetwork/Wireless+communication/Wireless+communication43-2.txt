★Can wireless communication be done under water? If not, how do submarines communicate with the outside world?
They use an ELF or VLF radio using a towed array.  wich can penetrate water. There is also a cool comms method called quantum key distribution for sub to aircraft comms. This method used light.  I know this is out of scope for this question. I just thought I would throw that out there. Subs also raise antennas from the mast while submerged. Unfortunately, this is how they are spotted by P3's who call out a feather in the water. Then a destroyer shoots an ASROC and its all over. It's healthier for bubbleheads to just stay submerged, and keep quiet...that's where we like them.    Embed Quote
