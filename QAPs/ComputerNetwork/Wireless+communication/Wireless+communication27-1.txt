★Is it true that Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower and his plans to build such "magnifying transmitter" towers at other places would have peppered the globe with free electricity and wireless communication as early as the 1920s?
Not at all. My great great grandfather Leonard E Curtis was Tesla's friend, patent attorney, and a partner at Colorado Springs Power Company.     Curtis persuaded Tesla to come to Colorado where he built the tower. Far from being free, the tower consumed so much electricity it blew the generator in Colorado Springs. Broadcasting electric power through the air was simply wasteful and impractical.  The myth that greedy industrialists suppressed this idea needs to die : it's bad history and bad science.    Embed Quote
