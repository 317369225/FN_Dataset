★What are the physical layer issues in wireless communications?What are some of the physical layer issues that are taken in to consideration when comparing the benefits of different wireless communication techniques?
Here's a (short) list of problems encountered during wireless signal transmission: 1. Channel: What is the impact of channel on phase/amplitude of received signal? How does it vary with time? Does the channel have many interfering objects? At what speeds are the interfering objects/receiver moving? 2. Antenna Processing: How much signal power does the receiver need to detect it correctly? In which direction does the signal have maximum strength? Can we exploit multiple signal receptions to to increase data rate? This motivated beamforming, spatial diversity, space time coding etc 3. Radio Access: How many users are going to use the channel simultaneously? What is the optimum interference level to maximize system throughput? GSM/CDMA/OFDMA differ fundamentally in these aspects. 3. Modulation: How much out-of band radiation can we tolerate? What is the signal to noise ratio at the receiver? Are the tx-rx synchronous? This motivates the pulse shape and duration, and the amount of information that can be crammed onto a modulated signal. 4. Channel coding: What is the SNR at the receiver? What is the kind of fading that occurs in the channel? How much computational complexity can the receiver handle? Add controlled redundancy so that bits received in error can be corrected at the receiver. 5. Equalization: What is the maximum intersymbol interference (ISI) at the receiver? How much complexity can the receiver handle? Reduce ISI to improve overall decision making and this the bit error rate at the receiver.    Embed Quote
