★Has there been a breakthrough in wireless communication?
In my view, the next big boost in capacity will come from muti-user MIMO (MU-MIMO).  There are already very premitive forms of MU-MIMO implemented in LTE and 802.11ac.  LTE-advanced started a more elaborate form CoMP.  However, there are still a lot to be done. Unlike past breakthroughs (e.g., MIMO), this will not be PHY alone.  It requires innovation in all layers (at least from PHY to network), in order to coordinate transmission and control interference.  So I think it will take many years of research to accomplish its potential.    Embed Quote
