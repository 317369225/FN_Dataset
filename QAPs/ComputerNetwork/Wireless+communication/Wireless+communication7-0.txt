★What are the good wireless communication companies in India?
My dear friend, It is a pity that there are not many MNC's / companies are doing good work in  R&D and developing Products in India. Most of them are in services and support arena ( testing, deployment and maintenance). Engineers who are really interested in this area have to join some of the public sector companies like ISRO, BEL, CDOT , CDAC etc wherein there are good opportunities to apply their knowledge and skills. ( I passed out in 1984 and was an R&D engineer at BEL for 8 years, That was the best period in my career, worked very hard, did not make much money , but enjoyed creating wonderful products for Indian Navy ) Another option is to pursue  doctoral  research in good foreign  universities and try to get in product development companies in the US. All the best  for a wonderful career ahead    Embed Quote
