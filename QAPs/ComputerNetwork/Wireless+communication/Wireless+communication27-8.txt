★Is it true that Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower and his plans to build such "magnifying transmitter" towers at other places would have peppered the globe with free electricity and wireless communication as early as the 1920s?
Three years ago I shot a short film around this topic. From my research I was put under the impression that the tower was the height necessary for it to be in tune with the earth's vibrations. The resonant frequencies vibrated some part of the tower, which is what supposedly generated the electricity. It allegedly was very poor at transmitting electricity through the air (inverse square law and all that), but some claimed it did a very good job at doing so through the ground, which I never really understood (or, well, believed). It always struck me as a neat idea, though. But as I'm reading these comments/answers it seems what I once thought is now inaccurate, and it's a good shock to the head. Thankfully the film was only concerned with Tesla's crazier days, holed up in the NYH (almost shot in his room!), so I suppose it hardly matters. Never did finish that movie.    Embed Quote
