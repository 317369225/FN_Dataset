★What are the differences between satellite-based and terrestrial wireless communications?
Here are some major differences. Some areas on earth are not covered by terrestrial wireless due to economical reasons. Satellite systems cover almost entire globe. Terrestrial wireless communication has delay that is not noticeable, whereas in satellite communication using geostationary satellites, at an altitude of 36000 km,  the users experience a quarter of a second delay. Due to the large delay, users can hear their echo after half a second if no devices such as echo canceller are employed. Setting up communication services in new places lot easier in satellite system than in terrestrial systems.    Embed Quote
