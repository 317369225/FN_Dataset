★Is it true that Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower and his plans to build such "magnifying transmitter" towers at other places would have peppered the globe with free electricity and wireless communication as early as the 1920s?
I recommend reading this article: The Cult of Nikola Tesla In short, it explains that (a) Tesla was a genius inventor; but (b) for some reason, he's also got a bunch of crazy fans who credit him for inventing just about anything and everything, much of which was suppressed by evil forces. It's a shame, IMO -- the man should be remembered for the genius he actually was, not for the genius these fanatics claim he was.    Embed Quote
