★Can wireless communication be done under water? If not, how do submarines communicate with the outside world?
There are VLF stations around the world that transmit at frequencies like 24 KHz, at low data rates. The ones at Cutler, Maine and Jim Creek, Washington, transmit a million watts or so into antennas strung between mountaintops. So, you need lots of power, huge antennas, and very low frequencies to penetrate a little ways into salt water.    Embed Quote
