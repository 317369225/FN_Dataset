★What is the most interesting way of studying wireless communication?I am trying to study the subject from "Wireless Communications: Principles and Practice By Rappaport". But the book seems to be like a history book. It is causing me to loose interest in the subject. How can I conjure up interest in the subject? Like, is there some hands on that can be done in any practical project, or is there any book which is more engaging and interesting?
Can you handle decent math? If yes, pick up Pramod Vishwanath and David Tse's book. If not, and you are still building intuition, head to Complex To Real and complete all the tutorials.  One other way is to use test-benches to actually building the entire Data source-Mod-Tx-Rx-Demod-Data Sink  chain. If you don't have access to one, try doing the same in Simulink/MATLAB/Octave. The Mathworks community has a whole bunch of freely available code-base which allows for some serious hacking and improvements to the extent of churning out a national conf level paper. If all else fails, may be Wireless ain't your thing. Its not the end of the world. Move on.    Embed Quote
