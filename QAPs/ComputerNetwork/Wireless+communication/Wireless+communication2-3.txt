★What are low-cost ways to implement wireless communication in embedded systems?
Dude, if you really want to go low-budget, use IRDA.  How does pennies per endpoint sound?  Lowest-cost (and lowest power) RF solution would be the TI CC11xx sub-GHz modules, or if you want really cheap, (echoing Mr. Gao) use the Holtek-based modules. It all depends on your volume. If you're building just a single pair of devices, you're better off getting a pair of plug-n-play transceivers. If you're doing volume, and can code (or know someone who can), work up your own out of bare radios.    Embed Quote
