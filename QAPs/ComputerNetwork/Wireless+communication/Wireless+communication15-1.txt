★Wireless Communication: Why does OFDM involve the FFT?
The magic is actually in the application of the IFFT (in the transmitter) and the FFT in the receiver. Assume you have 64 individual channels you would like to transmit over a wireless (or wireline for this matter) link. You can have the channel time multiplexed, which means that you'd have one and only one channel transmitted at a time. This is what is referred as TDM systems. You could also apply a certain set of magic codes to the individual channels, thereby allowing you to add them all up, transmit them simultaneously and still be able to separate them (demodulate) at the receiver. This is what is referred as a CDMA system. In the case of an FDM system (OFDM being one of them), you regard every one of the channels as begin carried on a different carrier frequency. This is just another trick of allowing the channels to be simultaneously transmitted without interfering with each other. Using an IFFT at the transmitter does just that - it takes multiple independent streams and regards them as being on a different frequency bin. The IFFT does the magic of placing each stream on its respective carrier and then combines the signals together. The transmitter then transmits the combined set of modulated channels. The frequency separation makes the channels orthogonal which is another way of saying that they do not interfere with each other even though they are combined together: So the transmitted signal has all channels magically combined  together thanks to the magical property of the IFFT that it separates the streams orthogonaly to different carrier frequencies. The receiver does the opposite. It takes the combined stream and using the FFT function "plots" a spectrum of the transmitted signal. But the spectrum bins actually correspond the individual channels transmitted. Magic !!    Embed Quote
