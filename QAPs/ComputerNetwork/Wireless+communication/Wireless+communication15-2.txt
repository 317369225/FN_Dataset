★Wireless Communication: Why does OFDM involve the FFT?
Not sure I follow the Q. Fourier Transform changes time domain into frequency domain. Inverse does the reverse. So you have multiple "slow" channels in frequency domain (subcarriers) and you transform that into one long signal. I explicitly said FT. Fast Fourier makes that easier by requiring 2^n subcarriers (ADSL has 1024 iirc, WiMAX 16d used 256, 16 used 64/128/512, WiFi uses... - you get the idea) LTE actually doesn't use FFT, as they didn't want the 2^n restriction so it ises DFT. But you say "I find this confusing, as the FFT seems like a coarse tool which would severely limit the data rate because of the large number of samples required to do an FFT." a) FFT is not a coarse tool. It converts from one domain to another. How coarse it is depends on how accuraely you do it (bit resolution, sampling rate) which is prety determined by the specs of the standard, but there is nothing "coarse" as such. You could use different tools (and sometimes people will do) but they will use similar numbers of samples. b) The number of samples is defined by the data rate (Nyquist etc) not FFT itself. The number of samples to do 5MHz CDMA will not be very different to do 5MHz LTE: in both cases you must digitize a 5MHz channel with enough oversampling and enough bits resolution. (OK, that is an oveersimplification, but handwavingly it is close enough)    Embed Quote
