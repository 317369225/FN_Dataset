★What are the types of antennas used in wireless communication?
There are plenty of antennas in use. It's not that simple to divide them to groups based on just one criteria. I've found this page List of Antennas (Antenna Types). It's worth to go through the page. You can see that the very basic dipole antenna has quite a few subtypes and the same is true for other types. For example the reflector type looks in general the same, but the emitter/feed antenna can by of more then one types. One can say that anything conductive is an antenna, the only question is how good one.    Embed Quote
