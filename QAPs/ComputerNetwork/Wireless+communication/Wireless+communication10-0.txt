★Is machine learning useful in wireless communications?I was going through the machine learning course website at Stanford by Prof Andrew Ng and found it to be interesting. Should I take this course? I am going for my MS in wireless communications this fall.
Machine Learning is kind of hot topic right now. But if you see beyond the buzz I think there is lot of ML applications especially in WSN domain. I was going through this survey paper titled A survey of Machine Learning in Wireless Sensor Networking, and I think there are some really good use cases people are applying these techniques. Having these ML skills in your belt will not harm you but rather expand your horizon.    Embed Quote
