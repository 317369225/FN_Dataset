★Is it true that Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower and his plans to build such "magnifying transmitter" towers at other places would have peppered the globe with free electricity and wireless communication as early as the 1920s?
No, Tesla may have taken too many shocks to the head. Radio waves go off in all directions.  If you're just a kilometer away from the tower you can only catch 1 part in 12 million of its output per square meter of antenna.  That's basic geometry, which neither Tesla nor anybody else since then has been able to overcome.  Well, to a small extent, you can with carefully designed antennas focus the energy a little bit better, but that still is horribly inefficient if you want to convey more than a watt of power per $100K of equipment.    Embed Quote
