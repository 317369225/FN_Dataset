★What are the hot research topics in wireless communications in demand by top R&D companies like Qualcomm?I am planning to go to graduate school for my masters(thesis-based) in wireless communications. I want to work in R&D companies like Qualcomm after my masters. What are the research topics can I concentrate on for my thesis?
I am a poor choice for answers to this question, having no formal credentials in communications, but I received a request for an answer so here goes ... Caveat Emptor. After ten years away from the field, I am unlikely to give you any apropos leads to a currently useful topic.  With that in mind, here are my off the cuff thoughts: >> for my old ears, the current vocoder technology makes typical conversations over cell phones unpleasant.  Just do a POTS phone to POTS phone call and you'll see (actually hear) what I mean.  Better vocoder adaptive algorithms may help here.  If nothing else, the softening of plosives makes it hard for old ears to understand voice.  Maybe you can look at the old Globalstar vocoder and see what was done there; that vocoder was significantly better than the then deployed vocoder on cell systems. >> I always have been impressed with FEC.  I saw in Jacobs' and Wozencraft's book a sequential decoder (if I recall correctly) and I played around a bit doing an implementation (for fun).  Back then, compute power for a sequential decoder was a problem and I never heard of a real implementation.  Maybe a good study and consequent implementation would prove instructive as we as useful    Embed Quote
