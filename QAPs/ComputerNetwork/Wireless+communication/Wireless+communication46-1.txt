★Wireless Communication: What are the main differences between RF and audio as transmission media?With audio, the medium is matter, and with RF, the medium is electromagnetic waves. How does this affect diffusion, reflection, attenuation, frequency response... How do things like humidity and temperature make audio different from RF?
Audio is baseband signal that requires no processing for comprehension. You hear with your ears. (Presuming transmission in air). RF is a modulated electromagnetic signal. You'll need a compatible receiver designed for the particular type  of modulation. That's a radio, with speakers. Tune in and enjoy.    Embed Quote
