★How do I generate a setup key for my endpoint on my cluster via the Globus command line interface so that I can use Globus to transfer a file?
If you're installing a multi-user endpoint on your cluster then you should use Globus Connect Server which does not require a setup key. See this link for information on Installing Globus Connect Server. You only require a setup key if you're trying to install a Globus Connect Personal endpoint. In this case you would run the following command: endpoint-add <endpoint_name> --gc where <endpoint_name> is a string of your choice to identify the endpoint. You should see something like: Created the Globus Connect Personal endpoint 'globus_username#endpoint_name'. Use this setup key when installing Globus Connect Personal:     6f647df4-6068-4c59-8934-4fc56771dc46 You may then copy and paste the setup key during installation of Globus Connect Personal.
