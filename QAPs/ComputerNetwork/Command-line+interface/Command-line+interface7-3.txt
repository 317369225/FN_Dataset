â˜…Are there any command line Linux distributions similar to GRML? i.e. truly dedicated to the command line interface.I really loved how GRML was a real hackers OS, running ZSH for the shell, packed with nifty shell programs, optimized with multiple tty terminals, a streamlined Fluxbox GUI to drop into once in a while, and chock full of custom code and cool scripts. I don't like the recent update that ripped the heart right out of it. All the clutter and nifty things to discover are what made it interesting... :(
Fedora and Debian work just fine if you install them stripped-down, without any GUI stuff and just your shell of choice (such as zsh) and your command-line utilities. The main tricky part to do from the command line is WPA for wireless networking, but other than that, running with no X is pretty straightforward.
