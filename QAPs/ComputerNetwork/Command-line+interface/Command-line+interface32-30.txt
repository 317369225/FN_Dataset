â˜…Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
Sure do! I've been using Free Pascal on the command line. For small programs it's less hassle than an IDE. The command line is also useful for preprocessors like lex and yacc and other hinky build conditions. I'm not dissing IDEs by any means; an Xcode/Eclipse/Visual Studio project file is far less hassle than a makefile for a large project. However, each tool has its purpose.
