★Are there any command line Linux distributions similar to GRML? i.e. truly dedicated to the command line interface.I really loved how GRML was a real hackers OS, running ZSH for the shell, packed with nifty shell programs, optimized with multiple tty terminals, a streamlined Fluxbox GUI to drop into once in a while, and chock full of custom code and cool scripts. I don't like the recent update that ripped the heart right out of it. All the clutter and nifty things to discover are what made it interesting... :(
if you are running Arch-linux ; you get a grml like terminal by installing zsh and the grml-zsh-config ( from extra ) and of course install fluxbox or  awesome or the window manager of your choice ; works pretty neet  !
