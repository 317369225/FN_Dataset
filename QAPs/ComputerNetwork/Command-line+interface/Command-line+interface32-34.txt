â˜…Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
This is mostly a matter of preference. It is also sometimes a factor of the type of work you are doing. If your problem domain is for example is a limited group of API's being able to easily skip around files is not as important as it is with larger projects. Some people are able to remember the names of hundreds of classes and the methods inside them. I am basically lost without code complete. You can argue that in some cases the IDE is a crutch. in other cases where I have rename a method that is called in 1000 places being able to right click >refector> rename is very useful. What you have to learn about computer work is people pick the tools that are most useful to them. Not everyone does the same work, thus we do not all use the same tools.
