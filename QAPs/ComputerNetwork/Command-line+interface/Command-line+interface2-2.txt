â˜…What is the best way to familiarize yourself with CLI (command line interface)?Unix-like systems come with many good command line interface tools, like brew, apt, vagrant, ansible, etc. I just wondering, when you come across a new CLI tool, is there some common practices that you can follow to quickly grasp that tool?
If that tool offers shell completion, take advantage of that to explore the various options Check the documentation - e.g. /usr/share/doc/PKGNAME/README and manpages The tool itself might have an easy way to trigger topic-specific help -- normally either tool option --help or [code>tool help option[/code] Practice, practice, practice! And Google for examples of people using the tool to achieve the task you're trying to get done.
