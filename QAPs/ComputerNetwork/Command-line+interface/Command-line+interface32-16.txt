â˜…Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
Sometimes you're asked to change code on a server, especially if you're doing web development. System administrators do that too sometimes. In college, we were given accounts on a school server and our code had to run on it. We had an IBM aix machine and a GNU/Linux server to test on. It would have been a pain to setup a duplicate development environment.
