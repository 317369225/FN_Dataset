â˜…Are there any command line Linux distributions similar to GRML? i.e. truly dedicated to the command line interface.I really loved how GRML was a real hackers OS, running ZSH for the shell, packed with nifty shell programs, optimized with multiple tty terminals, a streamlined Fluxbox GUI to drop into once in a while, and chock full of custom code and cool scripts. I don't like the recent update that ripped the heart right out of it. All the clutter and nifty things to discover are what made it interesting... :(
Gentoo Linux, you compile before you install ;) So you can strip down all the features you don't like. For example, I compile emacs without X windows support. because I only use CLI emacs. I checked GRML, it's debian based distribution, that's good because its package manager is excellent. But real geeks like us don't want the convenience (or limitation) debian provided, we want to hack everything.
