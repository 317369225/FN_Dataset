â˜…Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
A typical scenario is that you'd be using an editor like vi through an ssh shell or using sublime text editor over an sftp connection. Then in other terminals you'd be running your compiler and debugging tools. C is still a very important and vital language but for new tasks you'd have to wonder whether it is the best tool. We've started to use node.js increasingly on the server to run server tasks where previously we used C. Why? It allows us to use a single language (javascript) and the same libraries and modules across platforms. It allows for asynchronous communication which is very helpful server-side. It has a vast number of wonderful npm modules, a very active community and is fully web enabled.
