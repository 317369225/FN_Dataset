â˜…How important is it to learn command line interfaces?I'm currently learning Python, is this something I should spend time learning, or just go straight to learning more Python?
Command-line interfaces are worth learning because they are the most efficient way to do the job for many tasks. In python, there is a very very good command-line interface called IPython, I highly recommend that you check it out.
