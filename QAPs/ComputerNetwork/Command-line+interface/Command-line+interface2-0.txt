â˜…What is the best way to familiarize yourself with CLI (command line interface)?Unix-like systems come with many good command line interface tools, like brew, apt, vagrant, ansible, etc. I just wondering, when you come across a new CLI tool, is there some common practices that you can follow to quickly grasp that tool?
Use it. Just try it out. I always have a "play" environment (whether it's a second computer, dual boot, VM, or second user account) where I can try out anything without disrupting my work environment. That being said, you will not get comfortable or remember something unless you use it frequently. I am constantly looking at man pages and other documentation for CLI tools I don't use frequently.
