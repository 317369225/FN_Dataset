â˜…Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
I work primarily on Java. I usually use Eclipse, but drop down to vi when: I just need to write a short piece of code. I need to patch some third party code and they are using a build system. I am patching my own code already deployed on a server and need SSH (not so good practice)
