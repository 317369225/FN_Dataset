â˜…What is the easiest command line interface library for Python 2.7?I am working on a small project and would like to make something like this: I want to create something like a GUI in a Command Line (TUI). Also, I am doing this in GNU/Linux (Ubuntu 13.04).
This Stack Overflow question (always the best place to go when you have a question like this - Python library for (n)curses widgets) suggests, in order of voted-up-ness: pyCDK - requires a couple other things be installed, including a C-based library Overview - Urwid 1.2.1 - pure Python, so it may be easier to install npyscreen - Python user interfaces without all that mucking about in hyperspace - Google Project Hosting (not on the Stack Overflow page, but came up high in a search, and looks pretty good).
