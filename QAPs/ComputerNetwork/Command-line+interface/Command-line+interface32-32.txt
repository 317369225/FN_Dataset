â˜…Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
I'm not badmouthing my hypervisor's UI.. but to be frank each operation (switching on, switching off etc.) on virtual machines takes us about 5-10s (A few maneuvers of clicking/selecting and finally some UI effects) on the browser. For people who work on OS code.. replacing the kernel and rebooting the system is a tiresome routine which has to be done more than 20-30 times a day. We'd want this process to be as fast as possible. On the console I zap the VM and turn it back on within in a second by looking back at my command history using VI mode on shell. (set -o vi) This is just an example.. there are lots of repetitive actions through which you could hack your productivity via command line as VI/Emacs mode makes such boring tasks easier to manage!
