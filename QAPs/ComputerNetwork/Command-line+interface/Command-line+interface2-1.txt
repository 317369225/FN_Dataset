★What is the best way to familiarize yourself with CLI (command line interface)?Unix-like systems come with many good command line interface tools, like brew, apt, vagrant, ansible, etc. I just wondering, when you come across a new CLI tool, is there some common practices that you can follow to quickly grasp that tool?
Your question is somewhat different in the details than in the heading.  The answer, of course, is to use it.  You'll become more comfortable with the CLI, in general, by using it frequently and extensively --- and forcing yourself to try more complicated procedures (using loops and conditionals rather than a series of repeated or variant commands). To familiarize yourself with a new command (CLI tool) you read its man page and/or FAQ and try several of its switches or subcommands. If you're particularly motivated, maintain an AWS account and when you need to familiarize yourself with a new tool spin up an EC2 instance, install the tool, play with it (possibly spinning up some additional instances for things like Ansible which only make sense in a network or cluster) and then, when you're comfortable, terminate the instances. Incidentally the AWS CLI (Python package written around the botocore subset of Boto) are a particularly gnarly set of command-line tools which are particular hard to master. (One complication is that you have to supply many arguments which, in turn, must be extracted from the results of previous commands.  So you end up directing the output from each command into some separate file and writing scripts to pull the specific arguments out of that file.  I've written a rather ugly little "extract from JSON" tool for doing this a little more precisely and succinctly than possible with grep. It's JimDennis/xj.py).
