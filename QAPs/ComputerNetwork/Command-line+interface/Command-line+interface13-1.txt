â˜…What are some ways I could allow users some command line interfacing with my website?I was thinking of actually interacting via a terminal, not a browser at all. Maybe allowing file transfer, data piping, etc.
It sounds like you are wanting to think about how to make a REST endpoint more amenable for terminal use, like encouraging people to use cURL or wget. Most browsers will tell you what a curl request for this website will look like. I think in the 'Timeline' or 'Network' feature of the developer console is a place to get those, depending on what browser you use. You may also wish to consider making your website render well in a text-based browser like 'links' or 'lynx' (I didn't name them!). Finally, in long-gone days, there were systems like Gopher (pre-http web) and Veronica (search engine for gopher). This is probably the least likely option.
