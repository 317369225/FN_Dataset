★Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
The command line is very lightweight.  When you compile from a command line, you are running only the compiler.  When compiling in an IDE you are running the compiler along with the interface and any tools running, this can make compilation of large programs more prone to crashing, and you generally are locked out of your IDE while a program is compiling. (My 1000th answer!)
