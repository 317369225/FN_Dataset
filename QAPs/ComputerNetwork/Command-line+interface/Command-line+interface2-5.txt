â˜…What is the best way to familiarize yourself with CLI (command line interface)?Unix-like systems come with many good command line interface tools, like brew, apt, vagrant, ansible, etc. I just wondering, when you come across a new CLI tool, is there some common practices that you can follow to quickly grasp that tool?
The more you start using the command line interface, the more you understand the benefits. To start off, this is a good tutorial: Learning the shell. Once you get a head start, try and perform even the simplests of tasks using the CLI, this will definitely familiarise you with most functions of the CLI.
