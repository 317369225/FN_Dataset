â˜…What is the link between the terms shell, command line interface, operating system and kernel?I would like to know how are they interrelated?
The kernel interfaces with the hardware on a low level. The operating system communicates with the kernel. For instance, the operating system can be told to open a file. It checks its records, and asks the kernel to read from the disk. The kernel doesn't know about file systems, it just does crude read and write operations. The operating system gives it parameters on how to take care of things. Your shell is one of many programs that allow you to talk to the operating system. Bash is one for instance. It is called a command line interface, or CLI. In that regard, it is analogous to the graphical user interface, or GUI. So the CLI or the GUI instructs the operating system to do different tasks, and the operating system has the kernel do the heavy lifting. In terms of a car, your CLI or GUI is the steering wheel and controls, and the operating system is the electrical system. The kernel does the work, so it would be the engine and tires.
