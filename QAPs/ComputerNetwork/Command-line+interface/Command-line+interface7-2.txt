★Are there any command line Linux distributions similar to GRML? i.e. truly dedicated to the command line interface.I really loved how GRML was a real hackers OS, running ZSH for the shell, packed with nifty shell programs, optimized with multiple tty terminals, a streamlined Fluxbox GUI to drop into once in a while, and chock full of custom code and cool scripts. I don't like the recent update that ripped the heart right out of it. All the clutter and nifty things to discover are what made it interesting... :(
The majority of linux distributions do not require a gui to manage anything other than the gui itself, and any gui apps that run within it.  So if you are looking for a command line only distribution, you can choose whichever you like, and not install a gui, or uninstall one for those that install by default. Having said that, Gentoo, Arch Linux and Slack all install without a gui in the first place, and it is up to you to install one if you want.
