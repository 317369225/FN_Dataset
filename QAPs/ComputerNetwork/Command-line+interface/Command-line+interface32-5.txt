â˜…Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
My view on it, is use what best suits you If it takes 6 hours to write a program in Visual Studio, by all means use it If it takes 6 hours to write a JS library on Sublime by all means do it But if it takes you 10 hours instead of 6 to write something, because you're using a wrong tool so you can look like a "Ninja" to your friends/peers, that's a wrong approach to it. Professionally you shouldn't aspire to impress anyone, or prove anything to anyone else except your customers........ And quite honestly they can care less what IDE you use, most have no clue what an IDE is
