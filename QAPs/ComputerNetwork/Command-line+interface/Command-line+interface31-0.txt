â˜…Will I ever be able to reach a respectable level as a software engineer if I am not proficient with command-line and Unix environments?
If you're not proficient with command-line tools and the Unix philosophy now? Yeah, sure. I mean, no one was born with that knowledge. If you never become proficient with it? Nope. While using an IDE is sometimes the right choice, if you can only code inside of an IDE, then you're probably one of those programmers who just "writes classes" and can't code outside of a corporate environment. That's not "a respectable level". The good news? Learning the command-line interface and environment is far easier than learning any company's in-house FactoryVisitorFactory mumbo-jumbo, and "the Unix philosophy" is just a fistful of words for "modular, well-designed software". In other words, the question implicitly seems to make a false assumption, of command-line programming being hard. It's not. It's very easy relative to the power that it has. It's a REPL for your computer. It's fine if you aren't proficient with the command line now, but if you refuse to learn it, you'll never grow.
