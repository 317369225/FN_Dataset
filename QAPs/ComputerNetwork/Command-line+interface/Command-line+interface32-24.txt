â˜…Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
I do, because I rarely write programs made to run on the machine next to me, and I am not prepared to spend my life on getting my heavyweight IDE of choice installed on every bizarre remote machine I touch.
