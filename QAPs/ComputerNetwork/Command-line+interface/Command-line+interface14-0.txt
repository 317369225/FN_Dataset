â˜…Is there a significant advantage to using Windows PowerShell vs. the standard command-line interface?
Yes there is. With PowerShell you can easily parse text, combine multiple commands using pipes (easily), filter output and most importantly manage almost all MSFT products like Azure, Exchange and SQL. With cmd you can do some of those tasks as well but not in such unified way. That is not to say the cmd is worthless, it is lightweight in comparison to PowerShell and all its .NET classes, and it offers basic conditoinals, so its perfectly suitable for automating (simple) tasks.
