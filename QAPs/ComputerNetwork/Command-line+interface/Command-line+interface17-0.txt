â˜…I am learning C++ and for practice am using NetBeans IDE. When starting out, is it better to use an IDE or a command line interface?
Yes, use an IDE. I come from the pre-IDE era - I started programming on paper tape. So the IDE is not natural for me. And early IDEs were not good enough for me - I hung on to the command line and text editors for a long time. But nowadays IDEs have all the tools you need and you should definitely use a good IDE if you have one. My choice is Eclipse. That said, fluency on the command line is very useful. No IDE can be perfect, and you can only do things that the developers of your IDE have found necessary or usefult. There will always come a time where you want to do something that they did not think of. The Unix toolkit contains some very powerful tools, and the command line allows these to be connected together in ways that make them even more powerful. And if they do not do what you want, you can also write your own tool and connect it together with the existing tools. And the shell (the command line language) is a powerful, albeit ugly, language in its own right. So you should plan to learn the command line tools in the fullness of time. But starting out, use an IDE. YOu can focus your attention on mastering C++ before you need to spend mental effort on the command line.
