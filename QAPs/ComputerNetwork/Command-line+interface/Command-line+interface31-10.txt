â˜…Will I ever be able to reach a respectable level as a software engineer if I am not proficient with command-line and Unix environments?
I work as professional programmer for more than 20 years. I coded, designed and managed multiple projects, the biggest so far was over $10M in custom software development project, with team of around 20 developers (+ system engineers, QA, integrators, etc). My current job is chief software architect in small private company (120 programmers), and I am one of the owners of the company. Can you call it "respectable level" ? Don't know, comparative to Sergey Brin I am 100% broke. I am not, and never will be proficient with command line and Unix in general. I did my share of Unix programming in univercity, never liked it too much, and most of my carrier worked in Microsoft environment (anything except classical IT / Web, from device drivers to big distributed command and control applications). I can install distro, recompile kernel and configure my XBMC on RaspberryPi installation, likewise I can configure my home NAS and router, including non-trivial dnsmask configuration and guest VLAN using iptables (Google can find amazing stuff, that I never would be able to do alone). I hate Emacs and vi, and prefer "normal" IDE like VS. Just my 2 cents :)
