â˜…What is the best way to familiarize yourself with CLI (command line interface)?Unix-like systems come with many good command line interface tools, like brew, apt, vagrant, ansible, etc. I just wondering, when you come across a new CLI tool, is there some common practices that you can follow to quickly grasp that tool?
Install documentation on the system you use and read man pages for the commands. Make cheat sheets. Write down most commonly used commands for your tasks on a sheet of paper and pin them on the wall. Few commands (git, svn, rsync) have a dry run mode. You can run commands in this dry-run mode to try out before committing the action.
