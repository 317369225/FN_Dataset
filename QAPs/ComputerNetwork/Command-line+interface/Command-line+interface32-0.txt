â˜…Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
Being an expert with command line tools gives you super powers. The beauty of command line interfaces is that anything you can do, you can automate. GUI tools have to go out of their way to enable task automation, and chances are it will be very difficult to automate anything that the tool author did not anticipate. Programmers should look to automate anything that they do more than twice.
