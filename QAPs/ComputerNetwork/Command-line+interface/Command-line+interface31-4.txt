â˜…Will I ever be able to reach a respectable level as a software engineer if I am not proficient with command-line and Unix environments?
As with most things, you will most likely learn the things you need to know about both somewhere along the road. You don't get to "a respectable level as a software engineer" without working on real-life projects. As soon as there are some new commands or skills you need you will just sit down and learn them, by googling or asking a colleague.
