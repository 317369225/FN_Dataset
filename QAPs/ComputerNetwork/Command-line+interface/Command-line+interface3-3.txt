â˜…How important is it to learn command line interfaces?I'm currently learning Python, is this something I should spend time learning, or just go straight to learning more Python?
Initially GUI was developed to Ease of use, users may know or may not know commands to operate, still work is done by gui. I would say commandline is the very powerful and easy way of do any thing in computer with few keystrokes. (saves many mouse clicks, only if you know commands) Every programmers and computer administrator prefers command line instead GUI. You may invest few hours to learn command, but in future you will save lot of time when start spending your time with computer. every linux users use command line as per my knowledge. If you are computer engineer you must learn command line interface, If you are photographer or media person never look at command line.
