â˜…Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
I wish I could use an IDE that could do what my terminal does. I guess it all comes down to the fact that VIM/Emacs can work with any language almost equally well, and the terminal provides a uniform interface to everything. If I were to use an IDE, it would only work for one particular language, and some languages don't even have IDEs. Most of the existing IDEs are also slow, poor at keyboard navigation and just lacking in some features.
