â˜…Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
Lot of good answers here but no one has given the real answer: Linux C and C++ programmers still use the command line plus powerful text editors whereas everyone else uses IDEs. Specifically, Mac/iOS programmers use XCode and Windows programmers use Visual Studio. People writing Qt applications on Windows or Macs can be an exception -- it used to be easier to just compile and build from the command line if you were working with Qt -- but now most Qt developers are probably using QtCreator, which is an IDE... Some people write C++ on Linux using Eclipse + CDT but generally these people do so because they have come from a Windows programming background and don't want to bite the bullet and learn Emacs, which can be painful.
