â˜…Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
After learning vi as a junior in college back in '89, I cannot imagine using another editor to write code. I make use of IDEs when they add alot of value, but when it comes to sitting down and churning out code, I find the vim + linux command line simple, yet powerful and fast. Once you know how to use "xargs", there's no going back! My dream is a lightweight IDE (ie not bloated with features) that has vim and a shell built-in. :)
