â˜…Will I ever be able to reach a respectable level as a software engineer if I am not proficient with command-line and Unix environments?
No... Using Windows how do you show the IP address of your PC or Router without Command Prompt? I suppose you could write something in Visual to do the job but why would you if the command prompt is available and it's accurate? This is just one example but these tools exist to make life easier; as for Unix.. it's everywhere, if you don't understand or work in a Unix environment you'll be very limited in ability. So No... without being proficient with Command-line and Unix environments you will never reach a Respectable level as a Software Engineer.
