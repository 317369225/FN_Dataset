â˜…I am learning C++ and for practice am using NetBeans IDE. When starting out, is it better to use an IDE or a command line interface?
Doesn't make a difference. IDE can do certain things for you by giving you hints about the variables you wanna use or the errors. There is no real reason to using a terminal unless you are super productive because of it (which would mean you are a vim power user). I use vim sometimes, sometimes I use sublime and sometimes I use eclipse and I am mediocre on all of them. But in the way I program and the problems I am working on generally requires more of studying and thinking about a solution than how fast I can type (I type super fast though). Having said that, there is no excuse for using Netbeans :) use eclipse or sublime or "be a real man and use vim (jk)"
