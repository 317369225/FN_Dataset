★Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
It depends on the task. For web projects, I use Coda 2, which is a text editor with some lightweight IDE-ish bits tacked on. For iOS projects, I use Xcode. For C, I use the terminal and vim or nano or whatever else is handy.   I've intentionally constructed my life in such a way as to never have to use Visual Studio, though I have spent some time with it in the past.
