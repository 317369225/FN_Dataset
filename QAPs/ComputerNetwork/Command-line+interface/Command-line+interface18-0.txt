â˜…Is CLI (Command Line Interface) better than GUI (Graphical User Interface) in any aspect?Specifically in context to Windows Powershell.
In some aspects, yes. A CLI is far more dense than a GUI, i.e. a lot more information can be communicated in a small amount of time than what would otherwise be possible in GUI-land, where interaction is based on Windows, Icons, Menus and Pointers (WIMP). The big draw-back of a CLI however, is that it is not very natural and takes a lot more cognitive processing to remember and execute the different command combinations. To execute a certain task with a CLI could possibly be faster than the exact same task in a GUI, but remembering what commands to type, is a lot harder than executing that same task by using your mouse or finger to point and click. All user interfaces have strengths and weaknesses and are therefore a compromise in some way.
