â˜…Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
I use Vim daily. Quit, test build, go back in and edit. And when I'm ready, or tracking down a bug, valgrind and gdb. In my own personal observation, programmers who learn to automate their development environments through scriping interfaces tend to be more productive, even over the enhancements point-click IDE's provide. Mostly because of less time spent using the mouse. I even use Lynx (or Links) in terminal to go look-up information on the web rather than open a GUI interface.
