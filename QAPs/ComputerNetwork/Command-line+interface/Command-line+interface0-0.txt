â˜…What is the easiest command line interface library for Python 2.7?I am working on a small project and would like to make something like this: I want to create something like a GUI in a Command Line (TUI). Also, I am doing this in GNU/Linux (Ubuntu 13.04).
Perhaps newt? Create simple ANSI based UI with Python-Newt Or an ncurses binding like: python-gnt - Python bindings for libgnt, an ncurses toolkit that uses glib events. - Google Project Hosting or Overview - Urwid 1.2.1 Or even a binding to the old TurboVision (which was what stuff like Borland Turbo Pascal / C++ used): PyTVision
