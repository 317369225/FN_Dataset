â˜…Will I ever be able to reach a respectable level as a software engineer if I am not proficient with command-line and Unix environments?
A good engineer is often expected to have more breadth in their skills than simply writing and maintaining code in an IDE. This is especially true of engineers in startups and smaller teams. If we're working on some problem and I see you writing Java in an IDE to accomplish something that could have taken 10 seconds with a UNIX utility like sed or awk, you can bet I'll lose respect for your skills. And if time is of the essence, I will be more than a little angry.
