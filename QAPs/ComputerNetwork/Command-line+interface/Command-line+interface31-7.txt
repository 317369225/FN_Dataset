★Will I ever be able to reach a respectable level as a software engineer if I am not proficient with command-line and Unix environments?
I think what would prevent you from getting to a respectable level would be an unwillingness to learn whatever tools would be most effective for getting the project done.  If anything, you should be striving to add tools to your repertoire unless, of course, you're sure they are archaic tools that are falling out of use.... And even then, are you adopting an older project? My career has involved a lot of use of the command line and I love it, but it's because the projects I've worked on have components that use shell languages.  This may or may not be the case for projects you're working on. Do keep in mind that when using computers in general, not just as a software engineer, knowing the command line or PowerShell, and being able to shell script will often give you more control over the system than what is provided by the GUI alone.
