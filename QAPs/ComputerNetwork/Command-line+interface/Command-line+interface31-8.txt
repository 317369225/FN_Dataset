★Will I ever be able to reach a respectable level as a software engineer if I am not proficient with command-line and Unix environments?
The structure of your question is like asking: - can I reach that <hard goal> - without reaching <much easier goal involving similar concepts but in a simpler form>. Let's try it in other domains: Can I be <a great cook> without <knowing how to make Mayonnaise> Can I be <a great writer> without <using punctuation> Can I be <a great salesman> without  <ever making a phone call> You should be able to answer by yourself. Learning command line syntax is easy. Much easier than programming language ones. Sure it may not be necessary, but you'll encounter so many harder blocks on the way that it's unlikely.
