â˜…Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
For me it's 3 factors: 1) vim is much faster and more powerful than any other IDE I've used and I'm too set in my ways using it. Also great for remote ssh access, which is something that you have to do if you tend to have to hop around a server farm. 2) Using editors nudges you towards building automated and deterministic build tools from day zero. 3) I like forcing myself to keep the code in my head. Autocomplete is like training wheels - if you rely on it, you tend to develop a dependency on it instead of pushing yourself to internalize code to the point you can type it out faster than searching for what to use.
