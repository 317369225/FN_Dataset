â˜…Are GUIs inherently less powerful than command line interfaces, or is this sentiment simply the representation of frustration from current and previous designs? Might a future GUI be superior to CLI?This is a follow-up question to Why do many programmers insist that non-graphical tools are superior to GUIs?.
I think that GUIs are less powerful in the way of flexibility. For example, you can browse a directory structure in both a GUI file manager and the shell, but it is a lot easier to output a file backwards from the shell than from a GUI file manager. The shell can do pretty much anything, where as GUIs are usually made to only do one specific function.
