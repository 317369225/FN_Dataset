â˜…What is the easiest command line interface library for Python 2.7?I am working on a small project and would like to make something like this: I want to create something like a GUI in a Command Line (TUI). Also, I am doing this in GNU/Linux (Ubuntu 13.04).
You can use various modules or combinations. I would suggest some of these to you : CLINT(CommandLineINterfaceTools) : It supports iterator based progress bars and implicit argument handling and CLI colors. For more info : Python Package Index CLICK(Command-Line Interface Creation Kit) : It is is highly configurable but comes with good defaults out of the box. For more info : Welcome to the Click Documentation DOCOPT : It gives parsing through POSIX style instructions. For more info : docopt-language for description of command-line interfaces PLAC : Simple wrapper over library argparse with less complexity. It is for those who want to make CLI quickly. For more info : Python Package Index CLIFF : It uses setuptools entry points to provide subcommands, output formatters, and other extensions.
