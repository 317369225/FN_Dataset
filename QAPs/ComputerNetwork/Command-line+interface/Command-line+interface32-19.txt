â˜…Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
Yes, using gcc, gdb and valgrind are all very much relevant today. Linux based developers still do. We usually have a very quick coding cycle comprising of editing on Vi/Vim and using the very useful Make utility to build your code. Building using Makefiles and Make (which internally call gcc or g++) is the usual approach followed when you are enhancing or tweaking code part of a huge code base and you want your changes to reflect in the final product.
