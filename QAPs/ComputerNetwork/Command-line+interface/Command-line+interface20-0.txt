★What was it like to switch from using a command-line interface (CLI) to using a graphical user interface (GUI) in the 1980s-1990s?
It was mostly a losing proposition.  With window 3.1 (forgive me if I forget which Dos version I was running), one could run Dos programs under windows and those weren't too badly hurt.  But early windows versions of good programs were often slow.  I had a Dos version of Quatro pro, the first windows version was horrible.  I used Paradox as a database, and I ran it under windows for some time. It was very fast and very good, but at one point it became incompatible with Windows. I did use the Windows version, not so good, though not the resource hog the early Window Quatro pro was. As far a windows itself. File management was far slower than the Dos versions, so if you were comfortable with command line stuff, that was the way to go.  Even today I use the command line for file management stuff, since the overhead seems to be quite a bit smaller than with windows.
