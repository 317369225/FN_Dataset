★I am learning C++ and for practice am using NetBeans IDE. When starting out, is it better to use an IDE or a command line interface?
Use the command line for the first couple of programs to get an idea of what the IDE is doing for you. After that, an IDE is almost always a better choice. An IDE will check for errors in your program, highlight the syntax for easily navigating code. It will allow you to see documentation of in built functions,  will help with debugging, and so on. The easy documentation viewing and auto-complete features of an IDE are very useful to a beginner who is just learning about various functions/classes which are available and what they do. An IDE takes care of the mundane tasks for you so that you can focus solely on the program and language. But as I said above, you should at least know how to compile and run a program without using an IDE.
