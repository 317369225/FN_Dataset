★Will I ever be able to reach a respectable level as a software engineer if I am not proficient with command-line and Unix environments?
While breadth of knowledge and experience is always a good thing, respect from your peers and seniors will often first come as a result of having demonstrated proficiency or expertise within a narrower scope.  Once you've achieved proficiency in one area, you can try achieving it in another.  As time goes you, respect for your expertise will grow because it will reach a wider audience.  Ultimately, you'll be able to synthesize things you've learned from different areas, which will start to get you noticed for your breadth of expertise, and for your ability to make connections between areas or to apply techniques from one area to another. To your exact question, if you are working in, say, a Windows environment now but aren't proficient in it, then you might stay with that until you are and tackle Unix a bit later.  Learning something like PowerShell might be of more use to you at this time. But then, it depends on your objectives.  Your question seemed to mainly be about gaining respect.  If you were job seeking, my answer would be a bit different.  In that case, you need depth in at least a few things and some exposure to others to demonstrate you are not too narrowly focused, and to increase your chances that a prospective employer will interview you just because they saw "XYZ" on your resume.  That may get you an opportunity, but not the job unless the interviewer becomes convinced you can gain enough proficiency in "XYZ" on the job to meet the requirements.  Demonstrating you have the ability to self-learn can be helpful towards that end.
