★Do people still write and compile programs from the command line instead of an IDE? Why or why not?I'm currently in an introductory C course and we've started learning how to compile and debug using tools such as gcc, gdb and valgrind. Is this approach still relevant in a practical context, or is using an IDE more common in the real world? I noticed that professional programmers still use no-frills word processors such as Notepad and Vim. Sorry for the noob question.
I completely agree with the other answers. We build our database system for a wide variety of operating systems such as VxWorks, INTEGRITY, QNX, Windows, and Linux, and for most of those, multiple CPUs like x86, ARM, PowerPC, MIPS etc.  Being able to build for this large matrix of targets, launch test scripts, inspect the output files, build distribution packages, and so on, completely automatically, is essential.  We'd be buried if we didn't have the capability and talent to drive all of this from the command line through makefiles and scripts.
