★What is the best ISP in Redwood City California?
My location in Redwood City is 11,000 feet from Sonic's "local serving office" so this makes Sonic's DSL speed to my home at approximately 6 Mb/sec, according to their graph. I'm currently using Comcast instead as it provides a better download speed of 20 Mb/sec. Comcast is slightly more pricey though.    Embed Quote
