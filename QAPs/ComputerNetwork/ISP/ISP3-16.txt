★What is the best internet/ISP service in Pune?I hear that Airtel is providing their 4G service in Pune. Is it good? http://www.airtel.in/forme/wirel...
I have been using Spectra for about half a year now and the services are pretty good. Apart from the installation charges, usage for the first 3 months is free and for about 1100 INR a month, I get upto 16Mbps of speed. In addition, the download limit is 48GB per month for the first 6 months and 24 GB per month post the first 6 months. I think, that's a fair deal.    Embed Quote
