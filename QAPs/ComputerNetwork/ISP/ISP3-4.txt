★What is the best internet/ISP service in Pune?I hear that Airtel is providing their 4G service in Pune. Is it good? http://www.airtel.in/forme/wirel...
As couple of poeple mentioned....it totally depends on ur area...i hv stayed in couple of places in pune to say tht. I hv used airtel broadband in vimam nagar nut when i moved to pimple saudagar...i couldnt find any ISP there...so asked for Tata Indicom dongle & was pretty happy to hv it but it was tht cheap. So baseline depends on ur area n might i suggest doung some research.    Embed Quote
