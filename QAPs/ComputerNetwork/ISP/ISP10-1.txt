★What is the best ISP in Kolkata?Please suggest anything but not BSNL. Mainly for browsing and some amount of downloads including Torrents. [Not Needed for online gaming]
Softel is the best ISP in Kolkata. Blazing fast internet download speeds, unlimited usage (the speeds don't slow down after a certain GB limit, truly is unlimited) and incredible customer service. Our organisation swears by it, and I personally recommend it to anyone who downloads torrents, streams videos online or needs the internet for video conferencing or even surfing normally.    Embed Quote
