★What is the best ISP (Internet Service Provider) in Spain?Professional purpose, not for downloading/uploading big files.
They are generally slow and expensive by American standards. Except maybe ONO http://www.ono.es/, which is – I believe – the only Spanish company offering broadband fiber-optic internet. They claim they are as fast as the Japanese ISPs. ONO's main problem is they aren't everywhere. You've got to call them and or check out their website.    Embed Quote
