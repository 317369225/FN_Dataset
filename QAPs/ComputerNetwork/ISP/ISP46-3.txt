★Which ISP is most reliable in Capitol Hill, Seattle? Comcast or Centurylink?I am moving to the capitol hill neighborhood and my building is serviced by centurylink and comcast. I will be using the connection to do lots of streaming, so I will probably go with the 20Mbps speed with either provider. I see Comcast costs significantly more, but I am willing to pay the premium if it reflects better reliability and customer service.
Comcast is the better of two evils. I've never dealt with a worse company than Centurylink. They have no customer service. It's a very difficult company to work with. Even paying my bill was never easy. I closed my account. I was more than willing to pay more to give my business to someone else. 9 months later, I received notification that my account had been sent to collections. I disputed that claim, and turn's out they were wrong. My payments weren't going on my account. Good thing I had record of making the payments. Worst company ever. I'm not exaggerating.    Embed Quote
