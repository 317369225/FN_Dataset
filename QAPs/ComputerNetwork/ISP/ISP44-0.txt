★Are there any ISPs in Sholinganallur, Chennai?I'm located near Infosys Campus, Shoilnganallur. I have reached Airtel, YOU, Tikona, wi5, BSNL, Tata Docomo, ACT, Reliance. No use. Did I miss any other ISP?
Btw guys, I got MTS mblaze, comparatively cheaper, 40GB @ 999 + 1000 for device, very much worth it. Highly recommended.    Embed Quote
