★Internet Piracy: Can we stop American ISPs from spying on us?
The answer is yes but the solutions out there are not what you might necessarily want.  The reality is that there are 3 aspects of communications you need to secure - Message Source, Message Target and Message Content.  VPN providers are great, for example, at hiding Message Content but they do nothing to hide the Source or Target.  It really does not matter if an ISP cannot read your content if they see you connecting to a Torrent site...I'm just saying... Proxy Service Providers are decent at hiding your Message Source.  Decent as they generally do not give you options to set your location and, in reality, they are sending standard web request to their websites (which your ISP reads) and then sending your requests through their proxies and out to the world.  While the world might not see you as the source (yes there are issues here as well), your ISP already knows everything. Just to be clear, nobody right now protects the Message Target. So how do I know so much?  Well I faced your question a couple of years ago and I started working on overcoming these issues.  That effort resulted in IP Ghoster (http://www.ipghoster.com) which overcomes all of these issues.  Our first product, IP Ghoster Local will let you choose your location and directly connect to proxies (i.e. no middleman) worldwide - thus protecting your Message Source.  Our second product IP Ghoster Social will provide encryption well beyond the SSL/VPN options out there today and will protect your Message Content.  And our last product, IP Ghoster Universal, will hide you as a Source, completely hide your Content and even hide to whom you are communicating and thus provide complete anonymity online. Pretty cool, right? Check out the site - http:www.ipghoster.com - to learn more.    Embed Quote
