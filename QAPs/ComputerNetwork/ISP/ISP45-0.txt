★Who provides internet access (ISP) for Google?
Google is not their own ISP by the traditional sense of the word, but they do operate a global network large enough to meet the criteria for what many people would call an "ISP".  But, this is a private network that only routes data to and from google hosted services, so is not used by the general purpose internet. With respect to connectivity between Google servers and the rest of the internet, there are many, many individual connection points, and the majority of these are "Peering" relationships between local or regional ISPs, and the nearest Google network POPs.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pee...) You can easily see how your traffic routes from your computer to Goggle by using tools like traceroute (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tra...) or mtr ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTR... ) combined with whois lookups on the resulting IP addresses. Usually, what you should learn from these tools is that traffic goes through a couple of routers at your ISP, then hits a router that connects your ISP with Google, and then a couple more hops inside google's network before terminating at the nearest web frontend. This architecture will be true for most large internet companies (Google, Yahoo, Amazon, Facebook, etc.)  Smaller web sites will have different, slightly longer paths, or be hosted via Amazon, Rackspace, or some other large hosting company.    Embed Quote
