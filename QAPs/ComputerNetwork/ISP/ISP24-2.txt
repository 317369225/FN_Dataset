★What is the best ISP (Internet Service Provider) in Spain?Professional purpose, not for downloading/uploading big files.
In my experience all of them are perfectly able to give you the nightmare of your lifetime. At my house we have ONO and on some days it can get so slow, you can't even open your gmail account. I guess it really depends in wich area you are. Some years ago somebody explained to me that the best was Movistar, because, as former monopolist, all the others were actually using their infrastructure anyway. I guess that might have changed by now, allthough - who know. Anyway my experience with Movistar was that the connection seemed to be rather reliable (service is really crap though).    Embed Quote
