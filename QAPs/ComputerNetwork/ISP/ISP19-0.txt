★Whatever happened to AOL's ISP business?It used to be such a big part of their revenue. Now they're a content company?
Actually, AOL still has a dial-up business (Access) and it accounts for about 40% of their revenue (about $1 billion annually) and the majority (if not almost all) of their annual profits. AOL's ISP business has been declining in revenue and members due to consumers switching to broadband internet (as AOL only offers dial-up access), but it is a highly profitable business (about 70-80% margin business). AOL's advertising business, which is their other major form of revenue accounts for about 55% of their revenues (about $1.2 billion annually), however this business basically breaks even in terms of profit.
