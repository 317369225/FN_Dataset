★Which ISP is most reliable in Capitol Hill, Seattle? Comcast or Centurylink?I am moving to the capitol hill neighborhood and my building is serviced by centurylink and comcast. I will be using the connection to do lots of streaming, so I will probably go with the 20Mbps speed with either provider. I see Comcast costs significantly more, but I am willing to pay the premium if it reflects better reliability and customer service.
Not only that but Comcast does have a 300Gig cap that you can hit if you are doing a lot of data traveling, I don't tell you up front, you have to dig through you digital account information to figure out how much you have used.    Embed Quote
