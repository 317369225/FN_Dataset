★Would an ISP know if someone spoofed their IP address?I just got a notice of copyright infringement from Verizon, but I never downloaded the movie they accused me of. I have WPA2. Is it possible that someone spoofed my ip address?
Simply put no.  I haven't seen it stated plainly in the other answers, but in order for spoofing to work the attacker needs to be able to receive return traffic.  Your is chosen by a device that belongs to verizon.  Having worked at a residential ISP there are many simple security measures that make traditional spoofing impossible on the type of network your connected to. More often than not it was a friend, significant other or visitor that either downloaded the content or connected to your wifi and forgot to disable their file-sharing client.  I've received similar notices in the past and they sometimes get the name of the media file wrong. There isn't much to worry about here if you've only received one notice.  If it continues there are a few things you can do. You can block incoming filesharing protocols on most consumer-grade routers.  I'd do so whether you download or not. I'd also change the wifi password and implement mac-address filtering.  You'll have to login to your router to add new devices.  It's not the bad in my experience.  It's pretty rare and I can do it from my phone.
