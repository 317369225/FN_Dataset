★What is the best ISP in Kolkata?Please suggest anything but not BSNL. Mainly for browsing and some amount of downloads including Torrents. [Not Needed for online gaming]
Alliance broadband. Though it's not available in many parts of Kolkata, it's the only ISP which provides peering in case of torrents. For those who don't know about peering, suppose you are downloading a file via torrents. So, the file is situated in someone else's computer or in computers of many people and you are downloading some parts from each of them. Now, alliance uses a server of its own in which popular files are downloaded from the Internet and stored temporarily. You can go and see a list of these torrents in TorBox.net. The green colored font there, means the torrent is live and will be downloaded at much higher speed than the regular one. Since most of the popular contents are kept in that server, in most of the time you get blazing fast download speed.    Embed Quote
