★Which ISP is most reliable in Capitol Hill, Seattle? Comcast or Centurylink?I am moving to the capitol hill neighborhood and my building is serviced by centurylink and comcast. I will be using the connection to do lots of streaming, so I will probably go with the 20Mbps speed with either provider. I see Comcast costs significantly more, but I am willing to pay the premium if it reflects better reliability and customer service.
I did century link first and really hated it. Spoty coverage but the trouble started after an outage. I had been a customer three weeks when it went down. After calling and talking to the reps I was no closer to resolving this issue. I cancelled my service after they said it would cost a few hundred dollars to have someone come repair it!! Let me just explain also that the internet just stopped. It wasn't my device as I took my laptop to Starbucks and checked. It was just the connection. I agree comcast is still difficult but miles ahead for me after that brush. I even refuse to call Century Link field by its name unless I can interject a few adjectives first.    Embed Quote
