★Which ISP is most reliable in Capitol Hill, Seattle? Comcast or Centurylink?I am moving to the capitol hill neighborhood and my building is serviced by centurylink and comcast. I will be using the connection to do lots of streaming, so I will probably go with the 20Mbps speed with either provider. I see Comcast costs significantly more, but I am willing to pay the premium if it reflects better reliability and customer service.
I've had CenturyLink for over two years without a single outage. There are very helpful, and even the in-home installation etc. was free. Just make sure that you call them yearly to ask for the best rate. With Comcast be careful about which speed you actually get because they play some tricks with their "overdrive" speed that you only get for a few seconds. One reason against CenturyLink are the low upstream rates, so if you plan to upload movies etc. that will be slow, for regular usage (surfing, Netflix etc.) it doesn't matter.    Embed Quote
