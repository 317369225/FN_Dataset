★Which ISP provides the best broadband plans, in chennai, in terms of quality and pricing?I have relocated to Chennai, and I'm searching for a good, unlimited home broadband plan, within Rs.1000/-
I have used Tata Photon+ . It was quite reliable for me in Chennai( during my college time). There was a 650/month plan which gave 3.2 Mbps speed and 5 GB data. It also has a 900/month (or 950/month) plan which has 3.2 Mbps and unlimited data usage.    Embed Quote
