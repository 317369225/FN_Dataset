★Would an ISP know if someone spoofed their IP address?I just got a notice of copyright infringement from Verizon, but I never downloaded the movie they accused me of. I have WPA2. Is it possible that someone spoofed my ip address?
It's possible that there was some spoofing going on.  It's also possible that someone has your Wi-Fi password, or that someone in your household is downloading things.    Embed Quote
