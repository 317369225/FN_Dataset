★Would an ISP know if someone spoofed their IP address?I just got a notice of copyright infringement from Verizon, but I never downloaded the movie they accused me of. I have WPA2. Is it possible that someone spoofed my ip address?
As Tony Li said its more likely that someone was able to connect to your network.  Having said that, if Verizon didn't do a good job in their configuration its possible for someone to temporarily use your IP address without you or them being able to detect it.  Are you a FioS or DSL subscriber of Verizon?    Embed Quote
