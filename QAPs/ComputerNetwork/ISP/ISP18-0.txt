★What kind of data is stored by your ISP?I read that there is legislation/regulation pending that would require ISPs to record and keep data for six months. This includes IP addresses of customers, communication via IM, Skype etc. How would that even work? Also, I assumed they kept records of the IP assignments pretty much forever. What is the current policy?
This varies wildly depending on your ISP in question. A lot of ISPs already monitor and store a lot of traffic (especially Comcast and many small local providers). It isn't unheard of for a small ISP to sell some of their data about traffic and activity after it's been made anonymous, as market research or demographics data. In short, if you've ever sent or received something on your ISP's network, you should assume that they have a copy or log of the action. In other words, your ISP is aware of your web browsing and internet use behavior and patterns.    Embed Quote
