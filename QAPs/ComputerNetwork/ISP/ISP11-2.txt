★Internet Piracy: Can we stop American ISPs from spying on us?
This is pretty straightforward. We probably don't need legislation forbidding ISPs from doing this sort of thing. We merely need to assure them that legislation won't be passed that holds them accountable for what people do with their Internet access. All else equal, ISPs wouldn't want to do this, because it upsets customers and drives them to other providers. But if they feel threatened, it will become a universal practice, which also means that it will cease to be a competitive disadvantage. If we not only defeat SOPA and related legislation, but do so so decisively that everyone knows that another attempt would be political poison, this problem will resolve itself.    Embed Quote
