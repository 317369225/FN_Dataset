★What is the best internet/ISP service in Pune?I hear that Airtel is providing their 4G service in Pune. Is it good? http://www.airtel.in/forme/wirel...
When i first moved to pune , I started on with Airtel broadband. Speed was good but was way too expensive. But then came this into my life , VOVINET broadband with 10MBps truly unlimited for a whole month. Yes , I am serious. It actually provided with 10mbps speed for a whole month. You can watch 1080p quality videos on YouTube without buffering .I never came across any problem with online streaming for watching football matches or cricket live.Want to download a movie?torrentz on , few minutes and you are done with downloading. Check out for the smart packs , I am having the 10MBps truly unlimited plan which i paid initially for 3months and guess what i got the next month usage free with a router and installation charges free. How wonderful isn't it? The only problem with them is their service is limited around regions .So check for the availability in your area and go for it. Page on www.vovinet.in    Embed Quote
