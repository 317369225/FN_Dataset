★What is the best ISP in Menlo Park?We're downtown on Santa Cruz/Chestnut st but it seems that nobody delivers fast internet around here?
I live a couple blocks away (Santa Cruz / El Camino), and Comcast is pretty speedy.  I have the mid-range 25 Mbps option, and I'm able to stream movies just fine.  Maybe it would be too slow for gaming or other intensive activities, but I don't need that.  If you need super fast internet, just get Fiber and expect to pay a premium.    Embed Quote
