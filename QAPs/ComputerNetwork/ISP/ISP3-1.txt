★What is the best internet/ISP service in Pune?I hear that Airtel is providing their 4G service in Pune. Is it good? http://www.airtel.in/forme/wirel...
Well just one thing about Airtel 4G - Don't use it. It's definitely not worth the cost. The post FUP is 128kbps which is pathetic. I had a plan for which I paid 2250/month for 40GB.   I used it for about 2 months and got irritated by the post FUP speed. I have now discontinued the plan. UPDATE: So I forget to tell you about what I am currently using. SMARTDNA or DNA whatever you wanna call it. They are awesome. Torrent speed is maxed around 3.6 MBps on a 1.2 MBps plan. Isn't that crazy!! Youtube and all google sites have different speeds of around 30mbps. So Youtube videos buffers by default at 720p. And at last it just cost Rs 1000/month or Rs 2300/3 months depending on your choice.    Embed Quote
