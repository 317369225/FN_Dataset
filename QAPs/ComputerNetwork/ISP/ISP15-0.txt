★Can Google Adwords be filtered by ISP or location?A large proportion of clicks from our AdWords campaign is coming from schools - this is costing us quite a bit as our client base is entirely made up of adult professionals. Is there a way to filter or reduce impressions from these types of sources?
As others have mentioned, using the search terms report to find irrelevant queries you can add as negative keywords is the most effective way to solve the problem you're describing. The other thing to look at, as already discussed, is making sure that your ads are written in a way that will attract your target audience. For the sake of completeness, however, I'll mention two other features that may be relevant: You can exclude locations from seeing your ads using the location settings for your campaign. Instructions for doing this can be found in the AdWords Help Center (http://adwords.google.com/suppor...). However, smaller places like schools aren't generally represented in the list of locations you can target or exclude, so unless you're in a situation where it makes sense to exclude entire cities (something which shouldn't be done lightly), this may not be appropriate. There is also an advanced feature to allow exclusions of IP address ranges at the campaign level. Again, the Help Center explains how this works and how to implement these exclusions (http://adwords.google.com/suppor...). However, as the article explains, IP address exclusions should be implemented carefully -- it can be easy to exclude legitimate traffic without intending to do so. Note that, although Google Analytics may provide related information in the "service provider" column as you mentioned in your comment, this information isn't available in Google AdWords as a way of targeting or excluding users.    Embed Quote
