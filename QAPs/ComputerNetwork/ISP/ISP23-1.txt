★What is the best ISP to use in Boston?Moving to USA later this year, I want to get a really good internet connection (at least 20mbps) as I don't plan on having Cable. I'd like to be able to use Netflix, Hulu, p2p. Any suggestions?
Comcast is blazingly fast, however, it is in fact Comcast and you do need to deal with their shenanigans.    Embed Quote
