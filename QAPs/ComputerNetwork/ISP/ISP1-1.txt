★Which is the best Canadian ISP?How does this differ between consumer v. business v. hosting?
Although only in limited beta at the moment, I'm a fan of Bell Entertainment which is a combined IPTV and ISP much like Verizon FOS. The additional perk of Bell is you get free WiFi in a bunch of places (Starbucks, most popularly) for being a Bell ISP subscriber.    Embed Quote
