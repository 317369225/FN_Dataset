★What is the best internet/ISP service in Pune?I hear that Airtel is providing their 4G service in Pune. Is it good? http://www.airtel.in/forme/wirel...
Depends on your area . I enjoyed BSNL and Tikona in Pimple Saudagar . And whatever happens , even if there is any claim from Reliance Netconnect , no matter what they claim ....Don't ever buy it , its a trap.    Embed Quote
