★Are there ISP's in Indonesia run by expats?
Why would expats matter? There are many western graduates running ISPs in Indonesia. Technically, we are on par with the rest of the world. In fact, in some areas we're even better because of situation(s). For example, the way we design our internet exchange is different (ie. put all eggs in one basket :)) but that's just to make local access faster.    Embed Quote
