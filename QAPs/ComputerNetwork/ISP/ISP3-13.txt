★What is the best internet/ISP service in Pune?I hear that Airtel is providing their 4G service in Pune. Is it good? http://www.airtel.in/forme/wirel...
Well one thing is that "Never buy Tikona" I have used tikona for almost one year. The problem comes when you try to change your ISP from Tikona to someone else. Even after applying for disconnection of the service several times they don't come to pick up their hardware and will keep sending you bills. And worst when you don't pay the bills they will start Threatening you by calling you through a lawyer that if you don't pay the bills they will file a case against you. So never take internet connection from the A holes ever.    Embed Quote
