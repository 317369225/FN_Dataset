★What is the best internet/ISP service in Pune?I hear that Airtel is providing their 4G service in Pune. Is it good? http://www.airtel.in/forme/wirel...
After living in multiple areas of Pune, right from Viman Nagar, Vishrantwadi, Model Colony, Bavdhan, Baner to Pimple Saudagar and using multiple ISP (sometimes switching ISP just in a week to get good connection), I have been using Airtel 4G for past one year in different parts of the city and trust me I am finally very happy. NOTE: I have seen it go as low as 3 Mbps at worse (but that is fine) and there have been few minor hiccups is service (like 5 minutes of downtime, which is again fine compared to the other services I have used).    Embed Quote
