★What is the best internet/ISP service in Pune?I hear that Airtel is providing their 4G service in Pune. Is it good? http://www.airtel.in/forme/wirel...
Never go for You Broadband. I am using you broadband from past 6 months and service is pathetic. In every 2 days I get a message saying that service is down in our area (Aundh) for 5-12 hours even sometimes 2-3 days. Most terrible thing was their connectivity is not secure. I took a plan of 16 GB and it got expired in two days. When I made a complain they reverted that your account has been hacked and You broadband is not responsible for that. I changed my WiFi name and password and recharged my plan 0f 16 GB and again it got expired in 4 days. Same story "Your account has been hacked. And YouBB is not responsible for that. "   Now I had discontinued using You broadband services and exploring other service providers in my area. My suggestion as a customer of You Broadband : NEVER go for it.    Embed Quote
