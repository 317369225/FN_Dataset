★What kind of data is stored by your ISP?I read that there is legislation/regulation pending that would require ISPs to record and keep data for six months. This includes IP addresses of customers, communication via IM, Skype etc. How would that even work? Also, I assumed they kept records of the IP assignments pretty much forever. What is the current policy?
In the EU, this matter was already issued long time ago by means of Directive 2006/24/EC of 15 March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC. Under such Directive, harmonised in all the European Member States, the categories of data that ISP must retain are (following article 5 of the Directive): (a) data necessary to trace and identify the source of a communication: (2) concerning Internet access, Internet e-mail and Internet telephony: (i) the user ID(s) allocated; (ii) the user ID and telephone number allocated to any communication entering the public telephone network; (iii) the name and address of the subscriber or registered user to whom an Internet Protocol (IP) address, user ID or telephone number was allocated at the time of the communication; (b) data necessary to identify the destination of a communication: (2) concerning Internet e-mail and Internet telephony: (i) the user ID or telephone number of the intended recipient(s) of an Internet telephony call; (ii) the name(s) and address(es) of the subscriber(s) or registered user(s) and user ID of the intended recipient of the communication; (c) data necessary to identify the date, time and duration of a communication: (2) concerning Internet access, Internet e-mail and Internet telephony: (i) the date and time of the log-in and log-off of the Internet access service, based on a certain time zone, together with the IP address, whether dynamic or static, allocated by the Internet access service provider to a communication, and the user ID of the subscriber or registered user; (ii) the date and time of the log-in and log-off of the Internet e-mail service or Internet telephony service, based on a certain time zone; (d) data necessary to identify the type of communication: (2) concerning Internet e-mail and Internet telephony: the Internet service used; (e) data necessary to identify users' communication equipment or what purports to be their equipment: (3) concerning Internet access, Internet e-mail and Internet telephony: (i) the calling telephone number for dial-up access; (ii) the digital subscriber line (DSL) or other end point of the originator of the communication; No data revealing the content of the communication may be retained pursuant to this Directive.    Embed Quote
