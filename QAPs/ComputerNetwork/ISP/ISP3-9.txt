★What is the best internet/ISP service in Pune?I hear that Airtel is providing their 4G service in Pune. Is it good? http://www.airtel.in/forme/wirel...
Airtel 4G is not at all reliable and when you face issues, they don't even provide service either. I have airtel 4G connection, it worked fine for first one and half month but I am not being able to connect to it since 5th of April. They have not fixed the issue yet. I have placed a request for disconnecting but they are taking time to do that as well. I would never suggest airtel 4G to anyone    Embed Quote
