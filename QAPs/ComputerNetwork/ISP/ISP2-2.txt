★How safe & trustworthy are ISPs?Do you trust the connection your ISP supplies?  How can you check that your information is safe?
With everything going on in news with Snowden, ISPs are the least of your worries. Yes, ISPs collect tons of data. So does Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Facebook, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile... the list goes on and on. If you're using any service, ISP or web, they keep track of where you are, where you've been, what sites you're on, what ads you click. All that data is stored for an indefinite period of time. Now if that has you paranoid...with all the news about the CIA, NSA, FBI, DHS, etc. we now pretty much know much of that data is collected, inspected, and stored by the government as well. If it's not stored, they can easily get a warrant, or use the FISA court, to get that info from the various web services. So everything you do on the net, or your cell phone, is tracked and stored by someone. The only way you can be safe is to encrypt everything. Use encrypted email services where the email is stored encrypted by your key. Do searches with HTTPS. Use VoIP with encryption. etc. Good luck! ;)    Embed Quote
