★What is the best internet/ISP service in Pune?I hear that Airtel is providing their 4G service in Pune. Is it good? http://www.airtel.in/forme/wirel...
Currently I am using Tata Docomo broadband connection in Baner area, I am quite happy with the service. Mine is 2 MBPS 20GB FUP plan. Most of the time speed revolves around 1.5 MB.    Embed Quote
