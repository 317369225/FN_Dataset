★What is the best internet/ISP service in Pune?I hear that Airtel is providing their 4G service in Pune. Is it good? http://www.airtel.in/forme/wirel...
What I've gathered from anecdotal data from friends over the years in Pune is that if you can get Airtel in your locality, then it usually is the least bad option. The speeds will be OK - not great, but consistent. Problems, which happen once in a while, usually get resolved quickly. Customer service used to be excellent. It is getting worse now, but still not as bad as the horror stories I hear about other providers. For corporate broadband, I have heard good things about Tata Indicom too (but don't use them for consumer broadband). BSNL is great when it works. But a pain when it stops working. For all others, I have heard some horror stories which make me stay away from them. Don't know anything about 4G.    Embed Quote
