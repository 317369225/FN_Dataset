★Which ISP offers the highest bandwidth and lowest latency in Palo Alto?Are there any options besides Comcast and ATT?
Really getting tired of Comcast, and Sonic says I am so far (11,000 feet) from their CO so I would only get basic 1.5mb/sec on their ADSL.  Other than AT&T, anyone know other ISPs?    Embed Quote
