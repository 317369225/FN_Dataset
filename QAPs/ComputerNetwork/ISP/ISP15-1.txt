★Can Google Adwords be filtered by ISP or location?A large proportion of clicks from our AdWords campaign is coming from schools - this is costing us quite a bit as our client base is entirely made up of adult professionals. Is there a way to filter or reduce impressions from these types of sources?
I'm afraid it does sound like a keyword/copy issue. I once saw a campaign where a crew providing 3D rendering services to architects was dropping all their ad budget on irrelevant searches. What I'd suggest doing is taking a look at the Search Term Report for the illustration keyword. Odds are, there'll be a bundle of keywords there that aren't commercial in intent, and we can assume these will be the searches made by universities. Info on the Search Term Report: http://adwords.google.com/suppor... Here's where you might want to export the data as a CSV -- some heavy lifting with keywords -- what you want is to isolate all the keywords that are irrelevant, you might want to X-reference this with your Analytics data and spot the PPC keywords with high bounce rates. You then add these as Negative Keywords, exact match -- this prevents your ads from showing if the search is made again. It's a long way around, but it lets you keep the broad match "illustration" keyword live, and stops some of these educational or otherwise non-commercial searches from sucking up budget. I should probably make clear that I'm with Derek on the issue of ad content and keyword choice. This is probably the real issue, your ad needs to communicate exactly who you are and exactly why someone should click on your ad. A bonus about looking over the Search Term Report is that you'll get heaps of ideas for broad and exact match keywords that you *do* want. It's labour-intensive, and takes weeks not months, but if you play it right then it's a good way of getting a very strong set of keywords.    Embed Quote
