★What is the best internet/ISP service in Pune?I hear that Airtel is providing their 4G service in Pune. Is it good? http://www.airtel.in/forme/wirel...
I have used almost every ISP in last 6 years. Tata Indicom - Great service. Moderate cost. Speed as per promised. Rare failures , service almost everywhere in pune You Broadband : High speed awesome plans at cheap rates, good service, speed as per promised, most of areas are covered Hathway :- Stay away from these guys, pathetic service , ok-ok rates Tata-docomo :- Good service , plans are little costly Reliance broadband :- No high speed plans, ok-ok service, not available in many areas Overall , i would suggest go for You Broadband else Tata- Indicom. If you are looking for dongle , Idea is rock solid . And in PCMC area spectranet is also good option.    Embed Quote
