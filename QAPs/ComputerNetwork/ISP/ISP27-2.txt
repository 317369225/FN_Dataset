★Which ISP provides the best broadband plans, in chennai, in terms of quality and pricing?I have relocated to Chennai, and I'm searching for a good, unlimited home broadband plan, within Rs.1000/-
Thanks for A2A.  I am using BSNL unlimited home broadband plan, at almost Rs 1000.00  and so far I have not had any problems. By its sheer size and reach BSNL still appears to be a better bet than most of the private players.    Embed Quote
