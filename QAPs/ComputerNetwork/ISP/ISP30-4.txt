★Which ISP offers the highest bandwidth and lowest latency in Palo Alto?Are there any options besides Comcast and ATT?
I get like 20Mbps down with Comcast...I've upgraded before and didn't notice a big difference. The worst part is their service (after intro period) costs $100/mo for 50Mbps down... That's TERRIBLE. Do you realize my 4G LTE phone gets 30Mbps down? Cheaper than the 20Mbps internet from Comcast. Yea, there's a data cap...But still. I can't wait for 4G to take over the scene here. Or just anyone to end the tyranny of Comcast. It is the only industry (aside from the airline industry) where you can treat your customers like crap and bend them over a cold sink for money and get away with it...And literally have the customers begging for more. It's horrible. I only wish that I was in that nice block of town where Google's gigabit internet was being tested... And I hope Google expands quickly with their new internet and saves us all.    Embed Quote
