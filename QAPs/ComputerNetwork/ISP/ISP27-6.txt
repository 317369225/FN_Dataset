★Which ISP provides the best broadband plans, in chennai, in terms of quality and pricing?I have relocated to Chennai, and I'm searching for a good, unlimited home broadband plan, within Rs.1000/-
As far I know ACTTV had been very aggressive players in Broadband. They will provide very fast plans for reasonable pricing. They have some 999 plan for Chennai - 15Mbps upto 40 GB and 512 after that.  Check the availability in your location first and then apply for it. My 2nd preference would be BSNL, but since they are using age old infrastructure which doesnot allow too many connections to be allowed, they might not be able to provide connections at times and the delay is as usual. 3rd Preference would be Airtel, they are fast, reliable and reasonable in pricing as well. You could get the connection with in a week if they have coverage in your area. Finally, it all depends more on your locality and less on the service provider :) Don't opt for wi5, tikona, YOU, net express, etc,. They are all junk.    Embed Quote
