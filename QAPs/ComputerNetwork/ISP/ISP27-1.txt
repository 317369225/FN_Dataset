★Which ISP provides the best broadband plans, in chennai, in terms of quality and pricing?I have relocated to Chennai, and I'm searching for a good, unlimited home broadband plan, within Rs.1000/-
BSNL and Airtel provide good plans at the rate you are willing to pay. I think there is a Rs 750 plan fro BSNL that is unlimited. That is what my parents use. If I remember correctly, it is good for browsing, ok for youtube and bad for downloads.    Embed Quote
