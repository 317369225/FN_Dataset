★What's the best residential ISP in Mountain View, CA?Looking for speed, reliability, and value.
If you can get Sonic.net Fusion, take it! 20 megabits, $40/mo. Comes with one POTS (not VOIP!) phone line. You can also get 40 megabits/2 phone lines for $70. These guys have the best support, and won't try to upsell you a modem or overcharge for installation. If you call them, they'll google the manual for your existing ADSL2+ modem, if you have one, and walk you through setting it up to their service. I've never been put on hold while calling them, and last time I checked, there were no phone trees to deal with. A live human operator based in the States answered. No cable is included, but if you just need internet, or internet + phone, you can't beat Sonic. They do not throttle BitTorrent, and promise to never throttle traffic. They are purely an ISP, and don't have any interests in media. If they receive a DMCA notice, they will pass it on to you without revealing your identity. Sonic.net has a strict privacy policy as well. They will not release any information without your permission, unless they "receive a legitimate, legally-mandated request for customer information, Sonic.net, Inc. will respond only within the narrow scope of that request." They keep only the minimum amount of logging mandated by law, and nothing more.    Embed Quote
