★Has Spidigo (ISP) blocked torrent (P2P) in Ahmedabad since today?Since this morning, My torrent client is stucked on "connecting to peers". Lot of my friends who live in different parts of Ahmedabad and has Spidigo as ISP has same problem. Have they really blocked the peer to peer network?
The worst service I've ever experienced. The technicians claim to be punctual and very responsive to the complaints. However, the internet service is so pathetic that I'd rather like to become one of their technicians to be able to make the network contiguous. They throttle speeds every now and then and every other day you have to keep complaining for something or the other. The network is not reliable for connectivity and webpages do not respond due to multiple redirected pings. I believe making a switch from BSNL to spidigo was a huge mistake. stay away...    Embed Quote
