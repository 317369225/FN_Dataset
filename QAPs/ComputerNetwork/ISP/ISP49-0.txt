★Has Spidigo (ISP) blocked torrent (P2P) in Ahmedabad since today?Since this morning, My torrent client is stucked on "connecting to peers". Lot of my friends who live in different parts of Ahmedabad and has Spidigo as ISP has same problem. Have they really blocked the peer to peer network?
Blocked a torrent? I have faced problems loading even basic sites like google, yahoo or facebook. Forget downloading, count yourself lucky if you are atleast able to surf the net with an average speed. After using spidigo for 3 years, one thing I have realised  is that it was worse than the worst internet connection  in ahmedabad. Poor network connection, pathetic customer  care executives, speed that  they never provide, minimum  5 calls per week to their indifferent customer care department  for one complain  or the other. If you want to boil  your blood every  time your important  work gets stuck ; more often ;  then go for Spidigo!!    Embed Quote
