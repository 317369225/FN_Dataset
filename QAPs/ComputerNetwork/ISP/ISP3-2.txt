★What is the best internet/ISP service in Pune?I hear that Airtel is providing their 4G service in Pune. Is it good? http://www.airtel.in/forme/wirel...
Well, it all depends on the locality where you want to use the internet. I've lived in couple of different localities in past 11 months and I can firmly say that the ISP quality varies from place to place. For instance, Tikona is good in Wanawadi, Hadapsar area. While, it is not so good when compared to other ISPs in Pimple Nilakh, Pimple Saudagar, Baner area. Currently, I'm using Airtel broadband service and it works absolutely fine. I've received fairly good reviews for Airtel and Tata Docomo in areas like Baner, Pimple Saudagar, Vishal Nagar (Jagtap Dairy), Aundh, Wakad. Bottom line: Do some research based on local residents' internet vendors and settle down for the one which provides a good connection with affordable pricing.    Embed Quote
