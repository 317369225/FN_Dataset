★What is the best internet/ISP service in Pune?I hear that Airtel is providing their 4G service in Pune. Is it good? http://www.airtel.in/forme/wirel...
DNA Internet all the way! The speeds are just too good to be believed! It's like 'Pehle istemaal kare fir vishwaas kare'! YouTube buffering is now a thing of the past, torrents download at speeds above 1 MBps, consistently! Yeah, MBps, with a capital B! Even the most complex websites open in a flash! How I wish I had switched to DNA before itself instead of suffering, crying tears of blood waiting for websites to open and videos to buffer! And yes, it's very cheap! The lowest priced unlimited data plans start from 2300/- for a duration of 3 months! And mind you, but I have this exact plan, the one with the lowest speed, 1.2 Mbps! In short, 'Isko laga daala, to life jhingalala!'    Embed Quote
