★Internet Piracy: Can we stop American ISPs from spying on us?
Yep. There's always a way. For example, in China they have the Golden Shield. Many people can argue that this would start happening with America. I doesn't matter that USA is doing for copyright reasons, what would matter to people is the US is spying on us (China has about 30,000 people watching the internet for crimes, and people would worry about becoming more like China).    Embed Quote
