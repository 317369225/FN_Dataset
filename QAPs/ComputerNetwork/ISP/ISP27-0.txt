★Which ISP provides the best broadband plans, in chennai, in terms of quality and pricing?I have relocated to Chennai, and I'm searching for a good, unlimited home broadband plan, within Rs.1000/-
If your budget is below Rs. 1000, I doubt if you would get a reliable connection. Most of the local connections in Chennai are pretty bad in terms of coverage and customer service and also gets disconnected frequently. Airtel is a bit costly but very good. You can try BSNL - it seems to be the best option for you.    Embed Quote
