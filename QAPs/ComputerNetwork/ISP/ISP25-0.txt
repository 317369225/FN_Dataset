★What is the best ISP in Menlo Park?We're downtown on Santa Cruz/Chestnut st but it seems that nobody delivers fast internet around here?
That depends where you live in MP. I've used AT&T and Comcast most recently. Comcast was able to deliver faster broadband service than AT&T where I am located in the Willows.    Embed Quote
