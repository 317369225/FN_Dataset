★What kind of data is stored by your ISP?I read that there is legislation/regulation pending that would require ISPs to record and keep data for six months. This includes IP addresses of customers, communication via IM, Skype etc. How would that even work? Also, I assumed they kept records of the IP assignments pretty much forever. What is the current policy?
Everything you see, could also be seen by the isp or agencies given permission to view your activities. For the more paranoid or security conscious encryption / proxies / tor? could be an option. Or maybe avoid breaking the law?    Embed Quote
