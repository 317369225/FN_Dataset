★What is the best internet/ISP service in Pune?I hear that Airtel is providing their 4G service in Pune. Is it good? http://www.airtel.in/forme/wirel...
Undoubtedly DNA Internet....!! I , along with three flatmates have been using DNA from last four months. And netspeed is just AWESOME...!!  it literally gives more speed than your net plan actually allots you. My plan is 1.2 Mbps for three months at just  Rs 2300.. Just to give you an idea..this is what I get on torrent-- ​ ​at the same time my two friends were watching YouTube videos on 720p quality..! We've named our WiFi  'Dracarys' ( Only GOT aficionados would get it :p. As dragon unleashes fire, our net unleashes awesome speed ! )    Embed Quote
