★Which ISP is most reliable in Capitol Hill, Seattle? Comcast or Centurylink?I am moving to the capitol hill neighborhood and my building is serviced by centurylink and comcast. I will be using the connection to do lots of streaming, so I will probably go with the 20Mbps speed with either provider. I see Comcast costs significantly more, but I am willing to pay the premium if it reflects better reliability and customer service.
I don't know about Centurylink, but Comcast is terrible.    Embed Quote
