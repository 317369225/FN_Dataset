★What is the best ISP (Internet Service Provider) in Spain?Professional purpose, not for downloading/uploading big files.
My experience with ONO is just awful. I pay for 50mbps and get 10 through ethernet and 5 through wifi. I have made several complaints and their general response is I must have a virus. Really!!! A virus!? Then it must be on all my devices 2 laptops, 2 iPads, 2 iPhones, 2 apple tv's, xbox cause my connection sucks on all of them! I have even tried turning off all devices except one, turning of my cordless phones in case of channel interference. and still it sucks! I would love to know if anyone in Palma de Mallorca gets a high internet connection that they pay for?    Embed Quote
