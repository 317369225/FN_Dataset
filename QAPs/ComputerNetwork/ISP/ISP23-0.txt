★What is the best ISP to use in Boston?Moving to USA later this year, I want to get a really good internet connection (at least 20mbps) as I don't plan on having Cable. I'd like to be able to use Netflix, Hulu, p2p. Any suggestions?
Verizon's FiOS is available in a number of suburbs close to Boston.  If you live in a place where it's available, I'd recommend it over Comcast.    Embed Quote
