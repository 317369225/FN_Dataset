★How many man-hours would be required to write a J2EE application server?What is the number of man hours required to implement a fully J2EE compliant app server like JBoss ? I assume its a fairly complex task to implement an app server. How many man hours would be required to implement  workable model of web-container + servlet container like Tomcat ?
I hate to go for the cop-out answer, but yeah, it really depends on the experience of the one doing it.  If you're talking about someone who is intimately familiar with the spec, and possibly had contributed to a previous effort, it could be an order of magnitude faster than an equally skilled developer tackling the same problem.  Is this completely from scratch?  How many components are you going to allow to be used? I don't think Shiva's comparing it to the development time of JBoss or Tomcat is fair, as those evolved over time, along with the spec.  If you take a snapshot of the spec and attempt to implement that, it's a static target that would take much less time to do. I appreciate the A2A, but I'm just short on time to answer this thoroughly, so you can expect a credit refund shortly.
