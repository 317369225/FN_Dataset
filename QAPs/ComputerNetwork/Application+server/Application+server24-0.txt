â˜…What is the difference between a web server, an application server, and a database server?
Basically, a server is a software that runs continuously and responds to requests by other pieces of software, usually called a client. Communication between a client and a server happens using a specific protocol, HTTP for example. Web servers primarily respond to HTTP / HTTPS requests. Application servers respond to any number of protocols depending on the application business logic. Database servers use protocols ODBC, JDBC, etc. One other way these servers differ is by their function. Web server returns responses that can be viewed on a web browser. Application servers are custom designed and only a client built for the express purpose of interpreting its responses can read them.
