â˜…What are JEE web servers and application servers?I need to know the definition of 1) JEE web servers 2) application serevrs. And 3) their functions and differences.
Thanks for A2A, If you search for "web server vs application server", "apache vs tomcat", "tomcat is a web server vs application server" there are lot of answers and conclusions which seems very confusing for a beginner. Lets consider a java web application and its architecture. A request made by client and flows in the following way. HTTP Server : Manages client and gives response to every client request. Web Container : Can run simple Java code like Servlet, JSP. (As per the MVC pattern, JSP is the View and Servlet is the Controller and No business logic is written in JSP/Servlet. But these patterns are maintained for larger applications whereas for small applications business logic is written in simple java classes or in servlet or in jsp) EJB Container : Runs main java app components, say EJB components and so on, where the business logic is focused. For smaller applications EJB modules is not needed. DB Server : As we know it is the database server such as Oracle, MySql, SqlServer. SCENARIO 2 : APACHE TOMCAT A client request is handled by Apache Tomcat. You may try to differenciate between apache and tomcat. Yes they are different. Apache is the HTTP Server and Tomcat is the Web Container. They both are combined to refer as Web Server. Some may say wrongly that Apache is WebServer and Tomcat is App Server. But the fact is Tomcat is only has a WebContainer (also hence known as WebServer only) So Tomcat is not a J2EE Server SCENARIO 1 : JBOSS JBOSS is a example for perfect J2EE Server. It has both Web Server (Web Container) and Application server (EJB Container) in it and can run EJB components. Here Tomcat is not needed as JBOSS has an in-built webserver. Other J2EE servers are IBM WebSphere, Oracle/BEA WebLogic, TomEE, Glassfish falls under same scenario. Hope you are clear now. - Andro Babu
