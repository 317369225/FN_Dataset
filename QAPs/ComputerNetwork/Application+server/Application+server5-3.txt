â˜…What are the major differences between Glassfish and Jetty application servers?
Here is what I have gathered till now: 1. Jetty is the easiest solution to appify your system by embedding jetty inside your server. 2. Jetty has proved to be a very apt solution for server push application by its continuation support. Also, picking up of project by eclipse sounds promising to me. 3. Glassfish has some very promising enhancements like admin console which jetty lacks. Although the purpose is always achieved with jetty too. So glassfish win over management. 4. Glassfish is a full JEE server where Jetty is just a web container. Jetty so is the lightest and fastest to get started if it serves your need. Although I will always suggest that pick up the features which has possible chances of bottlenecking your application. Choice among the two has always turned out to be contextual as both have some advantages over other. Also for hackers who want to manage EE components as load balancing etc. by themselves, jetty is the way to go. Deploy and keep modifying your application to handle load, performance and consistency according to your use cases.
