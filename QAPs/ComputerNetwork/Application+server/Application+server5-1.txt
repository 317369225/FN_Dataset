â˜…What are the major differences between Glassfish and Jetty application servers?
I didn't realise this before, but GlassFish is embeddable too: http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc... As I understand it, GlassFish is used as the reference implementation for JEE, so is usually the first to implement the new standards. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gla... Jetty advertises itself as a servlet container (as opposed to a full JEE application server) so I assume it doesn't necessarily have all of the functionality of a JEE app server. http://docs.codehaus.org/display...
