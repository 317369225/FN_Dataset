â˜…What are the major differences between Glassfish and Jetty application servers?
I've been trying to figure this out myself. After investigating Glassfish and Jetty on wikipedia, their vendor sites, and Stack Overflow, I decided to use Jetty for my first Java Application Server deployment. Here are some things I've noticed: Jetty is led by the Eclipse Foundation, an open-source organization, whereas GlassFish is led by Oracle. Jetty has an emphasis on being pluggable, and with Eclipse behind it, it's likely that it lives up to this goal. Jetty seems to be easier to embed. That would explain why Jetty, rather than glassfish or Tomcat, is used as the development server in Compojure 's examples.
