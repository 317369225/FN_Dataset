★What is the difference between the WebSphere and WebLogic application servers?
I have used both extensively in enterprise level J2EE environments - applications were content management and business processes (data transform, SOA etc) I can say in general I think WebLogic outperforms Websphere in most categories (transactions per seconds, memory usage, database usage, thread management and monitoring).  What I think is most important is WebLogic is much easier to use.  Out of the box the first time I used WebLogic to configure a simple database connection factory it took less than 5 minutes - docs were easy to find as well.  As for the WebSphere app server, that took more than 2 days - very poorly documented and very difficult to understand.  let me know if that helps or if you have more detailed questions.
