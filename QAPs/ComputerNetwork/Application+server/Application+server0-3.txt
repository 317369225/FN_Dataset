â˜…Which is the best application server for Ruby?Many servers exist, unicorn, apache(passenger), and so. Give me some advice.
I prefer Unicorn. Because I can configure it. Passenger is a nice option as well, but I typically go with Unicorn. If you are going to server your app to mobile devices Unicorn will knowing fail over anything but fast connections. 3G and EDGE will fail. There is a good solution that I'm currently putting in place for a client to use Rainbows!. Built out of Unicorn and good for slow clients. Configuration of Unicorn and Rainbows can be combined into one config file. Use (as typical) Nginx as the web server and proxy to the app servers. So configuration Nginx to send traffic to Rainbows or Unicorn based on a domain or directory is a must. But that's easy to do as well.
