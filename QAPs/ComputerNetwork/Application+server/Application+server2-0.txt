â˜…Can Clojure run inside application servers?Such as traditional Enterprise Java app servers, or servers specialized for Clojure.
Yes, Clojure web applications, based on Ring, can be packaged as WAR files and deployed to standard Java Servlet containers using the Ring plugin for Leiningen - https://github.com/weavejester/l... - in addition to the option to run directly on Jetty. Another option is to have your main web application Servlet - written in any JVM language - load Clojure dynamically by instantiating clojure.lang.RT and using that API to load (& compile) Clojure from the classpath and invoke() to call into the Clojure code. That's the approach we use at World Singles to execute a Clojure-based application model from within an existing web application (running on Tomcat, but it could just as easily be running on JBoss, Websphere or whatever). If (or when) we have a full Clojure web application, we would probably use lein-ring to package it as a WAR for deployment (although we like the flexibility of dynamically loading and compiling Clojure into an already running web application, so we might use a hybrid approach).
