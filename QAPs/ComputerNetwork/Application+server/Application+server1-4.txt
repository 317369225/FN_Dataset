â˜…What is the best .NET Application Server Monitoring Tool?Looking for something of similar capability as Fusion Reactor (http://www.fusion-reactor.com/fr/) with the ability to see what is literally happening inside the CLR / runtime.
For availability and performance monitoring, you can use .NET framework agent from IBM's ITCAM for Microsoft Applications package. For transaction monitoring, you can use .NET Data Collector from IBM's ITCAM for Transaction package. These are server class products, you might want to check what basically you want and whether it compensates well with the pricing. I think another product from Microsoft - AVIcode (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/s...) would be suitable for you.
