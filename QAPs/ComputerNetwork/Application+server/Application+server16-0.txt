â˜…Java Platform, Enterprise Edition: What is the difference between "middleware" and "application server?"Application servers like WebLogic and WebSphere are all used like middleware. What is the difference between these two concepts?
These terms have no formal definition and may have conflicting interpretations. Here's my take: "Middleware" means they sit between two types of systems. In this example, WebLogic and WebSphere are used to host apps or services that bridge the gap between the Java world and other systems in Enterprise Application Integration - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid... The term "Application server" tends to be used when their main purpose is to serve up the application features on its own or with a limited set of other systems such as a Relational Databases or NoSQL. "Middleware" is typically used when a commercial packaged product from the vendors, such as Oracle and IBM in this example, are used. These products are "higher up the stack" and run on top of the core Enterprise Java + Message Queuing platform. In contrast, "Application server' is typically used when the developer deploys their own bespoke code.
