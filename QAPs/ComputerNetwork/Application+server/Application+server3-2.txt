★What other application servers can be alternatives to GlassFish?
Glassfish is the JEE Reference Implementation (no supported version AFAIK) so assuming you want JEE there are 3 main options: JBoss (OSS, Community is free but unsupported, EAP is paid subscription version, Red Hat) Weblogic (Not OSS, Pay for License,  Oracle) Websphere (Not OSS, Pay for License, IBM) If you just need the servlet container: Tomcat (FOSS, Supported versions available from VMWare/Spring Source and Red Hat) Jetty (FOSS, no support AFAIK) Resin (FOSS, no support AFAIK) Note: Tomcat is the servlet container for JBoss AS/EAP. Cloud JEE Open Shift PaaS (JEE - JBoss, Red Hat) Servlet Container: Beanstalk PaaS (Servlet Container - Tomcat, Amazon) Tomcat PaaS (Cloud Foundry - Tomcat aka Spring tc.server, VMWare/Spring Source)
