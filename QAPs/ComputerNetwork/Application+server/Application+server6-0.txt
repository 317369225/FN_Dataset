★What Java EE application servers are used more often?While Glassfish and Tomcat are OSS the commerical counterparts like WebLogic, WebSphere and JBoss are doing well. Which ones are being used the most in real deployments at medium and large companies? Which ones are used more commonly for commercial applications like ERP, WCM and portals?
In an abstract sense, Tomcat is by far the mostly widely used "web app server", since most of the open source implementations (including both JBoss and Glassfish) are derived from Tomcat. By revenue, WebLogic is by far the most commercially successful application server, with close to 1 out of ever 2 dollars spent. Additionally, and against many analyst projections, over the past few years (at Oracle), the WebLogic business has been growing steadily. IBM WebSphere is in solid #2 place in terms of commercial application servers. Redhat/JBoss arguably has the strongest commercial presence of any of the open source application servers. Overall, the field of solutions is very diverse, healthy and growing. For  the sake of full disclosure, I work at Oracle, including on the Java EE platform and on WebLogic.
