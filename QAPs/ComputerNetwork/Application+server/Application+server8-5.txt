★What is the difference between an application server and a web server?
A Web Server understands and supports only HTTP protocol whereas an Application Server supports HTTP,TCP/IP and many more protocols. As the name implies, an application server hosts instances of a   specific application, but   provides a great deal of other functionality as well.  The   application server provides most of the business logic that may be needed in order to process   requests from the client application. Webserver delegation model is fairly simple,when the request comes into the  webserver,it simply passes the request to the program best able to handle  it(Server side program). It may not support transactions and database connection  pooling. Application server is more capable of dynamic  behaviour than webserver. We can also configure application server to work as a  webserver.Simply application server is a superset of webserver. Reference : App server, Web server: What's the difference?
