â˜…What is Apache and Tomcat? If Apache is Web Server, can we call Tomcat Application Server?
Apache (The Apache Software Foundation) by itself is just a software foundation that develops open source software (apache license). Apache HTTP Server and Tomcat are two such softwares. Apache Tomcat - Welcome! is just a webserver that can handle Servlet and JSP technologies. With the advent of Spring and other lightweight frameworks, tomcat is being extensively used where you would use a traditional application server like JBoss (Community driven open source middleware) or WebLogic (Oracle WebLogic Server) or WebSphere (WebSphere software). Apache TomEE is enterprise version of tomcat which can be considered more of an Application Server. How to use If you are developing a static webpage (with HTML and Javascript), then Apache HttpServer should be good enough. This could be the starting point for deploying your pages and accessing it in your browser. If you are developing a webapp which requires some processing for the client on the server, then you could write servlets/jsp and that app would be deployed in Tomcat. I If it's a highly used webapp and it has some static content, then you can use webserver as frontend which serves that and tomcat to return servlet data. Please note: Just a simplified explanation for beginners - there are way too many features in apache httpserver and tomcat.
