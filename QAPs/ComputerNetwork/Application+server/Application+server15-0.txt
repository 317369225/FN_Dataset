â˜…What are the major differences between Tomcat and Jetty application servers?This is a follow-up question to What are the major differences between Glassfish and Jetty application servers?.
In the same way that Glassfish is a larger, more feature-rich server than Tomcat, Tomcat, though fairly lightweight, is larger and more feature-rich than Jetty. Jetty is a very lightweight, embedable server. It is frequently used in development environments, because it can be very quickly launched and restarted. It is also sometimes embedded in stand-alone applications that wish to provide a web interface.
