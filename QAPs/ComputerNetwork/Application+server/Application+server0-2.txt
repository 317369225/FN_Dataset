â˜…Which is the best application server for Ruby?Many servers exist, unicorn, apache(passenger), and so. Give me some advice.
Lame, Qualified Answer: It depends on the problem you're trying to solve. Passenger's wicked fast to set up; Unicorn seem to be regarded as having better sustained performance under consistently high loads. You should also consider at what stage your project is, how much you'll benefit by investing in this choice now versus later, the likely costs of switching when you find that the choice you made has an unforeseeable shortcoming which cripples your apps performance, blah blah blah-blah-blah. That said, here's one recent set of benchmarking data which suggests that Passenger wins overall, though Unicorn is slightly more efficient in CPU usage: http://torquebox.org/news/2011/0...
