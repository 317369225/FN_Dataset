â˜…What is the difference between an application server and a web server?
Application server is a fancy name for a web server that has some 'facilities' for exposing web services and 'applications' in general. Unless your web server serves only static files, your web server is already an application server. I think the term 'Application server' was given back when they tried to find a proper name for what is a web server that serves Java servlets. Which is another fancy name for something that you shouldn't even bother to know, unless you really use that. As far as I remember, servlets were superseded by 'beans', but I can't be quite sure since I have huge intolerance to bullsh**. Now, if you really want to know what an 'application server' is, it is a 'buzzword', something used by salesmen to sale expensive solutions to people that don't really need them.
