â˜…Where can I find real life examples of web application server side architecture?I want to see how successful companies built their site. I'm interested in database schema, models and relationships
If you're specifically interested in database schema etc., a really good read is; Livejournal's Backend: A history of Scaling http://danga.com/words/2005_osco... It's getting a little old now, as scaling approaches go but it's a really nice description of growing from one MySQL database to many. Otherwise there's plenty of real life architecture war stories happening at http://highscalability.com/blog/...
