★How can we disable newrelic agent in production without restarting the rails application servers?We are planning to use newrelic in our production rails servers. We have 8 applicatioon servers and restarting the application almost takes 15 -20 minutes. I would like to disable newrelic agents without restarting our rails app. How can we do that ?
Unfortunately, that's not possible.  The New Relic agent automatically instruments many classes in rails as well as your own application at startup time, and the only way to remove that instrumentation is to restart your app with the agent turned off. That having been said, you shouldn't need to turn off our agent.  We designed our agent so that there is no need to ever turn it off.  The agent has low overhead, suitable for 24x7 production use, and monitors every page request for large rails sites such as Groupon, Zynga (words with friends), 37Signals and Yellowpages.com.  So the real question is, why would you want to turn off our agent?  (If cost is an issue, you can adjust your new relic service level from free to paid by the hour or month within our web UI.) I encourage you to drop our support team a line at support@newrelic.com if you have further questions or if - heaven forbid - an issue in our agent is impacting your ability to use us in production all the time.  Thanks!
