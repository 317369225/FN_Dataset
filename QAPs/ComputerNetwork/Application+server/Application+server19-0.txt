â˜…Where can I find real life examples of web application server side architecture?I want to see how successful companies built their site. I'm interested in database schema, models and relationships
if you are looking for scalability, there is a good book by the guy called Cal Henderson, called "Building scalable Web Sites". I'd also recommend you watch youtube specifically there are some google lectures from the guys that started youtube. they talk about some of the stuff they went through. Reading the google docs on BigTable and their other backend stuff gives you some ideas.
