â˜…What are the major differences between Glassfish and Jetty application servers?
Jetty has been really good at providing an embedded API for the longest time but as Paul noticed GlassFish is getting there as well. These two servers really come from different angles. GlassFish a complete Java EE server (web tier, transactional support, persistence, web services) with clustering, monitoring, etc... while Jetty is focused on begin a (good) servlet container. Full-blown App Servers have been making a lot of progress lately in becoming less monolithic and more modular (lazy loading, pay-per-use, ...) to the point where they can now be used in many more cases. GlassFish certainly does a lot of that with its use of OSGi, lazy-loading of services and "a la carte" server using the update center. For the record, GlassFish 3.1 should be out soon (early 2011).
