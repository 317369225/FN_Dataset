â˜…Is there any site that runs completely on PL/SQL as its application server instead of application server like PHP, JSP, ASP.Net?If there is any existing web site, please mention
I can point you to Oracle Application Express and Formspider. These are PLSQL technologies that allow you to build dynamic web sites. As both technologies run on an Oracle database, applications built on top of PLSQL are mostly data and form oriented, such as ERP and CRM. Hence, all well-known solutions run on Intranets rather then being open to public. These technologies are not suitable for developing general purpose Web sites due to cost, flexibility, and scalability. You could still achieve responsive and nice looking sites by mixing in additional technologies such as CSS and JavaScript, though.
