â˜…What Java EE application servers are used more often?While Glassfish and Tomcat are OSS the commerical counterparts like WebLogic, WebSphere and JBoss are doing well. Which ones are being used the most in real deployments at medium and large companies? Which ones are used more commonly for commercial applications like ERP, WCM and portals?
zeroturnaround made a nice survey about that Mostly the free ones: Tomcat and Jboss and then there is a fierce battle between Websphere and Weblogic... glassfish should be coming back any time soon (or maybe not). The survey was also about "time lost restarting", very funny survey BTW. Survey Results: The Java EE Container Redeploy & Restart Report - measuring Turnaround Time
