â˜…What is the difference between an application server and a web server?
Typically a web server is software which listens to some TCP port (typically 80). It can receive an HTTP request and is capable of responding with an HTTP response. The HTTP response could be generated from a static file, or it could be generated by a script or program. Within the context of Java, a web server is typically a Java process which is capable of delegating the processing of a request to Servlets and JSP's. An application server on the other hand does everything a web server can do and more. Among the other things an application server does is support the JavaEE specification by being able to support EJB's, JPA, etc. For example Tomcat is a web server, and JBoss is an application server. Summary In Java, a web server supports a subset of the JavaEE specification - typically Servlets, and JSP. While an application server supports the entire JavaEE specification - Servlet, JSP, EJB, Web Services, JPA, etc.
