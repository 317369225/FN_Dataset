★Can VoIP ever have latency as low as a "regular" phone line?
VOIP latency is a major issue that most of the users face and it is undoubtedly irritating. There may be two practical reasons for this: 1)     Most of the times, it is the bandwidth that offers this trouble. Business organizations that have VOIP applications running on their internet channel usually share the bandwidth over VOIP and other operations. Assuming that the other operations would not occupy considerable bandwidth is what causes problems. Many times, when some download is going on, your employees often start feeling that the speed is slow. If at that time, calls come in, the VOIP channel is likely to get disturbed. So, it is a better option to segregate the bandwidth in such a way that there is always greater bandwidth available for calls than the maximum number of calls experienced at any time in the past. This will make your VOIP application more efficient. 2)     In case your bandwidth is good and the system has been configured in the aforementioned way, the other issue may be in the routes that you are taking. There is a simple method to find out if this problem is in the routes. If you notice that there are certain destinations to which the calls face issues, it is definitely an issue of the routes. This happens when your provider offers lower ACD (Average Call Duration) and ASR (Average Success Rate) and there is considerable PDD (Post Dial Delay). This problem can be solved by contacting your provider and asking him to replace the routes that have been offering your trouble. If things are set in this particular manner, the VOIP channel is also likely to deliver latency as low as the regular phone lines.    Embed Quote
