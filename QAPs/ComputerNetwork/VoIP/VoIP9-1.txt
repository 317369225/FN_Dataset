★What do you think the future of VoIP will be?
I can see VoIP really gaining some traction in a few years, once ISPs lower costs and the platform is standardized.   If ISPs start charging for bandwidth speed as opposed to data caps, I think you'll see VoIP take off. It would be very cheap for international calls but with lower prices would also be cheap for domestic calls as well.   Also, the platform needs to be standardised. I should be able to talk to any person on any VoIP platform, without having to be on the same platform nor know them as a contact.    Embed Quote
