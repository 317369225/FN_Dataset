★Can VoIP ever have latency as low as a "regular" phone line?
Short answer is "yes" When someone says "VoIP", most people think of it with soft phones in their phones or computers. However, this is not the only case. There are many millions of people around the world who use VoIP at home/work without knowing it that it is VoIP. In that case, calls are handled by VoIP products until the last mile. A PSTN home user can be migrated to become a VoIP user at a night and he will notice nothing. So, there is no problem with VoIP. The reason why it works so well in the cases I describe is, those are completely closed networks that are carefully designed to manage VoIP data. So, the operator can control the bandwidth, QoS, redundancy without considering infinite parameters that will arise when you do this in a heterogenous network. Most people who have bad experience with VoIP are customers of small VoIP providers. When you are not an operator, VoIP is a very challenging market with very low profit margins. Even cents are important. This situation cause those businesses to decrease their costs by hurting the quality, choosing the cheapest trunks possible to switch to PSTN, or do any other things to decrease bandwidth usage. So, VoIP as a technology stack, is capable of providing experience equal (or better) to PSTN. However, providers pick their own path about how to implement these.    Embed Quote
