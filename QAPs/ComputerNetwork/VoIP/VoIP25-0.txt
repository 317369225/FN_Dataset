★Why does VoIP suck?Why do I always lose packets, and why does it seem to falter over time? Is this a hardware problem or a software problem? Is unreliabity built in to the system somehow?
When VoIP service is properly implemented, there's no discernible difference from traditional landline service. When users complain about call quality due to packet loss, the source of the dropped packets is usually in one of two places: The connection to the user's Internet telephone service provider is shared with general data, and their perimeter device does not prioritize VoIP packets. The Internet service provider's infrastructure, between the ISP and the user, is not reliably transporting data, resulting in dropped packets.    Embed Quote
