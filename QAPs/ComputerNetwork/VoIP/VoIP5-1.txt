★What is the best VoIP infrastructure service, API or open source solution to use for a mobile VoIP app?The mobile app is a SIP client.
A really great easy to use service is apparently (cause I haven't used it yet) http://www.TWILIO.com  The usual suspects are Asterisk (especially) and FreeSwitch, but you've got several others besides. http://www.asterisk.org/ http://www.opensip.org http://www.kamailio.org/ http://www.iptel.org/sems http://www.freeswitch.org/ http://www.freepbx.org/  <-- this is a gui to asterisk http://www.sipwise.com/ http://www.flashpbx.com  <- this is really cool, based on asterisk http://sipwise.com Having installed and test driven SIPWISE's CE Edition (www.sipwise.com), I can recommend it, and am considering it for a mobile VOIP project that we are already selling and launching heavily next month. There may be some slight issues post install, like any other open source product, depending on your exact Debian distribution and libs, some downgrading of particular libs may be necessary. But once its running, its a charm. Its well though out, comprising an inbuilt SBC, high performance Kernel switching of RTP packets, uses Asterisk for VoiceMail, Percona mySQL supportering clustering, great simple Admin and User web interfaces!, SSL / security configs are easy, portal skinning options also, etc. and if its true that it can handle 2000 concurrent calls on a dual XENON 3GB box, then its simply a great product; especially for the type of heavy service provider use that a widespread consumer VOIP app would generate. 2600Hz.org You've also got some framework providers such as: 2600hz.org, that profess to provide a framework that is very scalable. Summary If its for mobile and you want to terminate on POTS, then you should start with a scalable architecture that can be built out as a service provider solution /telephony platform. Other than commercial service providers who I have spoken with, the only really capable open source platforms that I am aware of are:  - sipwise (which I have tested and recommend)  - 2600hz (tested, but  at the time of writing it was much more complicated to install and never did get it running properly even with some support help) Some tips from experience: VOIP soft-switches are notoriously resource and interrupt intensive, so you should not try this on EC2. EC2 also uses some tricky dynamic NAT, that play havoc with SIP. If you don't know how EC2 works, and why you should avoid it for this use case, then do some research. As your userbase grows, your system will also require quite a decent IO rate because of DB reads/writes (billing, config, even voice mail), and EC2 EBS performance is notoriously unreliable. Other For a small office solution (30 to 50 concurrent calls), then you can't rgo really wrong with Asterisk. If you have the time and would like to roll your own solution, then get the free book on the asterisk web site; or you can get something like FlashPBX.com which makes life a LOT easier.    Embed Quote
