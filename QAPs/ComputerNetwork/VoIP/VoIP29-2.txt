★What is the best VoIP service provider for multi-line business users?I need one now. AT&T is unable to provide us with adequate service.
Contrary to the suggestions about looking on a price / features comparison site I would totally ignore that cost approach and look at risk / value. One that provides the support and service you need Is accessible when you have a problem or question Has acceptable uptime with a decent SLA From the way the question is posed I doubt the small variations in pricing are as important to you are the business continuity aspect. Voice is mission critical to the function of many businesses and image suicide if it doesnt just work. Look for a recommendation from someone you trust, dont just scour the internet for the best price. That 5% saving will mean nothing if you have to spend 40 minutes on hold waiting for support or if you have a random problem nobody cares to fix.    Embed Quote
