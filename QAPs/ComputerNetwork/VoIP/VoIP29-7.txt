I do understand that it could be difficult when searching for the best VoIP provider, since most of them sound like their saying the same things over and over again. Just as most people that are considering VoIP, you are probably looking for the most affordable and reliable service. You also mentioned that you had a multi-line business, so you probably want a VoIP provider that can add these extensions for a fixed cost rather than with hidden fees and charges. Well, Telonium offers UNLIMITED phone extensions for a fixed price of  $24.95. Take a look at our press release to learn more for yourself: http://www.telonium.com/2011/05/...
