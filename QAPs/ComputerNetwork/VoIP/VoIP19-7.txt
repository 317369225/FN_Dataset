★Can VoIP ever have latency as low as a "regular" phone line?
Ever since the telecommunications industry existed, it's never been a technical specifications that dominated the quality of the call, but a human perception of the delivery. There's been studies done that human will not notice any annoyance when the round-trip delay is less than 250ms (1/4 second), which most "high-speed" broadband Internet services in US is able to meet. Because of the distributed nature of the Internet compared to the centralized architecture of PSTN, technically speaking, VoIP has typically higher latency then an analog line. However, UNLIKE PSTN, Internet is growing rapidly with Gigabit connections readily available in some areas of the US, VoIP has the possibility of surpassing the latency created by the copper wires.. But this is all technicality... Trust your ears!    Embed Quote
