★What are the best VoIP blogs out there?
I write and research for Business VoIP Phone Systems and Service for SMB | Tonka Teltec, LLC and although the blog is relatively new, I make sure to be up-to-date with the latest industry news so that we get to share and learn from each other, those in the same business or even those who are not. Our blog is at Smart VoIP Talk. Drop us a line or comment on this comment, would love to visit your company blogs as well!    Embed Quote
