★What is the best VOIP solution for a UK small business?Less than 10 users. I'm looking at Epygi PBX, Snom phones and VOIP Unlimited as a SIP provider but this is a new area for me and I don't know if there is a better option. Any experiences, pointers or tips would be great.
I ended up with 1) Epygi VOIP PBX, 2) Snom phones, 3) VOIP Unlimited for the SIP trunk, 4) Bria on my iPhone/iPad. Lots of stress getting it all working and there are still some weaknesses, eccentricities and failure modes. It is working now and does almost all of what was promised. However, if I was starting again today, knowing what I know now, I wouldn't go this route.    Embed Quote
