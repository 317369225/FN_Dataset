★How can echo be reduced in a VOIP call?I have a VOIP service setup on a softphone. When I make a call, the receiver hears an echo of his own voice with about a half to one second delay loud and clear. I don't hear any echo or have any problems with the call quality though. What causes this and how can it be reduced/eliminated?
You should ask your softphone provider company to use codec (G729,G711,G723 etc) that will help to reduce echo problem. Let me know if you need any help for the same.    Embed Quote
