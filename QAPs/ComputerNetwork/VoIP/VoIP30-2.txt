★What are some examples of the VoIP applications?
VoIP, by itself, does not need any application to run. There are two parts to an VoIP - hardware and software. Literally every computer, laptop, smartphone, tablet has all the hardware necessary for VoIP; essentially a speaker set, a microphone, amplifier, ADCs, and DACs. Now comes the tricky part. Let us say you have a laptop that is connected to the Net. can you make a VoIP call just like that? No. Why? Because you laptop will not know who to call or how to call. This is where the software comes in. The software essentially identifies you, identifies the party you want to call, and establishes a call session between the two of you. At the very basic level, that is all that is needed. Each VoIP provider then adds his own applications over and above these basic elements for adding the features and capabilities. Some of these provide a directory, call recording facilities, voice to text conversion, and a host of other features.
