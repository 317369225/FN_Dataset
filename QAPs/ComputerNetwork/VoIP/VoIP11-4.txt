★How can echo be reduced in a VOIP call?I have a VOIP service setup on a softphone. When I make a call, the receiver hears an echo of his own voice with about a half to one second delay loud and clear. I don't hear any echo or have any problems with the call quality though. What causes this and how can it be reduced/eliminated?
Since the far-end is hearing echo, the problem is at your end, i.e. your softphone/phone is not cancelling the echo. You can try one of the following: Use headsets - if possible. This should solve the problem completely. Lower the volume of your speakers, and/or the gain on your microphone. Check any setting for echo cancellation in your softphone/phone. Install a dedicated software to reduce the echo. If you are using a phone, then you can use a product called Personal PBXMate. For softphones, you can use a product called SoliCall Pro.
