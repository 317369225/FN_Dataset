★What do you think the future of VoIP will be?
The 134 year old circuit/switch public telephone network is already replaced by VOIP in a third of the US.  A DC advisory group has targeted June 2018 for it to be completely replaced.  Inbound and outbound call centers and enterprise organizations that have invested in technology that is built on the legacy network will need to adapt or die.  This will be huge upheaval over the next 5 years. However the single most important thing that VOIP does is to combine voice internet and mobile on one platform.  It's not that far of a stretch to imagine being able to know the location of callers that are calling in or to be able to use voice commands on the phone to send documents to your caller when you are traveling for example.    Embed Quote
