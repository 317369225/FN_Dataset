★Can VoIP ever have latency as low as a "regular" phone line?
As opposed to those who say simply "yes" or "no" I offer the following...it depends. Further, given a healthy network, it doesn't matter. There are absolutes in IP networks that cannot be overcome. Packetization, buffering, etc all add to the overall amount of latency experience on a call. Even on an extremely healthy IP network there will be some amount of latency that cannot be avoided. Call paths are another variable, often one beyond end user control. The call path is impacted by peering, where companies exchange traffic. This applies to both IP and TDM networks. What matters is the aggregate latency for a given call on a given day, regardless of the network technology. My own experience is that IP based calls can be as good or even better than TDM calls. I say better because much of my calling is to people I work with, who are also using IP connected devices. We pass SIP traffic directly, allowing us to experience the superior audio of HDVoice calls. When SIP is allowed to operate as designed the call media flows between the end-points in a peer-to-peer fashion. Thus the call path can be very short.    Embed Quote
