★What is the best VOIP solution for a UK small business?Less than 10 users. I'm looking at Epygi PBX, Snom phones and VOIP Unlimited as a SIP provider but this is a new area for me and I don't know if there is a better option. Any experiences, pointers or tips would be great.
I will tell you about Order | Voicemail Greeting. My one friend id using their service for his business. I have talked to him and he told me that he is happy. So, if you want you can make a try. I wish it will help you.    Embed Quote
