★Can VoIP ever have latency as low as a "regular" phone line?
VoIP calls can get very close in latency terms to a voice call. As Marco Laurenzano said, most voice calls are now routed in digital form, often in IP form (more often than most people realize). So the difference should be imperceptible. As for your actual problem, you should try a few things: Try pinging popular hosts, such as www.google.com and stuff like that. Check how many miliseconds are you getting. If you're getting delays in the hundreds of miliseconds, then you probably have a network issue with you provider. It can be in their backbone or in the access network. Note that if you are over a cable modem with too much noise, the delay in the access network will get very high, because of the error correction mechanism that is used by the DOCSIS standard. Try calling someone with Skype. If it works, again, the problem is with your provider. QoS settings can be of some help, but it's probably limited. Your QoS settings will probably have only local effect. If you have the habit of running high volume downloads or are a heavy user of P2P software, you may need QoS to reserve some bandwidth for your voice calls.    Embed Quote
