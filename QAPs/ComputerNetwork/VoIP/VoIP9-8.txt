★What do you think the future of VoIP will be?
I believe ATT has applied to the Federal Government for permission to shut down their PSTN switches and completely close POTS by 2015. But, that is not the only thing that will happen. VoIP, by itself, has reached it's zenith of development and achievement. After all what more can you do with voice as such? Add slightly better resolution, more clarity? After that costs will start raising it's head, and you will have to start wondering what additional value you will get from a $30 a month subscription as compared to a $25 one. The things to note are what VoIP can do as part of a larger communication paradigm. At a personal level, VoIP will be mixed with images  and video for interaction between friends and family members. But what is more in interesting are the offers such as Toshiba's IP Telephone Systems that makes business conversations so much more interactive and purposeful. With VoIP forming a part of Unified Communications, business people can exchange data instantly, share information on their screens, analyse data together and so on. This will make inter-company meetings so much more meaningful and productive. Emails, to a certain extent, reduced human interaction in business interactions. VoIP, along with other tools, will increase human face to face interaction in business circles significantly.    Embed Quote
