★What are the advantages of SIP for VoIP?
SIP is just a protocol, and, by itself does not provide any advantage. It is how it is used that matters. SIP is a setup protocol that works at the application layer. It biggest strength over other protocols is that it can handle multi-media sessions. Today when you talk about SIP, most people refer to SIP-trunking (Toshiba's SIP Trunking I-VoIP Service), wherein you can increase the reach of your VoIP beyond your local call area. In addition, if both parties have the right end devices, SIP-trunking can extend full multi-media sessions both ways.    Embed Quote
