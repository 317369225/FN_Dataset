★What are the best VOIP service providers and what distinguishes them?
It depends on what you're looking for and who you are... whether you're an ITSP, carrier, office looking for a hosted VoIP alternative, or a developer looking to build on top of a telephony platform. Full disclosure, I work at a company called 2600hz. We're a VoIP infrastructure company that just launched a telephony platform called Kazoo. We love communications, VoIP, telephony, developers, apps, etc :) It has all the features you'd expect from any VoIP solution like: rule-based call forwarding intuitive drag and drop web interface to manage everything ring groups (contact sales department auto attendants "You've reached Mike's Bike Shop. To reach Sales, press 1.." inbound faxing conference calling We're currently giving away free invitations to our BETA. You get five free seats (and new number included!) and some credit to start making calls and test out all the features/developer API tools. If you're interested you can request an invite at http://kazoo.io Our main website can give you a better idea: http://2600hz.com    Embed Quote
