★What is the best VoIP infrastructure service, API or open source solution to use for a mobile VoIP app?The mobile app is a SIP client.
If you want to use a mobile SIP client, you will need a SIP softswitch and a provisioning environment when you need to create a large amount of accounts . You also need a media proxy for endpoints behind NAT and a gateway if you want to terminate calls to TDM endpoints. For the softswitch and media proxy there are many open source solutions. TDM gateways are a different story. Then there is the question about billing of course and a lot of other nice things to consider like emergency calls or LI, etc. But to get good quality calls the most important choice is that of the audio codec. SILK is my advice for this purpose. It holds up well on WiFi and 3G.    Embed Quote
