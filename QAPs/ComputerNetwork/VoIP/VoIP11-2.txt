★How can echo be reduced in a VOIP call?I have a VOIP service setup on a softphone. When I make a call, the receiver hears an echo of his own voice with about a half to one second delay loud and clear. I don't hear any echo or have any problems with the call quality though. What causes this and how can it be reduced/eliminated?
Echo is typically produced when the speakers used to listen to the phone call actually feed the microphone used for the same conversation. Usually, if using the same device for speakers (output device) and microphone (input device) most devices and even VoIP applications have echo canceling. Echo is canceled because when the speakers are used the microphone mutes, automatically so that it won't create that feedback. If you however, use airplay for example or any other speaker as an output device and use your Mac or PC's microphone, there is no way for the microphone to know when to mute because the speakers our output device belong to a separate piece of hardware. USB Headsets have echo canceling capabilities built in so consider this option if nothing else is working as you expect. If you have an IP Phone and there is no hands-free or speakerphone device being used, the echo most probably comes from the public switched telephone network, the legacy voice network. Echo however can be caused by an error in the CoDec (codification-decodification) packet organization but it is a rare situation these days.    Embed Quote
