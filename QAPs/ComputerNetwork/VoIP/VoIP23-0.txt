★Which VoIP services offer high-quality voice?In Verizon FiOS: How clear is FiOS digital voice?, it is stated that FiOS uses the same compression algorithm as traditional landline service. Are there service providers who deliver better quality, ideally with both wider-band codec and some traffic policy / QoS
Wideband codecs won't improve call quality when calling landlines, because the traditional packet switched telephone network (PSTN) is exclusively G.711(μlaw) in North America. Traffic prioritization for QoS is generally handled on the customer's end; there are a wide assortment of traffic-shaping-capable appliances available, including many consumer routers. --Call quality that is on-par with Verizon's digital voice service should be possible with most VoIP providers. I've had good luck with Flowroute(http://flowroute.com/) for wholesale service (they also provide $0.25 of call credits to test their service). If you're looking for for a dirt-cheap alternative to Verizon's voice service (voicemail, call forwarding, etc.), Sipgate One (http://www.sipgate.com/one) might be an acceptable option. You will just need to purchase an FXS analog telephone adapter (ATA), if you want to continue using your household telephone.    Embed Quote
