★Can VoIP ever have latency as low as a "regular" phone line?
VoIP latency is a function of your network connection and the equipment/provider involved, not a limitation of VoIP itself. Yes, there is more that can go wrong with VoIP than a copper phone line but that does not make it inferior. With a decent connection and a decent provider you should not notice latency and the call should be indistinguishable from a PSTN call. Simwood customers enjoy HD voice which enables voice quality which greatly exceeds that of the PSTN, although like any VoIP that requires a stable network connection underneath. VoIP ceased being the poor relation to the PSTN many years ago and is mainstream now, even transparently underlying PSTN calls passed between carriers, but the advent of HD unlocks its full potential to finally surpass the PSTN.    Embed Quote
