Tango sells content that helps people share their feelings: our animations, the Tango Surprises help you say I love you or have fun with your friends or your kids, our greeting cards allow you to show you're thinking about your loved ones on different occasions. I love this model because it is so multi-faceted and it ends up creating a better experience for the people that upgrade while keeping a clean experience for the others.    Embed Quote
