★What are the best VOIP service providers and what distinguishes them?
There are a lot of VoIP applications available today such as Viber, Line2, Vonage, SipGate, Gizmo5. Which one's best depends from user to user and what your requirements are. For instance, whether you need an app that works well even in poor WiFi connectivity, or that provides a cheaper calling rate to the country you need to call to. VoIP based apps, however, have their cons. Not everyone has a stable and strong data/WiFI connection all the time, and even if they do, they often end up paying a higher amount for using that data. Plus, you won't always find WiFi connectivity while on the go. To address this need, we've recently launched Ringo, an international calling app that converts international calls to local calls, and offers calling rates cheaper than most VoIP based apps. It works without the internet, so you can make calls from Ringo, on the go. You can read more about Ringo at http://www.ringo.co.    Embed Quote
