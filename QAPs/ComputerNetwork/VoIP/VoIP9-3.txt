★What do you think the future of VoIP will be?
I concur with the answer about WebRTC being the future of voice over IP. Voice over the Internet Protocol or VoIP, has many shapes and forms, from OTT services like skype and FaceTime to cloud phone systems and hosted contact centers like Virtual Phone Systems | Hosted PBX | Nexogy. VoIP will persist as the method of transport but it will be simply another application next to video, chats, collaboration, co-browsing , etc simply because we are humans and we need to talk, we will never shut up. VoIP legacy might be the new term referring to an old IP Phone sitting on a desk which it's only capability is to place a phone call and check voicemail, unless you deploy an IP Phone with a touchscreen to have a browser and HD video features; but why? That is called a tablet and we already have our iPads and android tablets. Morever, services that offer crystal clear peer connections like FaceTime Audio will still be using VoIP, OTT, but the need for an extra device will bet set to expire. VoIP will persist, the channel we use it through though will change. WebRTC uses a browser, FaceTime and Skype use your smartphone, tablet or Mac/PC, even all three depending which one you happen to be signed upon.    Embed Quote
