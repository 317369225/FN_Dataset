★How does Tango (VoIP) make money?They've raised 8.7M making the total investment amount 13.7M. So how will they make money out of it?
They can do mobile ads which pay for CPM. Most possibly they tried that for a limited amount of users and that worked well. But they are not making the ads go mass because they don't want the users to be disturbed and switch to a competitor before they have the mass user base network power. They can also take yearly subscription fees for people who don't want to see the ads.    Embed Quote
