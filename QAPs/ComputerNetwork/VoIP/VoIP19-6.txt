★Can VoIP ever have latency as low as a "regular" phone line?
I used to work in this field and there are some interesting facts to take in account when comparing PSTN with VoIP: Most of PSTN nowadays is actually converted to digital at the first connection point and routed as such so, really, it's pretty much like VoIP anyway. The bandwidth of a connection doesn't say much. Pretty much any connection with more than 64/128kbps is able to carry VoIP if it wasn't for the latency of the connection itself. Try services like speedtest to see how much latency you have. If you connection has an intrinsic latency of say 100ms, you have to consider that this number will be added to whatever other source of delay. The size of the compressed packet is a variable too: usually voice is compressed in segments of a couple of hundreds ms which should be ok but the encoder selected for compression may fragment less to make better use of the bandwidth thus introducing delay. It may be network delay between you and you VoIP provider. Usually a ping on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server (if they accept ping) should help you understanding that. If that's the case, it may be caused by your Internet provider rather than you VoIP one.    Embed Quote
