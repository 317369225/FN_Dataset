★What is VoIP?
This needs a very long and detailed answer. Maybe, based on what I write, you can ask more questions, and those can be answered. VoIP, or Voice Over Internet Protocol, in simple terms, uses the Internet for voice communications. Your voice is converted to digital packets, transported over the Internet, and converted back to analog voice signals at the other end. The call is effectively from one IP address to another. In other words, multiple people can use the same IP address to make calls. How do you differentiate? By your logging in. When you log into a VoIP system, you unique id is linked to that IP for the moment. So the person you are calling will see your id and not the IP address. The id can be be anything - an alphanumeric id such as name@happyworld.com, just 'name', or even a number such as (123) 456-7890. To the system, it does not matter what you call yourself, as long as it can identify you with an id and password. Since it is digital packets that are being used, VoIP calls are measured by the volume of data transmitted. There are no per-minute rates. And, since it is using the Internet, the call can be from SFO to Sand Diego, or to New Delhi in India. For VoIP, both calls are the same in terms of data transmission. There are a number of other feature and capabilities of VoIP. One important aspect is SIP trunking. SIP trunking allows you to use VoIP to call and receive calls from PSTN lines and mobile phones. An Internet Telephone Service Provider (ITSP) manages the translation between the two circuits. One of the greatest advantages of VoIP is Unified Communication (UCedge Unified Communications | Toshiba). Since you are using digital circuits, like they show in SF movies, you can mix voice, video and data all at the same time. If you are interested, we can continue this topic. I am sure a number of others will chip in with their inputs. Who knows, maybe this question can become the bible for VoIP? Just joking!    Embed Quote
