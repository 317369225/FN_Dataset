★What is the best VOIP solution for a UK small business?Less than 10 users. I'm looking at Epygi PBX, Snom phones and VOIP Unlimited as a SIP provider but this is a new area for me and I don't know if there is a better option. Any experiences, pointers or tips would be great.
The best one right now for both individuals and companies, from my experience is voipfibre. I have used voipdiscount, actionvoip, skype, but nothing provides better customer service and cheapest rates. Go with this one, http://www.voipfibre.com.    Embed Quote
