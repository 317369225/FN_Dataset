★What are the best VOIP service providers and what distinguishes them?
Full Disclosure: I currently work for OneVoice Communications, Inc. I've seen a lot of different VoIP providers all over the internet, and (as someone else mentioned previously) a lot of them seem to boast the same essential "lowest price / best in the industry / 30 days free" etc.  I don't think there is a "one shoe fits all" and I believe that different companies are good for different situations. I can't say who is the best, all I can do is tell you what distinguishes us here at OneVoice. Our focus here is on four key factors when we discuss what you need: We're a one stop shop for voice and data for your company, you can consolidate all of your bills into one through us. You talk to a person, not a machine.  This person to person connection is extremely important to us here. We go through all of your business needs in order to come up with your technological needs and goals.  We identify your needs so you're only paying for what you need, no more / no less Cost Efficiency - We will also take the time to go over your existing bills, to show how we can save you money.  I'll be following this to see what other people view as the best VoIP providers across the globe, because I am very interested to learn! visit our website onevoiceinc.com    Embed Quote
