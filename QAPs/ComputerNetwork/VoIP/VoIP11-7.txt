★How can echo be reduced in a VOIP call?I have a VOIP service setup on a softphone. When I make a call, the receiver hears an echo of his own voice with about a half to one second delay loud and clear. I don't hear any echo or have any problems with the call quality though. What causes this and how can it be reduced/eliminated?
The best one right now for both individuals and companies, from my experience is voipfibre. They support G729, which gives best quality and lower latency. I have used voipdiscount, actionvoip, skype, but nothing provides better customer service and cheapest rates. Go with this one, http://www.voipfibre.com.    Embed Quote
