★Can VoIP ever have latency as low as a "regular" phone line?
Regular phones or PSTN use an old technology called circuit switch. It´s is very good for voice calls because for each call is settled an clear channel end to end, but, today,  in the middle of the network there are many equipments using packet or cell switching technologies. This is in contrast to the public telephone network, which is a circuit switching. Anyway, the calls keep their latency levels. So, Voip will have the same latency than the old phone lines very soon. It´s a technological issue that will be implemented in the due time. First of all, the Telcos has to get all the money can using their installed phone based and once they have depreciated them, all the limitations will be gone in a blink.    Embed Quote
