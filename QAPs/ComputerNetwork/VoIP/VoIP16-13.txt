★What is the best VOIP solution for a UK small business?Less than 10 users. I'm looking at Epygi PBX, Snom phones and VOIP Unlimited as a SIP provider but this is a new area for me and I don't know if there is a better option. Any experiences, pointers or tips would be great.
In my opinion it is hard to say exactly which system is the best as it depends on what you need your system to do. BT use the HIPCOM platform which is OK, in my opinion Horizon and Cisco Feature + are 2 very good systems http://www.drtelecoms.com/phone-... . there is a video that explains it all nicely.    Embed Quote
