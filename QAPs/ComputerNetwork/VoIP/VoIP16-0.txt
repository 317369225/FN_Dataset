★What is the best VOIP solution for a UK small business?Less than 10 users. I'm looking at Epygi PBX, Snom phones and VOIP Unlimited as a SIP provider but this is a new area for me and I don't know if there is a better option. Any experiences, pointers or tips would be great.
www.soho66.co.uk have always been very helpful to me, they are always happy to talk on the phone to discuss your ongoing requirements. I have also had a very good experience with FreePBX, I got a managed hosting package from www.sysadminman.net. The guys there are very helpful which is essential given the learning curve creating a custom asterisk based telephony system for the first time. This may be overkill for many but great value for all the facilities it provides. Used Voxbeam for trunks and Localphone / ukddi for incoming DIDs. Theres also my companies product MergedComms | Orbit Hosted VoIP take a look.    Embed Quote
