★How can echo be reduced in a VOIP call?I have a VOIP service setup on a softphone. When I make a call, the receiver hears an echo of his own voice with about a half to one second delay loud and clear. I don't hear any echo or have any problems with the call quality though. What causes this and how can it be reduced/eliminated?
Depending on your softphone you should see a configuration option for enabling/disabling echo cancellation. Enabling echo cancellation along with VAD (Voice Activity Detection) function would help reduce the echo and also bandwidth utilization hence helping in overall call quality. Also try to enable/tweak the OoS feature of your router by giving preference to audio or RTP stream if you have the access to the router management (Maybe not possible if you are using your office's network).    Embed Quote
