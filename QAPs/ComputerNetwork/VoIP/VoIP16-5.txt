★What is the best VOIP solution for a UK small business?Less than 10 users. I'm looking at Epygi PBX, Snom phones and VOIP Unlimited as a SIP provider but this is a new area for me and I don't know if there is a better option. Any experiences, pointers or tips would be great.
I would recommend you take a look at onsip.com.   They have a compelling service.    Embed Quote
