★What is the best VoIP service provider for multi-line business users?I need one now. AT&T is unable to provide us with adequate service.
The best one right now for both individuals and companies, from my experience is voipfibre. I have used voipdiscount, actionvoip, skype, but nothing provides better customer service and cheapest rates. Go with this one, http://www.voipfibre.com.    Embed Quote
