★What do you think the future of VoIP will be?
VoIP has been quite a fast-growing industry and will continue to grow over the coming few years. This technology has been beneficial not only for countries which have highly developed communications infrastructure, but also for countries such as India and Indonesia which actually happen to be global leaders in the growth of VoIP use, particularly that in mobile VoIP. However, they are still at a phase where there is a lot of friction for the users. For example, while calling through mobile apps, many people still face call lags and wifi connectivity issues. This is the gap brands like ours are trying to fix. We’ve recently launched Ringo, which is an international calling app that lets users make calls at very cheap rates. Plus, it works without the internet so it’s great for those who don’t have wifi connection or are out of range. You can have a look at how it works on the Ringo website: Low Cost International Calls. Would love to hear what you think about it!    Embed Quote
