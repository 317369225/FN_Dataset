★What is the best VoIP service provider for multi-line business users?I need one now. AT&T is unable to provide us with adequate service.
I have heard that it is more beneficial if you go with any local VOIP service provider. But I am not that familiar with any local service as I am using an international service from a worldwide service provider Voice Over Samples. But you can talk to them. They will tell you the truth. And also talk with the local services.    Embed Quote
