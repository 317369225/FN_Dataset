★What are the best VOIP service providers and what distinguishes them?
I've recently started using Line2 on my iPhone and the experience has been good. Calls are clear, you can send and receive txt messages, and most importantly for me, I can use the addressbook already built into my iPhone. It's got a ton of features that people love, but the only thing I care about is that I can reliably make phone calls. As soon as the iPhone is available on Verizon, I'm leaving AT&T and will probably leave Line2 as well.    Embed Quote
