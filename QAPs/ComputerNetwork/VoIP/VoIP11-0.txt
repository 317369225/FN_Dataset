★How can echo be reduced in a VOIP call?I have a VOIP service setup on a softphone. When I make a call, the receiver hears an echo of his own voice with about a half to one second delay loud and clear. I don't hear any echo or have any problems with the call quality though. What causes this and how can it be reduced/eliminated?
Echo cancellation is typically built into the softphone itself. That said, certain devices will reduce the amount of echo that can be picked up (i.e, using a USB headset as opposed to your integrated mic speakers) or using sound devices that include echo-cancellation.    Embed Quote
