★What are the best VoIP blogs out there?
Some of the more prevalent providers in the market run their own blog. As you would probably expect, most are very “markety” as the blog is essentially used to promote one of their products. However, a couple companies stand out in the mix such as 8x8 and Vocalocity (which is becoming a part of Vonage who has terrible blogs.) If you’re looking for unbiased information, there seems to be many 3rd party VoIP sites on the internet. However, most of these are partnered with several companies which causes them to consistently plug said companies in their blogs and further via generic press releases which are constantly spun the re-distributed to the web every couple of weeks. There are two very good VoIP blogs I follow - one being WhichVoIP.com Blog. These guys create a couple good blogs every week. They tend to cover more of a broad range of subjects in the telecom field rather than just VoIP. The information is good as they tend to cite certain stories in the press then delve deeper by providing additional perspective. Another great blog to follow is Blog - GetVoIP. The guy who produces these blogs provides great information on services, products, business and other matters relevant to the industry. This blog is more VoIP centric than the one above. It is also very interactive so if you have a Disqus account, you can follow up on the content by commenting on the material.    Embed Quote
