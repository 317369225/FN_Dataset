★How can echo be reduced in a VOIP call?I have a VOIP service setup on a softphone. When I make a call, the receiver hears an echo of his own voice with about a half to one second delay loud and clear. I don't hear any echo or have any problems with the call quality though. What causes this and how can it be reduced/eliminated?
I would add to Stephen's answer: Reducing delay in the call (if at all possible) will help reduce echo.  Echo with a short round-trip is less likely to be perceived by the caller.  Note that the echo that you hear is actually being caused by the other party (far end).  Often this is due to misconfiguration of echo cancellation, a total lack thereof, or "acoustic feedback" which is your voice being fed back to the microphone on the far end device. In a "soft phone" environment, headsets with built in echo-cancellation usually give the best results.  With VoIP phones, some handset and headset designs are better than others, speakerphone will generally introduce a lot of acoustic feedback too.    Embed Quote
