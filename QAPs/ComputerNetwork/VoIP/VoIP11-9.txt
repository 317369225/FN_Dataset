★How can echo be reduced in a VOIP call?I have a VOIP service setup on a softphone. When I make a call, the receiver hears an echo of his own voice with about a half to one second delay loud and clear. I don't hear any echo or have any problems with the call quality though. What causes this and how can it be reduced/eliminated?
Enable Voice Activity Detection function (if available). Try reducing the RTP packets size to 10ms. Enable the QoS function of your VoIP router. If your router doesn't support QoS, make sure you are using the latest firmware.I found Dove Communications - Part 3 very useful regarding Voip.    Embed Quote
