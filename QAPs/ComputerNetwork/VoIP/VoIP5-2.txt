★What is the best VoIP infrastructure service, API or open source solution to use for a mobile VoIP app?The mobile app is a SIP client.
The best by far is NetTalk (FREE Home Phone Service Local and Long Distance Calls VoIP). I think their customer service is fantastic. I had a single misunderstanding at first but one quick exchange fixed it up! They have been nothing but kind to me and they are CHEAP!! $30 a year for unlimited talk time!!!    Embed Quote
