★What is the best VoIP service provider for multi-line business users?I need one now. AT&T is unable to provide us with adequate service.
VoIP is location independent, but experience tells me that it is better to choose a local VoIP provider, or at least to be in your country. Especially if you want to port your existing number.    Embed Quote
