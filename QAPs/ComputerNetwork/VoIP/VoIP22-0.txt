★Who is the best wholesale VoIP provider for US termination?Many players like grnvoip don't even respond to sales inquiries. Some don't provide services for call centers. What companies provide these services for outbound call centers?
It's a tough question. First, you need to specify your daily/monthly volume in terms of minutes/concurrent calls. Depending on the answer to this question you are likely to fall in to two categories: "small business" or "big enough business". If you are more like the first category, then you could look through http://www.voip-info.org  or http://www.voipreview.org/ directories. If your business belongs to "big enough" group (it may start with 100k minutes/month), it would be best to start looking for a wholesale terminator such as AT&T, Tata, Voxbeam etc. In the second case it might be best to check the web for comments about a particular carrier.    Embed Quote
