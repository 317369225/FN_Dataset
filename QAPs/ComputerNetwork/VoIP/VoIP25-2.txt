★Why does VoIP suck?Why do I always lose packets, and why does it seem to falter over time? Is this a hardware problem or a software problem? Is unreliabity built in to the system somehow?
It’s not that unreliability is built into the system, however, there are quite a few factors that affect its quality. Like one of the other users answered, hardware and software could improve it, but at the crux the system is dependent on a lot of other factors on which it has no control over. It basically depends on the internet connectivity. So it’s the internet connectivity that you have on your device that is unreliable. If you’re looking for international calling apps that work without the internet, you should definitely consider Ringo. It converts your international calls to local calls and works without the internet. So you don't have to rely on internet connectivity as it uses your local phone circuits. The receiver need not have the app to receive the call. You can call both mobiles and land-lines. Your first Ringo call is free. So do give it a shot at http://www.ringo.co.    Embed Quote
