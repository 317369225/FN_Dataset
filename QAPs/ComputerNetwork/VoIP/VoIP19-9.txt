★Can VoIP ever have latency as low as a "regular" phone line?
No. You have to consider the followings: -Network latency: 5-X msec  (this can be close to zero on LAN, ~150 msec over public internet or 3000 msec over satellite connection) -IP stack latency: 5-40 msec -audio device latency: 5-20 msec -audio jitter: 10-20 msec Multiply these with 2 if both endpoint are using VoIP. So an estimated delay from these is in optimal conditions is around 100 msec. Note that this is below 160 msec which is considered as a threshold for a delay which can't be noticed by users. However over the public internet you can easily reach to 250 msec (which is still very fine contrary to public believes). Here the geographic distance has a big impact. For example from USA to EU you will have a minimum 60 msec delay.    Embed Quote
