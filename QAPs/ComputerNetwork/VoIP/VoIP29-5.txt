★What is the best VoIP service provider for multi-line business users?I need one now. AT&T is unable to provide us with adequate service.
Multi you can go with other voip providers who offer voip for businesses. However multi lines can mean anything. Based on experience (i work on call center technology) it really boils down on how many channels do you need and the Calls per Second you require.    Embed Quote
