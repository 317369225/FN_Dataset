★Which is the best mobile phone provider in Austin, TX?Of Sprint, AT&T Wireless, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile, which has the best coverage, lowest rates, and Android Devices selection? Caveat, I'm a heavy user of Smartphones and an early adopter so wireless features (eg. teathering) and services are also considerations.
AT&T is quite good, I agree. I agree with Colby above that GSM has many advantages. Just the other day, I tossed my Windows Phone and purchased the new iPhone off Craigslist and swapped it out seamlessly. I've had no problems with dropped calls on AT&T in Austin on any of the devices I've used. But AT&T also doesn't have unlimited data plans anymore unlike Sprint. All of the major carrier networks have matured to have good connection in Austin - I think the other variables are more important like the kind of phone you want, data plan, price, GSM vs CDMA, etc.    Embed Quote
