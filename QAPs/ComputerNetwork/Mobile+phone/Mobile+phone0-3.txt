★What is the best basic mobile phone?No need for any Smart Phones or enhanced features. A basic phone that has good battery life and decent audio quality?
LG Optimus L3 E400, cheap basic smartphone, very durable, decent battery life, WiFi and 3G compatible, Android OS (capable of running pure Android apps and games), 3.2mp Camera and easy to use. The only downside is that there is no Flash but overall, a very good phone. Source:I have one myself    Embed Quote
