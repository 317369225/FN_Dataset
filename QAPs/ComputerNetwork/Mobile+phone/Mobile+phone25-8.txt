★Which is the best mobile phone provider in Austin, TX?Of Sprint, AT&T Wireless, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile, which has the best coverage, lowest rates, and Android Devices selection? Caveat, I'm a heavy user of Smartphones and an early adopter so wireless features (eg. teathering) and services are also considerations.
AT&T has a pretty solid lock on Austin at the moment. It isn't the cheapest or the easiest to deal with (on the support side), but for call quality and the ability to multitask on a phone I don't think they can be beat. GSM carriers have a distinct advantage in the smartphone wars and T-Mobile (the only other GSM carrier) doesn't have the quality outside of Texas to be a contender, in my opinion.    Embed Quote
