★Which is the best mobile phone provider in Austin, TX?Of Sprint, AT&T Wireless, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile, which has the best coverage, lowest rates, and Android Devices selection? Caveat, I'm a heavy user of Smartphones and an early adopter so wireless features (eg. teathering) and services are also considerations.
I switched last year from AT&T to sprint to save a buck. It ends up about the same --but sprint only has half the cell towers AT&T has!    Embed Quote
