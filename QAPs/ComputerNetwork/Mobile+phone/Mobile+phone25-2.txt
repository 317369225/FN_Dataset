★Which is the best mobile phone provider in Austin, TX?Of Sprint, AT&T Wireless, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile, which has the best coverage, lowest rates, and Android Devices selection? Caveat, I'm a heavy user of Smartphones and an early adopter so wireless features (eg. teathering) and services are also considerations.
Based on the responses so far it probably really depends on the specific parts of town you're in.  I live in Round Rock and work in the Arboretum and had TMobile for about 6 years and couldn't have been happier.  I had forgotten the concept of dropped calls until my company switched to AT&T about a year and a half ago and it now seems like I average one drop per conversation - and it's almost a guarantee if I'm driving anywhere (mostly Mopac/45).  My wife just got an Android on TMobile and the speed tests were astounding.  I wouldn't consider any carrier other than TMobile/Verizon, and TMobile will be cheaper.    Embed Quote
