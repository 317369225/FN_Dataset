★What will mobile phones look like in ten years time?Mobile phones have become smartphones; they do infinitely more than take calls and send text messages. As they become smaller, faster and more powerful what will they look like and what kind of user interface will we be interacting with? Will they become increasingly aesthetically pleasing?
In future you will have a tablet or smartphone that is as powerful as our desktops are today just smaller.  Someday very soon desktops will be a thing of the past and only used for servers or for special needs powerusers. We may very likely have a Phone in the form of a small brick like we use now that can do everything our PC's can. The smartphone of tomorrow will have the ability to duplicate almost everything our PC's can. All of the below technology exists right now today it just needs to get cheaper and integrate which is already happening. On-board display projector. Virtual keyboard. Ability to dock with Larger screen, external Hard Disk, secondary processor cores, 3D video card and peripherals. In the video below that small box behind the keyboard is allowing all of that functionality. . Retractable large LCD screens. The only piece lacking in this puzzle is for prices to come down which they are in a predictable speed and an OS that can support both Smartphone and desktop functionality. Add to that other technologies we might see around the corner like desks that have giant touchscreen surfaces or large displays that use gestures to control. A hybrid of our current desktop PC's, smartphones and tablets as far as user interaction goes.    Embed Quote
