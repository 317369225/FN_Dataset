★Which is the best mobile phone under 7k?I want to gift it to my  mom and i am looking specifically that phone which has good battery life.
I will recommend you to go for Moto E or Micromax Android One. Both the phones have good specs and features. Don't go for Samsung or Sony phones in this price range. You may refer this. Motorola Moto E - A Game Changer Smartphone    Embed Quote
