★What are some of the most interesting mobile phone cases?
There are zillion different designed phone cases available on the market; everybody can find a nice case according to his taste. But cases, covers with funny unusual shape and extra function are quite interesting. The metal cover and aluminum bumper case are really cool for me. Another handy accessory is the “battery cover” which includes a battery like this one. You can turn it on/off to control when you need extra battery life. An upgraded version of this handy accessory, beside the battery also has an amplifier and speaker for additional sound experience. If you prefer hardware keyboard you may also like thephone case with Bluetooth keyboard. Waterproof case is pretty useful on the beach, pool, on fishing etc. A unique accessory is the iPhone Bluetooth Gamepad. Not a typical phone case, but it is worth to mention.      Embed Quote
