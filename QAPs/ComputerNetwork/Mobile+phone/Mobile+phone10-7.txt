★Which is the best mobile phone under 7k?I want to gift it to my  mom and i am looking specifically that phone which has good battery life.
I would suggest Moto E as it has all the basic features and supports all daily life requirements. It's of 6,999 Inr. Another good feature it has is that, it has corning gorilla glass so it won't break that easily because I have seen girls, ladies dropping their phones too often. :)    Embed Quote
