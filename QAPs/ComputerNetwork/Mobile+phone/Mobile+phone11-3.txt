â˜…What are current mobile phone ad CPM rates?
I'm Sonia at MdotM, an iPhone and Android in-app banner ad network. If you are looking at in-app CPMs, it varies by country. In the U.S., you can get inventory at a $0.60 CPM but if you want to drive volume, you have to bid higher. It also depends on the type of inventory (ie., app verticle) you are looking to buy or types of ads you want to display. I think iAds with Apple is at a $10 CPM. Also, on very niche content, like travel apps, I know some developers charge a $15-$25 CPM.
