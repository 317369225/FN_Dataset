★Which is the best mobile phone provider in Austin, TX?Of Sprint, AT&T Wireless, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile, which has the best coverage, lowest rates, and Android Devices selection? Caveat, I'm a heavy user of Smartphones and an early adopter so wireless features (eg. teathering) and services are also considerations.
I've had all four while living in Austin.  Here are my opinions. T-mobile - great customer service, bad coverage, lots of dropped calls, phone selection is not great.  They may improve in the next year or two with the new AT&T spectrum but would not recommend them right now. Verizon - great coverage, minimal dropped calls, good phone selection.  Unfortunately very expensive. AT&T - good coverage, especially in remote locations.  Used to have a lot of dropped calls but that has improved in the last 6 months. Expensive pricing.  I use them right now because I travel international.  Phone selection is ok. Sprint - best value and good coverage in Austin.  Can't beat the unlimited data unlimited voice plan.  Good selection of phones but do your homework, some of the android phones suck. Personal opinion, if you are paying go Sprint, if someone else is paying, go Verizon.    Embed Quote
