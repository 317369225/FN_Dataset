★What is the technology behind mobile phone top-up vouchers?
Its not magic...Its one of the typical network callflows/logic that you can understand easily. Generally, There are 2 type of charging happens in telecom networks , Prepaid and postpaid. Now here you are using the prepaid service (have to first recharge ur account than use the service). So for using the service , you have to buy some credits (Balance in your account). Therefore you buy vouchers (say of 100 rs) and  check ur balance .After successful recharge you use the service (voice,internet). Now to understand how recharge system works, check below points- 1.Mobile phone operators generates vouchers (with uniq id from 1xxxxxx-9yyyyyy) for a particular plan (i.e 100,200,500,1000). 2.This unique Ids are hidden first (have to scratch ) and than you apply that code using USSD code. 3.This unique code goes to system (IN node) , which checks whether this unique code has been used before or not. If not used , it credits the balance in your database(SDP node) and make that unique code inactive for future use. 4.Once credit the balance successfully , you can use the service as you like. This all process take very less time (seconds) .There are various nodes/protocol use to make this process fast . If you want to know all call-flows and protocols , there are various sites you can refer. Found one sites , i think that can be useful to you. http://www.tutorialspoint.com/te... i believe this has cleared your doubts. Thank You !!!    Embed Quote
