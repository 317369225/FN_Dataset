★What will mobile phones look like in ten years time?Mobile phones have become smartphones; they do infinitely more than take calls and send text messages. As they become smaller, faster and more powerful what will they look like and what kind of user interface will we be interacting with? Will they become increasingly aesthetically pleasing?
I think something that most answers have not addressed is the portable power issue. I personally think the biggest leap our smartphones can make now is to last a whole lot longer than they currently do and I think the one technology that is most crucial here is true Wireless Charging. That or well, massive batteries. While wireless charging does exist but it is limited by the distance at which it works. We already have WiFi amplifying electric bulbs and if a similar technology was pushed through for wireless charging, we would use our devices more freely and for a whole lot more than we do now. I think it is fairly true when I say that most of us use our devices in a restrained manner unless we are close to a charging point. Most phones will die under 5-6 hours of heavy usage which basically limits how much we do with them. Add more devices into this mix like a Smart Glasses and you have more device that you have to worry about charging. I think access to WiFi everywhere and wireless charging will drive market innovation and soon different form factors for mobile devices will start making appearances once we can stop worrying about our technology running out of juice or connectivity at a crucial moment.    Embed Quote
