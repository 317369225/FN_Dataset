★Which is the best mobile phone provider in Austin, TX?Of Sprint, AT&T Wireless, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile, which has the best coverage, lowest rates, and Android Devices selection? Caveat, I'm a heavy user of Smartphones and an early adopter so wireless features (eg. teathering) and services are also considerations.
In my experience, Verizon and Sprint seem to have the fewest problems around here. T-Mobile is inexpensive, but they drop pretty often and there are big swathes of town where the data just doesn't load. That said, though, the data and reception in downtown is incredible, even during SXSW. AT&T is what my roommate used to have, and she ran into problems non stop -- no data, no reception, the whole shebang. As for Verizon and Sprint, most of my friends with those two run into problems during SXSW and events like that, but the rest of the time, to be frank, I'm jealous of how great their reception and dat connections are.    Embed Quote
