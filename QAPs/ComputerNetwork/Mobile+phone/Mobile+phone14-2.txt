★What will mobile phones look like in ten years time?Mobile phones have become smartphones; they do infinitely more than take calls and send text messages. As they become smaller, faster and more powerful what will they look like and what kind of user interface will we be interacting with? Will they become increasingly aesthetically pleasing?
Yay! The future where every answer is probably wrong! I like the freedom that give me to say almost anything. ;) I think the form will almost go away completely. Voice commands will do a lot to mitigate the need for a keyboard. GPS and HTML5 will do a lot to sort out relevant information through location and semantic self description. Search will be annoying and replaced by push. If you need a screen, pico projectors will project and small wireless screens can receive signals. You'll go into a Starbucks and they will just have small screens sitting around that you can transmit to. I think the basic form of the mobile phone will be about that of a SIM card containing your account information. It could even be a chip in your skull like we do with dog tags now. The phone will take the form factor of a sim card worn on your wrist or body. The fabled Dick Tracy watch. Or maybe more like an iPod shuffle or 1 inch square nanos. An optional accessory will be a thin piece of glass that you can put your sim card into for those times when you need a dedicated screen, otherwise you will just connect to small screens in the coffee shop, the car, the airport, the table, etc. I think the current trend about making phones larger so they are somewhere between a phone and a tablet will reverse and the phone will almost vanish as the input and display devices are just things in our physical environment they we just interface with as needed.    Embed Quote
