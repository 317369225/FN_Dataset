★What is the best basic mobile phone?No need for any Smart Phones or enhanced features. A basic phone that has good battery life and decent audio quality?
Apart from my smartphone, I use a karbonn phone (an Indian brand) that has a ordinary audio & video player, is dual sim and has 2200 mAh battery with standard usb and audio connectivity . It has a decent body that has taken its share of drops but still runs fine. The best thing about this is that it runs for 2 weeks on a single charge!    Embed Quote
