★Which is the best mobile phone provider in Austin, TX?Of Sprint, AT&T Wireless, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile, which has the best coverage, lowest rates, and Android Devices selection? Caveat, I'm a heavy user of Smartphones and an early adopter so wireless features (eg. teathering) and services are also considerations.
I would be very careful moving to Sprint - they say none of their towers are malfunctioning and that they are building more 4G but since I moved here a month ago I have had little to no data connection downtown, near campus, or in North Austin.  When I am connected, my data speeds are much lower than I was getting in Buffalo, NY, and about 50 times slower than my husband's AT&T service.  Making calls from my house is impossible, and even outside calls drop within a minute.    Embed Quote
