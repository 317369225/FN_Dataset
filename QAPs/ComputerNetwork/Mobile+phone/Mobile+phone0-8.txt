★What is the best basic mobile phone?No need for any Smart Phones or enhanced features. A basic phone that has good battery life and decent audio quality?
As much as I loved my Nokia 1100, the original Motorola Razr and the subsequent Black Razr are at the top of my list. Best phones I ever had. I hope that someday someone makes a smartphone that works that well as a phone.    Embed Quote
