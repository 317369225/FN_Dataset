★Which is the best mobile phone provider in Austin, TX?Of Sprint, AT&T Wireless, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile, which has the best coverage, lowest rates, and Android Devices selection? Caveat, I'm a heavy user of Smartphones and an early adopter so wireless features (eg. teathering) and services are also considerations.
My experience with AT&T has been good. To be fair, I have tried each of the others, but have been with AT&T constantly for six years now. The rest sucked, but may have mended their ways. My only consistent problem is near Mopac at 360. There is quite a hole there, and I drop a call every time, no matter where I go at that interchange. There are some other places that are spotty, but overall, my experience with them has been much better than with any of the other carriers. If you plan to stray outside the I-35 corridor in Texas, AT&T remains the best option, especially if you are west of I-35. Nobody else seems to be as reliable once you leave the bigger cities and the I-35 corridor. If all of your in-state travel is on I-35 (not uncommon) then you generally do ok with any carrier.    Embed Quote
