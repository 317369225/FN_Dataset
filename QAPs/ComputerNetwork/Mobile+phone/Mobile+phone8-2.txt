★What is the technology behind mobile phone top-up vouchers?
I don't have complete information about this but one of my friends used to work in this industry earlier. He shared little information regarding this. Here it is: They used to get blank pieces of this coupons,i.e., the paper without recharge code. They had a software which used to prepare 16 digit non-repeated encrypted numbers and generate a database of it. These numbers had certain vailidty date( which is called expiry date of the coupon). They are then shared with the printing press of their own(for security purpose). Later, the printing press puts a scratch powder over them. The encrypted database of the number is shared with the telecom company meanwhile. After few more verification processes, that includes unique serial number of the recharge coupons( and not the recharge code) and physically testing the coupons for the scratch area covering. Telecom companies have dedicated systems for recharges. They can handle up to 10L (approx number, my friends wasnt sure about it) recharge requests per minute. It isn't magic,its engineering. :) Hope for better answers here.    Embed Quote
