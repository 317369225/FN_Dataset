★How accurate is mobile phone GPS?
I won't base my answer on technology but rather experience.  My BlackBerry 9700 and a previously owned BlackBerry 8900 had amazingly accurate GPS units.  To the point that they were able to pinpoint me in my backyard on Google Maps.  Granted, it didn't hit my exact location in my backyard but that's expected due the GPS technology accuracy.  I've heard similar results from iPhone users as well.  If I find a report online, I will edit my answer and post.    Embed Quote
