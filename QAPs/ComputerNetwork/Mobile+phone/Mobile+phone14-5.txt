★What will mobile phones look like in ten years time?Mobile phones have become smartphones; they do infinitely more than take calls and send text messages. As they become smaller, faster and more powerful what will they look like and what kind of user interface will we be interacting with? Will they become increasingly aesthetically pleasing?
10 years is pretty close and while technology does move quickly the current paradigms are pretty well ingrained. Phones have gotten smaller and gone wireless and do more but the basic form factor hasn't changed all that much beyond size in nearly 100 years. We still hold something up to our ears and mouth so to think that such a drastic change would occur in the next 10 years is wishful thinking in my opinion. The whole embedded thing is still way off. We put RFID in our animals but on us? With Privacy and Security at the forefront of today's technology news I highly doubt the majority of people are going to buy into the always on connected state as most of the answers here provide for. People lose their wallets much less then they lose or break their phones and relying on one device for everything leaves a huge single point of failure and a great place for thieves and other miscreants to target. The urban legend used to be about getting a kidney removed and waking up in a tub of ice, next it will be having sim cards removed? I imagine the phone will become closer to the Lt. Uhura model similar to Bluetooth today with the availability of a HUD. With people moving away from wearing glasses and getting Lasik will glasses make a re-emergence as "The New Black?" I think that is closer to the reality. All this said, do we really want to make it easier to communicate with people further away and ignore the ones standing right next to us? Will walking and talking become the new Texting and driving? All very scary. Would you believe I rely on technology for a living!    Embed Quote
