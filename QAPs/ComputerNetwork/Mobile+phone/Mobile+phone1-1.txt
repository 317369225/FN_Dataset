★How accurate is mobile phone GPS?
It depends on how your location is being calculated. (I'm going to assume that the questioner meant to say How accurate is mobile phone location, as multiple technologies are involved.) Based on cell towers - This will vary dramatically based on where you're at. In Manhattan, where towers are dense, you'll get finer resolution than if you're along an interstate in rural Montana. Based on WiFi signals - This is one of the most accurate (and quickest) methods. Resolution can be pretty fine, about 100 ft. (My phone is currently reporting 40m.) This method won't work when you're hiking or in rural areas. Based on the phone's GPS - With a good GPS signal, you can get to 25-35 feet resolution. This generally doesn't work indoors. Depending on your phone this may work even without a service plan. (Though time to fix will be longer.) With WAAS, you can get below 10 feet, but I haven't seen that implemented on a cell phone.
