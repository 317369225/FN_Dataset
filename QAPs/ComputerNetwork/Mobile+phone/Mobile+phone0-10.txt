★What is the best basic mobile phone?No need for any Smart Phones or enhanced features. A basic phone that has good battery life and decent audio quality?
Hello, as Jaap has explained, indeed Nokia feature phones are still the best ones out there, with a couple of exceptions coming from Samsung. So my reco today would be either Nokia C2-01, Nokia 206 or Samsung S5610. The Nokia ones are a bit more "light weight" in terms of specs while the Samsung is more specked.    Embed Quote
