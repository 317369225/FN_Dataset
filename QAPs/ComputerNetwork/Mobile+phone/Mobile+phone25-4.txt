★Which is the best mobile phone provider in Austin, TX?Of Sprint, AT&T Wireless, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile, which has the best coverage, lowest rates, and Android Devices selection? Caveat, I'm a heavy user of Smartphones and an early adopter so wireless features (eg. teathering) and services are also considerations.
No opinions huh?  I got one suggestion off Quora for Sprint and one for T-Mobile so I've edited the question include T in my list of carriers.    Embed Quote
