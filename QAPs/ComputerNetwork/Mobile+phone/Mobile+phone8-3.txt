★What is the technology behind mobile phone top-up vouchers?
its simple technology. First they will generate some 16 digit numbers randomly. In programming we have random object to do this operation. And then they will feed all the numbers on there database with the recharge amount. When you enter the code and click the recharge button, the code will be transferred to the required database and validate whether the entered code is in database or not. If yes u ll get the money and that code will be deleted from the database. On next time when you enter the same code, it will show "invalid code" means that code is no more in the database.    Embed Quote
