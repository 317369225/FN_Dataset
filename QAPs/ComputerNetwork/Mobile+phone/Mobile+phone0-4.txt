★What is the best basic mobile phone?No need for any Smart Phones or enhanced features. A basic phone that has good battery life and decent audio quality?
Good suggestions here. The key to good battery life is in minimising use of the features - turn off WiFi until you need to use it. Indeed, turn off the phone until you need to use it. I don't think it's now possible to avoid colour screens, but the smaller screen takes less power to drive it. These rules apply both to smartphones and feature phones. I recall discussions in Nokia talking about reduced polling time to the cell tower which would dramatically reduce power usage but I'm not sure where that went. For daily use, I have an iPod Touch combined with a Nokia clamshell feature phone. The clamshell doesn't dial out when it's in the pocket and the battery lasts for days.    Embed Quote
