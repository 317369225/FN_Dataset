★How accurate is mobile phone GPS?
Pretty acurate I would say, at the level of the other commercial devices for personal use you find out there. In ideal conditions (clear sky, no obstructions, no of satellites) it should get 10 - 20 m accuracy. Better than that and you need military hardware.    Embed Quote
