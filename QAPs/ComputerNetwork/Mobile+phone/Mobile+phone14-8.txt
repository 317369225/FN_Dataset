★What will mobile phones look like in ten years time?Mobile phones have become smartphones; they do infinitely more than take calls and send text messages. As they become smaller, faster and more powerful what will they look like and what kind of user interface will we be interacting with? Will they become increasingly aesthetically pleasing?
They will not exist and another form of communication will be integrated into our body's. This is of course speculation and I get the concept from the popular animation "ghost in the shell"    Embed Quote
