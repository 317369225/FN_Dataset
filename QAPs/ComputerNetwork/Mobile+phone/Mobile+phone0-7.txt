★What is the best basic mobile phone?No need for any Smart Phones or enhanced features. A basic phone that has good battery life and decent audio quality?
My choice would be Samsung Champ , Samsung C3300K Champ review: Having fun . Battery life can't be compared to Nokia 1100 ( still i get 3 days without MP3 usage) , but it has almost all the basic features apart from a GPRS browser , MP3 and Java. It is an awesome basic phone that has color screen , a decent touch interface but still easy on your pocket. It is cheap.    Embed Quote
