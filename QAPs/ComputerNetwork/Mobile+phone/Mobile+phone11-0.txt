★What are current mobile phone ad CPM rates?
These were averages in mid 2012. Likely the prices have gone up a little more, but not a lot, while spend in mobile has gone up rapidly, inventory has increased by a larger amount. Note that CPM's are hard in Mobile, mobile is a platform with no real "standard" ad units, it's not a channel so much as a context, it's a world where most units are custom, can you compare a Facebook feed mobile ad with a banner ad at the bottom of a app, with a video preroll served on youtube on a mobile device? You can still see non mobile ads on a phone ( banners, prerolls etc) Some ads are iAds from Apple, which won't be paid for in a CPM type way.    Embed Quote
