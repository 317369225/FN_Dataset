★How accurate is mobile phone GPS?
It all depends on the external conditions, how capable your handset is, and how advanced your network is.  Phones aren't able to do GPS accurately on their own, they get the network to push them assistance information so they can narrow down their search to a certain area. As Mihnea said, the exterior conditions are a big factor as well.  Any obstacles in the sky or tall buildings will make GPS reception very tricky. There are ways however to make GPS positioning on mobiles quite accurate.  Some networks are using a form of RF fingerprinting.  Each time a subscriber makes a GPS positioning, they calculate the signal strengh received by each cell tower and associate that to the GPS position.  As they collect data, they are able to map out signal stenghts over the environment.  This is very useful in an urban environment, where GPS doesn't work so great on its own, because every time somebody makes a positioning you know a little bit more about the properties of the area around him/her.  The more people move around the more accurate the map is. This extra knowledge is used to narrow down your GPS result to a more precise position. GPS on a phone is quite tricky because you don't often have ideal conditions.  People are finding clever ways though of using other information (from cell towers as described above or even wifi access points) to make GPS more accurate.    Embed Quote
