★How accurate is mobile phone GPS?
The first order answer is: probably as good as any other handheld - the physics  is the same, regardless of the chipset used, so accuracy to single-digit meters is possible.  But in practice, the accuracy is more often going to be limited by the strength of the signal received by the relatively smaller and weaker antenna in a multi-purpose phone than it will be in a single-purpose GPS receiver. Second order, an unaugmented mobile phone probably doesn't receive and interpret WAAS, EGNOS, or MSAS signals, that are essentially error-correcting signals, rebroadcast via another satellite (NMEA #35, #46, #47, #48, or #51), that indicate an offset to apply to the conventionally calculated position to compensate for ionospheric signal time-of-flight distortion.  (The offset is determined by a series of ground stations of known position that also calculate their GPS location, and measure the difference.) Others have speculated that the differential offset signal could be delivered via Internet instead of satellites, in which case a firmware update and/or enhanced GPS app could incorporate this data in some future version.    Embed Quote
