★How can I see which Windows 7 processes are using IPV4 loopback?When my machine boots, I see about 200 connections to IPV4 loopback being set up. The resource monitor (Windows 7 Pro) does not list the owning process in the detailed networking info. How can I work out what processes are causing this traffic?
Download the free 'sysinternals' suite from Microsoft.  There is an excellent network monitoring program which comes with it.  This tool is able to map ports to processes.
