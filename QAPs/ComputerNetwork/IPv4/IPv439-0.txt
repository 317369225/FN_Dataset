â˜…Internet Infrastructure: Who uses IPv6 in production and how did they manage transition from IPv4?I'm interested in pointers to case studies, etc., of people/organizations that have made the switch from IPv4 to IPv6 and don't run IPv4 any more for at least some purposes. The point is to learn what works and what doesn't. Short of that, I'm looking for case studies etc of people/organizations who run both simultaneously and bridge in between, and what their experiences have been.
There is a lot of companies that use IPv6 (google, youtube, facebook, ...) I think there is a mistake in the question though. They didn't make the switch from IPv4 to IPv6. The majority of them, if not all, moved to dual stack deployment, meaning they use both protocols on their devices. That is at the moment probably best possible solution as all the new-ish devices happily support that.
