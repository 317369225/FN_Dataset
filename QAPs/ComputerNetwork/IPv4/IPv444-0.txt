â˜…What does "IPv4 forwarding is disabled" mean, and how do you fix it?
I assume you got this message somewhere, and without knowing the details, all that I can do is to answer what does it mean in general. Hope it helps. If you have a server or network appliance that has more than one network interface, IPv4 forwarding is the function that allows it to forward - that is, send a copy - a packet that entered in one interface to another interface. In other words, the server or appliance receives a packet on one interface, and sends the same packet on the way out on another interface. Forwarding is a fundamental concept in networking, and is in fact absolutely necessary for any kind of routing to occur. It's how packets travel from one network to another one. The message "IPv4 forwarding is disabled" means that your server, or appliance, will not do any forwarding. That will stop routing between the two networks. It may be necessary for security reasons (that's a very common scenario). It may also be necessary because there's already another router doing the same and your "IPv4 forwarding" could be causing not only a security hole, but also some quite hard to diagnose problems. EDIT: I'm not sure if I did miss it in the original question or if it was edited, but I didn't answer the second part - "how do you fix it". Roysten Serrao (at What does "IPv4 forwarding is disabled" mean, and how do you fix it?) covers this part pretty fine for Linux boxes. There also recipes to do the same in Windows, OS X, or BSD, and it may vary also depending on your OS version, specially on how the change can be made persistent.
