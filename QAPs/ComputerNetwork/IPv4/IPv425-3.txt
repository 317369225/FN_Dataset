★We all have already heard of IPv4 and IPv6. But what about IPv5? What is IPv5 and why are we converting straight to IPv6 and not to IPv5?IP = Internet Protocol.
Quoting from: http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/p... IPng, Internet Protocol next generation, was conceived in 1994 with a  goal for implementations to start flooding out by 1996 (yeah, like that  ever happened).  IPv6 was supposed to be the "god-send" over the  well-used IPv4: it  increased the number of bytes used in addressing from 4 bytes to 16  bytes, it introduced anycast routing, it removed the checksum from the  IP layer, and lots of other improvements.  One of the fields kept, of  course, was the version field -- these 8 bits identify this IP header as  being of version "4" when there is a 4 in there, and presumably they  would use a "5" to identify this next gen version.  Unfortunately, that  "5" was already given to something else. In the late 1970's, a protocol named ST -- The Internet Stream Protocol -- was created for the experimental transmission of voice, video, and  distributed simulation.  Two decades later, this protocol was revised to  become ST2 and started to get implemented into commercial projects by    groups like IBM, NeXT, Apple, and Sun. Wow did it differ a lot.  ST and  ST+ offered connections, instead of its connection-less IPv4  counterpart.  It also guaranteed QoS.  ST and ST+, were already given  that magical "5". And now as the Internet clock ticks, our PCs don't use IPv5.  So we're moving onto 6.
