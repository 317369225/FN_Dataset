â˜…How do IP addressing an subnetting work for IPv4 and IPv6?I'm in a networking class. I didn't get it when the teacher was going over it. I need easy explanations. Pictures and videos are always nice and help me learn more easily. So if you include those, or they're in a link you mention, that would be a lot more helpful.
Subnetting is required to reduce wastage of addresses since the total pool of IPv4 addresses is shrinking. Subnetting is only required in IPv4 since total available addresses is 2^32 thats around 4.3billion addresses. These arent even enough for every human In IPv6 there is no need to do subnetting since the total no. of addresses is 2^128. Thats around 3.4 x 10^38 hence enough even if every human had 10 IP enabled devices.
