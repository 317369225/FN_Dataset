â˜…How does "echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward" command exactly work?What I want to know is: 1. Is ip_forward a file? 2. Why does a system store a single information in a single file (instead of storing multiple informations in a single file)?
The write operation goes through the procfs, which stores the value in a kernel variable. The path is indeed referring to a file, in unix many various objects are represented as special files. But those special files do not need to be stored on a disk.
