★What is IPv4?
The one answer to this question that is already here is extremely well put.  But, I think the OP is asking something a bit less complicated. For the layman, IPV4 is specifically a networking address scheme.  Just like the addressing scheme used by houses in a city, or apartment numbers in a complex. Let's use the apartment analogy for a moment.  Room numbers are assigned by 1. Floor, 2. Side of hall and 3. Position from the main floor entrance. A room on the first floor, left side, close to the entrance would be something like 103, and the room right across from it is 104.  On the second floor, the room on the left near the stairs will be 203, and the one across 204.  The one on the left next down the hall is 205, and so on. IPv4 is something like this, but not in relation to location.  It is assigned in one of several ways. One is to just apply the number to the device, what we call "static".  This means the address belongs exclusively to that computer, printer, tablet, whatever. Another is to let another device give out the address temporarily, called "dynamic".  The device the does this is called DHCP, or Dynamic Host Control Protocol.  When a computer using DHCP is turned off, the address can be used by another device for awhile. Whichever way is used, each device reports its address to another device which keeps a map of who has what. But IPv4 is also running out of addresses, and soon to be replaced by IPv6.  This hasn't happened yet, and some measures have been taken to make IPv4 useful for a little while longer. The biggest measure is to assign "private" addresses.  These are blocks of addresses meant only for private networks (like the one in your home).  these ranges are 10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x, and 192.168.x.x.  The block 169.254.x.x are reserved for automatic assignment, chosen randomly by your computer if it does not see a DHCP.  This allows it to connect with other, directly connected computers in a "Peer to Peer" style network.  None of these addresses will not get recognition on the internet, and can only be used behind a "router", which allows the private network to communicate with the internet, or with other connected, private networks. Another, already discussed, is DHCP.  This allows the network to utilize a limited number of addresses between a greater number of devices. A third way is subnetting.  If you ever look at your full address, it includes a subnet "mask" that determines how many addresses you have on your network. An IPv4 address looks something like this. 192.168.1.101 Without the subnet (and not understanding the A,B,C structure which I'll get to in a moment), you wouldn't know the number of computers possible in the network.  Each dotted number can only go from 0 to 255.  With the subnet, I can tell what addresses are considered in the local network. 192.168.1.101 (address) 255.255.255.0 (subnet) The 255 in each spot tells me that every computer in the local network will begin with 192.168.1, and the 0 tells me that I can have any address in the fourth place, so my network only goes from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255. But, I can't just throw any number into the subnet.  It is dictated by the binary version of the number.  So I can use only 255, 254, 252.248,240,224.192 and 128, each one carving out smaller and smaller networks. The first and last addresses in a network are reserved.  You can't use them for any computers.  In the above example, 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.1.255 are for special traffic, and would only cause problems on the network if given to a single computer. Lastly, IPv4 is classified according to IP ranges.  There are 5 classes A-E.  Class A networks are the largest, with over 16 million addresses, while Class C are the smallest, with only 255.  D and E are reserved and not used for the general public.  These classes are determined by the binary form of the IP address. Now the question is how does your private IP translate to the internet?  If you have only one computer in your house, and you connect that to the modem your internet provider gave you, you probably have a public IP, meaning, you don't need any translation. But if you have more than one device on the network, you have a router and a hub/switch (usually the same unit for household networks).  The router provides the communication between your internet, and the hub of devices in your house.  When you connect to the internet, the router keeps track of the private address making the call to the internet address, and knows where to send the return information.  Basically, you can't just assign addresses, add a hub to your modem and get internet service for a few computers. You have to have the router to translate for multiple devices.
