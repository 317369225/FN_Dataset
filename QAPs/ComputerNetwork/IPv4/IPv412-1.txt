â˜…How many chars do I need to store any numeric IPv4 address?If I want to store IPv4 address like 127.0.0.1, etc. in a database, how wide should my varchar column be?
Please, please, please don't only give your database the capability of storing IPv4 addresses. You will eventually need to support IPv6, so best time to start is now. Mysql 5.6 and above, in particular, makes this easy; you can simply use a VARBINARY(16) type to store both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the same field, and then use inet6_ntoa() and inet6_aton() to convert from binary to human-readable values when storing and retrieving data. VARBINARY doesn't waste the additional 96 bits on IPv4 addresses, and inet6_aton/ntoa() will encode/decode both v4 and v6 addresses. If you need to store a subnet mask alongside the address, you can just use INT, or you can be uber-efficient and use and unsigned TINYINT since you're storing a max value of 128 (don't forget to make it unsigned; signed TINYINT maxes out at 127).
