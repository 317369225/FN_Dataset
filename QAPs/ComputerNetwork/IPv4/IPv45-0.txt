★IPv6 from IPv4 - is that possible?My ISP and my Router does only support IPv4 at the moment. Is it possible to Access IPv6 pages from my home-network in any way? Proxy or whatever? I want to add an IPv6 to my webserver and I want to check if its working. Ideas?
It is possible, but generally uninteresting.  Very few sites are IPv6 only.  For the foreseeable future, most sites will be dual stack IPv4 and IPv6.  I would discourage the use of tunneling for most home networks, especially any 6to4 or Teredo tunnels which are generally more harmful than helpful to IPv6 adoption at this point. You should demand that your prover offer native IPv6 or move to one that has it. That said, if the objective is simply to test IPv6 on your server, you have some options where you can use public proxies: Access IPv6 test - web site reachability test site Pass through the SiXXs proxy, explained at SixXS IPv6-IPv4 and IPv4-IPv6 Website Gateway/Proxy. If insist on using a an IPv6 tunnel, you can just install the IPv6 Services - Freenet6 client on a PC on your network.  It builds an IPv6 tunnel across just about any IPv4 connection, regardless of NAT usage.  Performance is abysmal because their free public proxies are so overloaded, but it is useful to do a few simple IPv6 tests to specific sites.
