â˜…Which network does the NetID in your IPv4 address correspond to?I just read about Class C networks, where the first 3 octets are reserved for the NetID and the last octet for the hostID. I don't understand which network, and it's corresponding ID we are referring to here.
Shantanu's answer below is partially correct. He has mentioned about classful IP addresses. What he did NOT explain was what to do if your IP address is CLASSLESS, i.e. for e.g. if your IP is a Private one, let's say 10.33.22.11 with a SubNet Mask of 255.255.255.248 which does not belong to any CLASS, A, B or C. If the SubNet Mask is Classless, then the NetworkID (or NetID) is the first IP in a Subnet that describes that network. In your case, as we've assumed 10.33.22.11 /29, your NetworkID with which your Network will be identified will be 10.33.22.8 while your BroadcastID will be 10.33.22.15. Usable IPs in this Subnet will be from .9 till .14 (total 6). So, to sum it up, NetID in a IPv4 Subnet is like a Team-Leader of that group by which the entire group is identified with. Router will be needed to access other networks in other subnets. Routers will create a Route (Static or Dynamic) from 10.33.22.8 to other networks & vice-versa.
