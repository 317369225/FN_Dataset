★Why doesn't IPv6 use the same notation as IPv4?It seems like it would be a lot simpler to compare things and reason about things.
To elaborate on Carlos' comment about ipv6 being expressed as dotted quad, here is a simplistic example. The ipv6 address 2606:F400:1:2::3/64 expressed in dotted quad: 637989888.65538.0.3 netmask 4294967295.4294967295.0.0 Big numbers, but not all that scary.  Yet.  Watch what happens when we kick it up a bit: 2606:F400:2000:3000::3/64 ...becomes... 637989888.536883200.0.3 Suddenly a super easily recognizable netblock of 2000:3000 (the first two segments are the service provider's) are now a monster of a number. And just to really turn it up to 11...  If we go with 2606:F400:2000:DDDD::3, keeping within the same /48 as the one before, we get: 637989888.536927709.0.3 When you combine these examples with the ipv6 rfc authors' intention that your ethernet adapter's mac address should be part of your ip address: 2606:F400:2000:DDDD::0025:6446:CAB3 (my actual mac address tacked onto the previous example) we get: 637989888.536927709.37.1682361011 I started making friends with ipv6 notation really fast after producing examples like this.  :)
