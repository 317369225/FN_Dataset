â˜…How does "echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward" command exactly work?What I want to know is: 1. Is ip_forward a file? 2. Why does a system store a single information in a single file (instead of storing multiple informations in a single file)?
Nothing in /proc is really a physical file. So, instead, you echo that to a virtual file and the driver responsible with ipv4 gets that message and changes its operation accordingly.
