â˜…What "future use" is the 240 - 255 block of IPv4 being reserved for?If not now, what future is there for it to be used for?
Originally, there were three classes of addresses: classes A, B, and C. Those covered all but 224.0.0.0/3. This large prefix was defined in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791 as an 'escape' block to an (undefined) extended addressing mode. Ultimately, it was split into class D (224.0.0.0/4, used for multicast), with class E (240.0.0.0/4) retained for future or experimental uses. That's where it came from. Your real question is "why can't it be used now?", and the answer to that is simple: nearly all routing software and hardware out in the wild will simply not forward traffic with a destination in that prefix. If the prefix had been repurposed, say, 10 years ago, then we could probably use it now. As it stands, to open up that address space to unicast traffic, a lot of kit would have to be replaced or upgraded for a very small gain. Given that IPv6 is already deployed in lots of hardware, even if it's not yet active, it's actually less painful to now start running IPv6 than it would be to release 240.0.0.0/4 for unicast traffic.
