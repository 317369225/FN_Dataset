★When did industry start talking about IPv4 address exhaustion?IPv4 address exhaustion has been talked about in industry circles since the late 1980s, but when did conversation reach critical mass?
Well RFC 2460 with the specs for IP v6 was released in December of 1998 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2460.txt).... IANA has announced that the last of its IP v4 addresses are to be assigned to the regional registries assigned to distribute them by the end of the month (JAN-2011).  This essentially will leave us in a scenario where IP v4  space will be gone around sometime around the third quarter of the year.  But I would definitely  say that the critical mass was when that spec was released.
