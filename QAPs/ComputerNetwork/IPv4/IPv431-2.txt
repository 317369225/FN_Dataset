â˜…How can I find the IPv4 address from an email with only IPv6 in the headers?So far, I can only identify the IPv6 address (from the "Received: From" line), but unable to convert it to IP. Can I trace the sender using IPv6 as well? If yes, then how, which websites provide conversion?
It is not clear what you mean when you say that you cannot convert an IPv6 address to IP. IPv6 is a form of IP. It sounds like you might be trying to establish the IP address of the web browser that submitted the e-mail to Gmail's web interface. Google hides this information, as it explains in this support article: Seeing a sender's IP address If you want to find out that information you'll need to use a legal process to compel Google to release it.
