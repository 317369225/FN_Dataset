â˜…Will IPv4 address exhaustion affect end users?
Besides the more visible change of addressing for the end users, there's a different side to it, that is the potential for disruption in the backbone while providers upgrade routers and transit/peering links. This may lead to performance problems, or even "blackholes" where parts of the net may be inacessible or too slow for practical use. The problem with the IPv4 transition to IPv6 is that all providers will need peering and transit agreements for both protocols. During the transition, this has the potential of being very very messy. It would be much easier if we could just run IPv4 and IPv6 over every link, but for this to work, everyone would have to upgrade all their routers, and also keep the same backbone architecture. But it's much more probable that things will be way more complex: Some providers may decide to upgrade the existing structure to run IPv6, others may decide to roll out new backbone. Some may do both (in different parts of their networks). Traffic will flow in completely different ways, depending on the availability of transit for some parts of the Net. For example, if a major provider delays IPv6 adoption, traffic will flow elsewhere, and providers will need new links to acommodate for that. There's no guarantee that current peering agreements will be honored for IPv6. In fact, the opportunity is ripe for some companies to try to force new contracts with other ASs that have enjoyed (perhaps for historical reasons) the status of IPv4 peers.All that said, I believe that we are going for a wild ride, and that it will unfortunately affect end users. Let's see how it goes!
