â˜…When did industry start talking about IPv4 address exhaustion?IPv4 address exhaustion has been talked about in industry circles since the late 1980s, but when did conversation reach critical mass?
I vividly remember being at a presentation at the local university (UFMG) circa 1992, where a teacher that had just arrived from the US made a presentation about the impending exhaustion of IPv4 addresses. At the time we still used "classfull" address (UFMG has a class B, for example) and NAT was just a crazy idea that nobody believed would work very well. His presentation touched on these two subjects, and that was the first time I've heard of them. Looking for more precise info, and based upon these memories, I did some fact checking. CIDR was officialy introduced in 1993 by RFC1519, which superseded RFC1338, which was published in 1992 and touched only on the concept of route aggregation with supernetting. NAT was introduced by RFC1631, published in 1994, but the concept was floating before, as can be seen on RFC1335 (published in 1992) with talked about having separate "internal addresses" and "external addresses". That may be the original source of my recollections regarding NAT. It's interesting to note that at the time the idea of a 128 bit address space wasn't being seriously discussed yet. RFC1287 talked about the "Future Internet Architecture" and explored options of a 64 bit addressing space. It's also interesting to note that almost all these RFCs show some concern about the size of the routing tables. However Moore's Law is taking care of that, and today the problem is much more human (we're way beyond our ability to manage such large tables and do traffic engineering with them) that technical. But that's getting off topic ;-)
