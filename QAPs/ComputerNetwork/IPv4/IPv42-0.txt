â˜…What will be the effects of IPv4 exhaustion?This would be great in time line form, starting now until full IPv6 adoption.
The tests Yahoo! and others on 8 June 2011 are intended to identify the current issues some networks have with IPv6 so that they can be addressed and rectified prior to a widespread deployment. The tests will not shut out anyone from those sites that can already reach them over IPv4. In the event that a system believes it can connect over IPv6, tries and then fails to do so it will fall back to IPv4 if that is available. So unless the user with the problem could not reach Yahoo! or one of the other participating sites over IPv4 anyway all they will experience is an irritating but temporary delay to their web browsing experience. Because all these content sites are doing the same test on the same day, none of them are more or less advantaged or disadvantaged than the other sites and some cooperation is possible in identifying where problems lie. After all, IP is all about communications.
