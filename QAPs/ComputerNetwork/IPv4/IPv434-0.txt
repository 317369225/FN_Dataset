â˜…Which network does the NetID in your IPv4 address correspond to?I just read about Class C networks, where the first 3 octets are reserved for the NetID and the last octet for the hostID. I don't understand which network, and it's corresponding ID we are referring to here.
What you are talking about is classful networking. This concept does not exist today. When this type of networking was used, the address space of IPv4 was divided into 5 classes. These classes were Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, and Class E. Class A contained IP addresses from 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 Class B contained IP addresses from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255 Class C contained IP addresses from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255 Class D contained IP addresses from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 Class E contained IP addresses from 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 Now, in your case, taking an example of class C address, let the address be 196.101.57.8 In this address, the first 3 octets are the network address. The last octet is the host address. The network address was used to identify the individual network (out of the many networks present) and the host address was used to uniquely identify the host on this particular network Example: You enter a housing society. You know the building number and the apartment number. But you don't know the physical path to your destination. You tell the security personnel in the society about your destination address. He then guides you to your destination. You finally enter the correct building and then reach to the correct apartment. In the above example, you can be considered as a data packet. The buildings can be considered as individual networks. The apartments in the buildings can be considered as individual hosts in those networks. The security personnel can be considered as a router. The address to which you wanted to go to can be considered as the final destination address for the data packet in which, the building number was the network address and the apartment number was the host address. Classful networking was replaced by Classless Inter Domain Routing.
