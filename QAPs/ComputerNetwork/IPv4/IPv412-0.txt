â˜…How many chars do I need to store any numeric IPv4 address?If I want to store IPv4 address like 127.0.0.1, etc. in a database, how wide should my varchar column be?
15 chars if you want to store the addresses in a human readable format. or 4 chars or 1 32 bit integer if you can store each part of the IP address as a byte. If you want to store the addresses in a human readable format like 127.0.0.1, then you need 3 chars for each part (255 is the max) and 3 chars for the dots = 4 * 3 + 3 = 15 If you don't care about readability, then you can store the IP address as one 32 bit integer instead to save space.
