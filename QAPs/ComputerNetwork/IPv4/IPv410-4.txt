★Why don't the Internet networks change from IPv4 to IPv6 if the IPv4 is almost exhausted?The IPv4 numers are almost exhausted and the adoption of IPv6 is under 1%. The RIPE(Europe) has only 16 million IPv4 available (RIPE NCC IPv4 Available Pool - Graph) So the question is: What are we waiting for? Why don't change immediately? And how will be done the swap?
Moving to IPv6 isn’t as simple as checking a box to support another octet’s worth of address space (which could have taken us rather a long way, if you think about it). IPv6 is effectively a whole new way to communicate, and so there’s a learning curve for busy geeks. There’s a dual-stack requirement, because IPv6 is not backwards compatible with IPv4. Not all hardware and software offers the same level of IPv6 functionality
