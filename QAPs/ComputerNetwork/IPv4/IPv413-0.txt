★When did industry start talking about IPv4 address exhaustion?IPv4 address exhaustion has been talked about in industry circles since the late 1980s, but when did conversation reach critical mass?
Prior  to the rollout of Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) and BGP 4, the  IPv4 address exhaustion problem looked much more imminent.  Wasteful allocation of the address space in the old Class A, Class B and Class C model had people talking about the problem extensively in 1992. Scott Bradner has a nice history of the IPng effort in response to the IPv4 exhaustion problem at http://www.sobco.com/ipng/index.....  There were a lot of proposals to address the IPv4 scaling problem in 1992, and by 1993, IETF had formally chartered the Address Lifetime Expectations group (ale) which included Quoran Tony Li.  Geoff Huston also has a great history of address exhaustion mediation efforts at potaroo.net. While IPv6 was being invented, CIDR and Network  Address Translation (NAT), squeezed a lot more life out of IPv4, up to the "official" exhaustion date in 2011. Have you enabled IPv6 on something today?
