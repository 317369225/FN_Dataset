★How can I find the IPv4 address from an email with only IPv6 in the headers?So far, I can only identify the IPv6 address (from the "Received: From" line), but unable to convert it to IP. Can I trace the sender using IPv6 as well? If yes, then how, which websites provide conversion?
If  you  want  an IPv6  operation  and  do an  hacking  on  it ....  Use thcipv6    tools.
