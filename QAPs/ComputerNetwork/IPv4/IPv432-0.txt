★How does "echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward" command exactly work?What I want to know is: 1. Is ip_forward a file? 2. Why does a system store a single information in a single file (instead of storing multiple informations in a single file)?
A file system is just a bunch of drivers, whose jobs are to answer the file system interfaces provided by the operating system.  What they actually do while answering those interfaces is up to the driver implementation.  If they choose to write them to storage and make actual files, they will.  If they choose to take other actions (such as querying the OS or machine hardware, etc, as the /proc "files" do, writing to the net, or other actions taken by "special purpose" FS drivers), this works as well.  As mentioned above, all you have to do to be a valid device driver is sanely implement file system interfaces so that callers can use them.  You do _not_ have to implement the typical "meaning" of those interfaces.
