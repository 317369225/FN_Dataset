â˜…How does "echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward" command exactly work?What I want to know is: 1. Is ip_forward a file? 2. Why does a system store a single information in a single file (instead of storing multiple informations in a single file)?
Your main question and first sub-question have already been well-answered, so... Why does a system store a single information in a single file (instead of storing multiple informations in a single file)? First, that's not universally true even on Linux. Try cat /proc/net/route to see a counterexample. I believe there are also /proc controls that consume multiple pieces of information at once, though I can't recall them at the moment. But one rule of thumb that I (and most programming veterans) follow is KISS - Keep It Safely Simple. In this case, parsing input to a kernel module can have disastrous results if you don't get it exactly right. One of the safest approaches to accept configuration input for multiple settings is to have single integer values and individual settings files - which is what you're seeing above.
