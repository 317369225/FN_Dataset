★Why have so few people switched to ipv6 from ipv4?even though ipv6 was launched in as early as 1998 and all ipv4 addresses have exhausted
Well, the IPv4 addresses aren't used up quite yet.  ARIN, for example, still have 1.82 /8s* left which comes out to be about 29 million IPs.  Of course, those numbers are depleting rapidly, and other Regional Internet registries (RIRs) are completely out.** As the global IPv4 addresses run out, IPv6 adoption has increased.  Google's IPv6 tracker, IPv6 - Google , shows that global use of IPv6 addresses was at about .5% begining of 2012 to 1.8% today.  Interestingly, most of the growth has been in the USA, where there are still plenty (relatively speaking) IPv4 addresses and Europe, where there is not.***  For example, USA is at 4.2% adoption.  France is at 5% So, why the laxness in adoption? Probably the biggest reason by far is that there's no incentive to.  As far as I can tell, there is no reward for requesting IPv6 addresses, nor is their punishment for insisting on IPv4.  The entire web is open to IPv4 and it still works well, at least in North America.  We know that eventually we'll have to switch to IPv6, just like, say, one knows he/she will have to cut down on how much beer they drink.  However no one is pushing them to cut down NOW, so they can push it off toward later. The chicken little effect.  Here's a link to a 2002 article saying that IPv4 space will be completely exhausted by 2005.  The Crowded Internet -- InformationWeek.  The predicting of the Internet's impending doom due to IP exhaustion has been going on for well over a decade and it becomes easy to dismiss such articles.  Mitigating strategies like IPv4 reclamation has helped delay the inevitable.  In the early days, plenty of organizations were issued WAY more IPv4 addreses than they needed.  For example, in 2000, Stanford returned their class A block because they really didn't need 16 million addresses.****  Those addresses can be reassigned to other organizations and people who will use them more efficiently. IPv6 is intimidating.  Here's a typical IP address: 192.168.0.1 (which is NOT my local default gateway in case anyone is guessing.)  Easy peasy.  Here's a typical IPv6 address. 2607:f0d0:1002:51::4 (short form) or  2607:f0d0:1002:0051:0000:0000:0000:0004 (long form)^.  Yowza! Chickens, eggs and money.  Content providers don't want to spend money to support IPv6 if only a fraction of their visitors are using it.  Consumers don't want to switch to IPv6 if no one is supporting it.   World IPv6^^ day helped in that regard, but we are still talking about a major lack of incentives. Like I said, IPv6 adoption rates ARE on the rise, it will just continue to be a slow process until either the general Internet population notices connectivity problems and figure out that IPv6 is the solution to demand from their providers, or the providers get to a point where it is more profitable to encourage usage of IPv6 than to continue to support IPv4. *Page on Arin ** IPv4 address exhaustion *** IPv6 - Google **** Stanford move rekindles 'Net address debate (and yet an even older article on this topic.) ^I used my example from IPv6 Address Example ^^ It's World IPv6 Day: here's what you need to know | ZDNet
