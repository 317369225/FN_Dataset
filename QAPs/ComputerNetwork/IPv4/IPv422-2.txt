â˜…If I have an IPv6 address can I still visit web server that have a IPv4 address?Does using IPv6 and IPv4 create two internets? Meaning that if you have an IPv6 address you can only access servers using IPv6 and same for IPv4. Or do they work with each other? It can't imagine getting an IPv6 address and only being limited to communicate with other using IPv6.
For the most part if you have an IPv6 address on your computer you should also have an IPv4 address, basically the computer is dual stacked which means it is running both protocols. Until IPv4 is totally gone, which will not be for a very long time, this is how most computers will run.
