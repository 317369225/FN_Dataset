★How much does a Class A (2^24 addresses) IPv4 network address space cost?
Currently, you cannot get one at any price.  Even if you paid the relevant fees, the space is simply not available. If the space were made available, (for example, by the DoD returning the 6.0.0.0 network), ARIN would distribute the returned address space guided by its internal policies, not your requests. The most effective way to obtain a class A address would be to purchase an organization holding a legacy Class A address.  Even that is no guarantee, since the addresses are not technically property of the institution holding the address.
