If some of your friend send you a mail how can the Internet makes that mail to reach you fast. then comes the concept of IP . Where your collage is a network with some Subnet and the students have some Subnet+Id which is IP. with that IP Internet can easily find you where ever are. Where MAC address plays a Important role In your campus Intranet.
