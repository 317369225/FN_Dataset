â˜…Why couldn't MAC addresses be used instead of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses for networking?
The MAC address might be unique, but there's nothing special about the number that would indicate where it is. MAC 00-00-00-00-00-00 might be on the other side of the planet from 00-00-00-00-00-01. IP is an arbitrary numbering scheme imposed in a hierarchical fashion on a group of computers to logically distinguish them as a group (that's what a subnet is). Sending messages between those groups is done by routing tables, themselves divided into multiple levels so that we don't have to keep track of every single subnet. For instance, 24.x.x.x is within the Comcast network. From there, Comcast will know where each of its thousands of subnets are located and how to get to them (nobody else needs to know this information, they just need to know that 24.anything goes to Comcast). It's also pretty easy to relate this to another pair of systems. You have a State Issued ID Number, why would you need a mailing address if that ID number is already unique to just you? You need the mailing address because it's an arbitrary system that describes where the unique destination for communications to you should go. Source - http://serverfault.com/a/410631
