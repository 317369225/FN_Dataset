â˜…When will IPv4 be phased out?
Feel free to claim chowder me ten years from now, but I don't see a day where IPv4 will be completely phased out. While the percentage of traffic carried over IPv4 will drop over time (IPv6 is still less than 2% of global internet traffic today), it will never be "turned off". There are simply too many networks and systems (legacy PCs, mobile devices, etc) that will never support IPv6 to safely make that sort of a clean break. What will happen instead, IMO, is that IPv4 traffic will be increasingly dependent on NAT devices in order to oversubscribe existing IPv4 address space among more users. Most wireless carriers do this already, but expect to see your cable or DSL modem get assigned a private IPv4 address at some point. Website operators will be forced to consolidate their address space as well, utilizing load balancers, anycast, and other solutions in order to serve sites from fewer IP addresses. Large online companies, for the most part, will be relatively unaffected since their public space is already allocated, and there will be a healthy market for underutilized IPv4 space if they need more. There may be a day where IPv6 utilization is dominant enough that IPv4 can be completely turned off on the public internet, but private networks will still use it extensively - it's just simpler and easier to use for most people, and I doubt that will change anytime soon.
