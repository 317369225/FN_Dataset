★How will the switch to IPv6 affect programs that rely on using IPv4 addresses?
The document from the US NIST "A Profile for IPv6 in the U.S. Government – Version 1.0"   http://www.antd.nist.gov/usgv6/u... , at page 37 makes your concerns quite apparent. Both in terms of user interaction and storage of the IP address applications and of course the support libraries and frameworks may need to be modified. I have found that many large enterprise grade application platforms simply have not been qualifed for operation in an IPv6 environment. It is like that many make unfortunate shortcuts and an IP address is not as abstract as it should be.
