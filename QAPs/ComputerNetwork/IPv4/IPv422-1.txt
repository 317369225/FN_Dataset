★If I have an IPv6 address can I still visit web server that have a IPv4 address?Does using IPv6 and IPv4 create two internets? Meaning that if you have an IPv6 address you can only access servers using IPv6 and same for IPv4. Or do they work with each other? It can't imagine getting an IPv6 address and only being limited to communicate with other using IPv6.
IPv4 and IPv6 does, in fact, create two internets.  The protocols operate as "ships in the night," completely unaware of each other's existence. Practically speaking, most devices for the forseeable future will be dual-stack, meaning that they run both IPv4 and IPv6.  There are a lot of cases for IPv6-only devices, especially in mobile networks or sensor networks. Those devices will have to rely on some kind of gateway to usher the traffic between IPv6 and IPv4 networks - for example, NAT64. Additionally, 464XLAT specifies a synthetic IPv4 stack in the form of a client (CLAT) that lives on a an IPv6 only device in order to allow access for legacy IPv4-only applications.  Wikipedia has a good list of other IPv6 transition mechanisms.
