â˜…Why don't the Internet networks change from IPv4 to IPv6 if the IPv4 is almost exhausted?The IPv4 numers are almost exhausted and the adoption of IPv6 is under 1%. The RIPE(Europe) has only 16 million IPv4 available (RIPE NCC IPv4 Available Pool - Graph) So the question is: What are we waiting for? Why don't change immediately? And how will be done the swap?
The problem for IPv6 is that the address space for IPv4 is really 32+16 bits, because port numbers provide connectivity, and multiply the number of addresses available at least 1000 fold behind a NAT. So there really is no shortage of addresses. And IPv6 introduces a lot of problems.
