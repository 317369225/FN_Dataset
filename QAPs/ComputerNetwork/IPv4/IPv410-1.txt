★Why don't the Internet networks change from IPv4 to IPv6 if the IPv4 is almost exhausted?The IPv4 numers are almost exhausted and the adoption of IPv6 is under 1%. The RIPE(Europe) has only 16 million IPv4 available (RIPE NCC IPv4 Available Pool - Graph) So the question is: What are we waiting for? Why don't change immediately? And how will be done the swap?
In my opinion, one block may be compatibility , on the other hand because of the usage of NAT technology etc, which makes the power of changing to IPV6 not so strong. In addition, use IPv6  can reduce the complexity and cost, which benefits can only producers feel, users and operators will not feel, so this results in the whole industry missing power to  push IPv6.
