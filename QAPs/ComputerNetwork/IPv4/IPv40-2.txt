â˜…When will IPv6 replace IPv4 completely on the planet?
Not for a long time. Our next step is hybrid networks, ones that will work with both IPv4 and IPv6. It's not the actual devices they're worried about. Devices like computers and smartphones can be patched, the completely incompatible ones will be replaced on the consumer dime. It's the infrastructure. They hit a dilemma that to save a dime router and modem manufactures build their products with just enough resources to run firmware with IPv4 capability, and to upgrade ISP companies would have to provide their entire customer base with new modems or gateways. Not to mention the countless labor and hardware costs to upgrade their routers and switches at datacenters. The switchover will happen eventually, as the unsupported software and hardware fails and gets replaced. As long as v4 isn't completely out of addresses then they don't have to switch over. The benefit IPv6 will provide is not having to use NAT to save on address space for right now. Other than that it's not worth going out of everyone's way to replace hardware and software just for IPv6 support for the sake of future proofing.
