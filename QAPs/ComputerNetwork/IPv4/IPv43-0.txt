★What is IPv4?
This is a very open ended question. There are books and books on IPv4. I'll cover a few of the basics here: IPv4 stands for Internet Protocol version 4. It's the most popular version of the Internet Protocols, though IPv6 (Intenet Protocol version 6) is starting to slowly gain some traction and will eventually replace it.Most traffic on the Internet is done through IPv4 and it's an essential part of almost any networking model. An IP addresses consists of a 32 bit address, which contains 4 octets with numbers ranging from 0-255. An example of an IP address is 192.168.1.1.  IPv4 is a connectionless protocol that works on best effort delivery. This means that it doesn't guarantee that data sent will be delivered or that it will arrive in the right order. It also doesn't guarantee that duplicate data won't be delivered. To work with these issues, TCP was developed to address data integrity. Combined they make up the TCP/IP Protocol suite. Some important things to know about it are that there are 5 classes of IPv4 addresses: A, B, C, D, and E. We are also running out of IPv4 addresses rapidly, as there is a maximum amount of 4294967296 IP addresses. It seems like a lot, but it's really not all that many. Subnetting and NATS has allowed us to extend the life of IPv4, but ultimately, we are going to have to move over to IPv6, which has an absurdly high amount of IP addresses. It functions very similarly to IPv4, but it's a different beast.
