â˜…Are IPv4 address assignments an appreciating or depreciating asset?
I would study the Nortel-Microsoft-ARIN address deal carefully. See ARIN stumbles into the Nortel-Microsoft IP address deal (2011) and I'd read this from a CPA, "IP Addresses: Forgotten Intangibles?" (2012) Page on scandh.com and then I'd consult a tax attorney familiar with the matter.
