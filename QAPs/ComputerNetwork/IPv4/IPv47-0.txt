â˜…What will the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 look like?How difficult will the migration to IPv6 be and what issues will arise?
The transition will be both sudden because of IPv4 depletion and take forever because of IPv6 to IPv4 gateways. While the incentive to move to IPv6 gets stronger by the day, the incentive to move away from IPv4 will probably never be strong enough to force a complete transition. I'd guess other issues like the 19 Jan 2038 date bug will do a better job of ending IPv4 usage. I would imagine IPv4 will be with us in some significant way for at least 40 years or more. Large scale IPv6 rollouts will expose security vulnerabilities currently masked by NAT. Deep packet inspection firewall usage will explode and host-based IP / port blocking will become much more important. End to end encryption will become much more widespread and a significantly more complex routing infrastructure will suffer its growing pains. That said, much of the governmental world is IPv6 ready as are most mobile networks and traditional carriers. Once the market sees no alternative to make the move, things will pick up quickly. But as "it's just around the corner" has been the ralying cry these past 10 years or so, when critical mass will be reached is anyone's guess.
