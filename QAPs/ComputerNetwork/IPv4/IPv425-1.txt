â˜…We all have already heard of IPv4 and IPv6. But what about IPv5? What is IPv5 and why are we converting straight to IPv6 and not to IPv5?IP = Internet Protocol.
There is an IANA registry for the different versions of the Internet Protocol: http://www.iana.org/assignments/... It shows that IPv5 was assigned for what was called ST Datagram Mode. It was defined in RFC 1190 and was an experimental protocol for Internet streaming. It over 20 years old now, so the experiment has finished and it's not used in production networks. IPv6 was assigned a few years after IPv5, following a competition to develop the replacement for IPv4.
