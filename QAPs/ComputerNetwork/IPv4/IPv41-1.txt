★How is Anycast implemented  using IPv4?
As Tony said, anycast is quite simply the practice of numbering multiple hosts with the same IP address (usually in multiple geographic areas), then advertising a route for the IP from each location where there is a host. Traffic to that address will then terminate on the host that is logically closest, in terms of IP routing metrics, to the sender, improving reply latency. The big problem with anycast is that within the scope of a single transaction, all traffic must go to the same end host on both ends. When you have multiple hosts responding to the same IP address, there's no guarantee that a change in routing metrics won't change which host traffic goes to in the middle of your session or transaction, which will cause the communication to fail. As such, applications that work best via anycast have traditionally been single-query/single-response UDP transactions such as DNS resolution. TCP-based protocols are more fragile going to anycasted endpoints, but depending on the use case, that can be an acceptable risk. The fewer packets and time involved in completing the transaction, the lower the risk. Long-lived transactions, on the other hand, are usually a non-starter for anycasted endpoints. The best strategy I've seen is to use an anycasted IP for a DNS resolver that responds to queries with unique host IPs that are in the same location/site. That gets you the benefit of users being able to "find" the closest endpoint, but ensures that all transactions will complete.
