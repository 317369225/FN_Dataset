★How can I find the IPv4 address from an email with only IPv6 in the headers?So far, I can only identify the IPv6 address (from the "Received: From" line), but unable to convert it to IP. Can I trace the sender using IPv6 as well? If yes, then how, which websites provide conversion?
The question makes no sense.  Traffic is sent from EITHER an IPv6 address OR an IPv4 address.  Even if a host is "dual stacked" running both IPv4 and IPv6, there is no way to determine a host's IPv4 address based on it's IPv6 address.  They exist completely independently. Now, if the real question is "how can I learn information about the user of an IPv6 address," you can get WHOIS and DNS info from an IPv6 address using IP Address Lookup (IPv4 & IPv6), Information about your IPv6 address or DNS Tools - IPv6 DNS Lookup, as well as a number of other places.  The geolocation information for IPv6 isn't as well developed relative to Ipv4.  At least so far. If the email has been send from a web-based client like GMail, you can only know the originating IP address of the SMTP envelope Google's servers, not the IP address of the web browser that was using the GMail client.  That information is not included in the SMTP headers, presumably for privacy reasons.  However, some web based mail like Yahoo will provide a synthetic HTTP hop to show the IP address of the original web browser that opened the client connection.
