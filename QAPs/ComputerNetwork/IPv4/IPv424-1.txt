★Why does USPS need 16 million public IPv4 addresses?
(This is an edited copy of an answer from a similar question about MIT's address space) In the beginning of time, IPv4 addresses were broken into 3 classes:  Class A, Class B and Class C.  These breakdowns were based on a binary masking of 8, 16, and 24 bits for 256, 65535 and 16777216 available network addresses, respectively (minus inefficiencies and loss due to subnetting).  Prior to the introduction of Classless Inter-Domain Routing around 1993, any site that could make a case that they might grow beyond 65535 nodes someday could make a case to request a class A network from the forerunner to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authoritywhich was then run out of the Information Sciences Institute. If you want to amuse yourself, go to List of assigned /8 IPv4 address blocks and sort the list by date.  You can giggle about how many relatively small users on the modern Internet have a full "Class A" network, especially for issue dates prior to 1993.
