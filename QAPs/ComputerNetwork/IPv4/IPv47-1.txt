â˜…What will the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 look like?How difficult will the migration to IPv6 be and what issues will arise?
Currently, in the US only Hurricane Electric is really ready for it. Verizon is getting there. Most of the other carriers are not saying. Which I read as they are clueless. If your networking equipment is more than one year old it probably is NOT IPv6 ready. Including some major manufactures like Cisco. Even now a lot of switches and routers are going out the door IPv4 only. The biggest issue will be infrastructure. When will every significant ISP have routers in place to handle IPv6 traffic? When will every online name server have the ability to resolve IPv6? When will the registrars require every registration to have both an IPv4 and IPv6 name server? My thinking is that once the porn and online gambling sites become IPv6 only the switch will occur almost by magic over night. Until that happens I agree with Anders Brownworth 40 years of wandering in the desert.
