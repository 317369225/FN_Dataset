★Why don't the Internet networks change from IPv4 to IPv6 if the IPv4 is almost exhausted?The IPv4 numers are almost exhausted and the adoption of IPv6 is under 1%. The RIPE(Europe) has only 16 million IPv4 available (RIPE NCC IPv4 Available Pool - Graph) So the question is: What are we waiting for? Why don't change immediately? And how will be done the swap?
IPv6 allocation is done by IANA and they allocate blocks of IP address with size of each block as /8 (ie each block consist of 2^24 IP address) when IAN announced that all IP blocks are assigned they meant that all of 256 blocks of /8 IP addresses are assigned or reserved. Now /8 blocks are assigned to registries like APNIC, LACNIC, RIPE NC.. They further allocate IP blocks in /10 /12 /16 or /24 to regional internet registries and they further allocate it to ISP or end user directly. Now only /8 blocks are exhausted but address in 221 (non reserved) /8 blocks are still not completely in use. Still  many local registries are having /16, /18, /20, /21, /22, /24 blocks available for assignment and lease Now we are in alarming situation where with advent of mobile users, IPv6 resources are not sufficient, concepts like smart home, smart grid also contributing to immediate need to transit to IPv6. we have from moved from internet to Internet of things (IOT) to Internet of Everything All countries (including India) have understood the need to transit to IPv6 and made roadmap. some are doing relatively fast and some are adopting to new technology sluggishly but all are working on it
