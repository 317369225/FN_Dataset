â˜…What is the way to access ipv4 through wireless and ipv6 through Ethernet?Here is a free wireless network to access ipv4 while ipv6 is not available. Meanwhile, a ethernet which can supply free ipv6 access only. How could I get them work at the same time?
Most devices that support IPv6 are dual stack devices. If you are using Linux (ie. Fedora, Ubuntu), MS Windows (latests versions maybe 2008 up) and MacOSX. Just make sure they are enabled. In the new Linux distributions, this is enabled by default. If you have a dual stack device then you can connect to the wired CSMA/CD (ie. Ethernet) network using IPv6 and connect to the wireless network using IPv4. So both are connected at the same time.
