★How is Anycast implemented  using IPv4?
Certain people still have a fear about the practicality of Anycast in TCP, which are unfounded.. somewhere upwards of 50% of the websites you visit rely on anycast somewhere in their architecture (typically DNS, but quite a lot of TCP CDN's these days). (For example, all of Quora's static assets on this page are loaded from a CDN provider that's doing TCP anycast). IPv4 anycast is a little hard to wrap your around in particular because..as far as every single device is concerned.. it doesn't exist.. it's just a route with a next-hop...See below: large content provider has the following setup: - pop in san jose - pop in ashburn - transport between the locations - transit from level3 in both locations - has 100.0.0.0/24 which they use for their website, located in SJC, which ashburns learns from IBGP - is using AS10 to advertise - advertises to level3 in both locations with same localpref and metric, uses their backhaul to haul bits from ashburn to san jose here's what it the as-path looks like inside level3 for 100.0.0.0/24:  in ashburn: 3356  10    next-hop: ashburn ip in san jose: 3356 10    next-hop: san jose ip here's what it looks like on at&t in ashburn: 7018 3356 10   next-hop: level3 ashburn ip san jose: 7018 3356 10:    next-hop: level3 san jose ip Just looks like a normal, multihomed prefix, to level3, and to everyone on the internet. 100.0.0.1 is the service VIP their F5 load balancer, which has an IP of 1.2.3.4 so in san jose they do this ip route 100.0.0.1/32 1.2.3.4 now when the internet wants to reach 100.0.0.1, it gets on level3's network somewhere in the world, and level3 delivers it to sjc or ashburn, whichever is 'best' inside level3, and then once it enters AS10's border, it's routed to the load balancer on 1.2.3.4 which replies from 100.0.0.1. So Now, there's a 'normal' multihomed unicast prefix.. what tomfoolery must they do for anycast you ask?? 4 steps. a) they install a new cluster of web servers, and a new load balancer, in ashburn b) they configure the f5 in ashburn, real ip of 4.3.2.1, with the *same* VIP of 100.0.0.1/32 c) ip route 100.0.0.1/32 4.3.2.1 in ashburn d) locally generate the 100.0.0.0/24 prefix in ashburn. they're now anycasted.  All the traffic that level3 delivers from ashburn will now be served by the local F5, all the traffic that level3 delivers in san jose will now be served from the local F5 in san jose. As for as level3 is concerned, there's no such thing as anycast..nothing changes. as far as AT&T (and the rest of the internet) is concerned, there's no such thing as anycast, nothing changes. even AS10's ashburn/san jose routers don't know about anycast..they just know they have a local next-hop for that IP, and forward it there. and the F5 knows nothing about anycast, it just knows it has a VIP so it replies to traffic to the VIP.
