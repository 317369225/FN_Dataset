â˜…Why doesn't IPv6 use the same notation as IPv4?It seems like it would be a lot simpler to compare things and reason about things.
IPv6 address would be too long to express as simply as IPv4 addresses are usually written. Writing it the same way would make address too long. Writing in hex is one simple trick to alleviate this problem. Allowing groups to be written as a single digit ("0", for instance) is another trick. Please note there are a few basic assumptions in both protocols which happen to be completely different. IPv4 had originally only a very simple concept of classes, that was later extended with CIDR, which meant that for practically all purposes the addressing space could be understood as a simple "flat" addressing space (multicast and reserved space notwithstanding). On the other hand, IPv6 tries to solve a lot of things and thus its address space has a completely different structure. The "::" to substitute for zeroes and other similar mechanisms are tricks that in some way make it a little bit easier to recognize such special addressing groups.
