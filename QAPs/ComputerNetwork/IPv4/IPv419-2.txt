★Is IPv4 address saturation still a crisis situation?
IPv4 address exhaustion has been a problem since the mid-1990s.  The NANOG (North American Network Operators Guild) was making jokes about it back then (I have a T-shirt with the impending date scratched scratched out several times.) It's an annoyance, more to some people (esp. in developing and newly developed countries), much less so to old US Universities with multiple class-B networks and options on a class-A network - to say nothing of other network fragments.)  Or corporations that have inherited multiple class-A networks through mergers and acquisitions. (HP has it's own and Digital Equipment Corp's class-A networks.)
