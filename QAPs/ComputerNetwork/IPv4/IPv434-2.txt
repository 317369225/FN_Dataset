★Which network does the NetID in your IPv4 address correspond to?I just read about Class C networks, where the first 3 octets are reserved for the NetID and the last octet for the hostID. I don't understand which network, and it's corresponding ID we are referring to here.
lets take an example ..if you have newly purchased a wifi router and if you connect to it you will most likely find that the the network you are connected is 192.168.0.0  and the routers ip would be 192.168.0.1 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0 . if this was 20 years back then i could have told you that this is a class C network but since nowadays classfull networkin has become obsolete we cant call it as class A,class B class C. comming to your point in olden days when we didnt have CIDR we used classfull routing i.e we divided all ip address into different classes: 1) if the subnet mask of the ip address is 255.0.0.0 i.e the first octate is reserved then we say that the ip addrs belongs to a Class A network. how do you find out the network id from ip? simple convert the ip in binary and then convert the subnet in binary. so if your ip is 10.0.0.4 and subnet is 255.0.0.0 then there binaries are respectively 00001010.00000000.00000000.00000100 and 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000.  the binary of subnet will always be consecutive 1's so now compare th subnet and the ip , till where the 1's end in subnet till then in the ip address are reserved for networ id so take that out i.e here the consecutive 1's end in the 1st octate only so take the first octate out in the ip i.e 10 now fill the remaining octates with 0's i.e 10.0.0.0 you have your network address. this is class A network because its fist octate was reserved for netword addrss similary if the first two octates (i.e the subnet mask would be 255.255.0.0) are reserved then its class B network similarly if the first three octates(i.e the subnet mask would be 255.255.255.0) are reserved for network id then it is class C network  apart from this rule the first octate of class A network will always have first bit of the first octate  as 0 hence the possible ip address in class A are from 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 and in class b the first two bits of the first octate would be 1 0 i.e 10XXXXXX.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX so the range of ips in class b are 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255 and for class C the first three bits of the first octate will be 1 1 0 i.e 1 1 0 XXXXX.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX hence he range of ips in class C is 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
