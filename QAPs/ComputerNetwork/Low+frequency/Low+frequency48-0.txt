★Why does an inductor function as a short circuit at low frequencies, and at high frequencies it acts as a open circuit?The answer is expected to be an explanation of the concept behind the working of the inductor. Basically, the explanation should suffice the frequency response of the inductor.
Look at it's frequency domain description  , XL= sL  , where s is frequency . For low frequencies ,XL->0 ,for high ,XL->Infinity . XL is the inductive reactance    Embed Quote
