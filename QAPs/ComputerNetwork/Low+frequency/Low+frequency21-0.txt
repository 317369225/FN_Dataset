★Can deaf people who could previously hear normally, hear low frequency sounds?For example, you can feel a kick drum/bass at a loud music gig so would a previously able person be able to create this sound in their mind?
Whether or not they can actually hear low frequency sounds depends entirely on their hearing loss; some people have residual low-frequency hearing and some don't. Whether or not they can remember sound depends on how long it has been since they last had hearing.  If it was somewhat recent, within the past few years, they would probably be able to remember what it sounds like.  The ability will diminish with time; some sounds will remain more memorable than others. The emotions connected with sound are also important.  When I was a child, I was able to hear fingernails scratching on a blackboard.  I can't hear that anymore, but I still cringe because I remember what they sounded like.  But whether I am actually recreating the sound in my mind, or just remembering the horror of the sound, is unclear.  I'm not sure which it is.    Embed Quote
