★Why is low frequency transmitted longer than higher frequency? Why are microwaves used and not radio waves in cellular phones?
Lower frequency radio waves can reflect off of the ionosphere, and the surface, multiple times and so can travel for very long distances over the surface of the earth. Line of sight is not required for reception of lower frequency radio waves. In the old days, when using Morse code over 80m, 40m or 20 m bands with low powered tranmitters (< 1 Watt radiated power) was a hobby for many people, I commonly picked up transmissions from Australia: we used to send QSL cards, which were simple post cards, to each other, as proof that the conversation actually had taken place. In those days you needed to be licensed by the FCC to transmit. That requirement has since been dropped. Similarly, "shortwave" radio transmissions can easily be picked up from around the world: I used to listen to shortwave broadcasts all the time. I still do, when a hurricane or some other weather event knocks out power where I live (a pretty regular event on Long Island). I hear AM radio from distant locations in Canada and the US all the time. Only very rarely do I receive FM transmissions from much more than 50-60 miles away, though it does happen sometimes: but it takes very special conditions for that to happen, due to the higher frequency of the carrier wave and sidebands. For cell phones the transmission is almost purely line of sight, and it is optimized for high overall bandwidth: the system must carry many simultaneous voice conversations. Thus higher frequencies, in the "microwave" range are much preferable.    Embed Quote
