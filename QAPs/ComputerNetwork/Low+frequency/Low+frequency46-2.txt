★"[T]he majority of high-frequency managers delivered positive returns in 2008, whereas 70 percent of low-frequency practitioners lost money": is this temporary or has this become a permanent feature of markets?
This has less to do with frequency of trading and more to do with broad market exposure. 1. high frequency traders are generally flat broad market risk 2. the majority of non-HF market participants are long market risk The majority of investment shops make their money by attempting to BUY stocks that will outperform the market, so these firms lost money in 2008.  They did great in 2009 and are doing great so far in 2010.    Embed Quote
