★What is an optimum frequency, if any, for a low-frequency oscillator that is used during sleep mode?When MCUs go into a low-power sleep mode, they rely on a low-frequency oscillator. It is usually 32Khz based on my experience. How is this frequency determined as the most appropriate? Why not 1Khz since it may lead to lower power? Why not an odd number like 17Khz?
What is an optimum frequency, if any, for a low-frequency oscillator that is used during sleep mode? Most sleep mode oscillators that I am familiar with are 32.768kHz. 32kHz is chosen since it divides down to frequencies that are useful for time keeping and small crystals are readily available. CMOS power consumption is proportional to where C is the capacitance of a gate, f is frequency, and V is voltage. Therefore power consumption is linearly dependent upon frequency. Power consumption is already pretty low at 32kHz. Most crystal controlled watches use 32kHz. Dropping the oscillator by half would cut the power consumption in half, but the crystal would be physically bigger. Someone has made a trade off on the physical size, cost, and power consumption of 16kHz versus 32kHz versus 8kHz.    Embed Quote
