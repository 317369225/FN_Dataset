★Why does a capacitor function as an open circuit at low frequencies, while at high frequencies it acts as a short circuit?
This is  a sinusoidal signal represented by a complex   exponential: The Ohm's law says: Now try looking at voltage-current relationships across a capacitor. We can calculate the impedance as follows: You can notice that the magnitude of impedance goes down as the frequency increases. This means that at very high   frequencies the capacitor acts as an short circuit, and at low frequencies it acts as an open circuit. EDIT: "Conceptual" Approach- When you say low or high, you talk relative to something. Here, low frequency (high time period, say 't') and high frequency (low time period) are relative to the time taken by the capacitor (say 't1') to charge or discharge. So, when t  >> t1, the capacitor gets charged quite quickly and then acts as an open circuit. However, when t1 >> t, the capacitor takes longer time in getting charged, and acts as a short circuit.    Embed Quote
