★Are deep earthquakes more likely to have low frequencies than shallow earthquakes?
Earthquake energy is attenuated as it travels through rock, however the higher frequencies are attenuated more than the lower frequencies.   As a result, you are more likely to feel a sharp jolt (which means more higher frequencies are present) in an earthquake that is close by, than you are from one that is further away.   The distance that counts is between you and the epicentre - how much rock the energy has travelled through -  which could include how far underground the earthquake is, how far away it is, or both.    This doesn't mean the quakes produce different frequencies, just that how you feel/observe/record them at the surface varies.   This difference in frequencies is enough that you can usually tell if an earthquake is large-but-distant or small-but-local from how the shaking feels.    Embed Quote
