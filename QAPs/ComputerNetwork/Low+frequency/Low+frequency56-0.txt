★How can one detect the source of low frequency pulsing sound when it can have many possible sources?I live on the top floor of a condo with an array of AC units directly over me on the roof. This sound has been tormenting me for many months. Attempts to identify the unit are stymied by occupants of other apartments being unavailable for testing. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
Generally the best approach is to have a building engineer go through and turn off any suspected units one by one. This can help you narrow down if it is one unit or multiple.    Embed Quote
