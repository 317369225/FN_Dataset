★What is the relation between high or low frequencies and the sharpness of an image?
If you perform Fourier analysis of an image (converting the image into the frequencies that make it), sharp transitions will be represented by high-frequency components. Dennis Ferguson explained why. Here's a cool picture with 2D Fourier transforms of images that represent some letters of the alphabet. It would take a while to explain all details (including complex-valued results), but note that the letters with distinct horizontal, vertical or diagonal lines have perpendicular "lines" in their Fourier transforms (a line is made up of two sharp edges). For Q, the transform is mostly round, but shows a couple of diagonal lines that represent the non-roundness in the circle and the small straightline segment.    Embed Quote
