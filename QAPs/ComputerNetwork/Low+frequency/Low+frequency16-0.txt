★What percentage of bus trips in London are on "low frequency" routes?
I can't help with your statistic, except to suggest that you restrict your study to busses serving one particular loca and find the published timetables online or even visit and look at the timetables on the bus stops. Polling travellers would also be useful, after all it's their PERCEPTION of the service that matters, as much as the numbers. Even on a high frequency route, one bus MUST be on time - the last one! The final service on my local 364 route should connect with the London train at Goodmayes with 3 minutes to spare. The train is often on time. The bus is invariably early, so I have to walk.    Embed Quote
