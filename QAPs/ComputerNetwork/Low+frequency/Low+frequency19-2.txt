★Acoustics: Do high frequency sounds dissipate less in air than low frequency sounds?I've heard that Lincoln had a high voice and that this was actually an advantage in the open air speaking and debating of his time.  Is this right?  More generally, how does the dissipation of a sound wave in air (both loss of amplitude and dispersion of frequency) depend on the wave's frequency?
Sound reaching the audience depends on two main things. Intensity, which is inversely proportional to distance squared and attenuation which is directly proportional to frequency squared. Sounds with low frequency over short distances will be most audible. But I doubt that Lincoln had any huge advantage per se. Male voice has a lower frequency than a females, and maybe he just had a really loud voice. Intensity and frequency both play a role, and if both work in his favor, then maybe.    Embed Quote
