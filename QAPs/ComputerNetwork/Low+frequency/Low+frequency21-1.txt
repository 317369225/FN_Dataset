★Can deaf people who could previously hear normally, hear low frequency sounds?For example, you can feel a kick drum/bass at a loud music gig so would a previously able person be able to create this sound in their mind?
They can FEEL the sounds of kick drum, bass, piano (if they're close enough).  So they may get the impression they are "hearing" it, because their bodies can feel the sounds.  Before they became deaf, when they heard low frequency sounds, they also felt them.  And they may have connected the hearing and feeling in their minds, because most folks do. Then when they feel loud, deep, repeating sound, it seems to them they are hearing it. I introduced a profoundly deaf child to music once, by having him hold his body against my piano when I played.  It was a thrilling thing for both of us.  He could experience the music, because sound waves are taken into our bodies in ways other than just our ears.  He had never heard before, but he loved feeling the music (which I played in the low register, knowing it would be easier to feel).    Embed Quote
