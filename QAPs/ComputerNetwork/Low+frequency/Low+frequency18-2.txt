★Why does a capacitor function as an open circuit at low frequencies, while at high frequencies it acts as a short circuit?
A capacitor doesn't conduct under any circumstances, it can only charge its opposite plates, or discharge. When the frequency of input signal is very low, or zero, it will charge in few time constants (i am assuming time constant is very low) and then stay that way, and discharge only when the signal voltage goes lower than capacitor voltage. If its zero, only charging will take place when supply is on, which is why it becomes open circuit after few time constants On other hand, in case of very high frequency signals, the capacitor will charge and discharge so rapidly that it appears as if the capacitor is conducting, thereby acting like a short (though not an ideal short circuit).    Embed Quote
