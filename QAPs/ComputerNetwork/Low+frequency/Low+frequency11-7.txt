★Why is low frequency transmitted longer than higher frequency? Why are microwaves used and not radio waves in cellular phones?
Communication at very low frequencies can actually use the number of waves to send a message.  One medium in which these waves can travel great distances is the ocean.  One second of 8 Hz - 8 beats - could correspond to a meaning taken from a list of meanings in the hands of the receiver, say, in a submarine. So a meaning, if not a conversation, can be transmitted in a very short time by an extremely low frequency. Such waves are powerful, and perhaps destructive to ocean creatures. Much higher frequencies are needed to carry electrical impulses corresponding to actual sound waves formed by conversation, for the reasons given in much more comprehensive answers than mine.    Embed Quote
