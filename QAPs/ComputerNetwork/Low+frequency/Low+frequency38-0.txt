★Is Russia transmitting low frequency signals to communicate with submarines or are they trying to mask lower frequencies?The higher frequencies mask the lower. Perhaps, Russia is concerned over 'riot' frequencies. Aka. Terror management.
VLF radio is the standard way to communicate with submarines, every country uses it. Nothing to do with haarp or neuroscience Submarine communications is radio frequency, riot control is done with low audio frequencies ( not very effective anyway I think the dropped the experiments years ago )    Embed Quote
