★What equipment do I need to detect low frequency sound waves and electromagnetic radiation levels?I'm okay with having to crunch some numbers and inexpensive is in my price range.
I'm not a physicist or remotely even close to one but as far as  simply detecting low frequency sound waves you can simply hook up a Multimeter to a subwoofer speaker installed in a sealed enclosure and set the meter to it's most sensitive AC voltage setting, millivolts for most meters. I suppose an oscilloscope hooked up to the subwoofer would work as well for determining the frequency of the low  frequency sound you are trying to detect. You did say inexpensive. There is also a free app from Rockford Fosgate for your phone for detecting and measuring the frequency and Db of low frequency sound waves. Not sure if this helps you for what you are trying to do. Anyone more knowledgeable than me feel free to elaborate or correct me.    Embed Quote
