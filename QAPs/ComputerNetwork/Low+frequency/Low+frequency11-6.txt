★Why is low frequency transmitted longer than higher frequency? Why are microwaves used and not radio waves in cellular phones?
Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength. Hence lower the frequency higher the wavelengtg and longer it can travel. But a low frequency waves such as a radio waves cannot has smaller bandwidths compared to the microwaves and hence it cannot carry as much information as a microwave can. That is why a microwave is used for cellular phones. Also if two stations are using radiowaves there will ve interference of signal and that's why people had crosstalks or signal cross over in the past over telephone.    Embed Quote
