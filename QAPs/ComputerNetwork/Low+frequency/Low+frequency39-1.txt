★Which Iridium subscription should I get for long term, but low frequency emergency usage?The packages are very confusing - different companies sell them, some sellers only service customers in certain regions, the prepaid minutes seem to expire within 30 days (other sources claim they are extended for months and only top-up vouchers expire in a month). The minimum spend for Iridium seems to be ~60 USD even if you only want to use it as emergency backup.
If you're looking to have your phone readily available in case of an emergency your best option will be a monthly service plan.  These plans typically auto-renew monthly and don't expire. As you're paying your bill your phone should be active and ready to use at a moments notice.  A monthly service plan is typically cheaper in the long run if you're using less than ~100 minutes per year where the per minute rate is ~$1.50.   With the prepaid plans Iridium provides several options, however they all have expiration dates and you must monitor the minutes remaining.  We see all too often, even after continuous reminders that people forget or don't get around to renewing and they lose remaining airtime and the phones becomes deactivated.    Embed Quote
