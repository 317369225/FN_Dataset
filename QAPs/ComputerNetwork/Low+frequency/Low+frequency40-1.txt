★Low-frequency sounds such as the roar of a lion or a bear are meant to make us scared and alert, from an evolutionary point of view. Then why do I, and people alike, love music such as dubstep?
Part of the answer is in the composition of the music.  Low bass and pounding rhythms are generally exciting to humans.  If instead you just played a continuous sine wave at say 50Hz, it would likely drive you crazy after less than a minute.  It isn't the low sounds of the music you like, but their variation and arrangement.    Embed Quote
