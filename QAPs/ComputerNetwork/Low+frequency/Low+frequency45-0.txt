★Why are low frequency waves more suitable than VHF for acoustic levitation? Is the relationship between frequency and sound pressure monotonic?My guess is it's got to do with lower sound pressures at lower frequencies, but I'm seeking a little more information here. Also, by monotonic, I mean does the relationship have maxima/minima points or is it just increasing or decreasing?
Thanks for A2A... Sound Pressure, p = ρ x v x ω x ξ f Hz frequency ρ kg/m³ density of medium v m/s speed of sound ω = 2 π f radians/s angular frequency ξ m amplitude So it is directly proportional to frequency for the same intensity (amplitude). To sustain the levitated object in air, I think you have to balance this pressure with the weight of the object.    Embed Quote
