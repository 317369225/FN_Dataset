★How do subwoofers produce very low frequencies?
Subwoofers have larger vibrating parts than other speakers. The length of  a vibrating string and the intended output wavelength are often proportional and related by a fixed ratio, because this influences the efficiency of sound reproduction (loudness as a function of input power). The lower a frequency you want to reproduce, the larger the device needs to be in order to be effective. (A similar reasoning goes for antennas involved in radio transmission. They can from a few centimeters long for microwaves to using the entire planet as an antenna in the case of extremely low frequency transmitters.)    Embed Quote
