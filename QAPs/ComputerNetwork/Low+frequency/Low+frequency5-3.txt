★What is the relation between high or low frequencies and the sharpness of an image?
Sharper images have a greater proportion of higher frequency components, and conversely, blurry images have a lower proportion of higher frequency components present. For example, take this image which is made up of a sine wave whose frequency increases from left to right: The left side of the image has a low frequency component, which keeps increasing till the right end which has the highest frequency in this image. Now, apply a Gaussian blur to this image (of 10 pixels using Gimp: GNU Image Manipulation Program): The left side is practically the same as the original, but the sharp waves on right side have merged into each other. Low frequencies on the left side are unaffected by the blur, but the high frequencies on the right side have been strongly affected. Thus in the second image, which is a blurred or less sharp version of the original image, the strength high frequency components is much lower than the low frequency components. Lets also see what happens when we sharpen the image: This image has been sharpened using the sharpen filter in Gimp 2.2 which offers a single adjustable parameter - sharpness, which has been varied form 60% to 97%. Here, you can see that again, the low frequency components on the left hand side are again unchanged, but the high frequency components become more and more pronounced as the sharpness increases, and it is most pronounced at the rightmost end of the image.
