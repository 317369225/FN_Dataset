★What are some low-frequency world news sources to follow on Twitter?Like everyone, I'd like to stay in touch with the news, but I don't want to get flooded. Most of the conventional news accounts on Twitter (BBC News, newspapers, blogs) update more than a dozen times a day. Are there any accounts that are more selective - they'll tell you if September 11th happens, but leave you alone otherwise?
