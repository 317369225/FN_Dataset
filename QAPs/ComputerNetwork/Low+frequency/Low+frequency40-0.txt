★Low-frequency sounds such as the roar of a lion or a bear are meant to make us scared and alert, from an evolutionary point of view. Then why do I, and people alike, love music such as dubstep?
I recall reading that part of the reason humans have a physical "chill response" to music we enjoy is exactly because it triggers a fear mechanism. There is a reason that music chills are very similar to fear chills: they are rooted in the same response. For example, many people find soprano opera singers to be ecstasy inducing. Oddly enough, the high-frequencies that these singers can hit are reminiscent of crying or screeching that humans are traditionally unsettled by. (See link: The Science Behind Getting “Chills” From Music) For some weird reason that I cannot explain to you, however, our minds are able to differentiate between true fear, and false alarms like dubstep music or opera. Instead, we apparently embrace this "good fear" as a pleasurable experience. Additional links: Why Does Music Give Us Chills?
