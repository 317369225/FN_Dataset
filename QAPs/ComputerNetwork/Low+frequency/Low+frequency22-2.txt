★How do you block low frequency sounds that come from a sub-woofer?
You could stick a pillow into the sub-woofer to dampen the sound or you can just turn it off or lower the volume. Another thing to note is to not face the sub-woofer toward corners or put it near walls because that creates a booming effect that is undesirable. The best place to put the woofer is around the middle of the room if possible.    Embed Quote
