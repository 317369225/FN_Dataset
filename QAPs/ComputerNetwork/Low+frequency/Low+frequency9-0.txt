★How do subwoofers produce very low frequencies?
The enclosure - speaker cabinet - plays an important part. A subwoofer just sitting out in the open with no enclosure doesn't work very well at all. Just a basic closed box is the minimum necessary, but with the appliance of science to speaker cabinet design you can do much better. A Bass reflex cabinet about doubles the efficiency at low frequencies, but for the ultimate, you need an Exponential Horn. A horn is a mechanical transformer, coupling the small volume, high pressure of the loudspeaker cone to the large volume, low pressure air at the mouth. A typical closed-back subwoofer cabinet may be 2% efficient, in terms of energy transferred from the cone to the air. A well designed folded horn bass bin may transfer as much as 50% of the energy. Regrettably, you will not be able to get a pair of them in the trunk of your car, unless you drive a panel van.    Embed Quote
