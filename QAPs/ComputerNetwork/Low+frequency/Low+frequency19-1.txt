★Acoustics: Do high frequency sounds dissipate less in air than low frequency sounds?I've heard that Lincoln had a high voice and that this was actually an advantage in the open air speaking and debating of his time.  Is this right?  More generally, how does the dissipation of a sound wave in air (both loss of amplitude and dispersion of frequency) depend on the wave's frequency?
Very low, booming sounds, carry the longest.  However, they are mostly below the speech range. The US Air Force did a study a long time ago (about a half century) showing that high voices were easier to distinguish over background noise, so perhaps it was thing that gave Lincoln an advantage, if it did.    Embed Quote
