★In a stable population, do most low-frequency alleles ultimately vanish?
No. Unless the population is very small, whether they vanish or not depends on the selection pressure against them (which, in turn, is dependent on a wide variety of factors). Without any selection pressure, the frequency will slowly drift. The larger the population, the more stable the frequency and less likely that the allele will drift to extinction. You can trivially illustrate this on a computer by creating a simulated population with a particular allele frequency and performing in silico crosses to make subsequent generations. If you apply no selection pressure, you simply kill off a random portion of the population, and repeat. It's kind of a fun experiment in programming.    Embed Quote
