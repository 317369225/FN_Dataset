In what way Low frequency Noise characterization is important for semiconductor devices? Low frequency noise characterization in MOSFETs can give one a measure of the quality of the interface between the gate and the channel. Contamination and crystal faults introduced by processing can results in "traps" near the interface between the gate and channel. These traps hold onto charge carriers and release them after an indeterminate period of time. Therefore, you can "charge up" the traps and then if you attempt to take the charge out, the charge is not released right away and dribbles out over microseconds and milliseconds. Thus any square wave applied to the gate will have reasonably fast turn on and abysmal turn off. If fact, this problem is the reason that bipolar devices took off in the early days of semiconductor device development as opposed to FET devices. The normal method for measuring the trap noise is Deep-level transient spectroscopy. Traps and inversions are generally attributed as the cause for poorer flicker noise performance in MOSFET devices (and it would be fascinating to see the impact of FinFET geometry on flicker noise).§ There seems to be little work done in this area. Low frequency noise impacts the analog performance of a device. Both opamps and RF modulation operations are negatively impacted by close in noise such as flicker noise (1/f noise). §Modeling of flicker noise in n-channel FinFETs: Mobility fluctuations in the subthreshold region    Embed Quote
