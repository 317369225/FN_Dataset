★Can deaf people who could previously hear normally, hear low frequency sounds?For example, you can feel a kick drum/bass at a loud music gig so would a previously able person be able to create this sound in their mind?
It depends on the type of deafness as to what someone can or cant hear.  But no, a completely deaf person could remember the sound maybe but would not hear it any more then you remembering your breakfast is the same as seeing it. Sensation and memory of a sensation are two very different things.    Embed Quote
