★Low-frequency sounds such as the roar of a lion or a bear are meant to make us scared and alert, from an evolutionary point of view. Then why do I, and people alike, love music such as dubstep?
It probably has something to do with "controlled -fear" a mechanism that also make us love scary things like rollercoasters and horror movies. A simular mechanism called "controlled aggression" make us love sport competitions (like stickfighting in africa and basketball and soccer in the western world). I hope someone with more knowledge in this field could elloborate a bit on this answer.    Embed Quote
