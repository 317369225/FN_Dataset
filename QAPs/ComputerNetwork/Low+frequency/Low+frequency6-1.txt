★Does NFC include low frequency and high frequency RFID?Ignore the buzzword, is "NFC" on the same frequencies that "RFID" is using today? LF is 125kHz and HF is 13.56 Mhz.
Some times you could find in UHF frequencies Near Field Antenna and tags, but they are refering to use UHF in a short range communication , some confuse this with NFC    Embed Quote
