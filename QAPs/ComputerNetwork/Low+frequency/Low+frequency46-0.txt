★"[T]he majority of high-frequency managers delivered positive returns in 2008, whereas 70 percent of low-frequency practitioners lost money": is this temporary or has this become a permanent feature of markets?
Most high frequency traders are inherently long general market volatility, because other participants are highly likely to create imbalances in liquidity, and make mistakes/compromises in their pricing which algorithms can opportunistically scoop up. Human traders, for example, usually care less about the accuracy of a couple of basis points of pricing because they A. cannot assess a real-time relative value (down to the microsecond level)  and B. they just need to get the trade done, regardless of costs in market impact.    Embed Quote
