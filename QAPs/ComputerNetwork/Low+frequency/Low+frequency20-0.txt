★Why do low frequencies for mobile phones travel further in open space?According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSPL there is no physical mechanism that changes the attenuation according to the frequency. Is it because of fundamental physics of antenna design, or can it be overcome?
When I read the formula for Free Space Path Loss, I see loss is proportional to the square of the frequency.  I.e. twice the frequency, four times the loss. The problem is the receiving antenna's aperture shrinks by the square of the frequecy (or increases with the square of the wavelength).  For a given antenna, it is 1/4 as effective at collecting power when the frequency doubles.  This is fundamental to antenna theory.  It is the physics of how antenna's work. You could build a larger, higher gain antenna - but it won't be the same size and / or would not be isotropic.  In the case of mobile phones, this is a practical limitation.    Embed Quote
