★Should I EQ-boost low frequencies, to resemble a subwoofer?
Do what sounds best to you. A bass boost may run into clipping, so instead of boosting the low frequencies you may want to try reducing all the other frequencies. Depending on your software and your DAC this may sound better. To be safe, while it's not inherently dangerous like the other responses suggest, be careful with the volume control as equalization places greater demands for power from your amps. A true, dedicated sub that is designed well will probably sound better. Two or four even better. There's no replacement for displacement... Also, plugging ports is not necessarily a bad idea. Plugging bass ports changes the speakers from a vented alignment to a sealed alignment, which means you sacrifice output from the vents' tuning frequency that is 180 degrees phase delayed for lesser output that rolls off in the lower frequencies more gradually while approaching maximally 90 degrees out of phase. Sealed alignments allow more excursion from the drivers at low frequencies because they don't have the counter-phase back pressure of the vent to limit excursion, which increases harmonic distortion. So it's a tradeoff of phase distortion for harmonic distortion. I personally prefer to have less phase distortion and have plugged vents on my speakers as well. Finally, equalization usually is of the IIR type, which means you will be affecting Q and phase at the equalization frequency, which partially offsets the benefit from sealing vents. You can experiment with linear phase FIR type equalizers, but they're a lot of work to set up and may not necessarily sound better (while introducing processing delay, etc.) Have fun!    Embed Quote
