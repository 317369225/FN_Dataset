★Why does a capacitor function as an open circuit at low frequencies, while at high frequencies it acts as a short circuit?
Capacitor works on electrostatic induction. When a DC voltage is applied across it,  the electrons reaches one side of the plates. This causes the dielectric surface to generate positive charge. This again causes the other end of surface to get negative charge. This negative charge forces positive charge on the other plate now. A metal can't simply put up a charge without conducting. This metal gives losses out the electrons in to the circuit and conducts current. Now the static induction works only if there is change in voltage. Once the surface is fully charge the conduction stops. That's why for DC voltage the capacitor become open after some time. But when AC is applied the voltage keeps changing direction forcing the capacitor plates to charge discharge and gets charge in opposite direction again discharge. The surface of dielectric is never fully charged and thereby always conducting. As the surface charges build on dielectric the resistance starts going up. And this is reason why higher the rate of the change (high frequency) of voltage will charge the surface of the plates to minimum and thereby keeping resistance minimum. While low frequency signal will charge the surface to full causing high resistance. I think you got the idea right?    Embed Quote
