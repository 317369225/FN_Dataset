★Should I EQ-boost low frequencies, to resemble a subwoofer?
In general you should NOT boost the bass, because you may seriously overpower the drive units and fry them. Also, if the speakers are reasonably designed, you should not plug the ports because that will over damp the bass and you won't get the bass extension that the reflex alignment provides. Instead, assuming you can't do anything about the room, take the bass plugs out and use your equalizer to remove the bass peaks, don't use it to add bass at the suck-outs. You will get much more natural results and you won't fry your speakers.    Embed Quote
