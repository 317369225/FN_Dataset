★Why does an inductor function as a short circuit at low frequencies, and at high frequencies it acts as a open circuit?The answer is expected to be an explanation of the concept behind the working of the inductor. Basically, the explanation should suffice the frequency response of the inductor.
Inductor alone cannot really behave like a filter. It should  be combined with capacitor or resistor. Basis is current is stored as energy in inductor as magnetic field. Every time current changes magnetic field had to change so inductor will  not allow  fast changes in current. Fast current changes will not make  magnetic field to change fast. Hence the amplitude of  current exiting from inductor will be attenuated. The attenuation amount and frequency will be decided by capacitor or resistor used with inductor. When a current starts flowing in inductor. A magnetic field setup in wire (Biot Savart law). Because inductor had closely wound conductor next to each other the same magnetic field intersects with wound conductor. By Faraday law this magnetic again generates emf in coil opposing the  current flowing in coil. This is How current is slowed down. More value of inductor more turns in coil more magnetic interaction more opposing emf slower the current. In this induction the rate of change of current is important. Higher the rate better the induction.. So higher the frequency better the opposition. Inductor is open for higher frequency.    Embed Quote
