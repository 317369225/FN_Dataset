★Could low frequency electromagnetic transmissions cause a stress response, akin to the fear reaction from the inaudible frequencies  (infrasound) of a tiger's roar?For information on stress and the brain see  http://www.fi.edu/learn/brain/st...

It seems very unlikely.  Low frequency EM waves only efficiently couple and transfer energy to conductive structures that approximately match the size of the impinging wave and the impedance of free space.  Human body impedance is in the low kilo ohm range while free space is about 300 ohm so roughly an order of magnitude mismatch at an ideal frequency of 50 to 150 MHz (assumes a 30 - 200 cm body length).  Practical experiments report coupling at 30 MHz with a 24 dB loss.  3 dB is half power so 24 dB is 1/256 or about 0.4 %.  At lower frequencies this energy transfer would be much worse since human sized conductors would be increasingly transparent to lower frequency waves.  Keep in mind that the speed of sound, about 1e3 m/s, is what relates sound wave frequency and size which is why we can hear or at least feel 10Hz sound waves of sufficient amplitude.  EM waves move at light speed, 3e8 m/s, so the wavelengths are about 300,000 longer than sound waves of similar frequency.  I know of no physical mechanism that would allow low frequency EM radiation in the 10s to 1000nds of Hz to couple a measureable amount power into a human body unless the signal amplitude was astronomical and close by.  Any phenomenon that generated such a wave would likely obliterate nearby intelligence before the signal could be experienced.  Max    Embed Quote
