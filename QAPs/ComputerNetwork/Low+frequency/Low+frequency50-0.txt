★What is the effect, if any, of low frequency sound waves played at high levels on the brain?
it depends if the frequencies that reach each ear are slightly different, on average. if they are, and co-occur, a signal phenomenon called beats may cause the cortex to be active at a frequency lower than either sound frequencies present at the ears. The typical cortex brainwave has too low a frequency to be audible as a sound but "beats",  a frequency lower than the two that produce it could entrain the auditory cortex, either by resonance or synchronization. Various feelings might ensue depending on the beat frequency. Look up "binaural beats" and "beats" in wikipedia.    Embed Quote
