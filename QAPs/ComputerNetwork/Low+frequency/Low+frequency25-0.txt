★What equipment do I need to detect low frequency sound waves and electromagnetic radiation levels?I'm okay with having to crunch some numbers and inexpensive is in my price range.
What frequency range?     Your ears are superb instruments for sensing sound waves in the range of 20 to 20,000 cycles per second.  They are good down to the noise level.    As for electromagnetic waves, you can just hook up a short wire to the mic input of any any audio amplifier.   This antenna will pick up the ambient electromagnetic waves, which mostly consist of the 60 or 50 cycle AC hum that radiates from AC power wires.   It will pick up about one volt per meter of antenna length.   There is also a smaller amount of higher frequency signals, those are too high in frequency for you to hear, but if you put a diode in series with the antenna it will detect any modulation and you may hear a jumble of talk and music, basically all the AM radio signals.    Embed Quote
