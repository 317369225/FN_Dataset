★What equipment do I need to detect low frequency sound waves and electromagnetic radiation levels?I'm okay with having to crunch some numbers and inexpensive is in my price range.
You will have to define the frequency range over which your interests lie. By any normal definition any pressure wave oscillating at less that 50H does not get to the brain as 'sound' but rather as a series of discrete noises - if at all. Meteorologists typically measure pressure variations in the atmosphere at rates measured in hours. Because the energy in a sound or pressure wave at a given amplitude varies as the square of the frequency very low rates of change are not often destructive, although they might have a noticeable effect on the ears - especially if you have a blockage in your eustachian tubes as a result of a cold. Describe what frequency you are trying to measure and one could perhaps suggest the kit, from a simple aneroid barometer on up.    Embed Quote
