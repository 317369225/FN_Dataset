★Is it legal to put a low-frequency "emergency services" horn on a passenger car in the US?Not a siren, but the low frequency horn used on emergency vehicles.  This is essentially the second to last thing you hear if you mess with an armored vehicle in Afghanistan -- the buzz buzz, then the sound of a crew-served weapon fired at your engine compartment, then fired at the passenger compartment.  This would probably lead to safer driving in the US.
No, it is illegal.  Where I live in Georgia it's OK to have these annoying flashing lights, even on garbage trucks.  It's a nuisance and I wish they didn't do it, but audio is definitely a no-no.  Years ago they even had ordinances against ice cream trucks playing looney tunes too loud.    Embed Quote
