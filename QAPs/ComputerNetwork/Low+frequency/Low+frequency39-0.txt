★Which Iridium subscription should I get for long term, but low frequency emergency usage?The packages are very confusing - different companies sell them, some sellers only service customers in certain regions, the prepaid minutes seem to expire within 30 days (other sources claim they are extended for months and only top-up vouchers expire in a month). The minimum spend for Iridium seems to be ~60 USD even if you only want to use it as emergency backup.
For low-volume Iridium users we usually recommend our Emergency 200-min, 1-year Prepaid Plan, which retails at $449, the least expensive one-year plan out there. For just over $37 per month, the prepaid subscriber will have 200 minutes to use during the 1-year of service at no additional cost. In comparison, a monthly plan usually runs at least $45 per month, usually with no minutes included. Prepaid minutes do not roll over in the Emergency plan, so there is no burden to renew your service plan on time in order to save unused minutes. However, to continue service after the 1st year, the subscriber will be required to purchase a new prepaid airtime voucher at the current price. There will be no need to replace your SIM-card (chip). Prepaid plans (unlike monthly plans) require some customer organization in order to keep the satellite phone active and loaded with minutes. We usually email customers 2-3 weeks before their plan expiration date, however, we do recommend that customers set up their own reminders to renew their service.    Embed Quote
