★Why do low frequencies for mobile phones travel further in open space?According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSPL there is no physical mechanism that changes the attenuation according to the frequency. Is it because of fundamental physics of antenna design, or can it be overcome?
Two important points for you to consider: First, "free space" is a theorethical definition. Real space is filled with material that difracts, reflects, and attenuates electromagnetic signals. Some frequency ranges have lower attenuation then others. For instance, the 2.4 GHz range is heavily affected by water, including droplets, clouds and steam. Free space may be useful for link budget calculations but does not reflect the full reality. As the Earth is a sphere (roughly, I mean) lower frequency signals go farther because more of the signal is either difracted along the curvature (groundwave) or reflected by the upper atmospheric layers (skywave), making it actually go farther. Higher frequency radio signals are usually more coherent and directional in nature, and have comparatively shorter reach.    Embed Quote
