★How can one detect the source of low frequency pulsing sound when it can have many possible sources?I live on the top floor of a condo with an array of AC units directly over me on the roof. This sound has been tormenting me for many months. Attempts to identify the unit are stymied by occupants of other apartments being unavailable for testing. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
The most obvious answer is:  when you hear the noise, go on the roof and make note of which units are turned on (or off). Repeat whenever possible over days or weeks until you have a pattern of which units were off while you heard the sound, and hopefully which one was always on when you heard the noise. If you can pin it down to one (or at least a few) you can then leave notes asking the unit tenants to contact you at their convenience to make a simple test of having them turn their unit on and then off and see if you have the correct unit. When you find the "culprit," you can add isolating bushings or at least see if any mechanical adjustment to the mounting legs eliminates the mechanical path the noise is using to get to your ceiling.    Embed Quote
