★As a society, how can we better prepare for low frequency, high impact events?
That's a tough one. Because basically low frequency / high impact isn't what the brain is evolved to focus on. Instead, you have to be willing to trust externalized systems : eg. formal mathematics, scientific method, statistics etc. to tell you the things that your brain can't intuitively grasp by itself. You might even need to put your faith in institutions that are designed to collect, collate and process this kind of data in a way that you as an individual will never be able to. The best way society can do it is to build those institutions (universities, constitutions, courts etc.), try to ensure that they don't get compromised or corrupted, and be willing to trust them when they deliver counter-intuitive or unpalatable advice. But it's BLOODY difficult. Because we all have a resistance to being asked to believe things that go against our intuition. And are rightly suspicious when people want power over us in the name of something they tell us we won't understand.    Embed Quote
