★Can deaf people who could previously hear normally, hear low frequency sounds?For example, you can feel a kick drum/bass at a loud music gig so would a previously able person be able to create this sound in their mind?
My husband lived with a deaf guy.  He said that no matter how quietly he tried to sneak in, his roommate always knew when he got home.  He said he could feel the vibration.    Embed Quote
