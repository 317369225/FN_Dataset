★Is there any existing camera that we can use to detect low frequency electromagnetic waves?Something similar to an infrared camera but instead of infrared, it detects low frequency EM waves i.e. 50 to 60 Hz. I do know that one can detect low freq EM wave using a normal EM detector, but such device only measures the magnitude at a single point. Is there any camera to "see" the relative position of the EM source as well?
You're going to have a lot of problems implementing this "camera". (1) The wavelength is very large, so you need a large lens or antenna, at least a half-wavelength to get any signal and directivity at all.  And if you want to see details, you need the lens to be thousands of wavelengths across.  We are talking planet-sized. (2) There's an awful lot, like megawatts, of 50 and 60 Hz signal being sent out by all the power lines. (3)  There's an awful lot of noise in that frequency range from lightning strikes. (4) There's a nasty thing called 1/f noise too which limits your receiver sensitivity. All those issues conspire to make the project impractical.    Embed Quote
