★Low-frequency sounds such as the roar of a lion or a bear are meant to make us scared and alert, from an evolutionary point of view. Then why do I, and people alike, love music such as dubstep?
The question is interesting as it brings evolution in the discussion. Music in any country/region represents having been evolved over  millennia. For example the music (and dance) in African countries are totally different from, say, Indian. The reason being that (North) Africa is a region where the homo sapiens first appeared some hundreds of thousand years ago and their music’s origin lies in that period. Again South Indian music is bit different from its Northern region as the Southerners were the original inhabitants of India and Northerners arrived later from other North Asian region. Coming to the point of liking  or otherwise for any music,  while old timers still have liking for the music as was in vogue more than a hundred years ago, the trend in the younger generation is for pop music which have its origin in the recent past.    Embed Quote
