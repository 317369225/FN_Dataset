★Why is low frequency transmitted longer than higher frequency? Why are microwaves used and not radio waves in cellular phones?
There are a lot of tradeoffs in choosing a frequency. Higher frequecies are harder to generate and the transmitters tend to have lower efficiency, however there is less background noise at higher frequencies, and the bandwidths available are wider and can carry more information,  and the antennas can be smaller, but absorption is higher, however they travel better through small window openings and tunnels. So there are lots of tradeoffs.    The frequencies they use are usually what's available and what seems best for a particular application.    Embed Quote
