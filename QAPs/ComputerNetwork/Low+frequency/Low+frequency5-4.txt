★What is the relation between high or low frequencies and the sharpness of an image?
A low frequency means that something is changing only very gradually and slowly. This would be reflected in the presence of large number of smooth regions. A high frequency means a rapid change and hence visually it would represent something like an edge which is characterized by a sharp change in the intensity values. Now, the sharpness of an image is dependent on the presence of high frequencies in the image but only in a certain way. In general the amount of low frequencies would be very high as compared to the amount of high-frequencies. Infact, there is an exponential decay in the content of frequencies in an image. In general it is very tough to determine the sharpness of an image using only the frequency content , unless you have a prior knowledge about the content of the image. However, taking sharpness in terms of the visibility of features in an image, the sharpness can be considered to be proportional to the amount of high-frequencies present in the image.    Embed Quote
