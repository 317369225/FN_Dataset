★Is the amount of possible information contained within a bandwidth of, say 3,000 Hz larger for low-frequency signals than for high-frequency signals?A bandwidth is 3,000 Hz is HUGE for lower frequency ranges. But once you're in the MhZ range, it's just a small fraction of the entire range.
In theory it is the same.  The maximum amount of information is given by the Shannon Hartley theorem. [Math]C = B \log{1 + \frac{S}{N}}[/math] C is channel capacity B is bandwidth S is signal power (watts) N is noise power (watts) This doesn't depend on the actual frequency of the signal. So in theory it makes no difference. Kevin Williams answer about codes only helps you get closer to this limit, not surpass it.    Embed Quote
