★Why is low frequency transmitted longer than higher frequency? Why are microwaves used and not radio waves in cellular phones?
Lower frequency means a longer wavelength, which means the beam can diffract better. It also means a lower photon energy, which implies that, in general, the beam cannot excite atomic or molecular transitions as well, though it depends on the material -- e.g. those microwaves can pass through your room's wood walls reasonably well, but not a pail of water, as the water  molecules can be excited to rotate by waves of those frequencies. This is exploited in microwave ovens to heat food, which usually has a high water content. (The lower frequencies WILL still be stopped by metals, however, because the delocalized electrons in a metal are readily excited by the waves.) BUT, a longer wavelength also means a longer antenna is required to generate the wave. At, say, 240 MHz instead of 2.4 GHz, your antenna needs to be 10 times longer, which means at least a 1-foot antenna for quarter-wave, and 4 feet for full-wave! That's obviously not in any way wieldy.    Embed Quote
