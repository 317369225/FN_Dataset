★Why is low frequency transmitted longer than higher frequency? Why are microwaves used and not radio waves in cellular phones?
There are at least two reasons. Mainly, there just aren't that many low frequencies. As in, there's a MHz of bandwidth from 1 MHz to 2 MHz, but there's 1000 MHz between 1 GHz and 2 GHz. This matters because a single frequency doesn't convey information. To encode information you need to use a range of frequencies. To encode voice at telephone quality requires about 3-5 kHz of bandwidth. So you can only have of order 200 conversations going and you've used up all the bandwidth up to 1 MHz. You don't do that lightly because low frequencies have some unique properties that make them a valuable resource. In particular, up to about 30 MHz they'll bounce off the ionosphere and thereby travel long distances around the curve of the earth. That's the last thing you want for a cell phone, because even up in the GHz, there are so many competing applications for the spectrum that you want to make the most effective use of it. And one of the tricks that used is cells. You divide the landscape up into small cells, each with a low power transmitter that works on a few frequencies. The adjoining cells use different frequencies to avoid interference. But a few cells over you can reuse the frequencies from the first cell because it's far enough away. This also means that the cell phone can be small and low powered, because it's normally close to a cell tower (and if not, too bad).    Embed Quote
