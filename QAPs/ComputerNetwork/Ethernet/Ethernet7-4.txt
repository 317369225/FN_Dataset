â˜…Why does Cisco dominate the ethernet switching market?Why haven't smaller participants like Brocade been able to take share?
I'll answer this question in very simpler manner, Not only Ethernet switching products, if you consider any CISCO products like routers, access points, Firewalls,Unified Communication and collaboration are beating up any other vendors like Brocode and Juniper. The First, main difference is CISCO IOS which makes things easy to configure at any point of level. The second, It's support to customer available at their door-step. In my point of view, you should've strong customer relationship than simply offering services. It's not necessary inventing new things to customer for their better productivity. You can manage wisely with things what you've for clients. This is what exactly Cisco did in it's initial days. They've changed things in IOS and added some other features to IOS, then it puts them in top position. As of my knowledge I think Why Cisco has dominated in Industry. If any one would like to suggest me, yes please. If anywhere I'm wrong, please correct me.
