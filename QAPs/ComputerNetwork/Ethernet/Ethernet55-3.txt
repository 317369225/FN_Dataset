★Why does plugging two ends of an ethernet cable into a router cause it to crash?
For this to occur, you would need either a Router with two WAN ports, or you can connect your WAN port to your LAN port. Either way, any decent router  wouldn't necessarily crash. It would just cease to function (as in operate). If the router senses the same network on both the ports, it will not route and nothing will happen. Almost all the newer routers have their embedded OS as such, so that when such trickery is applied, the router does not go into an infinite loop or confused state, but will simply see this as a routing error and not compute (route) further. For older Routers, your Question could very well be valid and it might just cause the Router to crash, requiring rebooting.
