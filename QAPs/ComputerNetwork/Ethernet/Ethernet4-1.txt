â˜…What is an HDMI cable with Ethernet?Is it used with connection together with two devices connected double ethernet cable or "HDMI cable with ethernet"means something else?
So if I have it right you need a TV or sound system that receives internet capabilities so that you can then use the HDMI 1.4 cable w/ Ethernet to send data back and forth between your two products that use the internet. Painting the picture: You have a Internet TV and its hooked up to the router, and it has the capability for HEC (HDMI Ethernet Channel) so you use the cable going from the TV to another HEC capable device like a BlueRay player. This way you dont need the TV, the BR player, maybe a Desktop and whatever else you would want connected to the Internet all with Ethernet cables running back and forth. All and all the HEC cable is a little ahead of the curve of the devices that are out there today unless youre trying to spend a couple thousand dollars on a system you would want to use the HEC cable for. Unless you have/care to spend all the money for a TV, BR player, Apple TV, Receiver, and DVR or Tivo. I would recommend buy the HEC cable if you can find a cheap price you just might not be able to use all of the functions quite yet.
