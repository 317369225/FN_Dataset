★What is Ethernet?Update: It would be more appreciable if the answer explains this networking terminology in a simple and easy to understand manner, maybe by giving an analogous example to Ethernet in real time applications.
Ethernet is a local area network standard. It is only a de facto standard. It is the encapsulation method used at the "data link" layer (layer 2) of the OSI model. It uses the MAC addressing scheme. It is specified  by IEEE 802.3. Ethernet is only a wired standard. Carlos Ribeiro's answer is a much more in depth description so please refer to his answer for more info than my own answer.
