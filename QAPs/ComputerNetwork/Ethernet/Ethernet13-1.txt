â˜…What are the advantages of wireless Ethernet?
In 1997, at Genuity, our "standard issue" for network and systems engineers (and management) were DEC HiNote Ultra laptops and Proxim 1.2Mbps RangeLAN cards. With adequate coverage in the meeting rooms, workrooms, break room, engineering bullpen and board room, it meant that you could go ANYWHERE, with your laptop, and access anything you needed to access on the network, without worrying about wires. I took that with me to Enron Broadband, and we not only wired up every square inch of our office space (and progressed to RangeLAN2, then Cisco Aironet for higher speeds), we also pointed high-gain antennas at several nearby open-air coffee shops and restaurants, and even pulled cable to a few locations to deploy access points. Between that, and a very innovative AT&T "Mobile Office" plan that turned our cell phones into PBX extensions, no matter where you were, you were "in the office". On nice days, it was common to find half of network engineering sitting outside at O'Connors (then downtown) or at the Border's coffee shop working on some issue while enjoying the sunshine and a snack. Productivity soared. There's no substitute for that. Give people the latitude to change their work environment for the better, and they perform better. Keeping them inside on a sunny day that they can clearly see through the windows just breeds "oh man, when's quitting time again??"
