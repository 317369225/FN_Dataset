★Is it possible to connect a print server to an ethernet wireless modem?(USB to printer, Ethernet to an Ethernet D-Link modem) So the modem is acting like a switch and a modem at the same time, And from the D-link modem Ethernet cables to other PCs, so the PCs and laptops(connected wirelessly) is connecting to the internet and printing to the printer at the same time?
I assume you are talking about a home broadband modem that connects to a broadband ISP like TimeWarner, Comcast or Verizon and offers wireless and switch ports. The answer is yes, but you will have to locate a broadband router that has a USB port and will support printers. It looks like dlink has a technology called Shareport http://www.dlink.com/shareport/ that lets you connect your USB printer to the router and you install a small agent on your PC. The PC talks to the router and discovers the printer. Seems like an inelegant hack to me and I don't know if it works. Also seems to be Windows only (but I could be wrong). There are also wireless AP's that can act as a print server and doens't require a agent like D-Links Shareport does, although you do need to install network printer drivers. The Asus RT-N13U is one such device http://event.asus.com/2009/netwo....  Beware that just because a broadband router has a USB port doesn't mean that it supports printers. In many cases, the USB port is for storage devices only. If the box does not say it supports printers, then it probably doesn't. If the device does support printers, then make sure your printer is supported since it may not be. If push some to shove, you can always install your printer on one of your computers, and share it to the rest of the network.
