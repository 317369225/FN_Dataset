â˜…What is the best low-cost Ethernet router for the home?I'm looking to share a DSL connection throughout a house using wires, hopefully in such a way that the DSL provider can't see how many machines I have. Do I want a router? A NAT box? A switch? And if I just daisy-chain two or more of these items together, will they do the right thing? This is a follow-up question to What is the best wireless access point or router for the home?.
*Yes you can do that. The DSL provider shouldn't be able to tell how many hosts are on your LAN if you're using NAT. *Linksys is a good brand. *So you want a router, yes. If you need another device to extend coverage to another area of the house or something use a switch, not a router. You never want more than one router on the same network. *Buy the 10/100/1000 Gigabit equipment if the extra cost isn't troublesome; it might come in handy for you someday.
