The line Speed gives you the actual therical speed. The real speed depends on a lot of parameters - the driver - the physical layer quality (being wifi signal or twisted pair) - the speed of the remote server To test that part, I advice you to you iperf tool. This tool tests the current bandwidth between two nodes.
