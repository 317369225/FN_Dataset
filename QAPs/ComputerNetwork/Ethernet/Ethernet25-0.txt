★What are the pros and cons of Fibre Channel vs. Ethernet Storage?Key considerations when selecting one vs. the other?  Is Fibre Channel ultimately doomed?
We should clarify Fibre Channel (FC) as a protocol and as a transport.  FC as a protocol runs over FC transport as well as Ethernet in the form of FCoE. Having said that, FC as a protocol has a very long time to live.  While the FC protocol does have a lot of quirks, those quirks are well known and understood.  Further, the FC community is fairly small, so there is a lot of interoperability testing that happens. FC as a transport has probably hit its peak but due to its proven track record, large installation base, and performance, it too, will continue to enjoy a fairly long life span. Pro's for FC: Semi-closed ecosystem:  few players, all performing interoperability tests with each other Performance:  16G today.  iSCSI has the added overhead of TCP/IP.  40G Ethernet not so common (yet) Management:  SAN administrators know their tools well and have a lot of scripts built around existing infrastructure Proven track record:  Pro's for Ethernet (FCoE, iSCSI, RoCE, NAS) Ethernet switches much more pervasive, generally less expensive than FC switches Analyzers and other tools readily available - some are free Longer roadmap.  40G available today, 100G on the near horizon. Converged fabrics makes economical sense (power, cooling, cabling, acquisition cost) particularly for first hop and blade environments
