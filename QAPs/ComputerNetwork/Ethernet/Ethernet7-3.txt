★Why does Cisco dominate the ethernet switching market?Why haven't smaller participants like Brocade been able to take share?
you also have to remember breadth of product scope.  the ability to provide solutions across the board rather than just for a particular need.  to an enterprise, dealing with fewer companies is a big plus.  as long as cisco can maintain a first class support operation as they have in the past, they have no worries.  if they get arrogant or lazy and start cutting back in that area, they will become vulnerable.....
