★Do Fast Ethernet and 10 Mbps Ethernet use the same MAC protocols?
Fast Ethernet uses a variant of 802.3 called 802.3u. Its basically just a faster version of 802.3 and is backward compatible. There was an attempt by a section of the standards committee to frame a new protocol called 802.12 which failed. The frame format is the same. Its bit time though is reduced by a factor of 10. Another difference is that fast ethernet uses switched ethernet network architecture. Classic ethernet  used what are called multidrop cables, which meant you had this thick wire snaking around with nodes plugged into it by T junctions or vampire taps.
