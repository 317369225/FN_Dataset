★Why hasn't Ethernet gotten any faster in the last 15 years?I meant this question in relation to common consumer hardware. In 2000, higher-end PCs started having gigabit Ethernet ports, and today, PCs still have the same gigabit Ethernet. I know 100Gb fiber exists, but it's not for consumers, whereas WiFi, USB, etc are all common on normal computers.
In reality, how does this really impact us?  I run gigabit Ethernet throughout the house and never see a problem with speed.  If I want to move a big file it can be done in a very short time, I backup my server to my NAS and the speed is fine. My internet service is 50Mb, and when I had 1000Mb, the performance was almost identical, mainly because it is all the upstream bottlenecks that create the slowdowns.  My wireless Internet is faster than my ISP provides, so paying more for faster performance would be a waste. You could outfit your house with 100Gb Ethernet, but the cost would be prohibitive. What exactly is driving the need for faster Ethernet?  And, while we are at it, the cost of Gigabit Ethernet was pretty high back in 2000, few people would pay the price premium for it.
