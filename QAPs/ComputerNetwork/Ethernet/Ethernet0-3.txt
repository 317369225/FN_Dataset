â˜…What is Ethernet?Update: It would be more appreciable if the answer explains this networking terminology in a simple and easy to understand manner, maybe by giving an analogous example to Ethernet in real time applications.
Ethernet is the dominant LAN network technology, defined by the 802.3 IEEE (Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers) standard. It's located at the bottom of the so called OSI model (Layer 1 or Physical Layer), where you have the NIC (Network Interface Card, a.k.a Network card or Ethernet card) which physically connects your computer to the network. Today's LANs are mainly based on twisted pairs (divided in several categories, the most common is cat. 5e , covering a 100m max distance) and fiber cables, which can cover greater distances but are harder to troubleshoot. More info here: Ethernet Technology evolved later on and, along with wired networks you can have wireless networks, which are defined by the 802.11 standard (802.11n is its current version). This is Ethernet as a physical structure, then you have the Ethernet frames, located on Layer 2 (Data Link Layer), which gather together the data (bits) transmitted by the network cables into more complex structures called frames adding them a series of information (Ethernet header), but this is something different in my opinion. If you ask me "What's Ethernet?" in general terms, it's the first part of my answer.
