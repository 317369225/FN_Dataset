★When does it make sense to use WLAN instead of Ethernet?
Bad idea because WiFi, regardless of what you're using (2.4GHz, 5.8GHz, 802.11a/b/n/g/ac, etc.) is totally susceptible to outside interference such as fluorescent lighting ballast, microwave ovens, cordless phones, etc., while ethernet is not.  Even if your office is located smack dab in the middle of an isolated plot of land with the nearest neighbor miles away because the building's construction will also have to be taken into account along with the individual PCs and laptops.  Ethernet bypasses most of those problems.
