â˜…Why is there no micro Ethernet connector standard?We have micro USB (super-endorsed by EU), micro HDMI, and the Apple connectors getting smaller too... what's up with networking?
There are a few possible reasons that the Ethernet connector standard is not getting smaller. The 8P8C connector ("RJ45") is an international standard for inside wiring and structured cabling, as well as a standard interface for Carrier Ethernet switches at a building's minimum point of entry. There are Micro USB pin-out adapters for 8P8C, but the standard is driven more by considerations of infrastructure than of form factor. Also, 8P8C may allow for greater reduction in cross-talk than a standard with less shielding would. Even though shielding and cross-talk differ between ISO/IEC 11801 cabling classes, the 8P8C connector standard allows for backward compatibility (for instance, between Cat-7 and Cat-5e), with identical connectors on either end of a cable. A migration from 8P8C may be necessary as line signals with higher data rates begin to appear in residential wiring to support higher bandwidth than existing coaxial or twisted-pair wiring would permit. There are other twisted-pair standards like Siemon's TERA, but pluggable optical transceivers for fiber are more commonly used for 40- and 100-Gbps signaling. However, a transceiver is a media controller rather than the medium itself, and XFP or CPAK transceivers are both expensive and larger than most 8P8C-based network controllers, so considerations of cost and power diffusion make the combination no better than 8P8C from a form-factor perspective. (Even with an 8P8C connector, the Rapberry Pi's PHYceiver can overheat the board during sustained file transfers.)
