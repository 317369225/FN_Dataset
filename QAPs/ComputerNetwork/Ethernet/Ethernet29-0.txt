â˜…How does WiFi latency compare to Wired Ethernet?
Wired ethernet is about an order of magnitude lower ping time for machines on the same network (i.e. single hop). For example, on my home network, I see approximately 0.3ms wired ethernet ping vs 3ms wireless ethernet ping. This is because of the more extensive error checking and protocol requirements of wifi. More importantly, however, wired ethernet has much lower "jitter" or variation in the ping time. Because of interference from microwaves, other devices using a shared spectrum, usage of nearby channels, etc, there is a much greater variation in the ping time over wifi. Of course, if you are using local wifi to connect to a router connected to the Internet, it is important to remember that the wifi is the last link, and it may not make much of a difference if your ping time to the server you are interested in is much greater.
