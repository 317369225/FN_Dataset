â˜…Is a partly frayed ethernet cable a fire hazard?Picture here: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4027565/...
Probably not. The voltage used by Ethernet is usually insufficient to cause a fire. While anything can potentially cause a fire, a worn Ethernet cable should be a low-level concern. Frankly, given the falling costs of Ethernet cable in the face of growing wireless technologies, it may be simply easier to replace it if you have any doubts.
