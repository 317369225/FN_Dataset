â˜…Does the length of an ethernet cable affect speed?If so, at what length does it start slowing the connection down and is it noticeable?
Ethernet PHYs (the physical interface) are spec'd to support 100 Mb/s Fast Ethernet (100base-TX) over Category-5 twisted pair cable to a length of 100 meters. 100base-FX over full duplex multimode Optical Fiber supports 2000 meters (2km). Category-6 twisted pair cable supports the same distance for Gigabit Ethernet (1000base-T) Category-6A twisted pair cable supports the same distance for 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10Gbase-T) Beyond those distances it doesn't slow down per se, but you are likely to get errors which can cause data loss. Many higher level transport protocols that have error checking (e.g. TCP/IP) will re-transmit when that happens, and the net effect of that is reducing the effective throughput (bandwidth). As you might guess, the spec and what you experience in real life are often different - cheap cable + cheap phys results in shorter distances, quality cable with straighter runs and less interference from a cable bundle + quality phys and you get longer distance.
