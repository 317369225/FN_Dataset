★How does an ethernet switch work and how is it different from an ethernet repeater?
Switches are "smart" devices, while repeaters/hubs are "dumb". Switches operate on the second layer of the OSI model, the Data Link layer. A switch is aware of the MAC addresses of all the devices connected and forwards packets, based upon the destination MAC address, only to the port with the destination device. Hubs work on the first layer of the OSI model, the Physical layer. They have no processing, switching, or routing capabilities and simply re-broadcast any and all packets received, regardless of destination or source devices. All hubs work at half-duplex (can not send receive simultaneously), while switches can be full-duplex (can send and receive simultaneously).   Hubs are largely phased out in today's world, and are being replaced by layer two and now layer three switches.
