â˜…When does it make sense to use WLAN instead of Ethernet?
I don't have any experience with that many machines, but my expectation is that it's quite possible, but you should research the environment some. If there's interference from neighbors, sodium lamps, NSA bugs, etc., your wireless will be flaky and probably more annoying than it's worth. What sort of data will you be moving over the network? If you're doing video editing, wireless just isn't going to keep up. If you're sharing critical always-on stuff (like home directories), it's also probably a bad idea, because dropouts will be very noticeable. If your primary uses are code commits, email, web, etc., then it's likely fine. If you do decide to go wireless, you'll want high-end APs; most consumer routers tend to flake out every few days under heavy load (in my experience, anyway). Consider Cisco Aironet routers. I would also strongly recommend 802.11n, both for interference avoidance (5GHz band) and throughput.
