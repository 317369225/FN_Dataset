â˜…How many ethernet ports can I build into a single computer?Given the fact there are Quad ports PCI/PCI express cards out there, I wonder how many of them (x4) can I plug into a single server? Perhaps the bottleneck should be the PCI bus which I am not familiar with how to calculate that.
32-bit, 33 MHz PCI bus tops out at 133 megabytes per second. The follow on versions: 32-bit, 66 MHz: 266 MB/s. 64-bit, 33 MHz: 266 MB/s. 64-bit, 66 MHz: 532 MB/s. PCI-X: 1064 MB/s. PCI Express (PCIe) is a bit more complicated depending on the number of "lanes" both the slot and the card support.How many Ethernet cards you can plug into a single computer depends on how many slots of what type are available, and how many physical interfaces per card there are (e.g. 1, 2, 4). Whether the system you plug all these ports into can support the cards depends on how fast each of the ports are (e.g. original 10 Mbit/sec Ethernet, Fast Ethernet (100Mbit/sec), Gigabit Ethernet, 10 Gigabit Ethernet), and the expected actual traffic levels you want to send/receive (in aggregate) through all the ports. Nota Bene: all bandwidths for Ethernet are specified in bits per second, but PCI bus bandwidths are specified in bytes per second (factor of 8 difference). The conservative engineer builds a system such that each component can be fully supported by its interconnects (i.e. he won't put more interfaces into a system than the buses will support at full rate), but the conservative engineer sometimes builds things that cost too much money. If you know that you won't have to support full network rate traffic through these interfaces (and thus over the buses they connect to), you can oversubscribe the buses with more Ethernet interfaces than the top bandwidths would otherwise suggest.
