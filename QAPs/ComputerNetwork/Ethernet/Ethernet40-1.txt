â˜…How does one plug in a Ethernet cable into a tablet that has no Ethernet port?
I would recommend something like this: Amazon.com: BobjGear USB to RJ45 Compact Fast Ethernet Adapter made for Android Tablets; also works with Ultrabooks, Windows, Linux, Mac, ChromeOS, Android TV Sticks such as MK802, UG802, UG007. BobjGear One Year Adapter Limited Warranty Included.: Computers & Accessories This little nice clean adapter works with most Laptops, Ultrabooks, and Android tablets. If your Android tablet doesn't have a full size usb port, you can get a USB-OTG cable for around 99 cents which essentially is a dongle which changes your mini-usb port into a full size usb port.
