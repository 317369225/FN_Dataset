★Why did Ethernet beat out token ring networks?
Ethernet cables were originally rather complicated.  10Base5 (Thicknet) and 10Base2(thinnet) required "bus" wiring topologies that were complex to manage once you get beyond a few nodes.  You couldn't add or remove a node without interrupting service to the whole network and there were many cable joints and terminators that made these networks both prone to disruption and difficult to troubleshoot.  10BaseT was the key innovation that made ethernet both cheaper and more manageable than Token Ring or other available network technologies.  10BaseT introduced: The "star" topology centered around hubs (and later switches) Low cost wiring (same layout and similar style to telephones) Greater maintainability as devices could be added or remove with minimal disruption and cabling problems were largely isolated to a single node to hub link An upgrade path to faster protocols (100BaseTX, etc.) Later on, greater scalability through switching with reduces broadcast traffic These efficiencies were more than sufficient to make up for some of the shortcomings of ethernet.  Token ring networks are more "orderly" because of the token passing scheme that is common with other ring networks like FDDI.  Ethernet uses a "contention" system called carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD), which is less efficient if there are many devices trying to access the network at once.
