★What is Ethernet?Update: It would be more appreciable if the answer explains this networking terminology in a simple and easy to understand manner, maybe by giving an analogous example to Ethernet in real time applications.
I'll take it back a few levels... Ethernet started out as radio networking over a wire. The origins was in something called ALOHAnet which was developed at the University of Hawaii. They had a problem trying to connect the islands, and used radio. And discovered things about packet data transmission - such as what happens if you have two "talkers" at the same time, and how to manage congestion, and other things. It was one of the first, if not the first, network in which all participants shared a connection to a common medium (as opposed to individual links between the participants in a ring, star, hub, or mesh configuration). Bob Metcalfe had studied the experiment as part of his PhD work, and while at Xerox PARC in the early 70s, decided that the radio part was getting  in the way of speed, so put all that analog magic on a wire, creating the first version of Ethernet. Originally, it was a thick RG-8 coax, with "vampire transceivers" which pierced the shield and connected the electronics to the core wire without causing a break in the cable. You connected your computer to it using  an 8-pin AUI cable (upper right corner). Speed limit was 10Mbps. Distance was 1.5km - if you could afford that much cable. In the late 70s, "plain" cable was about $2/foot, and the Teflon coated stuff that was required for in-ceiling cabling to meet fire code was over $8/foot. That eventually evolved in to RG-58 "Thinnet", and RJ-45 twisted pair networking that you're likely familiar with today, plus fiber based solutions. To paraphrase from Demolition Man, "In the future, all networks are Ethernet"
