★How many ethernet ports can I build into a single computer?Given the fact there are Quad ports PCI/PCI express cards out there, I wonder how many of them (x4) can I plug into a single server? Perhaps the bottleneck should be the PCI bus which I am not familiar with how to calculate that.
Forget PCI. You want PCI-E for this application. PCI-E 2.0 runs at a higher clock rate, but I haven't seen any PCI-E 2.0 NICs. Intel is known for making pretty solid Quad NICs. It looks like the high end server mother boards max out at 7 PCI-E slots. Take a look at the SuperMicro Motherboard matrix and sort by slot counts. http://www.supermicro.com/produc... Here's a nice board for your application. http://www.supermicro.com/produc... 7 PCI-E (x8) slots. (Although the Intel Quad NICs are generally PCI-E x4) The board has a built in video controller, so this would give you a 28 GIGE NICs. You're just asking how many you can plug in, not necessarily how well it would perform. Another thing to take in to account: Interrupt handling -- You probably want at least 8 CPU cores for interrupt handling under high load. It sounds like an interesting project.  Talk to the folks at Vyatta. (www.vyatta.com) If they haven't tested this end of the spectrum, they should. Cheers.
