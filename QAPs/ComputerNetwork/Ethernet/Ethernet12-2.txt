★Does the length of an ethernet cable affect speed?If so, at what length does it start slowing the connection down and is it noticeable?
There's no significant drop in performance as long as you're running the cable within the specs that Robert Adams lists in his answer. Note that those distances are only for single cable runs - you can join spans with repeaters, intermediate switches, etc. and run an ethernet connection any theoretical distance, even across oceans.  These kind of distances will result in lower throughput on TCP connections, not necessarily due to errors, but due to signal latency interacting with TCP's packet acknowledgement mechanism (the higher the latency, the longer it takes to receive an ACK back from the remote end before you can send the next chunk of data). In general, the delays don't result in noticeable drops in throughput until you're running a connection over a mile or more.
