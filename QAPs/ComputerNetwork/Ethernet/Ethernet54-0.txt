★What are the benefits and disadvantages of Ethernet over SONET/SDH?
Well, SONET/SDH is now a legacy technology that is in maintenance mode.  That means no new development, and ever-increasing prices for spares.  In other words, it's dead, Jim. From a technical perspective, SONET/SDH is a TDM technology.  That means that if there is no data to send, the bandwidth is wasted.  Ethernet, on the other hand, is very happy to provide stat muxing.  This generally leads to higher utilizations.  Since it is Ethernet, it's easily interoperable with other Ethernet technologies, so it's more flexible.  And at lower speeds (<100Gbps), it's a commodity, so the price can't be beat.  SONET/SDH never made it there.
