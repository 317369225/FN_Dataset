â˜…Is Ethernet faster than wireless?this gig I have wants me to connect via ethernet to my router. I do it, but it's kinda a pain. Is connecting via ethernet significantly faster?
Generally speaking, fixed wire Ethernet is faster - unless you are using an older 10 Mbps Ethernet connection while the wireless is 54 Mbps or higher etc. If you have a recent router, chances are your Ethernet port is 100 Mbps or higher so it would be faster. None of this would matter, however, if your Internet connection is any speed less than 10 Mbps because then the throughput of your connection will be limited by your upstream/wide area network connection and not the local area network. Update: You do not say this, but it could also be that your employer is concerned with sniffing of your wireless connection, which can be done by anyone in proximity of your network and enough tools to break the WiFi encryption keys.
