★Why hasn't Ethernet gotten any faster in the last 15 years?I meant this question in relation to common consumer hardware. In 2000, higher-end PCs started having gigabit Ethernet ports, and today, PCs still have the same gigabit Ethernet. I know 100Gb fiber exists, but it's not for consumers, whereas WiFi, USB, etc are all common on normal computers.
In 2000, the fastest Ethernet speed was 100 Mbps.  Today, it's 100 Gbps.  That's an thousandfold increase. In 2000, the fastest WiFi speed was 11 Mbps.  Today, it's theoretically 450 Mbps.  An increase of about 40-fold. In 2000, USB 1.0 offered 12 Mbps top speed (USB 2.0 didn't come out until 2001).  Today, USB 3.0 offers 3 Gbps, an increase of 250-fold. SATA did not exist in 2000; it was introduced in 2002.  In 2002, SATA offered 1.5 Gbps.  Today, it offers 6.0 Gbps, a mere quadrupling of speed. HDMI did not exist in 2000; it was also introduced in 2002.  In 2002, HDMI offered 4.95 Gbps.  The most recent standard offers 14.4 Gbps, slightly less than triple the speed in 2002. So, of the technologies you list, over the last 15 years Ethernet has increased in speed the most.  It's also the fastest of all of them, at 100 Gbps top speed. Update: First, two corrections.  Chris Woodfield correctly points out that GigE rolled out in 1999; therefore, in 2000 Ethernet's top speed was 1 Gbps, not 100 Mbps as I stated above.  This cuts Ethernet's performance enhancement to only 100-fold and makes it fall second to USB in overall improvement over the last 15 years.  And Blake Dalms has caught me out of date on the latest advances in WiFi technology, pointing out that some of the newest dual-band 802.11ac systems are yielding 1.3 Gbps and can theoretically hit 7 Gbps (although I'm seriously dubious of that latter number).  Thanks to them both for keeping me honest here. More significantly, the OQ has added details to the question that I should address.  It's true that the upper-end Ethernet speeds are not generally available to consumers; in fact, I've never even used 10GbE in my own professional experience, since my area of speciality is in SMB IT for nontechnical industries (mainly financial and manufacturing), and fairly few small and medium businesses have a business need for 10GbE.  This is largely because 1 Gbps (indeed 100 Mbps) is entirely adequate for most home, and indeed even business, users. In 2000, most computers sold to the consumer marketplace had no Ethernet adapter at all.  At this point, most consumers were using dialup, and it was indeed not uncommon for computers to be sold with an integral modem.  Ethernet NICs were an added value feature.  When I got residential cable modem service in 1999, my cable provider offered to sell me a NIC as part of the setup package (which I didn't need because I had a 3com 3c509 already).  Computers sold for business use, of course, would generally have an Ethernet adapter, in most cases a 10 Mbps Classic Ethernet, but if you were lucky a 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet interface.  The thing is, in 2000, cable modem service was around 1 Mbps if you were lucky, and for that 10 Mbps Classic Ethernet is more than adequate.  When you're connecting to a straw, it doesn't matter that much whether you use a garden hose or a firehose.  In any case, the 66.7 Mbps limitation of the ISA bus meant that even if you put a 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet card in your computer, it wouldn't be able to keep up with it.  New computers in 2000 would likely have PCI 1.0, maybe even PCI 2.0, either of which was capable of keeping up with a 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet connection, but not a 1 Gbps GbE connection; for that, you really need either PCIE or PCI-X, technologies that did not exist in 2000, or the rarely-seen 64-bit PCI bus clocked at 66 MHz. Now, fast forward to 2015.  Most computers sold to the consumer market have PCIE buses that are certainly capable of keeping up with 100 Mbps, indeed most probably even with 1 Gbps (but see Is there any limit on UDP packets per second? for an example of a modern computer that cannot keep up with Gigabet Ethernet).  Consumer hardware still has no hope of keeping up with 10GbE Ethernet, and indeed 10GbE interfaces are usually only seen on upper-end server hardware and networking equipment.  The esoteric world of the 40 GbE and 100 GbE interface is the dimly lit world of the core network services provider, where ordinary mortals fear to tread.  Nor would including 10GbE Ethernet in consumer hardware make sense, as consumers rarely have anything in their environments to talk to at those speeds anyway.  The fastest consumer-grade ISP service connections are still in the 25 to 40 Mbps range, and for that purpose a 100 Mbps Ethernet connection is absolutely satisfactory.  We've upgraded the straw to a garden hose; the firehose of 1 GbE is still overkill, to say nothing of the Niagara of 100 Gbps Ethernet. On top of that, in most consumer environments, the only wired Ethernet connection is from the cable modem/DSL modem to the consumer gateway device, and then (maybe) from there to one or maybe two desktop computers.  Increasingly, consumers are using wireless for most or all of their home networking, and wired Ethernet is not something that plays much of a role in that environment.  Simply put, for the needs of the consumer, 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet is enough.  Even 1 Gbps Gigabit Ethernet is overkill in most cases. Comparing Ethernet, which is a networking standard, to USB, SATA or HDMI, is really an apples-to-oranges comparison.  SATA is a mass-storage interconnect, and it's not even the high-end one (that would be either SAS or FibreChannel).  It's not used for the same purposes as Ethernet and is not readily usable for those purposes.  USB was originally intended for use for low-speed peripheral devices like keyboards and mice, but has been increasingly used (in lieu of FireWire, which was intended to complement USB for mass storage) for higher-speed mass storage devices.  It, too, is not intended for use as a network communication protocol.  And HDMI is a video interconnect, designed for a very specific purpose that requires extremely high bandwidth, and which makes several interesting tradeoffs along the way. So, in summary, I'd say that the reason consumers are still getting 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps Ethernet devices is because that's what makes economic sense to offer to them given their needs and willingness to pay.
