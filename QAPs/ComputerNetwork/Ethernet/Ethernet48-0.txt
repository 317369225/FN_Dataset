★When did Ethernet become a standard option for personal computers (Dell, for example)?In other words, when did one no longer have to add on an Ethernet card?
Wikipedia states "mid-1990s", but I interpret this statement as:  Ethernet was ubiquitous for all PCs that were networked (organizations, businesses, etc). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eth... Although other network technologies exist (e.g. token ring), Ethernet has achieved near-ubiquity since the mid-1990s. From 1995 through 2000, most home PCs were still using dial-up modems and Ethernet cards were not shipped as a standard on PCs until later. I'd answer this question definitively if I had access to PC Magazine archives.  My best guess is 2000.
