â˜…Is it possible for me to connect to the internet via an ethernet cable connected to a WiFi enabled computer?
I think you can do that. All you need is set up your Ubuntu machine as a gateway and make the default router point to the wlan device. Then you can connect your desktop to your laptop with the ethernet cable.
