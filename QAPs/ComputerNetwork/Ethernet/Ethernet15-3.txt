â˜…Why did Ethernet beat out token ring networks?
I'm going to add to Gus Fuldner's answer. There were two token passing networks in serious contention with Ethernet. IBM's Token Ring IEEE 802.5 16 Mbits Arc net 2.5 MbitsArc net was easy to install and was cheaper than either Ethernet or Token Ring. Even though it ran at 2.5 Mbits it was often faster than Ethernet, since Ethernet was unregulated and could not transmit if another computer was using the LAN. Novell NetWare and Arc net were frequently found paired together. But, once tcp/ip became the standard protocol, there were real issues with Arc net. Token Ring, at 16 Mbits beat everyone and worked well with NetWare, but was perceived as a part of IBM's mid range computer systems. Also, I can attest that the cables were designed to drive installers over the edge. Token Ring was not cheap. And 100 Mbit Token Ring was really expensive. However, on large networks both of these networks were significantly better than Ethernet. Often, we would have a server with 3 EISA network cards attached with 10base2 cables to several12 port hubs, so we would have no more than 24 to 36 users per server card. And never add an Ethernet printer. Once switches replaced hubs and became full duplex instead of half duplex, and traffic was no longer controlled by contention for the line, price won the battle.
