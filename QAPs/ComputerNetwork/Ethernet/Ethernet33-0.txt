★Where can I buy ethernet cables in Manhattan?I'm moving my co-workers to a new office in Manhattan and I need a large quantity of cheap ethernet patch cables. B&H doesn't seem to have the quantities I require.
If you like to actually look at products in person I would make this suggestion.  You could try searching http://maps.google.com with your zip code.  Search "computer stores near putzipcodehere"  I've moved a couple of times recently and have found many types of stores I needed with this method.
