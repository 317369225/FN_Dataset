★What is the relationship between "packets" and "frames" in Ethernet terms?Friend of mine asked me what the difference was.  I thought frames were part of web sites in the old days and packets were pieces of info transmitted over the web
In the context of Ethernet, packet and frame are two different words (names) for the same thing, save that frame is more commonly used to describe a complete Ethernet packet (including preamble, payload, and CRC), whereas packet might, again depending upon context, refer to a specific instance of any of the protocols that are carried by Ethernet (e.g. "ARP packet", "IP packet", "XNS packet"). The use of frame for this context also hearkens back to telecommunications technologies and protocols that predate Ethernet (e.g. Bisync, T1, LAPB), and technologies that grew out of those, e.g. frame relay; the CCITT (excuse me, ITU-TSS) & ILEC people (and the standards documents they write) tend to use this word in preference to packet. This is to some extent a technology culture issue. Frame in the context of the web refers to a set of HTML tags used to lay out a web page as a series of ... frames (coincident windows of text or other elements within a page). This is a file or document level construct, separate (and much farther up the protocol stack) from Ethernet packets or frames; it's a case of using the same word to mean very different things, depending upon context. See http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/... Etymologically speaking, all the uses of frame described herein doubtless refer to the bounding nature of the constructs being described (Ethernet packets or frames have specific boundaries; web pages that use HTML frames are also bounding a series other elements of the web page), just as a window frame bounds a window.
