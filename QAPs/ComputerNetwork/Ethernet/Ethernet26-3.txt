★Can a fiber Internet cable terminate in Ethernet?
I can answer this but only if I make some assumptions about your question so maybe you could clarify if my answer isn't what you're looking for. Think of fiber as the physical medium - if you're familiar with the OSI model, it's part of layer 1.  The next layer, layer 2, is where you apply meaning to the bits that traverse the medium.  You group them in a specific order based on the equipment at each end.  I can put Ethernet (a layer 2 technology) on a fiber just as easily as I could put ATM or Frame Relay or SONET on a fiber, in fact, more and more connections are being made using Ethernet now as opposed to any of the other more legacy protocols even within the carrier networks. Now when you say "Internet cable" is where it gets a little more unclear. IP (Internet Protocol) is a Layer 3 technology. How you interact with Layer 3 would be dependent upon the capability of the equipment you connect the (presumably Ethernet over fiber) to. The questions would be - do you know your IP addressing? will you be getting routes dynamically? questions of that nature. In short, yes, a fiber cable can be an Ethernet signal and IP can run on Ethernet. Whether you can make use of it or not depends on what you plug it into and how capable you are as a configurer of that device!
