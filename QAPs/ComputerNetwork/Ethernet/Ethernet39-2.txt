â˜…Is it possible to wiretap the packets of a non-screened Ethernet cable from another nearby Ethernet cable?
If one had physical access to ethernet cables it would be trivial to insert a tap. If the traffic was not encrypted pretty much everything on that port would be up for grabs. The nature of switching means you would have to grab a cable that had trunk data on it and on most big switches there's no such thing as the trunks are on the backplane of the switch. You might grab a cable that goes to a WAN port and get some interesting stuff, but you still have to be in the closet.
