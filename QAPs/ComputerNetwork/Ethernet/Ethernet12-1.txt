â˜…Does the length of an ethernet cable affect speed?If so, at what length does it start slowing the connection down and is it noticeable?
I know a great UDP joke related to this, but depending on your cable length, you might not ge%!"!Twg What I mean by this is; the longer cable you have (or lower quality, or many other factors) the more likely the message sent over the cable comes out incorrect, and when that happens, in the case of UDP, is that the program has to deal with it, and that could involve like asking for the same data again, or as in the case of some VoIP solutions; to send it through distorting the sound. And when your program has to re-request the data, some time and extra bandwidth is consumed, thus slowing down your speed.
