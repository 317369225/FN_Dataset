â˜…What is the best low-cost Ethernet router for the home?I'm looking to share a DSL connection throughout a house using wires, hopefully in such a way that the DSL provider can't see how many machines I have. Do I want a router? A NAT box? A switch? And if I just daisy-chain two or more of these items together, will they do the right thing? This is a follow-up question to What is the best wireless access point or router for the home?.
