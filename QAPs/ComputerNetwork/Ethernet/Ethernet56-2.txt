â˜…Is there an ethernet hub/switch inside HDMI devices?I read on a HDMI cable that it can carry ethernet data. What kind of devises or application is it intended for? Is it possible to avoid connecting all my HDMI linked devise to my ethernet network if one of them is already linked? (pulled from the comments below the question.
I don't think there is a hub/switch inside it. HDMI can carry Ethernet but unless a device is specifically set to use it, it won't. Plus, a device capable of using both Ethernet and HDMI for networking purposes will be set to use Ethernet by default until it ceases to be the standard.
