★Why does Cisco dominate the ethernet switching market?Why haven't smaller participants like Brocade been able to take share?
Cisco learned from the IBM playbook: the way to win in the Enterprise market has very little to do with the technology.  It's more about customer relationships.  Once they go after an account, they simply bond with the customer at a very individual level that effectively gives them account control.  After that, breaking in is VERY hard.
