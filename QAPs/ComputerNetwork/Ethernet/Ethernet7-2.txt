â˜…Why does Cisco dominate the ethernet switching market?Why haven't smaller participants like Brocade been able to take share?
I have the utmost respect for Cisco. They have absolutely transformed the Networking industry, and while I work for there main competitor, I believe there is one reason why they dominate the switching market (something I would argue that they are now losing ground in....) Certifications. Cisco recently announced that over two million people have achieved a Cisco certifcation. Further, they give there highest rated certification, the Certified Cisco Internetwork Expert (CCIE) a number. It started at #1024, and a couple of years ago passed #35,000 ... So what? Well, if you're one of those two million people who have achieved a certification, you're basically know how to configure Cisco equipment, and if you're asked for a recommendation, you're going to choose what you know. That's why Cisco dominate the switching market.. and that's why every vendor trying to beat them has to prove to there potential customers that its just as easy, if not easier, to learn something different.
