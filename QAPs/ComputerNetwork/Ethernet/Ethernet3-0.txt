★Why is there no micro Ethernet connector standard?We have micro USB (super-endorsed by EU), micro HDMI, and the Apple connectors getting smaller too... what's up with networking?
The micro versions of connectors were driven by ultraportables and handheld devices.  Most of these were developed after wi-fi was common and robust.  There was no need to have a smaller networking port because people used wireless networking.  Small single-board computers like Raspberry Pi are a niche market, and they don't have enough need to create, test, and standardize on a new connector.
