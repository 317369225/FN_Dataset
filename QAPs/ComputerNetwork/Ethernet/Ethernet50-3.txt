★Is it possible for me to connect to the internet via an ethernet cable connected to a WiFi enabled computer?
Phillip is right that Internet/ConnectionSharing - Community Help Wiki should get you what you want.  But he overlooked the fact that you'll likely need a 'Crossover' ethernet cable, which you didn't list that you had.  Most ethernet cables are 'straight through,' unless otherwise noted.  Crossover cables wouldn't work to hook your computer to a switch/router for instance. An ethernet cable is made up of four pairs of wires.  One pair is used to transmit, one pair to receive.  The reason you need a crossover cable, is because both computers will be trying to listen on the same pair of wires, and transmit on the other (like talking into a phone with the microphone to your ear.)  A crossover cable switches the cabling to make it work properly. The alternative would be to by a cheap hub or switch to connect the two.
