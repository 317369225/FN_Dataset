★Why hasn't Ethernet gotten any faster in the last 15 years?I meant this question in relation to common consumer hardware. In 2000, higher-end PCs started having gigabit Ethernet ports, and today, PCs still have the same gigabit Ethernet. I know 100Gb fiber exists, but it's not for consumers, whereas WiFi, USB, etc are all common on normal computers.
It's pretty simple economics, really.   The transition from 100Mb to Gigabit didn't need any exotic costly changes in the chips to upgrade - in fact most ethernet chips today are 10/100/1000 .   And Gigabit uses the same cables at the same length limit as 100Mb (100m) so most existing wiring would work.  And realistically 99% of users don't need 10 Gb connections. Whereas 10 Gb needs special cable (at a much shorter length) or fiber and costs much more than Gigabit does.   So there's really little point to it outside of Data Centers and large industrial installations - certainly not for the average user.
