★Why don't we needn't CSMA/CD protocols in Fast/Gigabit Ethernet/10 Gigabit Ethernet which works on full-duplex mode?How to deal with collisions without CSMA/CD protocol?
I'm not sure I understand your question, but I hope my answer is appropriate.  10G and higher rates are only implemented in Point-to-Point topologies. Collisions only occur in a shared medium, such as WiFi, older Ethernet technologies such as thinnet and 10/100bT networks implemented with hubs instead of switches. With switches there are only two transmitters on a segment:  The switch at one end and at the other end is either another switch or a host (router, PC, etc.).  Since the ports are in full duplex, each device can be transmitting to the other at the same time.  There is no third party on the segment to generate a possible colliding transmission. The key is the difference between a switch and a hub which is really a different topic, but I'll give a brief summary here.  A hub forwards all received traffic out all other ports.  This makes all devices connected to the hub a part of shared network.  Any transmission can collide with another transmission.  A switch learns the MAC's of devices on all ports and only forwards traffic out the appropriate port.  This eliminates the potential for collisions.
