★What is the relationship between "packets" and "frames" in Ethernet terms?Friend of mine asked me what the difference was.  I thought frames were part of web sites in the old days and packets were pieces of info transmitted over the web
The term "packet" is normally used at the IP layer, and segment (TCP) or datagram (UDP) are used at the higher transport layer. It's common to refer to Ethernet frames, rather than Ethernet packets, MAC addresses are used to identify network interfaces at the data link layer, for devices which share the same physical medium (such as a switched Ethernet network). In your example, Computer A would use: Source MAC: the MAC address of the physical network interface (within Computer A) used to send the Ethernet frame. Destination MAC: is likely to be the MAC address of the default gateway on the LAN, which provides access to the external network.The segment/datagram should only be decapsulated fully when it arrives at Computer B.
