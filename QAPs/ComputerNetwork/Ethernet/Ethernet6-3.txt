★What is the relationship between Ethernet and LAN?
Some acronyms: LAN (Local Area Network - as per previous responses) - with a typical scope of a office to a building (and in some pathological cases, a campus) WLAN (Wireless LAN) - for SOHO (Small-Office or Home-Office), the LAN and WLAN are logically merged WAN (Wide Area Network) - pretty much anything bigger than a LAN - from a city to the world, although there was a brief fling with the term "Metropolitan Area Network". VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) - this is a collection of technologies that get jumbled together. One kind of technology extends Ethernet to allow sets of ethernet switches to separate different sets of physical ports from each other by using a 12-bit identifier in the extension.  Another kind technology allows encapsulation of ethernet (or higher level protocols) in IPv4 (and I presume IPv6.)   A private VLAN is one that an end-user has to login to (authenticate) - the idea being that certain rights and priviliges can be granted based solely on what network your on and so access to the network itself has to be controlled (via. a login.) As WLAN suggests, how the data is actually transmitted can vary too - from CAT-6 wiring (4 twisted pairs) to wireless to fiber optics - even various forms of coaxial cable (although I doubt anyone uses that anymore.)
