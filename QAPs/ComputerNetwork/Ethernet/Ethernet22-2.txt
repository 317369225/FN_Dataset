â˜…Why didn't the original Macintosh (128K) have Ethernet?Strange, considering that they copied many other elements of the Xerox PARC Alto ...
In a nutshell, because Ethernet (in the abstract) was not pervasive then as it is now, and Ethernet as we know it wouldn't be invented for years. Most corporate networks those days were Token Ring -- an IBM technology. It wasn't really until the mid 80s that Ethernet came into its own with 10Base2 (thin coax), and it really exploded once it moved from coax to twisted-pair cabling beginning in 1990.
