★How do you locate powerline ethernet jammers?
Do you have surge protectors or uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) connected to the same circuit?  Powerline ethernet functions by sending data signals piggybacking on top of the sinusoidal AC signals of regular power.  This is seen as "spikes" by surge protectors and UPSes and they try to damp it down, thus destroying the signal.  When this happens (there is a means by which the sender system can detect it, obviously), the ethernet algorithm tries to send the unreceived packets again, thus causing lots of extra packets on the network, some of which will not reach the other end, thus resulting in perceived slowness.
