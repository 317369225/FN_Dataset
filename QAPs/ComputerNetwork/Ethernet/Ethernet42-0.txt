â˜…What is a good, inexpensive ethernet multifunction printer?
I'd recommend the Epson Stylus NX515. It costs roughly $150 is really Epson's top-of-the-line NX model. It features Ethernet and WiFi support and addresses many of the shortcomings with the NX400 last year, while carrying forward almost all of the NX400's strengths. Source: http://www.castleink.com
