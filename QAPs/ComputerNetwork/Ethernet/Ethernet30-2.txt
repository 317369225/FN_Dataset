★When does it make sense to use WLAN instead of Ethernet?
E.O. Stinson has it right. WiFi is absolutely capable of supporting 60 clients – it's just a question of what kind of performance you expect. Things to look for in a wireless solution (full disclosure: I work for http://meraki.com which does precisely this kind of thing.) 802.11n: not only faster, and avoids interference, but will help deal with many clients in a small area. Simplify your life and get a managed wireless network. Most all the enterprise-class solutions use a controller of some kind to give you control of your entire wireless network. This is a lot easier than having to set each access point's setting individually. Think about security. If you're not going to have any wires, it's going to be important to lock down your WiFi security. The standard enterprise way of doing this is via a RADIUS server and 802.11x. This employs Microsoft's Active Directory system which is usually used on corporate networks anyway. Many enterprise-class access points can use Power over Ethernet. I'd highly suggest this in your case since it will significantly reduce the number of wires you'll have to run.Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to know!
