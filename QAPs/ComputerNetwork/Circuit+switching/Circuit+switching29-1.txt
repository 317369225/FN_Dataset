â˜…What is it about a digital circuit, in contrast to an analog circuit, that means that, in the event of a problem, it freezes/hangs and has to be reset (E.g. switched off/on)?
Digital circuits discrete-ize the information that is intended to be processed as 1's and 0's by mostly operating the transistor (usually a FET) in the tiode/ohmic region. This just means that the device is either "on" or "off". However since all digital circuits are limited by analog domain, there are certain parts of a digital circuit that needs to be "setup" before the information can being comfortably abstracted. One of which is the need to reset the digital circuit in the beginning of operation. When a digital circuit is first powered up, sometimes there are internal nodes which are undefined (randomly high or low) perhaps due to previous operation. Also likely is that the internal nodes may hold parasitic charge which may read a value that is neither a 1 or 0, which is unacceptable in digital domain. Thus is it necessary to force those nodes to high or low usually by a reset signal (which is a is just a glorified line that forces a conductive path of those internal nodes to some rail such as Vdd or GND).
