â˜…For a circuit, why is the back EMF when the switch opened is greater than when the switch is closed?
states that the voltage is equal to the inductance and the rate of change of current. When a switch is closed, the current in the inductor is zero and must build up to its steady state condition, so di/dt is small because di is zero. However, when the current is steady and the current source is suddenly removed, di/dt goes very high since dt becomes very small.
