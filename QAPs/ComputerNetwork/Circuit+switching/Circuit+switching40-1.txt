â˜…When Cisco was founded, why were packet switched routers considered to be inferior to the existing technology?
No guarantees. Too many Bell-shaped heads who wanted deterministic, time division multiplexing ("phone calls") and who couldn't wrap their brains around "best effort" stateless (and thus simple, and thus scalable) packet switching. The trick is to make sure that you have enough bandwidth in your network (especially your backbone), and build/add more as necessary.
