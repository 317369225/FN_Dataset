â˜…What's the difference between 3G & 3.5G
3G and 3.5G are commercial terms for plain old Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and UMTS with High-speed packet access (HSPA or HSPA+). Laymen don't seem to like acronyms as much as engineers do, you know. The difference is that HSPA is faster than regular UMTS. How much faster it gets depends on many factors, but the theoretical top transfer speed are 384 kbps for old rel. 99 UMTS and up to 42 Mbps for HSPA+. Real life speeds are not that great, but HSPA should give you 3-4 Mbps download, 1 Mbps upload in real situations. 3.5G or even 3.75G are later names for extensions of the UMTS standard to faster an faster speeds. They showed up when somebody decided to develop LTE technology and call it 4G for marketing purposes.
