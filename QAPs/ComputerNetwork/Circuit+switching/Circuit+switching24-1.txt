â˜…How beneficial is Mobile VoIP over traditional phone calls?
Traditional calls are one-dimensional. They can carry only voice (ignoring the practiclaly de-funct 3G video calls). Mobile VoIP can add layers of information to the call, thus creating a more interesting conversation. For example, photo and location sharing, presence (as Emily wrote in her excellent answer), social network integration, and much more. Yes, cost is much cheaper, especially for international calls. Also, the payment model and method is usually much simpler than your average mobile subscription. For example, Vonage Mobile App (http://j.mp/dlvonmob) enables users to pay by using in-app purchases.
