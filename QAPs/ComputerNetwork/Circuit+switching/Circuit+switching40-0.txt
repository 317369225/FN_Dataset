★When Cisco was founded, why were packet switched routers considered to be inferior to the existing technology?
In addition to Quality of Service issues mentioned by Erik, there was also the issue of billing. Circuits made a clear cut case for billing.  The economic models of the carriers all centered around having a fixed bandwidth circuit, either permanently connected or switched on and off as demanded.  The idea that you could consume all-you-can-eat data was completely alien to the incumbent carriers.  Some smaller carriers experimented with per-packet and per-byte charges, but all of the billing, management and settlement systems orbited around the concept of circuit-oriented networking. This circuit-oriented bias remains in place today though the circuit oriented abstractions provided over packet-switched networks by technologies like ATM and MPLS.  These technologies also strive to build in the Quality of Service guarantees required by carriers.
