â˜…What is it about a digital circuit, in contrast to an analog circuit, that means that, in the event of a problem, it freezes/hangs and has to be reset (E.g. switched off/on)?
This question is somewhat comparing apples to oranges. Analog circuits are typically continuous time circuits and work on continuous time signals. Typical analog circuits include amplifiers, filters, and mixers. Generally, they cannot get into a "hang" condition (they can under certain environmental conditions). Digital circuits can assume one of two outputs, normally identified as True/False, 1/0, High/Low. From an electrical standpoint, the output is either the high voltage rail or the low voltage rail. Digital circuits can be used to perform many of the same type analog functions such as amplifying or filtering on discrete time signals. Because multiple digital circuits are used in a discrete time signal processing chain, there are conditions which can arise in which one or more signals arrive at an error condition. This may be due to poor design, environmental conditions, or intentional abuse (hacking). When the error condition happens, it may take the form of a latch up, isolating and bottling up part of the signal processing chain. They only way to recover from this condition is to return the circuit to known state, typically, the start-up state. In any complex digital circuit, there is a start up state the digital circuit is placed in upon "power on reset". Normally, after power on reset, the digital circuit goes into a "power on self test" and then places itself in the nominal condition to be used.
