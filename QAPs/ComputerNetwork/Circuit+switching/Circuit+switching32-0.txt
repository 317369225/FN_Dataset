â˜…What do I need to replace 4 light switches on the same circuit?
The switch location which is nearest to the power source gets a 3-way switch. The switch location which is nearest to the light fixture gets a 3-way switch. The other locations get 4-way switches, no matter how many. The 4 terminals on the 4-ways are for 2 pairs of wires called "travelers" in the trade. The 3 way nearest the source gets 1 terminal to "hot" and the other 2 terminals are travelers to the next 4 way which sends 2 travelers to the next 4 way, which sends 2 travelers to the 3-way nearest the fixture.
