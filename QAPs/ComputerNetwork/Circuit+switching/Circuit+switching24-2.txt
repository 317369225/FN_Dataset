★How beneficial is Mobile VoIP over traditional phone calls?
One advantage Mobile VoIP has over traditional phone calls can be cost. Here is why I say “can be”: VoIP services generally charge per phone line, not for usage. So if your usage is high, it will likely benefit you greatly to use VoIP in lieu of a traditional mobile phone system.  Best of all, you can avoid roaming charges that often accompany traditional phone systems. With that said, keep in mind that if you don’t use it a lot, it can be unnecessarily expensive (though that’s the case with nearly everything, traditional mobile plans included).
