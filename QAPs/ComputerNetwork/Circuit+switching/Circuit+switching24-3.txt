â˜…How beneficial is Mobile VoIP over traditional phone calls?
In my personal experience, although all responses are completely right on the money and valid, is to avoid high roaming charges. I can even make VoIP calls from Europe for example over a mobile carrier's data network when roaming and charges are much less than making the equivalent overseas mobile call. Of course what I usually do is either purchase a local SIM with data capabilities or prepay a data roaming plan like the one at&t offers (I usually go for the $160 for 800MBPS while roaming).
