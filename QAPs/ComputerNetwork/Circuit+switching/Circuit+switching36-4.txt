â˜…What are some good resources for learning about distributed computing? Why?This is a follow-up question on How do I become a data scientist?
In all the very good answers, I believe that Lamport's paper on "Time, Clocks and Ordering of Events in a Distributed System" got missed out. This is the first paper one should read. Another paper that may be of interest is: Fay Chang, Jeffrey Dean, Sanjay Ghemawat, Wilson C. Hsieh, Deborah A. Wallach, Mike Burrows, Tushar Chandra, Andrew Fikes, and Robert E. Gruber. 2008. Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data. ACM Transactions on Computer Systems, 26, 2, Article 4 (June 2008), 26 pages. Big Table paper from Google is again one of the seminal papers on the NoSQL database systems, a must for modern distributed systems course. Another must read is this: Daniel Abadi. 2012. Consistency Tradeoffs in Modern Distributed Database System Design: CAP is Only Part of the Story. Computer 45, 2 (February 2012), 37-42. This paper gives a very good view of the CAP theorem and the need to look beyond it for distributed system design - CAP theorem addresses the operation of a distributed system during a network partition, while this paper addresses the other trade-offs in non-partitioned distributed systems. I fully agree with some of the comments that the papers can just get you started - u must really start writing distributed programs to get a full hang of things. For example, implement a simple replicated data store with just a single data item, with say k as replication factor. How will you synchronize the replicas? You may realize that using the clock value may lead to some issues, as each system may have a slightly different value. Write code in Java/C++ for the same. This will really set you up to start understanding the nuances of a distributed system.
