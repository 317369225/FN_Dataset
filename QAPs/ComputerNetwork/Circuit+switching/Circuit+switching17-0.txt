â˜…What is the difference between Voice Over LTE and 3G voice services?It seems current LTE network doesn't support voice, and voice is redirected to 3G network. What's the challenges to support VoLTE?
LTE by design doesn't have a Circuit Switched core which means even the voice calls are routed through the packet switched networks.The challenge currently lies in the fact that LTE specifications doesn't have a mechanism to hand-over a call to CS network which in most cases is 3G network. In real world, say for example a subscriber is driving in Area A with LTE coverage and is using VoLTE services and then he enters area B with only 3G services. In such a situation, the voice call will drop. There are 2 solutions to this problem :- 1. Have LTE everywhere - This will happen but will take it take sometime to have it. 2. Re-direct CS calls to 3G networks - This is the economically viable and technologically possible, intermediate solution to the above problem.
