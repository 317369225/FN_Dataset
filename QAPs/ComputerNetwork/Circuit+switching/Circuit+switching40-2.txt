â˜…When Cisco was founded, why were packet switched routers considered to be inferior to the existing technology?
A major factor was software x hardware. Packet switched routers were for a long time software driven machines. At those times - nearly 30 years ago - software was SLOW. Performance would be measured on the low thousands of packets per second. On the other hand, circuit switching was done by hardware. It helps the fact that it's comparatively easier to build hardware to take one bit every N out of a stream, always at the same time, and direct it to other stream, than it is to build hardware that can receive variable sized packets, check the header, forward the packet, update the header (including CRC) - all in real time. The belief that software-based routing would always be slower than circuit switching was so deeply ingrained in the best industry minds that billions were spent to develop ATM - a fixed-size cell-based technology, which attempted to be the one technology to rule them all and kill software-based routers forever. Thanks to clever minds (many of them working at Cisco, others at competitor firms) and Moore's Law, two related but separated things happened in the meantime: CPUs became fast enough to route millions of packets per second via software. Large memories help a lot, making possible to build structures that allow to make decisions and manage buffers in real time. Denser chips made it possible to build hardware-based "packet switches". Since the late 1990s Ethernet, IP and later MPLS switches have been using special built silicon that can forward packets at extremely high speeds - faster than software, but still with many of the same complexity and level of control (QoS, multiple queues, granular buffer management, etc.)
