â˜…Realtime Communication: What's keeping telephony API vendors from adding video?Twilio, Plivo, Voxeo, Telesocial and others offer simple, easy, scalable, and affordable APIs for web developers. What's in the way of offering video chat/conferencing/messaging APIs along with the audio chat/conferencing/messaging APIs?
I think many of us are waiting to see which video codec gets selected as mandatory. Server side costs and architecture (and also probably business model) will need to be re-thought depending on the outcome of the VP8 vs h264 battle. If h264 wins we will have to do channel counting on the server side and have a per user license, but will be able to use off the shelf hardware from day one. If VP8 wins then the solutions will be pure software (initially at least) but simplified by not having to count (and make available for audit) every simultaneous user.
