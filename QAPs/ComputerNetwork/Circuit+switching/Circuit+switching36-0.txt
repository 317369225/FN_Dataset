Download Hadoop (http://hadoop.apache.org/) and run some MapReduce jobs on your laptop in pseudo-distributed mode (seeWhat's the best way to come up to speed on MapReduce, Hadoop, and Hive? ) Learn about Google technology stack (MapReduce, BigTable, Dremel, Pregel, GFS, Chubby, Protobuf, Snappy, Ganeti, Tenzing, Sawzall, BigQuery, F1, Spanner, Jingle, GCM, Google Talk, Cloud Analytics , etc).

Setup account with Amazon AWS/EC2/S3/EBS and experiment with running Hadoop on a cluster with large data sets (you can use Cloudera or YDN images, but in my opinion you can better understand the system if you set it up from scratch, using the original distribution).
