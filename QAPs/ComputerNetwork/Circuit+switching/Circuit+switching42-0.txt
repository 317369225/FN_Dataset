★Wireless Routers: Why do modems take time to connect to the Internet when just turned on, as opposed to my phone, which connects to the net as soon as I turn on mobile data?
Typically this is because your phone was already connected to the cellular network (it had to be in order to receive calls), and only the portion that is used for mobile data was administratively disabled in the phone while you had mobile data off.  So when you turn on mobile data, your phone just goes "ok, use the channel that's already available".  This is especially true if your provider uses VoLTE, or a similar technology, which means that phone calls may use the data channel instead of the voice channel, and so even if you have mobile data off the phone will still activate and make available a data connection to support VoLTE.  If you actually turn off the entire cellular radio subsystem (which will also prevent you from receiving calls), you'll find it typically takes 15 to 30 seconds (sometimes longer) for mobile data to come online.  This may also happen after your phone switches mobile data back on after a voice call, if the phone had to fall back to legacy circuit-switched voice to place the call (and thus could not maintain the mobile data connection).
