â˜…Do mobile phones use circuit or packet switching for phone calls?
This question confuses a mobile phone connection techniques and central office switching. A mobile phone provides a connection to a base station. The base station may have integral switching or it may forward the voice call to a central office where switching will take place. The telephone switching system is mostly a different issue and somewhat isolated from the phone connection technology. Central offices must work with mobile phones and old analog land line phones. That said, the earliest mobile phones essentially made a circuit switch connection to the central office through the base station. Since 2G mobile phones, they have all used digitized voice in packets. The connection between the mobile phone and the base station doesn't care if the packet contains voice or data. Central office switching centers have almost all converted over to packet switching. There may still be some old circuit switches somewhere out in the sticks. A old land line may be analog up to the central office, but somewhere along the way, it will be digitized and transmitted as packets through the packet switched network. This is why/how an old analog land line can talk to the mobile phone.
