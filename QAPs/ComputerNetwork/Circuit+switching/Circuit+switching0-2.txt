★What is the difference between packet switch and circuit switch?
For analogy, circuit switching is like telephone switching = Reserved , unshared Bandwidth. Allocation of resources done before the connection setup. Circuit switching characterized by 3 steps: 1. Circuit setup 2. Data Transfer 3. Tear down of connection. Packet switching is not having these 3 time consuming steps.  No band width( generally) is reserved, shares bandwidth with other competing sources. Individual packets arrive at destination at different times due to the different paths the packet may take depending on the network condition.
