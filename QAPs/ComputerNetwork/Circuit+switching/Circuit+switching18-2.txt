★What are the best historical analogies to SDN?Like SAN vs. NAS?
This is the best one I've found, it uses a courier package analogy: Software Defined Networking (SDN) for the non-technical CXO - Logicalis CXO Unplugged Basically, imagine you want to send a package of data across town.  You give it to a courier and he sets off on his way, he is now in the network. He knows roughly which direction he is going, but has to stop at various points to find out the quickest way.  He may even find that when he gets to a certain street it is one-way and has to go back and find another route.  He may also get to a certain point and find there is too much traffic and has to ask someone for a less crowded route. And what if the package is an awkward shape and he cannot negotiate certain routes? Again he has to find another way. Those people he is asking are like routers, they contain the knowledge and he needs to consult them at each point in the journey. Now for the same analogy, but over an SDN.  Imagine the courier now has a smartphone with GPS.  He sets off and the route is constantly updated and controlled centrally. The central control knows the shape of the package and can route him accordingly.  He can also overlay other services such as traffic conditions, which will dynamically update his route, all from that central control point. If his phone packs up, he can still ask the way
