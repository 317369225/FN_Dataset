â˜…What is the difference between VoIP and VoLTE?So as I understand it voice calls can now be placed using LTE packet switching whereas before they had to use circuit switching and were therefore always defaulted to using 3G or 2G network. Since Skype/Hangouts etc already used packet switching internet protocol for their video/voice calling what is the difference/how is this new? Is it just the handoff between 4G and 3G/2G when required that is new?
Rupert Baines mainly covers the key point. VoIP is a generic term for any voice over IP service while VoLTE is a specific implementation in the LTE standards (or more accurately 3GPP standards). It would be good to note that VoLTE still uses the same essential components of any VoIP services such as a signaling protocol (like SIP), media payload protocol (like RTP) and codecs (like AMR). The 3GPP standards do specify particular things in addition to support things like roaming, wholesale interoperability, legacy integration and fallback, and many others. This additional items are specified in the form of customized signaling headers or the use of a combination of protocols and technology.
