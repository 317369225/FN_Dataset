â˜…What is the switching circuit of NAND gate?
Since I answered your question about NOR gates by referring back to RTL, I'll do the same here. At the top right you can see the logical layout - it is just a NOR gate with both the inputs and output inverted. The electrical diagram should be easy enough to follow from there - the two input transistors providing inverted signals to the NOR gate in the middle, and another NPN stage inverting that for the output. Note, though, that L. Phoenix's diagram shows the way things are done nowadays, which is a lot simpler and more compact than in the early days.
