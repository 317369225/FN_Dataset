â˜…What is the difference between packet switch and circuit switch?
Packet switching sends packets over multiple network paths to conserve bandwidth but requires the receiver to reconstruct the order the packets belong. Circuit switching reserves a single network path from transmitter to receiver, making it less efficient bandwidth wise, but more effective in eliminating error-correction latency and dropped-packet kinds of signal loss/noise.
