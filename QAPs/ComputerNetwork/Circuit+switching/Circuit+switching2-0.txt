★How are virtual circuit and circuit switching related?
Thank you for the opportunity to help you with your homework. Circuit switching is the most common instantiation of a connection oriented network.  In such a network, a connection is established from data source to data sink and is transmitted down this path. In the circuit switching instantiation, TDM switching elements directly shunt signals along the resulting path. A virtual circuit is the logical equivalent of circuit switching.  Rather than switching purely based on time slots, data is encapsulated and switched along a path through a packet network. To the end hosts, this appears to be circuit switched, but it delivers the higher utilization made possible by statistical muxing on a packet network.
