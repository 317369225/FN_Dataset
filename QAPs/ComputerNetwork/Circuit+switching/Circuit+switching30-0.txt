★Does it matter if you put switch/fuse in a DC Circuit on positive terminal or negative terminal?
Yes. Typically the negative terminal is ground.   So if you put the switch, fuse there (on the return path) then when the switch is open the whole circuit will be sitting at high potential. Tt won't be "on" but if someone were to touch something they could get hurt as they now provide a path from "high" to ground. That doesn't matter from a safety perspective at low voltages, but you might still damage things - especially since the current will flow without  a fuse (since the fuse is uselessly on the negative terminal where it isn't protecting anything!) So the switch and fuse go on the positive terminal. Then when they are off the circuit is disconnected and grounded. In some systems (telephony, cars) you have negative voltage (-48V, -12V) and the postive is ground: in this case you would do the reverse
