â˜…Do phone calls use 3G data? Why?
There are 2 types of core networks in 2G and 3G Networks. The CS (Circuit Switched) core network (MSC - Mobile Switching Centre) handles the voice part and the PS (Packed Switched) core Network (SGSN/GGSN - Serving/Gateway GPRS Support Node) handle the data part. In 3G, as you can see from the picture, the voice goes over the CS core and Data goes over the PS core so the voice does not use data. However, if you use an App like Skype or Viber to make phone calls, it will use data as they use VoIP (Voice over IP - IP = Data) protocols. In case of 4G (or LTE), there is no connection to the CS core network so there are 2 approaches for voice: The mobile moves to a 2G/3G network to make/receive voice calls - this is known as CSFB or Circuit Switched Fallback The mobile uses a VoIP App or a similar facility built-in in LTE networks. This is known as VoLTE or Voice over LTE.
