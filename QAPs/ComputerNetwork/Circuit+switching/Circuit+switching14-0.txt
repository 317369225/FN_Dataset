★What are the pros and cons of having so many light switch circuits in new constructions?
Without having your plans before me for verification, it sounds like you have a  rather ordinary electrical plan as specified by the NEC.  Kitchen circuits per code are numerous and separating the island receptacles from other receptacles in the kitchen is just good design.  Lighting circuits are also separated from receptacles which get a lot of use in the typical kitchen. Switches and circuits serve entirely different purposes, neither of which is to conserve energy.  You seem to want to limit the number of switches, where good electrical design would actually increase the number and location of switching devices, thus eliminating that walk across the living room to turn off a forgotten lamp.
