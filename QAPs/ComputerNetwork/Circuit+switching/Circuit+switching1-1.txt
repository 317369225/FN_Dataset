★Does TCP use virtual circuit switching ?why it is the meaning in Todd lammle ccna r and s guide that tcp sets up a virtual circuit? what is the meaning ? is it actual virtual circuit switching or datagram approach
Thats an interesting question: To be honest I didnt know what and how to reply when I read it, so I consulted the almighty google to help me out. A virtual circuit (VC) is a means of transporting data over a packet switched computer network in such a way that it appears as though there is a dedicated physical layer link between the source and destination end systems of this data. Before a connection or virtual circuit may be used, it has to be established, between two or more nodes or software applications, by configuring the relevant parts of the interconnecting network. After which, a bit stream or byte stream may be delivered between the nodes Datalink layer and network layer virtual circuit protocols are based on connection oriented packet switching, meaning that data is always delivered along the same network path, i.e., through the same nodes. Connection oriented transport layer datalink protocols such as TCP[2][3] may rely on a connectionless packet switching network layer protocol such as IP,  where different packets may be routed over different paths, and thus be  delivered out of order. However, it is possible to use TCP as a virtual  circuit,[3][4][5] since TCP includes segment numbering that allows reordering on the receiver side to accommodate out-of-order delivery. I am quoting this from wikipedia " Virtual circuit " So from the limited knowledge that we gained, I would conclude that TCP is not an "actual virtual circuit switching" because the packets does not follow the same path. But it is a "virtual virtual circuit switching" because the application layer receives the byte streams in the same order that it was sent. I hope that makes sense and it answers the question Vishnu Anilkumar Founder of ITnotes.in
