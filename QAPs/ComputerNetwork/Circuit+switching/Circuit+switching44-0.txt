â˜…When two people try to call each other simultaneously, why can't the network do the smart thing and connect them rather than give an engaged signal?
Because it is "circuit switched". Once the two parties are "in call", the resource (bandwidth/phone line) is occupied. It will be released only when the call is terminated. Once either of them picks up the handset (off hook), the resource is assumed to be "in use". So the other party can't essentially connect. Compare this to "packet switched" calling like GoogleTalk or Skype. Since the call will go over the internet (which is packet switched), you can actually be in multiple calls at the same time. Read one of the million articles on "Circuit Switching v/s Packet Switching" and you'll hopefully find the answer.
