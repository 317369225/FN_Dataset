★Why did Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) lose to IP?
Three reasons: cost, cost, and cost.  Ethernet always wins.  This is networking rule 1. ATM developed out of a fine idea: it's easy and cheap to make hardware that divides up data into fixed sized chunks (cells) and flings cells about.  It turns out that within a single system, that's a capital idea.  Tho a 53 byte cell makes NO sense.  Pick something sane, like 32 or 64.  Some power of two.  Then, the real problem happened when someone decided that it was smarter to send the ATM cells actually over WAN fibers.  Obviously, you can do that, but when you do squirt the 53 byte cell out of the box, you now start paying the dreaded cell tax.  That drives up cost.  That alone was enough to kill it. Add to that the awkwardness of running packetized traffic on top of a circuit switched infrastructure and you add further operational costs and you're left shoving a square peg in a round hole.
