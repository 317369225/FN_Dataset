â˜…What is the difference between packet switch and circuit switch?
A circuit switch originally meant literally that, a complete two wire current connection between a telephone apparatus and a central office. The central office would connect two telephones to each other and they "owned" that resource (wire) until they hung up. This concept of telephone connection was extended between cities, but the nature of "owning" the wire was the same. In the 60's and 70's, the concept of packet switching was tried, originally for teletype type messages in a store and forward manner as a technique for nuclear survivable communications. It also was more resource efficient. Packet switching is essentially the internet. Data is parsed into packets and sent through multiple packet switches to its destination. In the late 70's, it became cheap enough to digitize voice that it began to supplant circuit switched voice, first for military, then for business, and ultimately for the consumer. In the US, there will be no circuit switched communications in a few more years. Its day has come and gone.
