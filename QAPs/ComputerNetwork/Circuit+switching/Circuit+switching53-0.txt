â˜…Why do we see NO spark when the switch is closed in a RL circuit, but we see one when it is opened?
When you are switching the circuit on, inductor will resist change of current through it and the current will start to flow starting from 0 and increase exponentially to the final settling value. Now when you try to switch it off, the inductor tries to resist the change in the current from final settling value to 0, so potential appears across it trying to maintain the current. When you are pulling off the switch, when the gap is sufficiently small, this potential causes the spark.
