★Why don't telecoms cabinets use a bus instead of a wiring loom?Our copper network cabinets and frames have cat's cradles of wiring in them, why don't people manufacture buses to do this instead?
The short answer is because of when telco networks came into existence and how they developed, ie circuit switching (Circuit switching.)  All of the wiring in telco systems whether PSTN or PBX reflect this design heritage.  You could say that VOIP systems do resemble a bus because Ethernet switching is generally the layer 2 protocol but even then you see patch panels and sometimes punch down blocks.  The longer answer is that at the end of day cable management always comes down to wiring runs to end points and its easier (and neater) to bring that back to a patch panel before running it into the bus (switch) in case you need to physically move a port.
