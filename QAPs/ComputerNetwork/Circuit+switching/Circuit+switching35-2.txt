★Integrated Circuit Design: How to calibrate a switching regulator to power a ham radio
Not so much help with "calibrating" the regulators, but from experience in using them: These parts create a lot of harmonics on the DC outputs.  Some small caps in the 100pf, as well as .01uf and .1uf usually help immensely.  Ensure your layout connects them to the ground plane as possible to the ICs' pins.  Inputs and outputs.  Use a single continuous ground plane, and not just traces. Put an oscope on the inputs and outputs and look for short pulses.  These are usually the problem, rather than constant AC components on the DC.  73s!
