â˜…Do mobile phones use circuit or packet switching for phone calls?
It is a bit complicated... "circuit switch" and "packet switch" can sometimes have "shades of grey". That said: The connection between basestation and core has been cell based (ATM) since 1990s, and most basestations since mid 2010s will use carrier Ethernet & VoIP. There might be a few old voice only ones in very remote developing countries with GSM (no GPRS) using E1 lines but I'd be surprised. So it's fair to say that most of those (and all long distance connections) will be packet based. The air interface. GSM is circuit based (ATT style 2G), even for data WCDMA voice is circuit based; HSPA is packet based (ATT style 3G) So if you do Skype it is packets, but a voice call is circuit. The same is true for cdma2000 & EvDO (Verizon style 3G) LTE is pure packets. So a Skype or VoLTE call will be VoIP But today few carriers actually support that, so if you make a voice call on your LTE phone it uses "Circuit Switched Fall Back" which (obviously) falls back to use 3G Circuit switched for the voice
