★With an Arduino or similar board, how do you switch on a circuit in a certain direction?I have a small motor that I want to turn on and off in a certain direction using an Arduino board. Basically I want to use the Arduino as a switch for the circuit of the motor with a battery. The Arduino should be able to close that circuit and also be able to change its direction. Is this what a relay does or would I need another gadget for that?
Assuming a DC motor, you could use a pair of two-pole relays to switch the polarity in the motor field winding or, for more advanced control, use an H-bridge. Either method will require additional components.  I would also recommend that you do not drive the relays directly with the Micro, instead using JFETs or similar on the output.
