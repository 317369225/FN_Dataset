â˜…What is the difference between Voice Over LTE and 3G voice services?It seems current LTE network doesn't support voice, and voice is redirected to 3G network. What's the challenges to support VoLTE?
LTE is packet switched network unlike legacy 3G networks that are a combination of PS for carrying data and CS (Circuit Switched) for carrying voice. For LTE, standards bodies have defined multiple ways to carry voice. Where voice services are provided using only LTE network using IMS, it is called Voice over LTE (VoLTE). However most carriers are currently using mechanisms other than VoLTE to provide voice services to their LTE customers. This is by using their legacy (GSM or CDMA) networks to route voice calls. This mechanism is called Circuit Switched Fall Back (CSFB). Since LTE standards are still evolving, carriers currently prefer to use the CSFB mechanism to provide voice services in their LTE Network to be able to provide acceptable quality of service (QoS). Carriers who do not have the option of falling back on any legacy network e.g., Reliance Infocom in India, are likely to use VoLTE for delivering voice services on their LTE networks.
