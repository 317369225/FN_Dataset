★What is the difference between CDMA and WCDMA network/sim?
cdma2000 or cdma1x and GSM are 2G standards. cdma1x and GSM evolved into EVDO and WCDMA respectively, which are 3G standards. GSM and WCDMA are standardized by 3GPP while cdma1x and EVDO are standardized by 3GPP2. So, when you compare cdma1x and WCDMA, you are basically comparing a 2G standard and a 3G standard. Hence, cdma1x is inferior to WCDMA in many ways. However, EVDO and WCDMA, which are competing technologies  achieve almost similar uplink and downlink data rates. They both use the same "code division multiple access" technology, but differ in the kind of codes they use to differentiate between the users and base stations. The power spectral densities of WCDMA and EVDO signals are different. WCDMA, as the name suggests, is a wide band version is CDMA.
