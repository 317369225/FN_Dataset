★What are some good resources for learning about distributed computing? Why?This is a follow-up question on How do I become a data scientist?
I made my own production quality open source project in Ruby that does some basic distributed computing. Blog post: http://charlesmartin14.wordpress... Github account: cloud-crawler Slideshare presentation: http://www.slideshare.net/charle... You can contribute by trying it out, coming up with an idea, and making a github pull request.  There are detailed instructions on the README. This is actually pretty close to production quality system that you might see in a innovation group or a small startup, although the stack might be different (i.e. php / gearman / memcached instead of ruby / qless / redis )
