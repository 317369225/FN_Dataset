â˜…How beneficial is Mobile VoIP over traditional phone calls?
Mobile VoIP is better than traditional phone calls due to the following reasons: 1) Well, it's mobile. 2) It's cheaper because of the medium of communication. However, since VoIP completely relies on a stable internet connection, users often face issues such as call lags, call drops, echos and so on and so forth. Thus, the quality of calls is highly inconsistent and unreliable in the case of mobile VoIP. To offer the quality of traditional phone calls, and the convenience and cost advantage of VoIP, we've recently launched Ringo (Low Cost International Calls). Ringo is an international calling app that works without the internet! It basically converts international calls to local calls, thus offering lower rates. It's cheaper than local carriers in many countries, and offers some great discounts such as free calling from UK to US. Ringo is currently available in 14 countries.
