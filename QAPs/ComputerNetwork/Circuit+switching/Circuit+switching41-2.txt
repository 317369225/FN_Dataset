â˜…What is the difference between Voice Over LTE and 3G voice services?It seems current LTE network doesn't support voice, and voice is redirected to 3G network. What's the challenges to support VoLTE?
One of the important difference between 3g and LTE is that 3G is circuit-switched network for voice traffic while LTE is packet switched. Now, Voice over IP(VoIP) is through circuit switched network . However, LTE has been using CSFB(Circuit Switch FallBack) feature to compensate for the unavailability of voice traffic on LTE networks an duse available networks(read 3G). This again, has become a thing of past as presently we have VoLTE(Voice over LTE) available for voice transmission. Hope it helps :-)
