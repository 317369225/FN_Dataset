★What is the difference between Voice Over LTE and 3G voice services?It seems current LTE network doesn't support voice, and voice is redirected to 3G network. What's the challenges to support VoLTE?
LTE is a standard for wireless communication of high-speed data for mobile phones and data terminals. LTE has greater spectral efficiency, which will allow more standard voice customers and more data and services, in a given bandwidth, improving average revenue per user or per unit (ARPU). VoLTE is an evolution of voice over IP (VoIP) over IMS networks which introduced carrier-grade quality, intended to replace current CS-based services. Migration  from cellular networks (3G) to packet switch (VoLTE) will lead to a redistribution of the core  of the network intelligence, making the network simpler and helping to  reduce the CAPEX and OPEX for new services. I think the most challenging aspect on the evolution towards VoLTE will to offer a high quality service to conquer users confidence, currently used to over-the-top VoIP services provided on a best effort basis. Telco operators must ensure, at least, current network availability and reliability.
