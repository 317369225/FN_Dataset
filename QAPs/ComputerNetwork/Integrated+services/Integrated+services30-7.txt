★What is the best continuous integration & deployment server?
This is a very tricky question. Depends mostly on what are your parameters to define "best". I will mention some of the servers I have experience with at different capacities and what my opinions are, but in any case you should do your own research. CC.net - fairly easy to setup. Configuration via xml is ok. Some good plugins. I used a lot and was very happy with it in general. Specially if you are not going to be creating new projects very often. Once you set the server up you rarely need to make any changes. Jenkins (previously known as Hudson): Self contained CI server, tons of plugins, super easy to set up a grid. TeamCity (free and commercial versions): By far the easier to setup and administer. The UI is fantastic. There are a bunch of  plugins out there and comes with several must haves already in the box. If I need to start today this is probably the one I will choose.    Embed Quote
