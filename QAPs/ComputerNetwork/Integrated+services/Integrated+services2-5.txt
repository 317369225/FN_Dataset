★Are there any Python/Django-friendly hosted Continuous Integration services?I'm looking for some rough equivalent to what http://travis-ci.org provides for the Ruby and Rails communities.
I know this question is a little old now, but in case it is still relevant I wanted to mention that I have just launched exactly (fingers crossed) what you are asking for: http://continuous.io I have been working on it for a little while and it is pretty good at auto-detecting the type of Python project and how the tests should be run. You can also entirely customise your build script to make any changes you need (or to test an entirely different type of project. Rails, PHP, Java anyone?). It would be fantastic to get some feedback, be it good or bad :)    Embed Quote
