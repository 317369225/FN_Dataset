★Are there any standards-based ways to integrate a web service or application with a variety of Email Service Providers (ESPs)?Is there any API out there?  Is it possible to build a software interface that is reusable across many ESPs?  Who are the experts on this issue?
As with the above comments, I don't think there is a unified API for all of the different Email Service Providers, unless you build one yourself. Most providers (should) have a very easy to use API, and they should all have similar functionality. The trouble comes when each API has different parameters and structures. Probably not worth doing, considering they mostly do the same thing, but if you must, pick three and build for those. I know there's an Expression Engine add-on that interfaces with Postmark and PostageApp [1] so it can be done. [1] http://lobsterwarmachine.com/add...    Embed Quote
