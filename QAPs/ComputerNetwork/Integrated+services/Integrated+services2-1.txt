★Are there any Python/Django-friendly hosted Continuous Integration services?I'm looking for some rough equivalent to what http://travis-ci.org provides for the Ruby and Rails communities.
Shippable (free hosted service for continuous integration and deployment) is a CI service that supports Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, Node.js, services like Redis, Elasticsearch, Postgres, and instant notifications of build and test results. We also support continuous deployment to Heroku. (more coming very soon...) We are the first service using docker containers to run your build and test workload.    Embed Quote
