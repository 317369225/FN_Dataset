★What is the best continuous integration & deployment server?
(Disclaimer: I work at Atlassian and use Bamboo.) It may depend on where you're at with CI. If you're trying it out for the first time or only need very basic build automation, then Jenkins might serve your needs. If you're looking to move past that rudimentary stage into continuous delivery pipelining, or bring your CI practices onto all your development branches, then take a look at Bamboo. It's available to install on-premises or as a hosted service. And since it's an Atlassian tool, the integration with JIRA and Stash are top-notch.
