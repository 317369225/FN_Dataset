★Is there still a market for Cloud based ETL/Data Integration Services?The company I am working with is currently using Hadoop to integrate and analyze data....they are thinking about adding a ETL component/tool to their product in order to focus on "small" data as well as big. Is there still a market for this type of service?
In my opinion there is still a good scope of data integration services in the business world. Most of the companies which are providing Big Data as a service are using Hadoop Technology as the Hadoop framework was designed to handle ETL operations on Big data as well as unstructured data like log files. Hence, you may use Hadoop when you encounter Big Data and use the traditional tools otherwise. Even the company I am working for is also using Hadoop technology to integrate the client’s huge sets of data. To know more you can check here: http://www.ishir.com/big-data.htm    Embed Quote
