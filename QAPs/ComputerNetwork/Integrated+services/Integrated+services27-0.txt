★Will Evernote integrate more services?I know they have a new Evernote button for use on various websites similar to the Addthis tool but shouldn't the developers find ways to autoimport a user's activities that they want logged?
I truly hope that Evernote will focus on its core offering, and improve that before spending time developing more partnerships. There are real gaps in functionality, and some serious issues (text formatting on mac, sub-par iPhone app) that need to be addressed before they push into other areas. Their much hyped partnership with Livescribe is pretty limited, not well implemented, and has yet to be improved several months after launch. Before starting other partnerships, they should improve that one, which is pretty important for their platform. I worry about Evernote getting too scattered and not focusing on the really important platforms -  Web, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android. Rather than trying to support every device on the planet and partner with hundreds of different companies, they should address those five platforms and make sure they're rock solid on core functionality before doing anything else.    Embed Quote
