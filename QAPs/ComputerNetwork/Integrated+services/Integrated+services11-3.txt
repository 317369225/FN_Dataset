★Is there a feature-by-feature comparison of Informatica and SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)?It is hard to find SSIS-specific feature comparison on the SQL Server website, and I need to compare just SSIS vs Informatica. Any third party review available (for free or paid)?
I wouldn't trust MS on this subject too much. In my experience INFA is more capable and robust.    Embed Quote
