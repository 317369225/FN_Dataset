★In today's agency landscape, are brands favouring full-service integrated advertising agencies or unbundled specialty shops?Barbara Lippert from Adweek says the term "disintermediation" is coming up more often today.  Clients prefer to rally multiple best-in-class specialty shops instead of one full-service agency for all traditional, digital, social, etc.  Do you agree?  Where are the best published opinions and predictions on this topic?
Over the last several years as larger shops have gotten stronger at the many digital disciplines or bought their way in via acquisitions I've seen a strong move towards working with a one stop shop.  It is true that one may be able to eek out slightly more performance or efficiency if utilizing a best of breed agency for each role, but there are inherent costs associated with that model that may in fact be more detrimental to your campaign.  Having to deal with, meet with and coordinate with multiple agency contacts is a time suck that one can't overlook and that must be taken in to account when determining the true cost or efficiency of a program. Campaigns are also more complex than ever thanks to universal search and true synergy of goals, strategy and attribution across channels is more important than ever and will separate the new leaders of digital marketing from those that refuse to adapt. Lex is exactly right... great ideas, no matter how well developed will fail without proper execution.    Embed Quote
