★In today's agency landscape, are brands favouring full-service integrated advertising agencies or unbundled specialty shops?Barbara Lippert from Adweek says the term "disintermediation" is coming up more often today.  Clients prefer to rally multiple best-in-class specialty shops instead of one full-service agency for all traditional, digital, social, etc.  Do you agree?  Where are the best published opinions and predictions on this topic?
I find Merit in the idea and would be a firm believer of  the  Integration Story. For the client the benefits are Time, Money & the agency having to delivers on targets. An Integrated  digital agencies  focus will be on the Target,  what channels to use will be their prerogative, unlike a specialized agency who will always be limited in the overall deliveries.. Maybe some of the productions services can be outsourced via the digital agency but by and large strategy and execution should be with one Agency.    Embed Quote
