★Is there a feature-by-feature comparison of Informatica and SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)?It is hard to find SSIS-specific feature comparison on the SQL Server website, and I need to compare just SSIS vs Informatica. Any third party review available (for free or paid)?
Most of the data integration capabilities have a parity of 90% (INFA has more features form a caching lookup perspective).  INFA comes into its own when an organization need profiling, discovery, exploration, meta and master data mgmt requirements around the classic ETL.  IMO SSIS is more mid market while INFA is enterprise class.  A Microsoft white paper comparing the two is here: http://download.microsoft.com/do...    Embed Quote
