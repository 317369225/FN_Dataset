★In today's agency landscape, are brands favouring full-service integrated advertising agencies or unbundled specialty shops?Barbara Lippert from Adweek says the term "disintermediation" is coming up more often today.  Clients prefer to rally multiple best-in-class specialty shops instead of one full-service agency for all traditional, digital, social, etc.  Do you agree?  Where are the best published opinions and predictions on this topic?
Kyle is right in that it really depends on a lot of factors - not only the maturity of the market and the players involved, but also how much of the leg-work the client is prepared to take on themselves. It is potentially very powerful to pick best-in-class for each execution but this means that the client really has remain very hands on and the conductor of a complex orchestra with more than just strategic differences. Where there is a challenge of resources, time, budget, carefully choosing a single integrated partner can yield amazing results. As we see more and more - today ideas alone are not enough, but execution is key and in this respect without great execution anything can fail.    Embed Quote
