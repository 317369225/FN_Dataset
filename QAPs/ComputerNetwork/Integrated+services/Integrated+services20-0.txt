★I am a .Net developer having 3 years of experience. I am planning to learn SSIS (sql server integration services). Is it a good field to jump?As Microsoft usually changes the framework and tools every year. I am also concerned about the salaries.
In general moving from software development (which is now a fairly commoditized profession) into BI (which includes integration, and therefore a need for SSIS or other tools) is a good move. There is a lot more data now than there ever was, and we have the tools and technology to actually analyse it. Beware that many companies may try to follow the same team structure for BI as they do for software development (ie. hiring more "code monkeys" and fewer software designers/engineers). So if you're happy writing ETL flows forever, then that's fine. Otherwise, I'd recommend being able to provide the full BI solution: Data governance, Integration (SSIS/Informatica/BizTalk, etc.), Data Warehousing (Kimball/Inmon), Reporting (QlikView, Tableau, SSRS, etc.) and Data Science (SAS/R/SSAS, etc.).    Embed Quote
