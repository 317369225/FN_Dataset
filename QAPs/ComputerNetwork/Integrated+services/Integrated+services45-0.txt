★Can you integrate multiple PPI services into one iPhone app?For example, if I want to use Flurry, Tapjoy, Fisksu, and Sponsormob at the same time, are they compatible? If so, will it cause performance problems during the first app load when they all try to contact their servers?
You are definitely able to integrate paywalls with most PPI Networks as long as you have not negotiated an exclusive contract with a single company. Of course this is a case by case basis but I have yet to run into a company that was unable to integrate multiple networks. Integration of multiple paywalls is a little more time consuming but is well worth it for any app developer to increase revenue and reach of their application across platforms. Current gaming companies that have developed their own mediation layer to serve multiple offers include Gameview Studios and Kama Games. What is tricky is building a mediation layer that allows all offers to integrate seamlessly. If an offer doesn't work with your mediation layer, you can always link out to their offerwall. This is what SponsorPay currently does when it comes to iOS offers. Hope this sheds some light on your question.    Embed Quote
