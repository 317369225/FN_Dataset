★Are there any standards-based ways to integrate a web service or application with a variety of Email Service Providers (ESPs)?Is there any API out there?  Is it possible to build a software interface that is reusable across many ESPs?  Who are the experts on this issue?
Phil of FeedBlitz (www.feedblitz.com) here; our specialty is automation.   There aren't ESP standard APIs. But there *are* standard content and metadata protocols: Feeds.   I say use a feed (RSS or Atom) as your interface and then let a service with RSS automation convert it to email for you. There are many RSS generators out there if your site's standard ones aren't enough, including Dappr, Pipes and us (FeedBlitz). Depending on the level of sophistication and support you need, you can use FeedBurner for the RSS to mail (no support and very basic emailing) through to us for the widest possible control over your RSS mailing automation, branding, filtering and traking.
