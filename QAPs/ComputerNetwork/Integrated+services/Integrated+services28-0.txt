★How does Doxo.com integrate with service providers?
First, not sure if readers know what doxo is, so i'll start there: doxo provides people with a secure, private online digital file cabinet that's accessed at doxo.com.  People use doxo to receive, upload, store, and manage any type of document or account information that's important to them (e.g. phone bills, bank statements, receipts, usernames, passwords, etc.) Service providers (e.g. phone companies, banks, insurance companies, utilities, etc.) can also join the doxo network and connect with their customers.  When a user and provider connect on doxo, that provider can then turn off paper mail for that customer, deliver documents directly to the customer's doxo account, and receive payments via doxo. Providers join doxo by enrolling at the doxo website (www.doxo.com/for-providers/).  A Provider can immediately start using doxo to connect, send documents, and receive payments with no system integration at all by using the web console for their account.  Or they can integrate to doxo's API's if they prefer.  In either case, integration and use of doxo is controlled and completely self-managed by the provider.  No software or services are required. Larger companies on doxo, like phone companies with tens of millions of customers, are typically doing direct API integration.  Smaller providers, like a credit union with ten thousand customers, are typically starting by using the web interfaces and batch processes.  Either works well, just depends on needs, scale, and current systems the business has in place.    Embed Quote
