★If we paid developers to integrate our service into their product would they do it?Providing that our service has the same core features as competing services.
It depends on what the service does, if it is as good as the alternative, how much time and resources it would take to switch from the competing service.  Assuming the service is as good, as easy to use, with comparable support and ongoing feature development, then sure why wouldn't I use the one that is paying me.    Embed Quote
