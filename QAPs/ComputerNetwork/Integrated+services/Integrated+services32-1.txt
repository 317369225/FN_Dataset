★How does 3rd party web service integration work ?Is it possible to discuss some issues on api design and implementation over a sequence of Q&A series.
REST has already been mentioned; the other main method used to publish web services is SOAP. SOAP APIs include a machine-readable definition of the calls that make up the API and the data types of all the parameters in and out - it's called the WSDL. This is handy because tools can use it to automatically generate all the code you need to call the API in the language you want to use (if there is such a tool for your language).    Embed Quote
