★In today's agency landscape, are brands favouring full-service integrated advertising agencies or unbundled specialty shops?Barbara Lippert from Adweek says the term "disintermediation" is coming up more often today.  Clients prefer to rally multiple best-in-class specialty shops instead of one full-service agency for all traditional, digital, social, etc.  Do you agree?  Where are the best published opinions and predictions on this topic?
I have to believe they are favouring us. We're a full service portfolio of specialist unbundled shops, that we bundle to create complete solutions without the mediocrity the big shops are known for. And my rationale for believing they prefer us is that we are the fastest growing network in the work, according to the analysts who track such things. That said, you win some, you lose some.    Embed Quote
