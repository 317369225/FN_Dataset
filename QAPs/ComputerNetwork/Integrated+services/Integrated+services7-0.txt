★What continuous integration service does AeroFS use?
JetBrains' TeamCity. We've also written our own distributed testing tool to simulate partitions and arbitrary event sequences. Why TeamCity? We have limited resources and wanted to spend them on extending our distributed test tool and writing tests against our product, instead of our CI framework. TeamCity comes with the features we care about: Robust JUnit support Ability to run arbitrary command-line jobs Ability to parse logs in real-time and report failures Simple error-reporting for custom log output Ability to drill into artifacts (zips of log files) via the web UI Job statisticsWe have not written any TeamCity plugins, neither do we plan to. It's not all roses, of course: its UI is unnecessarily complex, and I would love to see JetBrains-supported OpenID integration. Test Tools Our distributed test tool is designed to be run on a developer's machine. This allows us to work remotely and independent of our CI system (as befits a company building distributed file-syncing software!) We have scripts that spin up VMs as necessary, perform headless AeroFS installs, and run test suites against them. I can't thank enough everyone who made this system a reality. For our CI jobs we simply use TeamCity as a coordinator for our test tool. Each test job is modeled as a build configuration, and each configuration sets up a test environment and starts the job up - exactly like a developer does. The test tool reports test progress in real-time to TeamCity, which allows us to see if a job is failing or not. At the end, all artifacts from the headless installs are archived and stored as a TeamCity artifact. Developers are able to use the web UI to explore the artifacts and fix any errors as necessary.    Embed Quote
