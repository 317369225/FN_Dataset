★What is the best continuous integration & deployment server?
Hi there. I'm on the Customer Success team at Solano Labs, and we offer a CI & CD solution, Solano CI. Since “best” really depends on what you are trying to accomplish, I think Moritz’s answer does a good job of laying out the groundwork for narrowing down options and providing a framework for thinking about what solution is best for you. The links he provided should also help anyone who wants to explore which is the best CI/CD solution for them. There's one area we disagree, however: simplicity isn’t always opposed to customizability. For example, Solano supports a wide variety features, including specific versions, simply by adding them in its configuration file. (Relevant docs: Config File Reference and Page on solanolabs.com) And for more esoteric features, you can install them as part of the pre-setup process. Cheers!    Embed Quote
