★Are there any standards-based ways to integrate a web service or application with a variety of Email Service Providers (ESPs)?Is there any API out there?  Is it possible to build a software interface that is reusable across many ESPs?  Who are the experts on this issue?
Context.IO has built an API for IMAP, which covers a huge chunk of the ESP space (gmail, google apps, yahoo mail, etc), and will eventually cover even more. We've also made it incredibly easy to leverage all forms of data contained in mailboxes: messages, attachments, contacts, flags, folders, etc. Take a look at our documentation and stay tuned for lots of news: http://context.io/docs    Embed Quote
