★Are there any standards-based ways to integrate a web service or application with a variety of Email Service Providers (ESPs)?Is there any API out there?  Is it possible to build a software interface that is reusable across many ESPs?  Who are the experts on this issue?
as already stated there is not full standard. However they may well be enough similarities for a generic solution depending on what you need to achieve. Presumably for CMS iteration you want to be able to programatically create messages. In this case a simple RSS type feed with a script page to parse the feed and produce the email friendly HTML content. I've worked with many publishers who work with advanced RSS rules managers and parsers. Any decet ESP will enable you to import a webpage or you can copy and paste the HTML into tue message. if you have more complex requirements there probably isn't one method to worm with all.    Embed Quote
