★What is the best continuous integration & deployment server?
I have had a satisfying experience in using both Bamboo from Atlassian and Jenkins over the past 6.5 years of large scale CI usage (at biggest 30+ teams on the same product with one and 18 teams on the other). Both of them can be good for you - jenkins has more plugins and open source support. With either one you will likely need additions when used in large environment (many teams working on same subject) - especially on radiating the information that you need in concise, useful for all the stakeholders form. Had to do that for both of the products... Unluckily did not have time to open source the radiator work.    Embed Quote
