★We are looking for some good reliable integration services for connecting a couple of cloud apps to our enterprise yammer app. Is zapier a reliable integration service for this purpose?
Have you tried Azuqua? We are a cloud integration platform that allows you to connect all your cloud apps (including Yammer) together. The Azuqua platform is more than one-to-one (so you can connect multiple apps in one process and add familiar functions to filter your data) and anyone can use the platform - you don't need a tech background. Check it out at http://www.azuqua.com. It might also be helpful to see this  example process that includes Yammer: Flõ Gallery.    Embed Quote
