★What is the best continuous integration & deployment server?
I definitely agree with Hernan here; there's a wide variety of tools and which will work for you highly depends on your technology stack, requirements and budget. I've had extremely good experience with JetBrains TeamCity over the last three or so years; that being said, I've always found Hudson extremely easy to set up and effective overall. I'd stay away from TFS (even for a .NET stack) and CC.net as I've had rotten experience with both. Another interesting option may be Atlassian Software's Bamboo; I haven't used it beyond playing with Codehaus's server a little bit, but did like what I saw. Update (November 2011): Having worked with Bamboo, and Elastic Bamboo via JIRA Studio specifically, I can highly recommend it as a robust, effective build server that's easy to set up and extremely well documented. Atlassian's support staff has also been tremendously helpful whenever I ran into serious trouble. (current stack includes Ant, Java, Scala and Subversion; we'll soon be migrating from Ant to sbt and from Subversion to git/Mercurial, at which point I'll add another update).    Embed Quote
