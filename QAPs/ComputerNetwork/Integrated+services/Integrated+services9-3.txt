★Which hosted continuous integration services show you individual Java test results?
Hi there, I'm on the Customer Success team at Solano Labs, maker of Solano CI. To follow up on Satyajit's comment, if your test suite produces JUnit-compatible XML reports, you can enable our JUnit parser by annotating your test command with the `junit` type. You can find out JUnit docs here: JUnit - Solano CI documentation. Hope that's helpful!    Embed Quote
