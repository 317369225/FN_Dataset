★What is the best continuous integration & deployment server?
We've used both Jenkins and TeamCity to do .Net builds running on a Windows server. Jenkins is quite capable out of the box, but TeamCity has a number of nice UI features that make managing it far easier. Ultimately, TeamCity does more of what I need it to do with less hassle & better reporting & artifact management. It gets out of my way, and lets me get on with the business of developing & testing software.    Embed Quote
