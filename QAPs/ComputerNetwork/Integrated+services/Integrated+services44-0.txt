★Is Google aiming to integrate all Google services into Google+?Does Google is focusing to integrate all their online web services and apps under Google+ as a complete social layer of interaction? So that by just visiting Google+, we could have all the Google services under it. Also, will there be any future integration of Google+ with Chrome?
The answer is, without a doubt: Yes to all. Hints of this can already be seen on the UI revamp of many Google services. In a recent hangout, Gmail's product manager was asking users how they want to see Gmail integrated with G+. Other google's product managers are asking the same from users. I think that in the next 6 months we will see many developments that will bring all Google's services under the G+ umbrella.    Embed Quote
