★Are there any standards-based ways to integrate a web service or application with a variety of Email Service Providers (ESPs)?Is there any API out there?  Is it possible to build a software interface that is reusable across many ESPs?  Who are the experts on this issue?
Hello, it's Ros here from Campaign Monitor. From my knowledge, each Each ESP will most have likely have their own unique set of API methods and calls, so I don't think it's likely that you could build a codebase that covers many of them, I'm sorry to say. Your best bet is to refer to vendor-specific documentation (eg. http://campaignmonitor.com/api/). Support teams such as our own Campaign Monitor's are usually more than happy to answer development questions, or put you in touch with their in-house API team.
