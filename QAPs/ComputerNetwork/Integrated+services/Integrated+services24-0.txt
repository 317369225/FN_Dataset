★I recently got an offer from Deloitte Hyderabad as a consultant in a system integration service line. What are the perks for this role?I will be joining in the month of April, let me know the downsides of joining in April (whether eligible for this year performance evaluation and stuff)
A prime advantage of working with Deloitte is the kind of crowd it attracts. Most of my colleagues are from IITs and NITs and other prominent colleges in India lke TSEC ,Manipal University. You cannot compare it with any other IT Company. A lot of impetus is given on building your network  which really helps in future. It will surely enhance your business communication skills. I would say that it is one of the best places to start your career especially if you have future MBA or Masters plans. Plus, you're in time for a performance review cycle - which is April to March, if I remember right. Further, once you get promoted to Sr. Consultant, perks multiply - such as car loan (at cheaper interest rates), free phone, etc.  Also, the rewards and recognition are amongst the best in the industry, not to mention the team activities, dinners and parties. Good Luck with Deloitte!    Embed Quote
