★In today's agency landscape, are brands favouring full-service integrated advertising agencies or unbundled specialty shops?Barbara Lippert from Adweek says the term "disintermediation" is coming up more often today.  Clients prefer to rally multiple best-in-class specialty shops instead of one full-service agency for all traditional, digital, social, etc.  Do you agree?  Where are the best published opinions and predictions on this topic?
Working in a fully integrated agency, I'm seeing things go both ways. There are a lot of clients finding efficiency in going to one agency instead of many, including clients that have recently disintermediated and are finding it difficult to manage all of the different groups separately. It becomes the job of the client to drive integrated strategies across multiple platforms instead of the agency. On the flip side, there will always be value in niche shops that do a bang up job at the one thing they do. They wouldn't be in business if they didn't. This is especially true for many emerging technologies such as mobile app development.    Embed Quote
