★What Gmail integrated CRM services are comparable to Insight.ly?
If you're looking to integrate your Gmail with a CRM there are basically two options to choose from. You can go with an in-Gmail approach where you have a CRM layer built inside your Gmail, or you can sync the two and still have your data in a standalone CRM outside of Gmail.
