★Has anyone integrated strategic service design with marketing as an approach?
I can't imagine trying to design services without integrating marketing. Any successful service design assignment has to be integrated with marketing. Service design means aligning the coming up with desired customer journey and aligning the business processes with that it enables the journey. Marketing obviously is an important part of these business processes, both for creating awareness in the discover stage of the journey but also strategic marketing to figure out what the value proposition is (or might be).    Embed Quote
