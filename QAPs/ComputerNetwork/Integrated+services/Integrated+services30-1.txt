★What is the best continuous integration & deployment server?
The community of real users on our site, IT Central Station, have a few interesting answers to that question. As you conduct your research on these tools, you may find it helpful to see what other users are saying. Here are a few helpful excerpts: Jenkins vs. TeamCity: "The biggest difference upon initial inspection is that TeamCity is far more focused on validating individual commits rather than certain types of tests. Jenkins’ front page presents information that is simply not useful in a non-linear development environment, where people are often working in vastly different directions. I generally find TeamCity a lot more intuitive than Jenkins out of the box."

One cannot say that any of them is clearly better than the other. It is often a matter of personal choice, type of the project or what we’re used to. For new projects, Travis is my favorite and I use it extensively."

Improvements to My Organization: Rather than send emails and tickets around we can hand out "buttons" to teams so they can do self-service for actions that used to involve manual effort from the Operations group."
