★We are looking for some good reliable integration services for connecting a couple of cloud apps to our enterprise yammer app. Is zapier a reliable integration service for this purpose?
Assuming the cloud apps you want to connect to your Yammer app are available on Zapier it is. Zapier is quite reliable and easy to use tool, so I won't be surprised if connecting your app to Yammer via Zapier won't take longer than asking a question on Quora :)    Embed Quote
