â˜…Computer Programming: Do larger screen sizes make programming easier? If so, why?
Yes. And a second monitor is even better. A lot of it comes down to screen real estate. The more space you have to work with, the you can arrange things you need t osee, the more you can look at ,etc. You have more room to put things side by side, either to compare them, or to use something as a reference. Its like a desk. Would you rather work on a project using a tiny 6x6 inch desk, or a full sized one? Technically, you can write just as much on the small one, but you have to shift the paper around, you will waste a lot of time with flipping papers around, you can't arrange things easily, you have no room to set up penciles, erasers, you don't have a space to put your dictionary and thesaurus, you have no elbow room, etc. Even if you have the same resolution on the screen, which means the same amount of data can be present, the larger screen will be easier to read. Programming often involves looking at walls of text, whether its code, the output of your program, api documentation, a data file, and its easier to read it without straining if it larger.
