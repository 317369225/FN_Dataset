★What is a coder's worst nightmare?
The scariest thing that ever happened to me was The Bug That Didn't Happen. I was developing front-end emulation terminals, and I was trying to figure out why the unit crashed at random times while typing.  It should have been obvious, but wasn't.   I was adding some test code when management showed up, asking how I was progressing.  I told them that I had yet to track down the bug, but was confident I would find it soon.  They wanted a demonstration of what was working so far, so I commented out the test-code output and reassembled the whole works.  I warned them that the bug was still there. Except it wasn't.  Everything worked fine, so management said "Ship it."  I had to explain to them that it wasn't actually working, but it only looked like it was.  They didn't care.  They were happy, the project was late (not my fault), and they wanted me to wrap it up.  I literally had minutes before production took the code and burned it into ROM. Turns out that commenting out the test code was the clue.  That shortened the code area and hid the problem.  When I put back the test code, it reappeared.  I added No-OPs until it worked again, and more until it failed.  That pointed the problem out for me.  Seems one of the other programmers on the project had used an indirect pointer for a jump instruction, with the address immediately after the jump.  This was a page-based machine, so when we added enough code, the address overflowed to the next page, and the jump went to whatever location was at the base of the page.
