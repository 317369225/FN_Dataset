â˜…Why do programmers love working at night?
I respectfully challenge your assumption. I don't love working at night. I vastly prefer to do programming work early in the morning. Why? I'm as well-rested as I'm going to be that day. Zero fatigue means I can focus all of my energy on the problem at hand. It's me, the code, and my ability to reason. There's nothing else in the world. My mind isn't cluttered with all the random cruft that comes up in a normal day. No frustrations with traffic, or meetings, or strange client requests, or picking up my dry-cleaning, or figuring out when I'll go to the gym. None of that. No phone calls, no meetings, no interruptions. No matter what else happens, I got shit done today. The first coffee of the day is the best. My kids are still sleeping. I'm occasionally rewarded with a beautiful sunrise (San Gabriel Valley, near Los Angeles):
