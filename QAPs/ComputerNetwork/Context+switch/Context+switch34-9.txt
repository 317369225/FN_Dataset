â˜…Computer Programming: Do larger screen sizes make programming easier? If so, why?
Definitely. Larger screens or more screens are always helpful. As a web developer, I need to switch between the following frequently: An IDE that shows source code A browser window to test an application Other browser windows/tabs to review reference materials A terminal window to deploy the application to the web server Another terminal window to watch logs that tell me what's going on with the application I may also need e-mail, text documents, and/or spreadsheetsThe more screen real-estate, the better! It means less pointing and clicking to switch between things. Fun story: I have a co-worker who has four screens (two for his Mac and two for his laptop) yet he still uses Mac's multi-screen feature to quickly switch between windows.
