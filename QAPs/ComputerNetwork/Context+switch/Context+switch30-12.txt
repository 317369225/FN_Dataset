â˜…Why do only IT/Software companies like Facebook, Google, Valve, Dropbox etc. see the importance in creating fun and the most comfortable working places?
The Facebook campus (formerly the Sun Microsystems campus) is a prime example of this trend; workers have ample opportunity to relax at work, with ample numbers of restaurants an cafeterias, dozens of bikes lining the roadway running past the multitude of buildings sporting modern architecture (which I've been told was exorbitantly expensive), and a variety of other perks for workers. The applications for these seemingly unnecessary perks are quite important to the function of the company, however. Facebook seeks to draw the brightest young minds from university (they recruit from Stanford, Harvard, MIT, and other schools of comparable merit) and use a friendly, open atmosphere to appeal to students in and coming out of university. The open atmosphere also attempts to encourage collaboration between workers; the company opts for desks lined with workers of various rank, and even Mark Zuckerberg's personal conference room is walled with floor-to-roof windows immediately next to the company's 'transportation hub' and the main road running through the complex. Facebook also provides a number of free food options (as well as a Peet's coffee, a staple for Palo Altans, though not quite as good as Starbuck's) in order to keep employees on-site. I can't speak about other tech companies (I know that Valve's offices offer "big pink cookies") however, from my limited experience visiting FBHQ, I can say that the extra perks are as pragmatic as they are extraordinary.
