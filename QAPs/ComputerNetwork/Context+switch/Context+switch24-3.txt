â˜…What are the advantages of Sparrow over the Gmail web app?
I have purchased Sparrow out of curiosity and I am still comparing it to my Gmail setup. Because I am new to Sparrow, I might be missing some key features but these are my observations so far: 1. Multiple accounts: I see no limitation on the Gmail side. I am using a Google Apps mail account so this might be different than standard Gmail. But I can check all of my "other" accounts", I can send from those accounts as well. When new mail is retrieved, filters put them into the right folders. 2. It seems like Sparrow handles facebook integration much better. 3. Gmail gives me a look at my calendar in the same main interface. Jury still out for me... Updated: - miss the integration of Gmail (calendar, easy access to docs, etc.) Update 1/15/2012: I have boiled down my use of Sparrow to two points: - search is inferior to gmail/google apps. I sense that sparrow must first retrieve the search from the cloud thereby slowing search down. Google is infinitely faster as as effective. - for day to day email correspondance, Sparrow now shines since the recent change in look/feel of gmail. I really do not like the minimalist look and feel more comfortable (now) with the sparrow look/feel.
