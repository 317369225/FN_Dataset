â˜…What does busy waiting mean?
Robert Love's answer (What does busy waiting mean?) is complete. So I will provide an analogy, you can consider this a "dumbed down" version of the same, just to help you understand. Imagine you went to a hospital. and there were some people ahead of you. You can either keep checking if the Doctor is free and there is no one ahead of you. Or, you can read a book, and the assistant calls out your name when it is your turn to meet the Doctor. The first one is busy waiting, the second is sleeping. Sleeping has extra overhead, there has to be an assistant to call out names. (S)He has to maintain a list of patients ordered by when they came in. But busy waiting is stressful, the patients have to keep doing some work to find out if the Doctor is free.
