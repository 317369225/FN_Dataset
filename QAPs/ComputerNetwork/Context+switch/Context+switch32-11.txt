â˜…Why do programmers love working at night?
For a lot of us older developers, the simple fact is that when we were in school the computers were faster at night, and we got used to it. They were faster at night because they were shared computers (mainframes or minicomputers) with timesharing operating systems, and they supported hundreds or thousands of users in a wide variety of tasks. The administration users logged off at the end of their work day, then the faculty users logged off, then the students doing regular homework and playing games, finally leaving the majority of the computer's cycles to the programmers.
