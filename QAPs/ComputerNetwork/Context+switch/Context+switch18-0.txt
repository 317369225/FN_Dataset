â˜…What strategies do you use to context switch out of performing an intensive cognitive task like programming or studying?There's been much written about getting into "flow" or a state in which one can do tough cognitive work more or less effortlessly. I have a tough time getting out of "flow." After a typical 8 hour day, I have a very tough time socializing and relaxing. What strategies do you use to "wind down" after a period of being in "flow"?
I usually never stop studying unless I get so tired that my brain automatically "shuts off" the "flow". Conclusion: I wake up, study for 9 hours straight, get too tired and go to sleep ridiculously early, wake up in the middle of the night (usually around 4 am), and study again till I fall asleep. Conclusion of conclusion? I don't have time to anything. Just to study. And it's awful cause I have a boyfriend and I need to give him attention to keep the relationship going. What can you do? While you're in the flow, do whatever you're doing till you think it's enough. Usually, if it's studying, 3 to 4 hours is more than enough. What you do next? Stop. Then, lie down. Then, breathe, relax, just empty your mind or day dream. Or, you can take a shower. I personally take the shower that is less comfortable for me, a cold one. It makes me think about how uncomfortable cold showers are, instead of thinking about the studying. Then, you go out and socialize like a normal human being :)
