â˜…Computer Programming: Do larger screen sizes make programming easier? If so, why?
Yes, totally! Some IDEs do not even fit (work well) in small screens with too small resolutions. (e.g. Toad) You want to see the context you are working in. That fits to text editing code where you want to see the current code structure you have to work on, IDEs where you have code in one window and other info (like class outline) in an other, maybe some documentation or other info like a file system location which changes when you test your code and of course: debug stuff! Some programming environments are also not perfectly designed.mso having more space is a solution here, too. And where is your open Browser with quora placed properly? ;) On the other hand you have to be a bit more careful what you do - you won't like to get stuck in a 1 window for work and 4 with distractions :-) Anyways it's simpler (and more healthy) to turn your head to see needed additional info of any type and not fumble on your OSses Window switch to find the damn window hiding somewhere in the stack of open programs you need right now. And I imagine this might change dramatically when the first really useable and high resolution VR solutions are being sold soon. Imagine this discussion being totally obsolete, as you do not even a sreeen. You might have a 360 degrees 3D workspace with all the needed stuff literally in range.
