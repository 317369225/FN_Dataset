â˜…What's the difference between a context switch, a process switch and a thread switch in Linux?
I'm no Linux guru, but... A process switch is a operating system scheduler change from one running program to another. This requires saving all of the state of the currently executing program, including its register state, associated kernel state, and all of its virtual memory configuration. All of the state of the new program is then loaded and execution continues. A thread switch shifts from one thread to another, within one program. Threads within a program are full execution contexts, but they share one address space with other threads in the program. A thread switch is cheaper than a full context switch since the memory management unit does not need to be reconfigured. A context switch can informally mean either a process or thread switch, depending on the context (pun intended).
