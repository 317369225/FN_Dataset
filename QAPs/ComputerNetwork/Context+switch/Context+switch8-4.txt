★Elon Musk: What does, "My context switching penalty is high and my process isolation is not what it used to be," mean?
Elon Musk has a lot of projects on his plate.  If his experience is anything like mine, then all his interests strategically overlap and fold together into a cohesive plan.  This makes it possible to keep it all in his head.  But there's a limit to the mind's ability to focus, and in my case at least, it doesn't improve with age.  After you reach that point, your choices are either to reduce scope to keep it all in view, deal with the headaches of task-switching while you continuously revisit every aspect of the plan in detail, or offload your vision to your trusted lieutenants and prepare to scale up again. I'm not Elon Musk, but I can relate to his statement.  From age 20 to 30, I was on fire.  From 30 to 40, I was managing people who were on fire.  After 40, I've got multiple teams of people working on projects, all of them on fire.  Problem is, my head is simply full. All of this work is important and engrossing, but switching between them can take hours, even days.  If I'm working on one project and someone asks me about another one, I may not even have the vocabulary available at that moment to discuss it.  It just depends on how deeply engrossed I am in the project.
