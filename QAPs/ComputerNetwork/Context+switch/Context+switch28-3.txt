★How does thread switching differ from process switching?In most systems it’s possible to switch between threads much faster than it is possible to switch between processes. How does thread versus process switching differ? What is the performance difference?
To add to Robert Love's answer: Since threads use the same virtualized memory space, they may write anywhere in this space. If a thread misbehaves, the process crashes along with all threads. Since processes on the other have their own virtual memory space, they cannot write to the memory of another process and a piece of misbehaving code will not affect other processes. For the sake of stability, the Apache httpd runs as a multi process server (each process runs a few threads anyways) rather than a multi threaded server. This causes the pre-forked apache to consume a large amount of memory, but can heal out of crashed processes.
