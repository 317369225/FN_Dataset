â˜…Operating Systems: What is the difference between preemptive scheduling, context switching and swapping in operating systems?
All the three come under process scheduling. Swapping is a procedure of shifting a process from main memory to secondary memory and back to main memory after some time to resume execution. Context switching is the process of restoring the state of a process so that it can either be swapped or put out for sometime and resume later. Preemptive scheduling is allowing a process of high priority to run by interpreting the already running processes by either swapping or context switching.
