â˜…Why do programmers love working at night?
I don't really know, but it's almost like I can only code at night sometimes. It must be to do with the lack of distractions, but even on days when no-one is distracting me during the day, I still find it easier to get going when it's dark. Maybe the night creates a sense of it just being you and the computer, so you can focus better.
