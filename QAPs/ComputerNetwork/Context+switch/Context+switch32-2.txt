â˜…Why do programmers love working at night?
To put it straight: We are like insects, attracted by bright light. At nights when the world is conquered by darkness, all the people sleeping with no one to disturb us. We get a sense of physical privacy. We get attracted by the bright light of the monitor and can easily get indulged, get lost, finding paths, solving puzzles, thinking in different direction, etc. staring at, actually living in, the 14 to 21 inch world of ours. To me it helps me on concentrating on one thing and one thing only. My monitor, my code, my bugs, my code features, the problem and its solution. Everything else seems less relevant and a feeling that those can wait to see the light of day.
