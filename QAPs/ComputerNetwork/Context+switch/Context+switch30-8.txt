â˜…Why do only IT/Software companies like Facebook, Google, Valve, Dropbox etc. see the importance in creating fun and the most comfortable working places?
We want to be cool! Seriously! That's pretty much it! We don't want to provide a job, we want to provide a lifestyle! Let me tell you what we want for our super-talented employees in two simple bullets: Workplace should feel like home - You get food, you can wash your clothes, you can walk your dog, you can sleep in the dorm, and you can play with your friends. Why go home early? Why worry about the small unfinished business at home? Just stay at work and finish your project because you are allowed to bring your home-business at work. Office friends are your friends for life - if an office can do that, there is no way employees are going to jump ship for a little pay-hike or a small-promotion because they work as a single unit. People love to spend time with their friends and work with them. Also, friends become really competitive with their projects as they have to discuss their projects at the water cooler and during their beer drinking sessions. And, yes, did I mention that we want to be a cool (I repeat! Cool) workplace. PS: One more thing, outside of the scope of this question, how much ever cool an office is, if it doesn't pay well, it is going to lose its employees.
