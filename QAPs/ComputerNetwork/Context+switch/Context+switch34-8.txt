â˜…Computer Programming: Do larger screen sizes make programming easier? If so, why?
My daily driver is a retina MacBook Pro and as much as I thought I would never be able to use a screen of lower resolution without getting a headache after this, I am always excited to get back to my dorm to plugin to my 37" HDMI TV to work on projects. Despite the significantly lower resolution and poor color reproduction, the boost in screen real estate does wonders for my productivity. As Tony Li mentioned, I can see more lines, have my bash prompt open, maybe some Finder windows, Safari with Stack Overflow and Quora open, and other source if I need them. Again, despite the awful resolution, its worth the trade off. Hopefully after this March 9th Apple event I'll get my hands on a 5k Thunderbolt display...
