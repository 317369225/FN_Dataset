★Why do 32-bit Linux kernels only recognize 3GB of RAM?The question is that 2³² = 4GB but systems only recognize 3GB.
Due to the 32bit architecture and the needs of virtual memory being allocated to some hardware (memory mapped devices like graphics cards) and BIOS, you will "lose" roughly  642mb. In a 32bit OS, the virtual address space is limited to the size of a 32 bit value. Memory mapped devices usually reside in the top of the physical address space leaving 3GB for RAM. There are ways around this. One way is to switch to a 64bit OS. This would allow for all of your RAM to be recognized. The other way is PAE (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phy...). There are ways to recompile the generic kernel and enable PAE but you would probably want to do more extensive research than what I can provide here.
