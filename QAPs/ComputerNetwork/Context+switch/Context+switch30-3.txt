★Why do only IT/Software companies like Facebook, Google, Valve, Dropbox etc. see the importance in creating fun and the most comfortable working places?
These "perks" are cheaper than compensating people in a traditional way.  Free lunches do not cost nearly as much as bumping someone's salary an extra 20K/year....  And it makes for much sexier press coverage which might help with recruiting.  The Verge is not going to write an article gushing about company X paying their engineers 20% more than competitors, but there is a glut of articles talking about these random "perks" like ping pong table in the lounge room.  The more random, the more free press.  Furthermore, a lot of the perks are just a way to keep their employees on premises longer.  Free laundry service, errand/concierge service, etc - all that stuff is designed to eliminate your excuses to actually leave the office and live your life fully.  Interestingly enough, people are questioning whether long hours actually increase productivity/output.  Most people have a limit as to how long they can concentrate and produce.  Massive hours often don't produce substantial extra output.
