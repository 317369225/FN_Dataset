★Why do programmers love working at night?
There are a lot of good answers here, and I'd agree with most of them, but for me personally I'd prefer to work as a programmer at night so that I can play in the day. Most people are excited to hit the clubs on a Friday night or grab a coffee with friends on a weeknight.  For me, these things have no draw.  I'm a hobbyist with many interests.  Most of these require frequent purchasing of parts, supplies, etc.  Unfortunately, many of the stores I would need to go to in order to supply myself so I can enjoy my hobbies close at 6pm.  If I'm working 9-5, my hobbies are suffering hideously. Also, there is nothing more disheartening to me than walking out of the office at the end of a 9-5, indoor, cubicle-bound shift and seeing the sun dipping low in the sky and realizing... "Oh, it was a beautiful day today.  And I missed it."
