â˜…Why do only IT/Software companies like Facebook, Google, Valve, Dropbox etc. see the importance in creating fun and the most comfortable working places?
I believe that the CEO's of such companies understand the fact that people are 50% more productive when they are happy at their workplaces. This also attracts new employees as nobody wants to work in a stressed environment... Happy employees is the key to a successful company.
