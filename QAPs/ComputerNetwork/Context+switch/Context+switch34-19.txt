â˜…Computer Programming: Do larger screen sizes make programming easier? If so, why?
Actually the size of contents are depend on the resolution of screen not the Size of Screen.......so if you try with same screen size with different resolution then you got original idea.......... if you want larger screen then it only allow more content with higher resolution......and also helps to check more content of code in same time....... therefore bigger screen give you more space to check your bigger bunch of content.......
