â˜…How is the time taken to perform a context switch between processes in an OS measured?
One fellow has written some code which measures the amount of time it takes to perform a context switch by performing as many thread switches as possible in a second. His code can be seen here: Context Switch Benchmark (POSIX, C++) If you want to go deep into context switches, here's some resource which I found very useful: How long does it take to make a context switch? The code which is quoted above gives you only a general idea of the time it can take for a context switch between two application threads. Hope you do know that you compromise a very small amount of accuracy as it does take some time to lock and unlock a mutex and increment a variable in the thread.
