â˜…What is context switching?Explain.
It depends on the context (ba-dum). Context is the information I need to hand to perform a task. In a psychology context, imagine that I have three columns. In the columns I have to write the numbers 1-26, the letters A-Z and the roman numerals from I to XXVI. If I perform each task completely before switching to the next then I switch context 3 times and this is a relatively straight forward problem. If I have to write one entry in each column, then when I get to the number column, I have to look to see which was the last number I wrote, remember the next number in the sequence and then write it. Then I have to repeat the process for the alphabet and Roman numerals.It is much less efficient to repeatedly switch context and, if the sequences are unfamiliar, context switching can take a significant amount of time. In a computer system, context switching is about saving application state when it has been interrupted so that it can be resumed at a later date. A visible analog of this is when a computer comes out of hibernation; because loading the state of the computer from disk takes time, a screenshot of the desktop is shown (usually grayed out) to give the impression that the computer has woken up and is doing something faster. The time between restoring power and being able to interact with the system is the context switching time
