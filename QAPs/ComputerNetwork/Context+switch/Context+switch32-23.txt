★Why do programmers love working at night?
This is a great question.  I sometimes go a full day without writing a line of production code until something clicks and this usually happens at night for some reason.  I will then work through the night until the kids get up and then I can hopefully pick things back up again. I have no idea why this happens but in the last 25 years of writing code at least once a week I have worked through the night because that's just when the 'click' happens. I am sure there is a great explanation in this queue of why that happens, I'm glad I'm not alone. Sidenote:  I was taught C by a Microsoft employee who taught classes on the side.  His famous line was 'go check the laundry'.  When he was stuck on a function he got up from his chair, went downstairs, and either started or folded a load of laundry.  Worked every time. EDIT:  Don't forget about Occam's Razor....developers work late at night because deadlines are early in the morning.  ;-)
