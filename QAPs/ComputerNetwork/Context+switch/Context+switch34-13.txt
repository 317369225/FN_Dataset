â˜…Computer Programming: Do larger screen sizes make programming easier? If so, why?
Dual screens, or trio. But don't pick any model that is larger than 24 inches. I have them and I feel they become overwhelming - not really improve any productivity. You have to look "around" to see what is going on and make it hard to focus on the work. However, if you're like me that enjoy watching TV while casually programming, you will find good use case with larger size of screens ;)
