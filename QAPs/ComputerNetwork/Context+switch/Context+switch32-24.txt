â˜…Why do programmers love working at night?
All humans have a limited working memory of between 3 - 7 items. Programmers tend to veer towards the top end which is helpful to understand complicated algorithms but to take advantage you don't want colleagues or phone calls or your family taking up slots in that memory when not necessary. The longer you can maintain that clear thinking the more likely you are to have an aha moment, which is more likely at night. For the same reason you rarely see a function with more than 7 arguments. Better to pass the arguments in a structure/record which only takes one slot conceptually in your brain. The benefit of working late only lasts for a few nights otherwise fatigue reduces the very ability you are trying to promote. Because neurons work on thresholds, not boolean logic, it is a good idea to put clear water between different variables/arguments by given them meaningful names instead of short or single character names. As a compromise you can omit the vowels without introducing too much ambiguity.
