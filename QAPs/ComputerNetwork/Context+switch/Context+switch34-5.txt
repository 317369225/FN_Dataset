★Computer Programming: Do larger screen sizes make programming easier? If so, why?
Yes,  particularly when you're talking about an increased resolution as well. The more 'real estate', the better. More space allows: Viewing more of your code at once; Splitting your IDE to edit multiple source files at once; Have reference documentation viewable; Have debug/preview windows viewable Multiple monitors is a great thing too. Preferably multiple large, high-resolution monitors. Edit: There's going to be a point where a monitor is too large to be useful. I'm not sure what that size is, but I'm certainly not going to be coding with a 60" TV on my desk.
