★Computer Programming: Do larger screen sizes make programming easier? If so, why?
I agree with the previous answers of using larger screens and at least two if possible to optimize your working environment and avoid swapping between applications unnecessarily.  I don't use it for higher font sizes since my eyesight is still great (despite the fact that I've been starting at monitors similarly to the other responders since 1987), I use it for the efficiency of dragging multiple applications into windows on my monitors in a manner that permits me to review code, documents, browsers and other applications without swapping continuously as I would with one monitor. After working with at least three screens at work over the last few years and at least two on my personal desktops, I'm spoiled and can't wait to return to my normal hardware configuration after being forced to use one screen when traveling with my notebook (although it's a high-end notebook with touch capabilities and a high-resolution screen).  Give it a shot, and I guarantee you'll never want to switch back to using one monitor.
