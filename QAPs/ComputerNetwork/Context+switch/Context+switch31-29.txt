â˜…What is a coder's worst nightmare?
Spending too much time in corporate/line-of-business development or on borked legacy code instead of doing R&D, turning into an idiot, and being both unqualified for real technology jobs (due to low-quality experience) and disliked by the corporate world (due to age) in two decades.
