★Why do only IT/Software companies like Facebook, Google, Valve, Dropbox etc. see the importance in creating fun and the most comfortable working places?
I work for a marketing analytics company where the culture / environment is very much like that described in the question.  About half the company comes from a Fortune 500 management background.  That half (myself included) made a conscious choice to do something different to encourage productivity and innovation and, just maybe, have some fun at work.
