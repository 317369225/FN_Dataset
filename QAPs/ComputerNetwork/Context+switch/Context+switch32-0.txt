â˜…Why do programmers love working at night?
Programming is one of those things that takes a while to context-switch into. That means it's most efficient to do a large chunk of work at once, interruption-free. The easiest way to get interruption-free time is at night. I don't think that most programmers consciously decide to stay up late at night for this reason; it just ends up being the easiest thing to do. For example, suppose it's midnight and I've found that I'm in "the zone": deeply involved in a task for my programming project. Maybe I spent all day trying to get there. Do I want to go to sleep? No, I want to make use of this opportunity, so I keep working until I get too tired to continue. I also really enjoy working in the morning, as it's often possible to get a stretch of uninterrupted time here, too. However, since it's much easier to become late-shifted than early-shifted, this is less practical for me.
