★Why are system calls expensive in operating systems?
Here is my take on this and lets look at the very fundamental side of system call. A system call is a call into kernel code, typically performed by executing an interrupt ( the context switching ). a program execution follow as below +----------------+ |                  | |                  | |                  | |                  | |                  | User Space Execution | sys_call     |------ Jump to Kernel, { Go and execute in kernel and come back } |                  | User Space Execution continues until next syscall |                  | |                  | |                  | |                  | +----------------+                                                          Kernel code                                                                                     +-----------------+                                                                                      |                  |                                                                                        |                  |                                                                                      |do_sys_call |                                                                                      |       .          |                                                                                      |       .          |                                                                                      |       .          |                                                                                      |       .          |                                                                                      |     end                                          return to user space                  |  do_sys_call                                                                                      |                  |                                                                                      |                  |                                                                                     +-----------------+                                                                    There seems no problem with this flow at all however except when we consider below things A System call is a service and because service is provided in the kernel, a direct call cannot be performed. In order to get the services from kernel you must use a process of crossing the user-space/kernel boundary This differs based on the particular architecture. for example in i386 architectures this generates a software interrupt 0x80 , which results in execution of syscall handler, which upon a few simple tests, the actual system call is invoked using the system_call_table and sys_call index. ( and this means its not a direct jump like normal library calls ) upon return from the system call, syscall_exit is eventually reached, and a call to resume_userspace transitions back to user-space (which again is a bit of a task) Now the question, is the system call expensive ? source : Kernel command using Linux system calls
