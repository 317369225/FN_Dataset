â˜…Why do programmers love working at night?
As a programmer, I tried to work during the day but it has never worked. There are some possible explanations why we tend to code better at night: First as everyone has pointed out, it is the quietness of the environment during the night. It is possible that people will lose more than 80% of concentration under a noisy environment. Secondly during the long hours at night it is most likely that one may feel one will be interrupted less. This is more of a psychological effect, because the anxiety of not having enough uninterrupted concentration time on the code is much more damaging than it seems. Then as some may have said, it is the half sleep half awake mental status at late night that helps to bring up some high functioning imaginations in the subconscious mind. Programming is as demanding on the rational mind as on the imaginative mind.
