★Why do programmers love working at night?
The semi-joke answer with, at this time, 2.7k upvotes (including mine) is the best answer.  (Colin Song wrote "To ease the shame of nothing accomplished in the daytime.") It is written in the classic style of a Ha Ha Only Serious--it is a joke with a lot of truth in it and a sarcasm frosting on top. A more detailed answer might go something like: many coders, while at their dayjob, attempt to code but get distracted by... *everything*.  Everything on the Internet and every single thing their co-workers are doing. However, late at night, possibly at home, all the normal people are asleep and now the coder can focus and get work done.  Also the deadline is probably tomorrow morning at 8AM so there's that added incentive to really get the juices flowing. I also hypothesize there might be some ancient human evolution-y thing going on here.  Something like--daytime having been the time for socializing and night time (at least once there were fires or candles) having been the time for individual, quieter, more contemplative work. But that last part is just a guess.  You should consider the sarcastic answer to be the complete answer and all this I wrote is just annotation and speculation. -- Furry cows moo and decompress.
