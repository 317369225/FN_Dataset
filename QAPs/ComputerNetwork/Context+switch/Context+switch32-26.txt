â˜…Why do programmers love working at night?
Distractions are sleeping too. The server has more resources available to run your program (University), and the weak have gone to sleep. Chances are you got used to working at night because you had to meet deadlines, and 24 hours in a day seemed a little few. You got drawn into working late again, because you said " maybe I'll try this and see what happens " in the afternoon. You are not a morning person.
