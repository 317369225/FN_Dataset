â˜…Why do programmers love working at night?
Perhaps it's just that they like sleeping in late in the morning and then consequences ensue. Sure, they say that the early bird gets the worm, but programmers are chasing something more ethereal, and new to human experience, than worms, or even money. I think it's well established that the dreams that happen during sleeping are part of a process where the brain reconciles the events of the day before and establishes new understanding and intuition. I think the best way to be in contact with that process is to lay around a bit in the morning while half asleep. An hour. Two weeks ago I woke up with a complete memory of a song (I feel fine - Beatles). I could quote every line, and the melody, all that day. I checked my playlist and I don't own that song. It was a memory from long ago but it was super clear. Two days ago I had a sudden vision of how git works. I didn't ever use git much before my new job 3 months ago (it was subversion, or others) so I've been going through the motions for 3 months now. I woke up, read a couple of chapters and now I'm a git ninja. My experience is that the best way to make wild progress is to work on a problem up to the very end of the day and to then go directly to sleep. No people. No tv. In the morning, while in the twilight of waking, the problems of yesterday present themselves with solutions. This can lead to ever increasing lateness, or 'being a vampire', or 'living on Tokyo time' much to the chagrin of loved ones and family. I would not say that programmers love it so much, but more like they have discovered it and they can get away with it.
