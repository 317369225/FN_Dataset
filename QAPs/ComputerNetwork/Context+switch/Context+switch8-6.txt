★Elon Musk: What does, "My context switching penalty is high and my process isolation is not what it used to be," mean?
You have to realize that good engineers have memorized (10's of?) thousands of formulas, constants, and words particular to their field. Their mind are literally full to the brim with information. If you tell one you have been "under a lot of stress lately",they are probably thinking of tension/compression/shear/bending moment or torsion. (Hence the "context switching"  problem).  As for process isolation; someone who constantly thinks up imaginative solutions to problems, is constantly applying outside input to these problems. Very easy to get distracted when having a bath you forget about bathing - jump up and yell "Eureka i've found it!" Then go running naked into the streets to tell everyone....(True story).!
