â˜…What is a coder's worst nightmare?
Random, non- replicable bugs. I was once a VAX operator in an academic computing centre. Some students were complaining that their network programs were delivering spurious results, not all the time and it could not be replicated. Eventually, we suspected the transport layer and narrowed the problems down to around 3:00pm. With some analysis tools and a bit of lateral thinking, we discovered that a large bus entering and leaving the main gate was compressing a network cable, improperly buried beneath the driveway. This was not breaking the link, but was briefly corrupting a few data packets.
