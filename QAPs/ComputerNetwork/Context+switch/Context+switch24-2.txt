★What are the advantages of Sparrow over the Gmail web app?
The age old Application vs. Web experience.  Sparrow is an application and of course Gmail is a web experience. I have used Sparrow and have come to appreciate a perhaps more modern approach to email.   The buzz about Sparrow is of course the "Twitter" like user interface.  It creates panels that are email summaries that feel very Twitter like. It is an interesting way to rediscover email.  At this point i sort of like it.  It is however not my primary way to deal with email at this point.  I do like the quick reply function, it feels a lot like a Tweet and in some ways gives a new feel to email.  Because it is a application the speed and responsiveness is great.  The old school email power user will likely not have any love for this product because it is not really trying to be a traditional email client.  It has some limits on what it can do and is a work in progress. I can imagine nothing stopping the wizards at Google from duplicating many of the cosmetic features of Sparrow, or buying them.  But it may not have the same speed and responsiveness.
