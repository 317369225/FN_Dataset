â˜…What is a coder's worst nightmare?
No matter how many times this happens ... You read a discussion on how to do 'X'. It is discussed by a bunch of people you have to prove something to. You know how to do 'X'. You know the logic, the algorithm, the data structures, the what nots. It is a question of putting fingers to keys. What better way to show your mettle than to whip up code for 'X'! You need maybe 1-2 hours to type, compile and test. That can be done in the middle of these other things you are doing. You send that email. "Hey! I got 'X'. Give me a few hours and I'l have it ready." More than 1-2 hours later, everything is typed up and compiled. You run it. It doesn't work. Hah! Nothing works first time. 3-4 hours later it is done. Just before it sending it out you change the parameter and run it one last time. It fails. It is now 4 in the morning. The lovemaking thing won't even compile. You know it is simple. It was simple. Then you send that email. "Yo! I have some other urgent work. I will get to 'X' by tomorrow afternoon" It is day 2. You have pushed everything else you were doing in the background. It hadn't worked the first time. That was a fluke due to uninitialized variables being zero by default. End of week. You have a beard reaching your knees - gender does not matter. You code over the weekend. You walk with your hands held over an imaginary keyboard. You are a nervous wreck. You can only bark at people, not talk. Then you send that email. "This is taking a little bit longer than expected. If it is urgent I can get it done in a few hours. I am expecting it is not. Priorities, priorities :) " Week 2. You are done. For. In more sense than one. The mistake was the algorithm choice. Or the language choice. Or you really didn't understand 'X'. Overconfidence. Lack of preparation. Underestimation. Furious activity instead of groking. My favorite worst nightmare. It happens periodically. Then I learn the lesson. Then I forget.
