â˜…What does busy waiting mean?
Busy waiting means a process simply spins, (does nothing but continue to test its entry condition) while it is waiting to enter its critical section. This continues to use (waste) CPU cycles, which is inefficient. Additionally, if a low priority process is in its critical section, and a high priority process goes into busy waiting, it may never get to its critical section, on a single CPU; busy waiting becomes a circular issue, so blocking would make more sense, as it only requires a single call to the OS to change state to Ready/Run, once it is notified that blocking process is complete. For blocking solutions, we would need to be careful because there is a chance that an incremental counter might be corrupted; processes can go into a sleep state and never awake. Additionally, while busy waiting may waste cycles on a single processor, blocking may waste cycles on a multiprocessor.
