â˜…What is a coder's worst nightmare?
Imagine spending years of your life and billions of dollars in funding to develop something--a rocket. It's the big day and you're ready to go. The rocket's ready to go. The ignition sequence starts. A short while later, the rocket lifts off. You watch your screen with metered glee...have you suceeded? Is your creation bound for space? You stare at the timer as it ticks through the numbers. T+34 seconds...T+35...T+36... T+37...self-destruct. You watch as the $200 million Ariane 5 explodes. You wonder what went wrong...was it an engineering problem? Maybe a loose panel? A broken nozzle? Nope... Integer overflow. The software tried to convert a 64-bit floating point integer to a 16-bit signed integer, but the number was too big. Oops.
