â˜…Why do programmers love working at night?
Because programmers are driven. One more bug to solve. One more feature to add. The issue at hand becomes all; driving you forward. You aren't aware of your colleagues leaving. The lights dimming. The security guard making his/her rounds. Just, finding and fixing that last damn piece of coding so you can call it a night.
