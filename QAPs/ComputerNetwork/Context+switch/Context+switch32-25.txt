â˜…Why do programmers love working at night?
You (or at least me) have to be in a distraction free environment for a while before entering the "zone", and once you are in it, it would be a shame to waste it, so you continue for a while. And this generally only happens once people stop calling on you, which would be in the evening. Same thing for gaming and some administrative work.
