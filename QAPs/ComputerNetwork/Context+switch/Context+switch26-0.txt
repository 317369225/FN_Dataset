â˜…When switching contexts, people tend to drop information from their working memory. Is this related to the "attention splitting effect"?
That depends on what you call 'switching contexts'. If you identify two separate visual fixations in a diagram with two contexts, then the connection with split attention is tautological. In general, it is possible to postulate that both context switching and spatial attention switching require repopulating working memory. If we assume a constant multiplicative error associated with every memory recall event, this would entail greater difficulty in working with tasks that involve multiple visuo-spatial fixations as well as imperfect information preservation across context switches, as you require. Several information processing models of working memory are compatible with such an assumption. See, for a recent example "Human memory search as a random walk in a semantic network" by Abbott, Austerweil & Griffiths, NIPS 2012.
