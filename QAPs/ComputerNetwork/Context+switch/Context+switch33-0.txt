★What is sleep sort?
Sleep sort is a joke sorting algorithm that became popular on the 4chan board /prog/ [1]. The pseudocode for sleep sort is: 1
2
3
4

 procedure printNumber(n)     sleep n seconds     print n end for arg in args     run printNumber(arg) in background end wait for all processes to finish Ha-ha! Hilarious. In other words, what it does is that sleep sort spawns off one process for each argument. Each process waits for n seconds, then prints out n, meaning it takes 1 second to print out "1", 2 seconds to print out "2", 100 seconds to print out "100". This means that for the most part, the numbers are printed out in the order of their size, thus "sorting" the arguments. The complexity of this algorithm in a perfect world is O(max(args)), as it will take max(args) seconds to print out the biggest arg. In reality, the complexity is O(n^2 + max(args)), because maintaining multiple background processes relies on the operating system to manage the context switching and prioritization of the processes, and so the algorithm basically outsources the actual sorting to the kernel. Also note that there are no guarantees that the output of the sort is actually correct, a feature that most other sorting algorithms don't have. [1] http://dis.4chan.org/read/prog/1...
