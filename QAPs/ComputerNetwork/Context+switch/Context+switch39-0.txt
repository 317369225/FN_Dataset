â˜…What kind of projects will get me a job at Google?
This is extremely difficult to answer. I was contacted by a Google sourcer after they found me on LinkedIn and found my blog. I mainly blog about low-level stuff such as how context switching works, how tail call optimisation works and how compilers create binaries. This is by no means the only way to do it, though. I would wholeheartedly recommend you work on things you enjoy and don't think about whether that will land you your dream job. If you work hard enough towards things you love, things should fall into place on their own :)
