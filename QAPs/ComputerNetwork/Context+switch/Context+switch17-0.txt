★What are some techniques to reduce the amount of time it takes to context switch (for humans)?While context switching sucks, it's pretty much a part of life. What are some techniques you use to get back into flow after it's been interrupted, especially for cognition intensive tasks like programming?
Switch tasking is certainly a productivity hog.  While the most effective strategy is to avoid it all together, as you note, that is not always possible.  If you get interrupted while in deep concentration: -- pause - don't immediately respond to the interruption -- note - jot a note on your current frame of mind, point you are in your thinking, the next step you were about to take, etc, -- manage the interruption - the shorter the interruption the better chances you have of getting quickly back into focus.
