â˜…What kind of projects will get me a job at Google?
This is a slightly askew definition of "project", but: Start your own business. It doesn't have to be software-related, or even technical. Google obviously likes people who show technical ability, but they also look for entrepreneurs, and I can attest that they've reached out to Googlers who previously ran their own businesses completely unrelated to technology and software/hardware, and saw that experience and determination favorably.
