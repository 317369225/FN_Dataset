★How different is a futex from mutex - conceptually and also implementation wise?I got to know that futex (fast userspace mutex) was essentially a user-mode implementation of the mutex. But I couldn't make much sense of it from the man-page results that popped up when I was looking into this. What are the design decisions that encourage using one over the other?
A futex is not a mutex.  It's a kernel facility the enables fast implementations of mutex in userspace.   By fast we mean that for the uncontended usecase, there will be no context switching to the kernel.  It's just a building block.  Read "man 7 futex" for more information.
