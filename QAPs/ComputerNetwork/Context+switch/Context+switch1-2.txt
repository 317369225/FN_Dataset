★How long does a context switch take?For a process context switch?  thread context switch? Exact numbers probably vary; cost relative to cache miss, memory reference, and so on is more interesting! This is a follow-up question to What are the numbers that every computer engineer should know, according to Jeff Dean?.
The real overhead may not be in context switch itself, but the things after context switch, especially for process. under x86, if page global directory is switched out(CR3 and TLB flushed with new process's VM), and caches also, so it takes really long time for new process to "warm up" TLB, level 1,2 caches... that will make your program run slower than before, but that is not the directly consequence of context switch
