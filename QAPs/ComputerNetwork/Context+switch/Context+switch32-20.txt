â˜…Why do programmers love working at night?
My best code has been written between 6 am and 9 am at home while everybody is asleep. I don't like coding at night. I prefer the early morning. To be honest, I used to code at night (when I was younger). It was good. I could concentrate well enough maybe because I wanted to finish as quickly as possible so I would go to bed. Nowadays, I don't do that. I prefer going to sleep early and waking up early to code.
