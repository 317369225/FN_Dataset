â˜…Computer Programming: Do larger screen sizes make programming easier? If so, why?
I bought a 39" 4k monitor. I'll never go back. It's a Seiki. Dirt cheap at $350. Pixel resolution and clarity is awesome. It's cheap, because it's sold as a TV, but is not a good TV at all. Looks terrible if you drive it with a resolution lower than 4k. Colors a bit off. 30hz (it's billed as 120hz, but that's only for lower resolutions).
