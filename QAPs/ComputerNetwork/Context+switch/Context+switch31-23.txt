★What is a coder's worst nightmare?
I call them Heisenbugs.  They're only visible when you aren't looking at them (ie, they don't show up in debug mode, or outside production workloads, or require a complex combination of environmental issues to manifest themselves). I've had a few over the years and they required far more work to set up environments to find them than actually fixing them once they were found - they're  typically weird race conditions, often involving races between multiple apps, sometimes requiring timing issues caused by stuff that has nothing to do with the app other than introducing delay - or sometimes speeding something up. One of my favorites of this sort happened when we upgraded a server and it turned out that one of the apps used a time call to do a task.  The new, fast server ran the task fast enough that the time call sometimes returned the same value as the task finished within one clock tick, messing up the app's internal state.  That one took a long time to find, particularly since it was the opposite of many Heisenbugs: it only came out at night :) (ie, when the system _wasn't_ under load)
