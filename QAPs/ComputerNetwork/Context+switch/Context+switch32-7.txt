★Why do programmers love working at night?
For older programmers like me, it dates back to college when we had  servers that everyone in a class shared, but that weren't quite powerful enough to support everyone using them at the same time.  When these machines (usually Vax 700 series machines) were busy, they would be dozens of times slower than they'd be if they were lightly loaded.  So, you'd wait until late at night so you could test your project and get vastly more code-compile-run-debug cycles in than you could during the day when everyone else was banging on the system.  And the machine may be lightly loaded enough that you could get in some rogue while waiting for your run to finish :) You combine this with natural college student night-owl tendencies, and you end up becoming a life-long "night person". I still do most of my best programming either early in the morning or late at night.  No distractions or silly emails also helps.
