â˜…What is the difference between a process and a thread?
U may have heard process is heavy weight . actually when process is created Os creates a PCB (process control block) which includes may things like process id ,state registers ,counter ,list of resources, list of open files ,memory management info n all . This information is necessary for scheduling of processes by Os (for each process to get proper time on CPU) . Also sharing of resources between process requires a lot of overhead(due to security provided by Os) .while threads are part of process that run independent without much overhead . Each process have one thread while each process can create multiple thread for execution .Interthread communication is each (it is responsibility of programmer to see security). On multicore processor each thread can actually run simultaneously on each core of processor
