â˜…Why do programmers love working at night?
I agree with Alok's answer, but there was an actual study about why programmers program better late at night. It turns out that late at night/really early in the morning (3AM), the brain gets tired enough that it can only focus on one task, not on multiple. So, it chooses to focus on programming, and not reading the news, or checking Facebook. It could also help that a lot of news websites, and Facebook news feeds are not updated late at night EDIT: Requested to put link to that study Read about "The Sleepy Brain" and "Ballmer's Peak" Why Programmers Work At Night - Programming - Nairaland Why Programmers Work At Night Why programmers work at night
