â˜…How many context switches are there between a HTTP server receiving a request and when it sends out the response?This is a follow-up question to How long does a context switch take?.
There are close to 5-6 context switches between a HTTP request and a response, Since the request and response are IO based, receiving the request, processing the request, reading relevant data and sending the response all will have a context switch. Please read Scalable Internet Architectures by Theo Schlossnagle. He gives a fairly clear explanation for the number of context switches and its impact.
