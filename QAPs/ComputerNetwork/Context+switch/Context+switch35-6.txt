★Why do 32-bit Linux kernels only recognize 3GB of RAM?The question is that 2³² = 4GB but systems only recognize 3GB.
I think your answers is more related to Physical memory addressing instead of virtual memory. Yes, in many SOCs 32bit Linux kernel can only recognize 3GB of RAM. Now why is the question here (I am assuming no IOMMU related stuff here) ??? Thats because: SOCs doesn't just have RAM as the only addressable device but there are other peripheral device addresses as well. Means out of 4GB which a 32 bit arch can address, generally <1GB of addresses are peripheral addresses(generally there registers addresses). So, remaining >=1G to 4GB address which is 3GB space in total can be only addressed by CPU as RAM.
