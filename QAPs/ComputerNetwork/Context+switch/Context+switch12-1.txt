â˜…Operating Systems: What is the difference between preemptive scheduling, context switching and swapping in operating systems?
From the question, I believe, you're taking an OS class at college level. So, here it goes. Preemptive scheduling: To understand what it is, you should know the meaning of preemption. Preemption means ceasing of opportunity before someone else can. In the context of operating system process scheduling, this means stopping a process from taking CPU execution time and taking that time yourself. More specifically, it's a technique which allows the operating system scheduler to stop a process temporarily and allocate the CPU resources to another one. There is another kind of non-preemptive scheduling in which the OS has to wait for one process to finish before it can allocate the CPU resources to another process. Context switching: An operating system needs to keep switching between several process to maintain the "multiprocessing" property. However, before you switch from one process to another, it is a good idea to save the state and essential information about the process you are switching (called "context") away from so that you can come back to it later when you need to. This technique of saving context and then using it to restore the process operation is known as context switching. Swapping: Swapping is simply the process of moving of data from main memory (RAM) to hard disk or any alternate memory resource since you cannot always keep everything in RAM (the size is limited).
