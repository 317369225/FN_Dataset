â˜…Why do only IT/Software companies like Facebook, Google, Valve, Dropbox etc. see the importance in creating fun and the most comfortable working places?
When designing workplaces for more "traditional" organizations, the software industry is frequently a model for conversation about a more social workplace. However, a very frequent response is, "We are not Google," rejecting the notion of a workplace that does not look like work is being done there. Indeed, given the great interruption of the Great Recession, most of what characterizes the workplace of Silicon Valley was perceived as superficial in the heartlands of other industries. But I think a change is coming. Among the more open of those traditional organizations are the ones who have begun to realize that "work looks different, now." The increasing complexity of products and increasingly networked business contexts seem to drive a move from the fungibility of people that Vinod Khare mentions to teams of collaborative specialists. These are people who are not processing in a cubicle but engaging with others, so the workplace naturally becomes more open and "social." The scale of the organization is also becoming a driver of a more social and nurturing workplace. We hear the phrase, "people are working at both ends of the clock," to characterize global organizations and their emerging "flexible" work modes. They are coming to recognize the need for a workplace that provides food, recreation and services to support the essential work patterns of global product development. I'm optimistic in other words. The mobility of our technology, the characteristics of the next generations, the reduction in control by middle management, the innovation imperative, leadership models and so many other factors will mean that the workplace of the near future will not look at all like those in either Silicon Valley or the Rust Belt do today.
