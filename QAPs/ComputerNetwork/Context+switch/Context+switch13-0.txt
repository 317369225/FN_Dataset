★What's a good way to get into the zone when dealing with small tasks, i.e. frequent context switches?
I prefer to do some planning in advance to see what tasks can be completed very quickly (less than 60 seconds) and try to order the list from smallest the largest.  Sorting your list this way will allow you to knock out a bunch of tasks in a very short amount of time, so that when you switch to the longer tasks, it will be easier to focus on them without having to worry about that little thing that will only take a minute or so. Each switch costs you time, so if you can swap to tasks that don't require a lot of focus, you'll minimize the time you lose.
