â˜…Computer Programming: Do larger screen sizes make programming easier? If so, why?
Large screens allow you to see more code and project structure inside the IDE. The aspect ratio of the screen matters too. I prefer something squarer so that I can see some lines of code at once. Too bad most new screens are "wide."
