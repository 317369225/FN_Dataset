What are best practices to A. avoid context switching B. If it cannot be avoided, how can it be done effectively?
In my management role, my top priority is to remove roadblocks for my team and within the organization. Context switching is common, frequent, and welcome. Having said that, I do block out time for other functions, but that time isn't sacred - people come first. Establishing team norms for interaction can reduce interruptions, I just keep in mind that each interruption is an opportunity to improve the relationship, and great relationships are essential to effectiveness.
