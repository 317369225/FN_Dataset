â˜…Computer Programming: Do larger screen sizes make programming easier? If so, why?
Gotta be careful with this one! Your screen's size, does not equate to space! Consider the following: Resolution = the size of a desk. Display size = how close you are to that desk. For instance, a 13" retina display has more "room" to contain your programs and interface than a 56" 1080p TV! But unless you are holding the retina very close to your face, that won't matter, because everything will appear too small to you unless you have exceptional vision. The answer is a large form display with a high/dense resolution. The new 4k screens are a perfect example. You will notice on such screens that the real estate hogging elements of an application (window bars and borders, tabs, menus) are significantly smaller on a high density display. You could very easily run two web browsers side by side and compare two web pages with clarity. Or look at hundreds of lines of readable code at once. Or discern dozens of image thumbnails.
