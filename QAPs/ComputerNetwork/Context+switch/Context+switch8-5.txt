â˜…Elon Musk: What does, "My context switching penalty is high and my process isolation is not what it used to be," mean?
Hehe. I wondered that, too. It's in high level thinker speak that has lots of meaning in few words. My translation: Because Elon has to switch between so many different things to meet his responsibilities and make progress towards his goals, he: Has to load up a new context each time he switches to a new, different task or starts a conversation. This means he isn't able to focus in depth on a project and "single handle." So it's like trying to make dinner and write a report at the same time. You can do it, but single handling is generally more efficient than multi tasking and allows you to focus and go deeper on one specific task or project ("process isolation"). Multi tasking is also cognitively draining, in that you have to remember many things ("my head is full"). In terms of memory, it's probably like having to know the answers to multiple exams, but all the time. Or loaning and reading multiple library books at different times, and having to know when each of them is due. Practically, that's not easy to do. So Elon doesn't really have the opportunity to focus on one or few things as much as he might if he was just, say, CEO of one company, and he's basically saying there are costs that come with that. There are advantages, too. I'm sure Tesla benefits from his understanding of and connections in the aerospace industry and associated knowledge. And it allows him to do interesting things, like the standalone battery pack for houses which seems like it'll be a collaboration between Tesla and Solar City.
