★Elon Musk: What does, "My context switching penalty is high and my process isolation is not what it used to be," mean?
He is saying he can't multitask as well as he used to be able to.  If you are working on one task for a day, and then the next day pick up where you left off on a different task, you will forget a little about what you were doing and have a little time penalty to review what you were working on.  That little time penalty is growing for him. Regarding the isolation, he is likely having more cases where he is dealing with SpaceX let's say, and he asks someone how task X is going, and then remembers task X was actually something for Tesla. Few people ever try to keep so many major companies/initiatives going as he is, and likely he will need to start delegating more.  But it is probably very hard for him to let go.  For some, no matter how much they trust their lieutenants, they still trust themselves more.
