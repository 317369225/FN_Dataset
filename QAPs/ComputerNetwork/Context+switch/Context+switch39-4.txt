â˜…What kind of projects will get me a job at Google?
Projects probably won't get you a job at Google. They may make some recruiter notice you, but you can just apply online at Google Careers and you will get into the same hiring pipeline as everyone else, including internal referrals. In the end, only what you do at the interviews counts. Source: currently working at Google
