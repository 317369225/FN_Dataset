★Elon Musk: What does, "My context switching penalty is high and my process isolation is not what it used to be," mean?
Elon Musk, said increasingly... "My context switching penalty is high and my process isolation is not what it used to be.” To me this means simply, that as his enterprises have grown in size, scale, and complexity, he finds it increasing difficult to focus on the singularly most important things, one of his personal success formulas (as many more things are now important to him and his enterprises); and further he finds penalizing and undesirable the increasing mindshare dilution and distraction costs when he switches back and forth from his competing interests. If Elon's situation resonates with you, it sounds like a great time to simplify, delegate, and redefine the singularly most important things. Remember, often in business and in life, the same processes that got you here, won't get you there. You must adapt and improve your process, or fall back.  Re-examine your A-list priorities, keep only those responsibilities and tasks that you personally must do, delegate and/or discontinue the rest of the tasks, as they are distractions; and remember to make time for yourself, indeed to take time to recharge your physical and emotional batteries.  Research shows that employees are at least 40% more effective after returning from vacation, than their peers who stayed at the grindstone of business.
