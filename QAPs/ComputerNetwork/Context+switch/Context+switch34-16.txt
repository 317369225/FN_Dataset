â˜…Computer Programming: Do larger screen sizes make programming easier? If so, why?
Yes, ofcourse. No second thoughts about it. But given a choice between 1 large screen or 2 small screen, then I would chose 2 small screen (except large one is really large) Reason is pretty much straightforward. In terms of programming, your mind should have array index linking with files you are working on, rather than having linked list linking. So rather than traversing through terminals, jumping from one file to another, you should be able to access them directly. In programming you generally have function dependencies, library sharing; and understanding you code becomes easier when you can see both caller and callee at the same time (which is feasible on large screen)
