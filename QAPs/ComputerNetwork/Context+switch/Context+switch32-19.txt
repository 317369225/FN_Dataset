â˜…Why do programmers love working at night?
Perspective of a young guy at the trade. I've been avoiding all-nighters these days but I'm slowly finding myself sliding back into that lifestyle, usually for reasons that aren't well within my control :( These days my schedule includes some running around during the day (meetings, dentist appointment, blah blah). Then I get home in the evening and I'm very tired, tired to the point that I just sleep off within a few minutes. But the cron in my head wakes me up after about 2 hours. Refreshed and full of energy I fire up my laptop for what's a day without a meaningful accomplishment? Twenty minutes later it's 5am, crap I have to sleep! git push shutdown He who learns to run away lives to fight another day (and yes I've actually put that in commit messages a couple of times). I don't think this is a healthy lifestyle so I'm doing my best to avoid it. Above all, don't live like this if you are not allowed flexible work hours at your job but then, what do I know?
