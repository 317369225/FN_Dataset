★Why do only IT/Software companies like Facebook, Google, Valve, Dropbox etc. see the importance in creating fun and the most comfortable working places?
It's not only software companies that have innovative and fun workspaces. In the early to mid-2000s, Mattel internally launched "Project Platypus": "We take 12 employees with various skill sets and backgrounds and from all levels of experience. We give them the task of conceiving and developing a completely new brand. We put them in a separate building-2000 square feet-that looks like a playground. The desks are on wheels. There are lots of toys and materials. I like to imagine that a helicopter has picked them up and dropped them someplace completely remote-a totally new environment-even though it is just across the street. For three months they leave their jobs and their titles behind to take part in this experiment." --Project Platypus: Reinventing Product Development at Mattel A BP office in Houston clusters workspace "neighborhoods" around a cafe, and has tented semi-private collaborative spaces. --Page on Hermanmiller BMW's factory in Leipzig intermingles industrial output with office functions: "Conveyors not only take the vehicles from one production shed to another, but do so directly through all of the functional spaces of the Central Building. The offices, meeting rooms, and public relations facilities are all built around these elevated conveyors, creating an interesting relationship between the employees, the cars, and the public. --Wikipedia: BMW Central Building (photo tour: BMW Leipzig factory tour   (Photos inside!))
