★What is a coder's worst nightmare?
My worst nightmare has nothing to do with bugs. It's much worse. So a really nice, interesting, challenging feature comes up in the backlog.  You advocate for it.  It gets scheduled.  Rejoice! You come up with a design for the feature which you run by your colleagues who nod and say nice things like "Should work, yep."  You rought it out and it comes in at maybe a couple of months to get it all done. You split it into four or five sprintable chunks, but it's one of those features that requires a bunch of behind-the-scenes refactoring, data marshalling and rework, and the thing is really only surfaced in the UI toward the end. In one of the final sprints, when you can really start to play with it, you realize the design made a single - tiny, probably - assumption about something that is so terribly, horribly wrong, you have to start looking backwards to figure out how to fix it. Before long, you're desperately shelving, copying, branching and reverting SCM commits to get the codebase into a state where you can start to go forwards again, until you finally figure out there aint no more, and you're right back at square one.
