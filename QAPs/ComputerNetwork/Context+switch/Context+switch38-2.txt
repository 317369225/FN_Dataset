â˜…How does multithreading work in a single-core computer?
There was always multithreading when there were single-core processors although, essentially it will be concurrency by time slicing and context switching precisely multitasking. Traditionally single core processors were handled by OS's for multitasking when you will have a word document, media player and a web browser running simultaneously, each process will get a small slice of time to perform it's tasks, meanwhile other processes are paused however it is done in milliseconds therefore an enduser does not have any perception about it. OS used to handle these processes through multitasking until recently when multi-core era arrived now OS handle multiple tasks with more dedicated threads along with time slicing.
