â˜…What is the difference between concurrency and parallelism?
Concurrency and parallelism are two related parts of computer science. Concurrency studies processes that have have no causal relationship between them, and therefore can be executed simultaneously, but need not. Parallelism studies processes that indeed run simultaneously. Concurrency is an older field of study: concurrent processes can execute on a single threaded processor, for instance by time sharing. The typical question studied here are use of shared resources, and determinism of the computation. In parallelism, especially traditional distributed memory parallelism, shared resources and determinism are typically not in question, and the main question is about efficiency and speedup attained by parallel execution of the program.
