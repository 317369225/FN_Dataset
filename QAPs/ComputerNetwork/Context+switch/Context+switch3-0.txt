â˜…What is context switching in OS?
Assume that you are working on quora and scrolling through the answers while listening to some song on your PC. If for simplicity we assume that your PC has a single processor, in order to run your two applications i.e., songs and quora via browser, the OS software runs your browser containing quora for a short time and then it runs your song for another short period of time, giving you the overall impression of both the things running in parallel. You would not be able to notice this as this 'short period' is of the order of nano seconds. This jump of execution of one process to another process is what is called context switching. The overall goal is to reduce waiting time of applications by switching between them in short periods of time so as to give the overall impression of running all the processes at the same time.
