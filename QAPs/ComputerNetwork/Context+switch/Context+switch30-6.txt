★Why do only IT/Software companies like Facebook, Google, Valve, Dropbox etc. see the importance in creating fun and the most comfortable working places?
Short Version - A company spends a lot of money protecting their factory and equipment and the source of productivity in an IT company the people are it so you have to protect and pamper then. Long version.  I've worked for a traditional company for 8 years now and just started a tech startup. My earlier company was about imports of medicines. Over there we spent a lot of money to ensure that goods we stored right (not only climatic conditions but even labelling and which medicine should be stored where and in what quantity), insurance was taken for storing of goods, transit insurance was taken etc etc. The point here we pampered the medicines because that was out bread and butter. Similarly in the it industry people are everything - you don't find software creating a new product like Facebook or an iPhone, people make things so that is your best asset and you have to pamper your best assets to make them felt needed and give then space to go ahead and change the world.
