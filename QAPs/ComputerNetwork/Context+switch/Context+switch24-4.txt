â˜…What are the advantages of Sparrow over the Gmail web app?
I'm always trying out new email apps out of curiousity and also to keep current so I can best advise my clients. Brian Roemmele's comments regarding Twitter-like interface are interesting. Sparrow also makes it easy to integrate Shortmail, the newish email service that lets you send 500 character or less messages - no html or attachments. It's also great that Sparrow integrates DropBox now as part of its feature set. The jury is still out for me, however. I am a power user of the web mail app, and I miss the ease with which I can accomplish some tasks, such as creating labels on the fly in Sparrow (perhaps I'm overlooking this).
