★How does DirecTV compare to cable?
Depends on what you like to watch.  I have both DirecTV and Comcast Cable and am comparing both.  There are channels on DirecTV that I enjoy watching, but they are not available on Comcast.  The exact same applies to Comcast.  Comcast has channels available that DirecTV does not.  Requesting that either provider add those missing channels is an effort in futility.  Both DirecTV and Cable (regardless of the provider) are good, you just have to choose the one provider that suits your viewing preferences the best.
