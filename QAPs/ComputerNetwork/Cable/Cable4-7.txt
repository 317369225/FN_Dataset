â˜…What is the name and purpose of this cable?The cable I'm talking about is about six inches long, has a 1/4" audio connector on one end and a metal spike on the other. I have seen two of them so it is a confirmed thing. I'd like to know what it is and what it's for. Sadly, I can't post a picture because I don't have access to the cable. Here is a picture of what it looks like on one end: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/ima...
Thats just a 6.3mm mono jack audio cable, at least the one on the link you mentioned is. Used for stuff like guitars or anything else that is by default mono. They also exist in different variations like 6.3 mono to 3.3mm stereo name it its there. So my bet indeed is some probing of anything but can't be sure of it, the cable name would be something like 6.3 mono/stereo jack (to) - xxxxx.
