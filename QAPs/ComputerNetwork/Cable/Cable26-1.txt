â˜…Audiophiles: Does the audio cable make a difference in terms of sound quality?Including all types of cables -- interconnect cables / digital cables / power cables / speaker cables.
Yes, but follow these simple rules: Keep cable lengths as short as possible* Don't spend more than 10% the value of your system on cables Don't believe everything you read, especially about audio cables * special case: for arcane reasons, S/PDIF cables may perform better at 2m lengths than at shorter lengths
