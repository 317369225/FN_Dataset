â˜…What cables are fastest for a computer?
Ahh data transmission. You might be asking about fastest data transfer between sites (geographically separated buildings), or you may be asking which is fastest to transfer data from a computer to an external storage volume, or internal volume. My two cents on this topic is this: (1) Fibre laid down underneath the pavement, and (2) Thunderbolt 2.0. Please keep in mind, I know people go all out buying expensive cables for home stereo systems, however in computer terms I would more focus on getting a computer which supports the latest and greatest standards. You will notice the incremental improvements in speed with USB, in the following speed increments. USB 1.1 runs at 12Mbits USB 2.0 runs at 480Mbits USB 3.0 runs at 5Gbits USB 3.1 runs at 10Gbits Hence the conclusion is that if your computer does not support the latest standard, a cable will not make any difference. Replacing the motherboard will give you more speed for data transfer, which most of the time entails replacing your computer.
