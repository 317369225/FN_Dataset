â˜…Audiophiles: Does the audio cable make a difference in terms of sound quality?Including all types of cables -- interconnect cables / digital cables / power cables / speaker cables.
Very often it's a blindly held belief that is simply fiction (people comparing the sound of USB cables for instance, are absolutely delusional). It isn't subjective at all - how can something like this possibly be? In some situations it's possible for some kinds of cables but the vast majority of all the audiophile cable rants you hear are not rooted in reality. Yet another example of audiophile paranoia.
