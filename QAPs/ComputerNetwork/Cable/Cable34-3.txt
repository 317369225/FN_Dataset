â˜…Is there really a difference between a $30 instrument cable and a $150 dollar one?"fast transients, clean highs, vivid harmonics"... I'm starting to suspect it's marketing nonsense, but never having used a seriously expensive cable I have no frame of reference.
I am an engineer as well as a performer, and can confirm that scientifically & sonically the two are about 99% the same. The places they cut costs are in materials that contribute to durability- solder joints, structural support at the ends where the cable meets the metal, etc.
