â˜…What can you make out of an old cable box?
Do you mean the one provided from cabel TV companies? I store them for later repacking of the equipment or stuff that came with them. This also includes all my boxes for notebooks, TV, etc, etc. I don't throw them since in case I coudl sell the units again, these come in handy.
