★Does a lightning cable with "audio out" and USB exist?I need one to connect my iPhone to my car stereo without having to run a separate wire from the 3.5mm headphone jack to the AUX jack for the stereo.  There are tons of them for the old 30 pin connector (e.g. Amazon.com: 3.5mm Audio Line Out + 30pin Usb Dock Cable for Iphone Ipod: MP3 Players & Accessories ).  Thanks in advance for any assistance on this.
What about this one? http://dx.com/p/lightning-3-5mm-...
