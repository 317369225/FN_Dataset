★Is there really a difference between a $30 instrument cable and a $150 dollar one?"fast transients, clean highs, vivid harmonics"... I'm starting to suspect it's marketing nonsense, but never having used a seriously expensive cable I have no frame of reference.
As an electronics technician (since 1975) I've always known that high-end cables were mostly a matter of hype.  On the other hand, even the best cables are subject to eventual failure and most musicians wouldn't begin to know how to go about soldering on a new connector so I've always recommended to my musician friends that they buy a well known brand name because when the cable fails they can put it in a box or envelope, mail it to the manufacturer and receive a new, or like new, cable back in the mail.  These days, when a 30 second google search can find you the companies website, where you can register your cable and/or find both their address and return policy, it makes even more sense to buy a well known brand name.  If there's not a brand name you know and recognize, a google search for guitar cable reviews can be helpful.
