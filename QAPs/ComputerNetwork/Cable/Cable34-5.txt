â˜…Is there really a difference between a $30 instrument cable and a $150 dollar one?"fast transients, clean highs, vivid harmonics"... I'm starting to suspect it's marketing nonsense, but never having used a seriously expensive cable I have no frame of reference.
A high quality cable will last for a long time, avoid unexpected failures in awkward moments and avoid hum noise http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The.... And It doesn't need to be a $150 one in order to have those features. Most of the cables work just fine. Only try to avoid incredible cheap ones. The rest is just crap.
