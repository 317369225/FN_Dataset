â˜…Is there a sports-only cable/satellite provider?
There are none that exist to my knowledge and I have had the opportunity to work with cable/sat providers around the world. It's a great idea but there are economic limitations due to the huge infrastructure required to build out a cable/satellite service versus the number of subscribers that would be consumers of a "sports" only service. The reason cable/TV companies can support the costs of these infrastructures is because of the economics of scale that are achieved with offering a wide array of content to a huge customer base.
