★Does a lightning cable with "audio out" and USB exist?I need one to connect my iPhone to my car stereo without having to run a separate wire from the 3.5mm headphone jack to the AUX jack for the stereo.  There are tons of them for the old 30 pin connector (e.g. Amazon.com: 3.5mm Audio Line Out + 30pin Usb Dock Cable for Iphone Ipod: MP3 Players & Accessories ).  Thanks in advance for any assistance on this.
It looks like the cable linked in the question will work with Apple's Lightning-to-30-pin adapter.  From one of the reviewers on Amazon: I now have an iPhone 5, so I bought the 30-pin dock connector to  lightning adapter, plugged that into this cable, and into my iPhone 5,  and was happy to see it working perfectly too! See full Amazon comment here: Amazon.com:      J. Geerling's review of 3.5mm Audio Line Out + 30pin Usb Dock Cable... I have not tried this empirically yet, but believe that this solution will work. Please note that some folks have had issues with the genuine Apple Lightning to 30-pin adapter cable (.2m).  It seems the smaller "brick-style adapter" works well, but the cable has been problematic.  More here: Apple Support Communities.
