★How do cable cars work?
This book The Cable Car in America: George Hilton, James A. Bier: 9780804730525: Amazon.com: Books will tell you all you want to know about Cable Cars and a lot you didn't want to know! While today we tend to equate cable cars with hills in many US (and some international - e.g. Edinburgh, Scotland and Dunedin, New Zealand) they were the primary means of transport around the turn of the 19th/20th centuries hills or not.   There were also variations on the way they worked, particularly in the way the grip worked.   For instance, Asa Hovey designed a side grip.   The San Francisco cars you see today use a top grip but the side grip, in its' day, was more common.
