â˜…What is the name and purpose of this cable?The cable I'm talking about is about six inches long, has a 1/4" audio connector on one end and a metal spike on the other. I have seen two of them so it is a confirmed thing. I'd like to know what it is and what it's for. Sadly, I can't post a picture because I don't have access to the cable. Here is a picture of what it looks like on one end: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/ima...
It sounds like you're describing an audio probe, used to trace an audio signal, usually a test tone, through a tangle of cables. It's an old school method as it requires you to violate the insulation, generally considered a bad thing in these days of high def, high frequency, digital and whatnot. That's the only thing I can think it is without a drawing or photo to go by.
