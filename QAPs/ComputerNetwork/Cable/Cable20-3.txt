â˜…What cables are fastest for a computer?
If you're asking about the optimal build/materials of well known cable types to make it "faster", like getting the most optimal VGA or DisplayPort cable, then go with David Eaton's answer. If you're asking about high speed communications (between computers) in general, then go with John Bottoms's answer. To elaborate, from the Wikipedia entry for Fiber-optic communication: In 2013, New Scientist reported that a team at the University of Southampton had achieved a throughput of 73.7 Tbit per second, with the signal traveling at 99.7% the speed of light through a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber.[13] [13] "Big data, now at the speed of light", New Scientist, March 30, 2013, p. 14.
