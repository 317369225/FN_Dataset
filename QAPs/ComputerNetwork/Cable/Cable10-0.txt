â˜…What is an HDMI cable with Ethernet?Is it used with connection together with two devices connected double ethernet cable or "HDMI cable with ethernet"means something else?
HDMI Cable with Ethernet means that it has an ethernet cable inside that allows to connect all of your electronic devices to the internet, without using an ethernet cable for your setup. You will find all the info you need here : http://www.hdmi.org/manufacturer... In addition, HDMI cable with Ethernet is not necessarily 1.4. HDMI 1.4a is now called High Speed HDMI with Ethernet, but there are Standard Speed HDMI cables with Ethernet out there as well, and its not the same cable at all. Just depends on what you really need for your system. Hope this helps, Abreck Askerow QPS Cable www.qpscable.com/en/
