★What is the best HDMI cable for PS3?
Cable brand/quality for HDMI is irrelevant. The cheapest will perform as well the most expensive, assuming of course the actual connector is of an acceptable quality (which is a basic requirement for a good connection)   The more expensive cables only become relevant when dealing with very long cable lengths (15m plus)
