★What can you make out of an old cable box?
If you're talking about a cardboard box it can be made into a wonderful cat-catcher if you have any cats running around your house.  Place it, open, next to your computer chair, and in an amazingly short period of time you will probably catch one! If you're talking about the hard, electronic, metal/composite boxes with cable-TV electronics inside, they're generally sturdy enough to be used as bases for things you want to raise a few inches off the floor.  Or, if you're too poor to have cable, you can still leave it next to your TV with the wires attached so it looks like you've got enough money to pay your cable bills. - MJM, who really should simply throw things out more often than he does.
