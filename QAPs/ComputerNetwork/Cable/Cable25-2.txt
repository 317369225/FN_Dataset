★Why is the cable industry difficult to disrupt?
I am not sure that the cable industry is hard to disrupt.  Currently, the industry is being disrupted by customers who are not signing up for cable television, but instead getting all of their video entertainment from the internet.  This change toward the internet and away from separate cable for the TV has been going on for a couple of years now but is disruption nonetheless. Another disruption to the cable industry will happen when the FCC makes its next ruling on net neutrality.  Though many lawsuits will immediately ensue, eventually the industry will have to bend to the desires of the FCC. If there is any reason why cable companies cannot be disrupted, it would have to be the current regulatory environment.  Existing cable companies (like Comcast) have made sweetheart deals whereby they become the local cable monopoly by giving a municipality a good deal on the internet the municipality wants.  These deals prevent competition and block disruption. The public (at least in the US) is against cable companies.  Cable companies clients are among the most unhappy of all customers.  These companies' reputations have suffered.  I don't imagine the political environment getting better for these companies anytime soon.
