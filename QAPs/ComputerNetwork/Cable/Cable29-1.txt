â˜…Why should anyone pay for cable?
'Why" as in "Why should people pay for a privately offered service?" or why as in should people pay for an alternative form of entertainment? Cable TV, although pricey and usually void of interesting and quality does allow access to a variety programs that network currently does not. To do so, their business model requires them to charge for the service. Are the prices "fair?" Probably, considering that going to a similar number films in a monthly span would cost far than a cable service's monthly fee would be. However, since cable (sat TV) are primarily showing re-runs of older network fare, the choice of whether or not pay for the service depends entirely upon the tastes and financial abilities of the viewer.
