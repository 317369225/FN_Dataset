â˜…Why is the cable industry difficult to disrupt?
You mean how they are a monopoly and not readily challenged right? Well for telecoms there is the whole "you need cables and towers" to supply those services. Well governments only allow "x" amount and if company A gets there first, then you're SOL because it's unsafe to have more than "x" towers in this area. The idea is more obvious with gas lines. Imagine if there were hundreds of gas lines from different companies through the streets. Increase chances of singular failure AND therefore could cause catastrophic failure more probable. It's a monopoly and that's why the FCC and government is trying to decide if it should be regulated as a utility (like gas and water) instead of like a commodity. #netneutrality
