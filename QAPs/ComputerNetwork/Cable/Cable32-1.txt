★Is it possible for a cable modem to acquire a virus?
There are more active compromises rather than the true viruses, ie self replicating software that exploits the modems.  Having said that, there are few exploits that target plain cable modems since they're not on public IP addresses (normally) they can't be used for DDoS attacks and they generally don't have sensitive information. Advanced modems that contain embedded routers, WiFi access points, and telephone adapters are much more commonly targeted and there are many exploits that have occurred over the last 5 years.  Embedded routers do get public IP addresses and are excellent DDoS vectors.  EMTAs often contain SIP credentials for each line making them good targets for theft of that data so criminals can drive calls to high cost shell telephone companies using the SIP info.  Even PacketCable EMTAs aren't immune, but the protocol itself is harder to exploit since its not designed to be IP portable across the Internet.
