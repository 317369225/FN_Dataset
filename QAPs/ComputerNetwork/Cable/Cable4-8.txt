★What is the name and purpose of this cable?The cable I'm talking about is about six inches long, has a 1/4" audio connector on one end and a metal spike on the other. I have seen two of them so it is a confirmed thing. I'd like to know what it is and what it's for. Sadly, I can't post a picture because I don't have access to the cable. Here is a picture of what it looks like on one end: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/ima...
The cable in the picture isa patch cord.  In the good old days, telephone exchanges used them to connect one circuit in a panel to another - a girl (at least in movies, always a girl) would be the operator, and would use thus cable to connect you to whoever it was you wanted to talk to. Of course it could also be used in a similar way to connect audio signals to one device or another. Both ends have a quarter inch jack on them.
