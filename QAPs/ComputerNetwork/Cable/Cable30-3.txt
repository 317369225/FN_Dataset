★Does a lightning cable with "audio out" and USB exist?I need one to connect my iPhone to my car stereo without having to run a separate wire from the 3.5mm headphone jack to the AUX jack for the stereo.  There are tons of them for the old 30 pin connector (e.g. Amazon.com: 3.5mm Audio Line Out + 30pin Usb Dock Cable for Iphone Ipod: MP3 Players & Accessories ).  Thanks in advance for any assistance on this.
This actually doesn't answer your question, but this is probably better AND CHEAPER than what you want: BestDealUSA USB Bluetooth 3.5mm Stereo Audio Music Receiver Adapter for Speaker iPhone Mp3 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AND... It plugs into your car USB for power.  It's dirt cheap, and I can use a lighter charger if I need to charge my phone.
