★What is a "diplomatic cable"?
In the old days embassies used to make use of each country's telegraph service to send messages back home, or they had a small radio station in the embassy to do the same thing.  In either case the message was encrypted before being sent, into the standard 5-letter groups. Most countries had all these messages copied and sent to their intelligence agency, for decoding.    Quite often the codes were simple or breakable.   In one notable case the ambassador sent a verbatim transcript of a speech, that was a huge clue and then by comparing the original speech with the encoded version the code was broken.
