â˜…What is the name and purpose of this cable?The cable I'm talking about is about six inches long, has a 1/4" audio connector on one end and a metal spike on the other. I have seen two of them so it is a confirmed thing. I'd like to know what it is and what it's for. Sadly, I can't post a picture because I don't have access to the cable. Here is a picture of what it looks like on one end: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/ima...
If the "spike" is many inches long with a tapered conical tip, and about the thickness of the cable (with perhaps a finger guard of plastic to aid in placement, and the cable is light colored, flexible and slippery like nylon or teflon, made to be heat-resistant, then it's probably a temperature probe from an oven that plugs into a 1/4" jack inside the oven cavity and lets you set a meat temperature that will signal you when the food is sufficiently cooked. I have a temperature probe like this for my GE standard/convection oven from 20 years back that seems to fit your description.
