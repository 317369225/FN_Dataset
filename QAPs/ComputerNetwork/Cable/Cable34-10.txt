â˜…Is there really a difference between a $30 instrument cable and a $150 dollar one?"fast transients, clean highs, vivid harmonics"... I'm starting to suspect it's marketing nonsense, but never having used a seriously expensive cable I have no frame of reference.
The amount of metal in the cable is a consideration particularly in high power speaker configurations - I remember Glenn Meadows talking about the welding cables that were used for the Masterphonics speakers that had to be filed down at each end to fit into the speaker connectors :) And I finally realised the true reason for those little towers for running your cables on - its so that your robot vacuum cleaner can clean the dust at the wall!
