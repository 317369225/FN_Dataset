â˜…What is a "diplomatic cable"?
A diplomatic cable is a communication -- originally by cable, then by radio, now by satellite communications -- between and among embassies, consulate, and various agencies of the sending government. These are encrypted -- the level of encryption may vary depending on the substance of the communications and its level of classification -- that convey information and/or instructions between the parties, usually concerning diplomatic issues. Diplomatic cables are supposed "inviolable," that is, to be secure from host country interception or interruption according to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Cables are quicker than diplomatic pouches, but can convey only information whereas pouches can convey material things.
