â˜…Is there really a difference between a $30 instrument cable and a $150 dollar one?"fast transients, clean highs, vivid harmonics"... I'm starting to suspect it's marketing nonsense, but never having used a seriously expensive cable I have no frame of reference.
I have an MBA in marketing, and I can guarantee that most of that is marketing nonsense. Unless your cable is poorly made and crackles, there's not going to be much sonic difference at all between a $30 and a $150 cable. The most important cable attribute to me is longevity. There is not always directly correlated with price. The best way to find good cables is to ask around, especially those with lots of experience. That being said, I usually buy cheap ones, and when they wear out, I replace them.
