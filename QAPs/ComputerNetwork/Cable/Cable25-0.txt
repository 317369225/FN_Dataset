â˜…Why is the cable industry difficult to disrupt?
The cable TV industry isn't that hard to disrupt and it is happening, although they're trying to take steps to preserve themselves as long as they can. Services like Hulu and Netflix can stream movies and TV shows over the Internet to your television for much lower prices, much more conveniently (on-demand), and without commercial interruption. Many young people for this reason are "cutting the cord" and using these services instead of paying for cable TV. Cable TV companies are relying on several things to extend their lifespans: Users that are not tech savvy - Some people just aren't technologically savvy enough to hook anything up to the TV or use remotes to specifically choose what they want to watch. They're accustomed to doing things a certain way and are reluctant to change. Access to programming - Cable companies are often the only way to get local programming, and may be the only way to get certain news broadcasts and other television shows that don't have arrangements with services such as Hulu and Netflix. What the cable companies themselves are doing is offering cable internet services over their lines, which for all we know they might actually make a higher margin on than their TV services.
