â˜…Why is the cable industry difficult to disrupt?
Disrupt How? Like, interrupt service? It's dreadfully easy, and happens all of the time. Almost any bad weather will send some idiot into a pole, down a tree or something and take down the wires. Cable is the last thing repaired in such a situation. As-in provide competing services? That depends a lot on where you are. Here in Connecticut the idiots in charge at the time Cable TV started to explode made the stupid decision to make some quick money for the State, and auction-off sections of the state to specific companies as monopolistic territories. Other companies are forbidden to compete in these areas. The only alternatives we have are Satellite service, or put up an old-fashioned TV antenna.
