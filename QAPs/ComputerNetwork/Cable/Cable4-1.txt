â˜…What is the name and purpose of this cable?The cable I'm talking about is about six inches long, has a 1/4" audio connector on one end and a metal spike on the other. I have seen two of them so it is a confirmed thing. I'd like to know what it is and what it's for. Sadly, I can't post a picture because I don't have access to the cable. Here is a picture of what it looks like on one end: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/ima...
I agree with the suggestion that it might be an old-school continuity testing probe, but I also have a very similar gadget myself- it's a thermometer probe that connects to my oven that you'd use to check that a joint of meat is cooked all the way through before serving.
