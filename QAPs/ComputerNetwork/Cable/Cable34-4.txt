â˜…Is there really a difference between a $30 instrument cable and a $150 dollar one?"fast transients, clean highs, vivid harmonics"... I'm starting to suspect it's marketing nonsense, but never having used a seriously expensive cable I have no frame of reference.
Aside from all the points already listed (essentially, as long as it's not absolute cheap crap and doesn't fall apart, you're fine), there is one other aspect of cables worth considering. Long, coiled cables sometimes introduce enough resistance to slightly dampen the high end frequencies of your signal. This isn't generally very noticeable outside a studio environment or in a full mix, but if you like to sit and obsess over the intricacies of your tone, it may be worth considering.
