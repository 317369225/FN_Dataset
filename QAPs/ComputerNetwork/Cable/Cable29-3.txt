â˜…Why should anyone pay for cable?
We have only had cable TV for 9 months out of the 29 years we have lived in our house. We watch PBS, which is three stations in our area with four subchannels for each. We have converter boxes on our old TVs and an antenna on our roof. We mainly watch the news, enjoy documentaries, travel and cooking shows and occasionally watch sports on regular broadcast channels, as well as weather tracking. I get most of my information on the internet. Once in awhile we get caught up in a television drama for a season, but it never lasts. I have an extensive video library. There is so much to do and learn, we find watching TV is a waste of time and too full of advertising which is against our family values, sponsoring unhealthy processed foods and mass consumption. My kids grew up without TV basically and they almost never watch it. So I succeeded. I saved money and turned my kids onto real life and learning. The only social dilemma was when the topic in school was what is your favorite TV show? Well, of course, my kids did not have one.
