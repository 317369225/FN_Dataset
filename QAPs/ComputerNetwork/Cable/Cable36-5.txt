â˜…What can you make out of an old cable box?
1) Turn it into a jewellery box and stick a small mirror on the inside or store your paints or pens,pendrives or other things that tend to get lost easily, in it. 2)You can make a cheap remote control for an easy diy robot by cutting out rectangles on one side and fixing some toggle switches in it. 3) Stack up CDs or cassettes in it if they fit 4) I usually keep my own cardboard boxes for packing stuff when required. 5) You can make a cutout lamp out of it. Thanks for the A2A!
