â˜…What is the best HDMI cable for PS3?
HDMI cables are no different from cheap to expensive. Most retailers have a huge mark-up on them. Remember that these cables are carrying a digital signal - so it either works or it doesn't. I always purchase cheaper cables online - and have had the best results. I always say no to "Monster" cabling etc.
