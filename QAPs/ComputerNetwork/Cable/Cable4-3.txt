â˜…What is the name and purpose of this cable?The cable I'm talking about is about six inches long, has a 1/4" audio connector on one end and a metal spike on the other. I have seen two of them so it is a confirmed thing. I'd like to know what it is and what it's for. Sadly, I can't post a picture because I don't have access to the cable. Here is a picture of what it looks like on one end: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/ima...
As I commented on another answer here for your question, it is extremely likely that, based on your description, it's probably the probe used in some microwaves back in the '70s or '80s for shoving into things like roasts so that the system could cook to proper internal temperatures. I always thought it was a nifty tool and wondered why we still don't see them (I think some might still use them, maybe fancier ovens?).
