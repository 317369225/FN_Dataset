â˜…What is CAT5 cable?
Category 5 cable is four pair cable used for Ethernet over twisted pair, and is probably the most common type of cable used for network connections. From Wikipedia: The specification for category 5 cable was defined in ANSI/TIA/EIA-568-A, with clarification in TSB-95.[3] These documents specify performance characteristics and test requirements for frequencies up to 100 MHz. Cable types, connector types and cabling topologies are defined by TIA/EIA-568-B. Nearly always, 8P8C modular connectors, often referred to as RJ45, are used for connecting category 5 cable. The cable is terminated in either the T568A scheme or the T568B scheme. The two schemes work equally well[a] and may be mixed in an installation so long as the same scheme is used on both ends of each cable.
