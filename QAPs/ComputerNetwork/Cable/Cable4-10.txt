â˜…What is the name and purpose of this cable?The cable I'm talking about is about six inches long, has a 1/4" audio connector on one end and a metal spike on the other. I have seen two of them so it is a confirmed thing. I'd like to know what it is and what it's for. Sadly, I can't post a picture because I don't have access to the cable. Here is a picture of what it looks like on one end: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/ima...
