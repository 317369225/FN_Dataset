â˜…Is there really a difference between a $30 instrument cable and a $150 dollar one?"fast transients, clean highs, vivid harmonics"... I'm starting to suspect it's marketing nonsense, but never having used a seriously expensive cable I have no frame of reference.
The expensive cable might sound 5-10% better, which in my opinion doesn't justify 5x the price. It's just a way for people to "feel rich."
