★Is there really a difference between a $30 instrument cable and a $150 dollar one?"fast transients, clean highs, vivid harmonics"... I'm starting to suspect it's marketing nonsense, but never having used a seriously expensive cable I have no frame of reference.
Kind of related to what everyone's said so far, spending upwards of 100 dollars isn't totally necessary, but cables below the 20 dollar price point do start to get a little dicey.   Two big things to look for are cables with high-quality connectors and sufficient insulation.
