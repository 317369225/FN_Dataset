â˜…Is there really a difference between a $30 instrument cable and a $150 dollar one?"fast transients, clean highs, vivid harmonics"... I'm starting to suspect it's marketing nonsense, but never having used a seriously expensive cable I have no frame of reference.
Yes, but a higher price doesn't always mean better quality. You can break them up into three groups; Cheap cables that are sufficient for most purposes, overpriced cables that are just cheap cables with really good marketing and are to be avoided, and professional quality cables that cost more but do give appreciably better sound quality but would only be worthwhile if you were running a professional recording studio or something. The hard part is telling when a cable is expensive because it's good and not because someone knows how to sell junk for a high price.
