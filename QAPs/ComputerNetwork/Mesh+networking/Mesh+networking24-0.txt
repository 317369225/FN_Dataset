★Which cell phones have the technical capability of forming a mesh network?meaning with the proper software, it could form a network to pass data/voice to one another in the event of tower failure etc...
The GSM protocol itself does not support mesh networks for what I know. It is designed for a strict base-station to client type of communication. Not a client to client kind of radio hopping. GSM feature phones especially are designed to be dumb terminals with the base station handling most of the processing. With some smartphones, depending on the type of WiFi protocols they have implemented, will be able to form a type of mesh network, but that would then require users to have a custom app to do 'phone calls' over the WiFi network. OpenBTS might be able to change the public possibilities on the GSM network in the future, but not currently. Google for 'MANET' if you want to know more about mesh networks.    Embed Quote
