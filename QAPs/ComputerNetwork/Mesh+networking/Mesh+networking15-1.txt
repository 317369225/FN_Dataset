★Are self-organizing, community-owned wireless mesh networks a realistic 'last-mile' option?
No. "Self-organizing" means "unlicensed" (e.g. Wi-Fi), and it is impossible to make any service guarantees when your infrastructure can be legally interfered with and you have no recourse to stop it; such is the legal definition from the Federal Communications Commission of the "Instrument, Scientific, & Medical" (ISM or "junk") frequency bands that WiFi (and other 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz spread spectrum devices) operate in. Best plan: the community pools its resources, installs its own infrastructure, and then negotiates with the telecomms companies as a larger buying group (i.e. as a corporate entity) for more bandwidth at a lower unit price ($ per Mb/s per month); this would also allow the community to use its own infrastructure to satisfy its own, local telecommunications needs, without paying a telecomms company. Properly structured, profits from the community entity would accrue to the community. The implication of this, of course, is that you're now in the telecomms business yourself, within your community. One very successful example: Stokab, A/B of Stockholm, Sweden. The city dug up its streets once, laid down a large amount of "dark" fiber plant, and then incorporated Stokab, A/B to operate the infrastructure: flat price for fiber or bandwidth on a non-discriminatory basis. It gave Telia (the PTT of Sweden) severe heartburn, and contributed to the need for Telia merge with TeleNor (the Norwegian PTT) to survive. It is this precise scenario that all US-based telecomms companies are fighting very hard against at multiple levels with multiple strategies.    Embed Quote
