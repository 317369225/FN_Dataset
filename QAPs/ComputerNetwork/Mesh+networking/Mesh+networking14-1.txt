★What support is Fon giving mesh network protocol research?Does Fon have an interest in wireless mesh networks? Key members in Guifi (Spanish Mesh Network) appear to like the Fon hardware!
Guifi (guifi.net) is not related to Fon. And Fon has not expressed any interest in the project. In the current project use Alix or Routerstation with miniPCI. I don't know if that's what you asked me.    Embed Quote
