★Will future smartphones support mesh networking?
Rather unlikely, as long as the strongest distribution channel for smartphones in most countries is the network operator. They will rather drive against mesh networking, as their business model is to put every device on 4G instead. There would have to be a party in this industry which has a benefit to drive mesh networking, strong enough that it can outweigh the purchasing power of the network operator industry and make device manufacturers build such a product. I currently see no player of such scale and business interest arising... Maybe the Google ATAP modular phone project could innovate in such a direction, as basically everyone could start building and offering a HW module with such a capability, without being dependant on network operators to sell it.    Embed Quote
