★Why aren't mesh networks (or peer-to-peer internet connections) more common place?It seems like a really good idea to democratize access to the internet?  OLPC laptops are all kitted with mesh networking capabilities.  Why is this not common place?
Lets look at the laptops today that are wifi ready. It is not the hardware that stops them from being part of a meshed network, but the software/OS that is running on them. Meraki http://www.Meraki.net had a goal to have this large araay of mesh networks all world over and one would prop up in your neighborhood. Sadly, this did not happen (the way it was envisioned). Meshes today make perfect sense. They offer reliance in a network, backup bandwidth, better use of your existing bandwidth. Unfortunately with wireless system trust and distance become an issue. Who should you trust to be part of the mesh? and what if your distance is too far away to be part of the mesh. Interoperability is also an issue. If I do not have a Meraki solution, how can I become part of the mesh network as a node? I cannot (AFAIK). Same analogy applies to other OEMs. This is a huge hurdle for community level wireless meshes! OLPC had a different application and purpose when the laptop was being designed.    Embed Quote
