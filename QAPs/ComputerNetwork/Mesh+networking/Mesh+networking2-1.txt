★What projects and initiatives are underway to build wireless ad-hoc mesh networks?in preparation for the Contact Summit in NYC October 20, we want to understand the current landscape of projects/initiatives building wireless ad-hoc mesh networks so efforts can be coordinated.
Please include the Village Telco (http://villagetelco.org) in your list.  We make the Mesh Potato, an Open Source, Open Hardware mash-up of a mesh WiFi access point and an analogue telephony adaptor (ATA) which means you can build a telephone and Internet network at the same time.  Here is a short introduction FWIW, in your list I think it would help to separate projects related to mesh protocol development and mesh network projects.  BATMAN, OLSR, Babel et al are mesh protocols that are in use by many projects.  We use BATMAN.    Embed Quote
