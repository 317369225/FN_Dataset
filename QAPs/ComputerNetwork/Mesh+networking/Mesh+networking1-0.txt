★What are the options for wireless mesh networking?Ideally, I'm looking for some sort of mesh repeater than can also broadcast 802.11b/g/n.
The good news is that 802.11n is backward compatible to 802.11 a/b/g – you'll not have any issues there. In a bit of a shameless plug, I work for a company, meraki.com that was one of the inventors of mesh networking. Every access point we make does mesh networking. A longer answer: you're mostly looking at the higher-end gear if you want mesh capabilities. Cisco, Aruba, etc… all have mesh products – they're also pretty costly.    Embed Quote
