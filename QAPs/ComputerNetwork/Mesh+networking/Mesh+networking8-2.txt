★What is the future of wireless mesh networks in your opinion?
I agree with Nachiappan's answer. The Internet of Everything will soon be here. It's already arriving in devices such as the Philips Hue, a number of Personal Area Network devices in the form of smart watches and head up displays, in Smart Grid meters, and via Bluetooth 4.0 tags. Wireless sensor networks will need to make use of meshing for their use to be economical. I do think HWMP (Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol), defined in 802.11s will help drive the availabiltiy of mesh networks, but I suspect that vendor specific solutions will likely win out in the short term. I do expect to see more adoption of wireless extenders, but I don't think they will be mesh based. I would expect you'll find mesh based networks more prevalent in light commercial applications - such as large warehouses, distribution centres, ports, agriculture, etc. where the areas to cover with traditional wifi are challenging and/or expensive with current AP structures. Also I full expect some of the smartmeter folks to sort out a decent mesh, especially in the power distribution/metering space. Whilst Power Line Communications are dropping in price, having a couple of PLC enabled meters in a neighbourhood that then mesh to all other meters sounds pretty good to me.    Embed Quote
