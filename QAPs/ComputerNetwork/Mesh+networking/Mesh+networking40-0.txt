★Why didn't the WiFi mesh network take off given the ubiquity of WiFi today?Today, when people talk about mesh networks, Zigbee always come to mind. Why not WiFi given its ubiquity, popularity and cheaper price today?
We tried Wi-Fi mesh.  Really hard. And with reasonable money too. The bottom line is that Wi-Fi is the Wrong Technology. Period, end of story. The range is simply too short, the bandwidth too slow. We need laptops and smart phones that can deliver 100Mb/s with at least 1 mile of range, not 800 feet. We need a backhaul technology that can deliver about 1Gb/s, with equal range. And we need to be able to do this for about $50k USD per square mile. This is the technology that needs to be built-in day one, otherwise no one is going to use it.  Yes, you could use cell technology for some of it, but it's really not quite set up the right way.    Embed Quote
