★Net Neutrality: How will the FCC's decision tier the Internet affect efforts to develop P2P mesh networking?
The Net Neutrality discussion will have no effect on P2P issues at all. The P2P issues are around (a) copyrighted content, which is clearly separate, and (b) network saturation. Because P2P, even with legal content, can drive an access link into saturation, and because it can even do this for a shared link, the ISP is going to want to control such activities. Net Neutrality will require that ISPs not provide traffic controls based on content, but as a practical matter, this is not truly necessary anyway. Many traffic controls can be completely based on rate controls, which, if implemented uniformly, would not be a violation of neutrality.    Embed Quote
