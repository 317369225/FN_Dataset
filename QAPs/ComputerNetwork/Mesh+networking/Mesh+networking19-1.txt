★Could starting a for-profit mesh network ISP be sustainable and profitable in a dense area?I've always thought a mesh network as an alternative to DSL/Cable for a high density area could be interesting.  Would building an ISP based on this de-centralized model be sustainable?
Yes, I think it could be, and I would be honored to get involved on the hardware-supply end of your awesome project.  I tried something like this in West Africa in 2006.  I was far too early.  Today, it just might be possible with the right amount of energy and intensity.  Further, today this is a model that could be pursued in both the developing world and developed countries.  I'm interested in this for a dozen reasons.  Please get ahold of me. faddat@gmail.com +86 185 6573 5168 (I have telegram) faddat on Skype    Embed Quote
