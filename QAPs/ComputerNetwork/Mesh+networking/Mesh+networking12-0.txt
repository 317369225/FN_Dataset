★What about bandwidth in MESH networks?How could we have good bandwidth in MESH networks? What would be the structure of the network? Please be specific, like explaining the bandwidth of connections between cities, datacentres; how redundant; what kind of hardware to connect buildings, etc.
Mesh networks lose a lot of bandwidth between hops, therefore if you want a lot of bandwidth in a wireless connection, don't use a mesh network, but rather run a cable straight to your access point. Wireless networks are intended for connectivity to end stations, I don't think you'll have 10GB connectivity in wireless at any usable range for a few more years.    Embed Quote
