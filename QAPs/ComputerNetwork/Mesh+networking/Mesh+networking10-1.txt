★What is the role of TCP/IP in deploying mesh networks?
First, review the OSI network model to know how to keep the layers of the network abstraction clearly defined.  Then you'll see that "the mesh" lives at mostly the physical and IP layers, below TCP. So at the physical layer, this includes radio and the methods which will encode information on to those radio waves.  Then once you have information on that radio signal, IP (or possibly some other special "mesh routing protocol" in order to deal with the high mobility of mesh networks) will handle getting it to the various points/nodes/devices in that network.  TCP, then, is the information that the computer/node will take up into their user stack as DATA.
