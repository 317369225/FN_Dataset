★Why didn't the WiFi mesh network take off given the ubiquity of WiFi today?Today, when people talk about mesh networks, Zigbee always come to mind. Why not WiFi given its ubiquity, popularity and cheaper price today?
Wireless Mesh has been around for decades and is shipping in many proprietary forms and capabilities like 802.16a or WirelessHART. Now WiFi Mesh like 802.11s as developed by Mesh Networks has not been popular due to issues with overhead and loss of capacity, thorough-put, latency due to features associated with WiFi having a basis mode of operation using CSMA/CA which works well in controlled media like Ethernet or Fiber, In ether freespace where coexistence is important the features  with WiFi fail to provide efficiencies when you go beyond 1-2 hops and tiered networks rather peer-to-peer..Need a Scheduler and move to a TDMA structure.. Solutions exist and are shipping in volume using COTS silicon, one just needs to connect with correct folks..    Embed Quote
