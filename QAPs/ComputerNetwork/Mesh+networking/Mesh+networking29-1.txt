★Why aren't mesh networks (or peer-to-peer internet connections) more common place?It seems like a really good idea to democratize access to the internet?  OLPC laptops are all kitted with mesh networking capabilities.  Why is this not common place?
It's hard to profit from giving all the power back to the people :).  If you cut out the middle man, or let everyone share part of their paid connection to the middle man, middle man loses.  So there's not a financial incentive to develop this.  There would be more incentive, in fact, for those profiting from selling bandwidth to purchase and kill the mesh networking solutions.    Embed Quote
