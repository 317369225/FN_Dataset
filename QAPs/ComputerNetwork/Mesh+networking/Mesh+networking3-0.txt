★Is Google seeding a mobile mesh network?
Google certainly has the skills and know-how to update those (or encourage to download an update) with a FONera-like capability at any point — but this might actually come as is. I'm not sure how those work, but to check-in as an identified user without having to type your long, secure, main Google password on an inconvenient virtual keyboard on a suspicious item at the store, those probably should be free, open wifi hotspots: that way your location is guaranteed, and that would be the incentive for the store to install them — more information on your customers, and the ability to handle coupons on GMaps is great, but hard to make sense of, so not really convincing, especially by Google's “Let's throw 7Gb of storage for free in there” standards. Google probably foots the connection bill too: you don't want to have the store pay for a (hackable) connection that is presumed to be exclusively for Google's targeting benefits — so Google is better off turning those into MuniWifi poles, and justify the expense with the very likely insane profits on instant-coupons for availability management at local shops, offered to customers through GMaps. (Check Groupon growth for market size.) You are left with a dense network of wifi connections, that would probably improve its coverage with mesh-capability. Energy would be an issue for both the merchant terminal (but I'm assuming “keep it plugged” works for fixed cellular terminals too) and the user cells, but the battery effort asked to those might not be that strenuous, if the first seed of terminal is dense enough.    Embed Quote
