★What are mesh networks used for?
The Prince George's County Amateur Radio Emergency Service/Radio Amateur Emergency Service (PG ARES Home Page) is exploring the use of mesh networks (Broadband-Hamnet) during emergency communications response. I foresee most of the traffic being logistical in nature and we're also considering traffic from sensors, weather stations, and other devices for situational awareness (micro-Internet of Things). I've build a proof-of-concept demonstrating a "smart node" in such a mesh (Emergency Cloud System) that can provide both SA  as well as application support (D-RATS Home server, LAMP web server, database, Winlink Global Radio Email server, etc.) The mesh would allow my team to stand up operations with a minimal amount of prior configuration. Just show up with your router and connect. I also see this network connected to the area-wide, point-to-point network that hams are building (Amateur Radio computer compatible Networks).    Embed Quote
