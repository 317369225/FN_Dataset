★Why didn't the WiFi mesh network take off given the ubiquity of WiFi today?Today, when people talk about mesh networks, Zigbee always come to mind. Why not WiFi given its ubiquity, popularity and cheaper price today?
It is likely because they solve different problems. Wi-Fi is generally capable of a large amount of bandwidth and is used in scenarios where end user terminals need a lot of bandwidth. In these cases, you would like to use wired back haul, not want to share the scarce air interface spectrum for back haul and use all of it for end user terminals. Zigbee, on the other hand, is used for low power, low bandwidth and wide coverage use cases. Therefore, it is acceptable to share the air interface for both terminal and back haul use.    Embed Quote
