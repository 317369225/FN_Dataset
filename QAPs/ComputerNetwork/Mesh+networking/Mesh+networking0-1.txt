★How do mesh networks work?
A mesh network is essentially a bunch of separate sites with redundant links.  In a mesh network if a single link to a site fails traffic will still reach that site through redundancy.  Picture a spider web and you will notice that all connecting points have multiple paths to reach the rest of the web.  A mesh network is the exact same thing.  It is a fully redundant architecture and the only way a single site could be disconnected from the rest is for every external link to fail for that single site.  That is at least the easy answer without getting deep in the weeds with technical jargon.    Embed Quote
