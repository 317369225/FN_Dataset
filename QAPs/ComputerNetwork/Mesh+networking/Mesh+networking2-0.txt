★What projects and initiatives are underway to build wireless ad-hoc mesh networks?in preparation for the Contact Summit in NYC October 20, we want to understand the current landscape of projects/initiatives building wireless ad-hoc mesh networks so efforts can be coordinated.
here is the list i've been compiling: PROJECTS: - Open Mesh Project - http://www.openmeshproject.org/ - building a mesh network for Egypt - Open Source Mesh - http://opensourcemesh.org/index.htm - group looking at how to build a reliable open source meshing software - B.A.T.M.A.N. - http://www.open-mesh.org/ - better approach to mobile ad-hoc networking; routing protocol for multi-hop ad-hoc mesh networks - Roofnet - http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/roofne... - 802.11b/g mesh network in development at MIT CSAIL - GNUnet - https://gnunet.org/ - framework for secure p2p networking that doesn not use any centralized or otherwise trusted services - Dot-P2P - http://dot-p2p.org/index.php?tit... - a free, decentralized, and open DNS system - SMesh - http://www.smesh.org/ - seamless wireless mesh network being developed at John Hopkins University - Coova - http://coova.org/ - open source software access controller for captive portal (UAM) and 802.1X access provisioning - Babel - http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/s... - a loop-free distance-vector routing protocol for IPv6 & IPv4 - SolarMESH - http://owl.eng.mcmaster.ca/~todd... - solar powered IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN mesh network  and relaying infrastructure solution - WING - http://www.wing-project.org/ - wireless mesh network for next-generation internet; partially built on Roofnet - Daihinia - http://daihinia.com/ - a tool for WiFi; turns a simple ad-hoc network into a multi-hop ad-hoc network - P2P DNS - http://p2pdns.baywords.com/ - building a distributed p2p DNS system - Digitata - https://sites.google.com/a/opens... - developing an inexpensive infrastructure (low bandwidth internet terminals) for basic internet exposure to children in African countries - Netsukuku - http://netsukuku.freaknet.org/ - an ad-hoc netowork that uses only WiFi connectivity and a specifically-built adddress system that allows direct communications between machines without resorting to the HTTP protocol - Tonika - http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar... - open source organic network project; administration-free platlform for large-scale open-membership (social) networks with robust security, anonymity, resilience and performance guarantees - Open Garden - http://opengarden.com Open Garden provides mobile broadband connectivity aver a Peer2peer wireless mesh network. The application currently in private beta uses bluetooth and enables any device with the application installed to seamlessly enter the Open Garden network.
