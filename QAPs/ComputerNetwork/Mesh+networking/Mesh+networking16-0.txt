★What is a mesh network and what is it used for?
Tony Li has a good answer. Mesh networks are typically useful in two circumstances. You might have a collection of devices that have short range radios, and you want to extend the network beyond the range of those radios. In this case adjacent nodes serve as routers or repeaters for each other to help get messages off the local mesh onto the greater Internet. IEEE 802.15.4 is a standard you'd look at, as well as networks built on top of that like Zigbee. In another approach you have wifi access points that can mesh to each other, using a primary wired link as their uplink and using mesh over wifi as their secondary backup backhaul link if the primary goes down. Meraki (now part of Cisco) has been a leader in this space.  Wireless Ypsi Wireless Ypsi || We Are Connecting Ypsilanti is one example of a public network built on this system. The hardest part about mesh networks is that intermediate nodes that you depend on for access to the greater Internet can move or go dark without notice. As a result there's a lot more routing overhead and less reliability.    Embed Quote
