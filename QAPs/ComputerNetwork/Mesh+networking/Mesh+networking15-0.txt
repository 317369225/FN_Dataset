★Are self-organizing, community-owned wireless mesh networks a realistic 'last-mile' option?
Two words: Software Radio. With Software Radio spectrum scarcity no longer exists, and last mile is not necessary.  With software radios everyone becomes a node in a grass-roots, bottom-up, ad-hoc network of peer-to-peer, or in this case radio-to-radio network.  With software radio and wide-spectrum transceivers any available piece of spectrum can be use if available.  This technology is such a threat to the incumbents that we should expect all sorts of misinformation, legal maneuvers and other efforts to squash it.  However, the technology is basically simple, so it's only a matter of time before people start making their own from parts ordered on the net or from Radio Shack. Best Case scenario - the technology takes off fast enough that it reaches some kind of saturation (at least in urban areas) that it becomes impossible to stop from sheer demand and public pressure. Worst Case scenario - they outlaw the technology, that "outlaws" and "pirates" become the dominant market growth.  In that case, expect the same outcome of those using p2p services and those trying to stop it.  P2P wins out.    Embed Quote
