★Is it possible to have WiFi nodes form a mesh network?The home router WiFi seems only capable of only forming a star network. Is mesh networking possible with WiFi?
While many routers support it there are drawbacks namely the speed is decreased. Now I assume you mean using multiple accesspoints in a mesh. That would be WDS.    Embed Quote
