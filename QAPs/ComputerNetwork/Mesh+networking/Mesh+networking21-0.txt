★What is the best website for hardware purchases for mesh networks?
The best website will depend on the type of hardware you need, and the type of hardware you need will depend on the type of mesh network you are trying to build. A mesh network does not necessarily need to be wireless, there are several common examples of wired mesh networks. Similarly, mesh networks are not always Wi-Fi, the Project Byzantium team has had success using sound waves, AX.25 over 2m HAM, optical, and Bluetooth, in addition to traditional Wi-Fi. Some other HAMs in our area have used 802.11 frequency-shifted to other amateur bands such as 3GHz. In my experience, the most common scenario is building community wireless networks, and around the globe Ubiquiti Networks is the go-to brand for building such networks. Ubiquiti makes Wireless ISP (WISP) grade Wi-Fi equipment which is durable enough for out-door installations and well-supported by OpenWRT and similar open source routers operating systems. You can check the Ubiquiti Networks website for a local or online distributors to order from. If you're building a community mesh network, be sure to checkout Commotion Wireless.    Embed Quote
