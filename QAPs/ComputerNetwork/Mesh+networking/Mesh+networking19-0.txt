★Could starting a for-profit mesh network ISP be sustainable and profitable in a dense area?I've always thought a mesh network as an alternative to DSL/Cable for a high density area could be interesting.  Would building an ISP based on this de-centralized model be sustainable?
No, not in most scenarios.  Mesh networks sound very good conceptually, but trying to use each client as a relay for other clients has not been successful in most cases and the difference in cost per client radio outweighs the benefits in coverage, at least in all of the current implementations.  Most of the systems that are still being sold today are actually mesh "lite" in the sense that they try to prevent any client from being relayed more than twice before reaching the dedicated access point. In general, wireless always loses to wired networks in terms of cost and performance because the wired networks have had decades to pay for the cost of twisted pair or HFC infrastructure.  The only time we see wireless really out competing wired networks is in mobility and where the cost of wiring is simply too high.    Embed Quote
