★What can we learn from the non-collision flight patterns of how Bees or Locust fly, with respect to heavily meshed network traffic?Years ago, companies like IBM, Cisco, et. al., were fascinated with the non-collision and somehow advance warning system that bees or locust clouds behave in. They never seem to collide. How has this model been adapted or juxtaposed to computer networking? (if at all).
There has been some interesting research done in this area. It seems that a few simple rules govern this type of behavior, seen in clouds of insects, flocks of birds, balls of bait-fish, etc. The seemingly complex behavior is explained with a couple of rules, and the behavior is termed 'emergent behavior'. Simple, but recursive. If the guy in front of you turns left, you do too. If blocked left, go ahead a bit then turn left. Apply something like this to all directions, and the resulting movement seems to take on a life and intelligence of its own. A group of many seems to move and react as one. I'm not sure of a computer-networking use for this (there must be some way it is applicable) but it is already used in robotics. Groups of smaller robots network to share movement and location data. The same sort of group-response is seen among the robots as is seen with animals.    Embed Quote
