★What support is Fon giving mesh network protocol research?Does Fon have an interest in wireless mesh networks? Key members in Guifi (Spanish Mesh Network) appear to like the Fon hardware!
Meshing is a very interesting area of WiFi research but we are not part of it.  We are not in meshing because when we go into a country, like the UK with www.btfon.com or Portugal with Zon, we get so many fonspots or hotspots that meshing is not needed.  When we move on to the developing world, maybe in 5 years, than we will probably need meshing.    Embed Quote
