★What would be required to roll out national mesh network infrastructure in America?
I don't live in America so I'll try to answer a more generic question: what would be required to roll out a national mesh network in a large country (as the US)? Mesh networks promise a more flexible and reliable infrastructure than it's possible with a "fixed" backbone. Mesh networks can adapt automatically and in thesis require much less investment in infrastructure than traditional networks with the same coverage. But this flexibility comes with a cost. The main problem is not that the network "don't work", but that you can't give hard guarantees on latency and bandwidth, and performance can vary wildly depending on external factors. Mesh networks also use more complex protocols, and I'm not sure if these protocols would be stable on a really large rollout. Note that most rollouts are relatively small and I'm not aware of any experiment on such a large scale. More importantly, mesh networks tend to be of relatively limited capacity, as it depends on omnidirectional radio signals. A true mesh network[1] needs omni radios to be able to discover other base stations in the neighborhood. Omni radios spread their signal around in all directions and for a given power have to sacrifice one (or both) of the following: reach or bandwidth. Typical capacity is measured in tens of Mbps, opposed to hundreds of Gbps possible in a fiber network. That's possibly the hardest problem to overcome. Given its advantages, mesh networks are more appropriate to cover difficult to reach areas, where laying cable is difficult, costly, or even impossible. Rural areas are a great example. To implement a big nationwide network, traditional architectures are still better. -- [1] If your mesh uses point to point links for backhaul, it's not a "true" mesh, although beamforming could possibly rescue you here. But even then the capacity would be relatively limited, specially compared with fiber.    Embed Quote
