★What are mesh networks used for?
Actually, mesh networks are used around the world to provide Internet service to citizens in urban or rural areas. Often as part of municipal or community wireless networks. Unfortunately, in the USA such networks are often blocked by telecom/cable company lobbyists. For a few quick examples: Page on freifunk.net AWMN Portal - The Front Page guifi.net - Open, Libre and Neutral Telecommunications Network odprto brezžično omrežje Slovenije Réseau Libre Red Hook WiFi | Red Hook Initiative In the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY, the network was used to provide emergency connectivity after Hurricane Sandy had disabled most of the traditional infrastructure. The network also features local services such as a community mapping system which allowed activists to collect statistics about the controversial "Stop and Frisk" policy as it was being implemented in the neighborhood. Much work has gone into making mesh networking more practical and more accessible in the wake of the Arab Spring and Occupy protests in which disabling or limiting of Internet access was often used to try to disrupt the protest movements by restricting their ability to communicate, organize, and get their message out to the press. I am one of the developers of Project Byzantium, a Linux distribution aimed at making it easier to setup mesh networks during or immediately after a failure of tradition communications services. Whether it's due to a despotic leader shutting down the ISPs, or a natural disaster destroying the physical infrastructure.    Embed Quote
