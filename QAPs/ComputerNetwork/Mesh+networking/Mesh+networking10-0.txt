★What is the role of TCP/IP in deploying mesh networks?
None. A "mesh network" is just another phrase for LAN (MAN, WAN, whatever); you set it up with whatever physical media specific protocols you need (e.g. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) for Ethernet, 802.11 for Wi-Fi), assign an IP network address to the mesh network, and set about assigning IP host addresses to the hosts that show up (either manually, or with DHCP, or ...), and off to the rest of The Internet you go, assuming you have a backhaul to it. The Internet Protocols don't care how your "communications subnetwork" actually works, so long as it can properly get IP packets to and from the hosts that participate in that network. That's the beauty of TCP/IP.    Embed Quote
