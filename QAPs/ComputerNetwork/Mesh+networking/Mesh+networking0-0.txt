★How do mesh networks work?
Mesh Networks are small, standalone communications exchanges that rely on phones (or other devices) talking directly to each other, with their range sometimes amplified through routers or other extenders. These networks allow each device to connect directly to others nearby using Bluetooth, peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, or traditional Wi-Fi networks. Because you’re connecting directly with other users, you don’t actually need to be connected over Wi-Fi or a cellular network. The aim of these networks is to create hyper-local communications. Not simple enough? It’s what the Internet was back in the day - decentralized, anonymous, citizen-based, secure communication.   Each connection in a mesh network is not important to the overall strength of the community; this is not the case in a centralized network that offers a hub to form relationships. There is no authority in a mesh network. The fact that there is no authority opens up the possibilities of hundreds of new forms of technology, especially with IoT – the Internet of Things - becoming a reality.   Since mesh network devices can hand off signals, they have an ability to connect thousands of sensors over a wide area, such as a city, and operate in concert.  These networks have the added ability of working around the failure of any individual device.  In theory, mesh networks will allow actions to be truly democratized as well as giving users of the network the ability to see every other user within the network.   To date, mesh networks have found the most value in times of crisis. For example, the Serval project in Australia was launched after the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti to provide emergency communications even when larger cellular and Wi-Fi networks are down. The Serval app allowed people to communicate directly with each other using Wi-Fi over a distance of over 100 meters.    Embed Quote
