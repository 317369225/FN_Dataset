★How to build a city wide wireless hotspot network excluding the method of mesh networking?
From your mention of mesh, I assume you are interested in how to provide suitable RF coverage using Wi-Fi, and not so much in the other challenges like seamless roaming, AAA and enterprise Wi-Fi etc ? The coverage and channel overlap / interference issues have largely been resolved now with 5ghz 802.11n (or .11ac soon). This is mainly a result of the additional channels' but also a result of new technologies like radio resource management and beam forming. Contention (devices per AP) is the new challenge along with traffic / bandwidth management and QoS. My personal opinion is the access control, authentication (AAA) and security (WPA enterprise) along with the new Wi-Fi hotspot 2.0 (passport) is the really exciting challenges facing large scale Wi-Fi deployments.    Embed Quote
