â˜…What's the median salary of HFT (high-frequency trading) software engineers?Separating between base pay and bonus would be appreciated. Would also prefer salary for a new college grad.
AnonUser is nowhere near the right figure. For a new college grad, salary at a top HFT propshop (getco, jump, optiver, etc.) as a software engineer would probably look like 120k + 20k signing + 40k bonus (in chicago or NYC). Citadel FTAP has a notoriously high salary for developers, I believe it's 120k + 20k signing + bonus of either 40k, 60k, or 100k, depending on which third of your "analyst class" you're in. http://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/... http://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/...
