★Who is bringing High Frequency Trading to the masses?It seems like a limited number of Funds and Firms are doing this now, and the rest of the population is being left out in the cold.  Would it even be feasible to bring some sort of high speed algo platform to average people?
My view is that HFT is a race to the bottom, where there is little to be gained. Think in minutes and then you'll be at the same level of of your peers.
