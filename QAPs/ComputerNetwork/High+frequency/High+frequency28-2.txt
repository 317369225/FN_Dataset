â˜…What's the median salary of HFT (high-frequency trading) software engineers?Separating between base pay and bonus would be appreciated. Would also prefer salary for a new college grad.
I don't want to reveal myself, but Stephen Ozyck's salary quote for one of these firms (won't say which to protect anonymity) seems on the very low end for a Ph.D. I recently received an internship offer that's prorated at $145K; this also includes the price per month of the provided furnished corporate housing in a luxury high-rise (don't want to quote the exact number, again, for anonymity).
