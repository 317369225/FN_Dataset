★High frequency trading (HFT) in finance - what is it?I mean, not a dictionary type definition, i.e. HFT is algorithmic automated trading of financial instruments at low latency, but in practical sense. How does it work? Is it similar to frontrunning?
High-frequency trading (HFT) is a type of algorithmic trading. Specifically, it is the use of sophisticated technological tools and computer algorithms to rapidly trade securities. HFT uses proprietary trading strategies carried out by computers to  move in and out of positions in seconds or fractions of a second. High frequency trading is secretive and mysterious, but not at all evil.  It make the stock market more efficient and helps small investors who  trade at random times over the day. I could almost feel sorry for them  being misunderstood. Visit here to know more about HFT Fully Automated Robotic Stock Trading System| Day Trading Robots
