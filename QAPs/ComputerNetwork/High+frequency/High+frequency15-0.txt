â˜…What is the best high frequency trading model?
I'm simplifying a lot here (and I'm not trying to be flippant with such a simple answer), but it is some variation around this: 1. Figure out what the bid and ask prices are for a security on the various exchanges. 2. Buy/sell based on arbitrage opportunities. This doesn't have to be complicated. If you see someone selling Stock A at $10 on Exchange A and someone wanting to buy Stock A at $10.02 on Exchange B, buy from the former and sell to the latter. 3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 as long as you can. The only reason this works is because you (the high frequency trader) have a faster network connection to all the exchanges and can get the information and react to it before anyone else can. Caveats: HFT firms are constantly trying to improve their network connection and constantly trying to issue cancelable buy/sell orders to fake out the other HFT firms as to the real bid/ask prices on the various exchanges. Maybe what you had worked, but no longer works after a competitor's improvements. If you were to visualize the "fake out" orders, they look like this: ( Source: Flash Crash Analysis - May 6'th 2010 - Part 4 - Nanex ) There is another strategy where you're trying to detect when a large institutional investor is trying to buy or sell a large block of the same security. In this case, the volume will drive the price up or down in a predictable way, if only you know that it is happening. I'm not going to try to elaborate on what the models are and which one works best (at the moment), but you might want to look at physics, radar, and object detection for a basic mental framework for that. (e.g., on the radar screen, is that a flock of birds or a stealth fighter?)
