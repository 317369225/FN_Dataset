â˜…What's the median salary of HFT (high-frequency trading) software engineers?Separating between base pay and bonus would be appreciated. Would also prefer salary for a new college grad.
Stephen Ozyck's figures are too low. I see that his answer was posted back in NOV 2012 - maybe things were different back then. Now, top tier hedge funds like (DE Shaw, Two Sigma, Citadel) offer new grads from Top Colleges, with internship experiences, 150+ base, ~100 year-end bonus, ~30 sign on bonus and ~20 relocation bonus.
