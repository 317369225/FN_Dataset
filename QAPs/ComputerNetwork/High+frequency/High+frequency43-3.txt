★How do high frequency trading companies make such large and consistent profits?
HFT firms are more like law firms than traditional investment companies.  They have something they do every day that provides profits, at a cost of spending money on staff and computers. To the extent you believe the HFT firms, this is viewed as (nondeterministic) service fees for providing "liquidity" and "efficiency" to the markets.   To the extent you disbelieve them, it is viewed as "extracting rents" from the market structure.
