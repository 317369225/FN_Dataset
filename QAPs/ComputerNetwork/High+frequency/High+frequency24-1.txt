★Has high frequency trading improved market quality?In terms of market depth, liquidity, transaction costs. Particularly during times of financial stress.
HFT has led to increased efficiency at the cost of increased market fragility and decreased market integrity. In a sense, HFT does for trading what AdWords does for advertising: increase price efficiency at the expense of higher complexity. But advertisers who use AdWords do not need to be paranoid about the platform they are bidding on nor the body who oversees the whole process. A user won't accidentally spend all of his money on Adwords and if he did, Google would probably amend the situation in the user's favor. HFT firms build their own platforms to interface with a highly fragmented, poorly regulated process. If the HFT firm pulls a Knight Capital, the company goes bust and it scares markets. Additionally, the whole deck is stacked in favor of the Goldmans of the world. They accidentally posted $14 options at $1 several months ago, and most of the trades made to exploit that fact were busted, leaving HFT firms with naked positions they bought to hedge the Goldman options.  Goldman got away with a small fine. What worries me the most is the general complexity creep. The public sees it in the form of Knight Capital blowing up, the FB IPO getting botched, and NASDAQ freezing. These are drops in the bucket compared to other catastrophes that could happen and lead to very real, very scary systemic slowdown due to market shell shock.
