â˜…How will high frequency trading change hedge funds?
The changes I envision: Algorithmic trading will continuously develop and become vastly more efficient and effective. Machine learning, advancements in 'big data', and improvements in textual, voice, and video analysis will all make algorithms more powerful and accurate. Transaction latency will all but disappear. Liquidity will improve and bid/ask spreads will narrow further, even for larger orders. Despite these potential advancements, I don't see the role for humans diminishing. The market, the underlying businesses being analyzed, and the economy are all still made up of human beings. There will always be a role for people but the technology supporting them will help make their decisions more robust and systematic.
