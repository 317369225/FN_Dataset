â˜…Economic Policy: Is there any societal benefit to high-frequency trading?What are good reasons that it shouldn't be banned? It seems that it mostly serves to create immense wealth out of nothing, and to concentrate this wealth in very few hands. It also skews the playing field considerably against regular investors (shareholders).
I'm just going to assume here that you're talking about HFTs whose strategies are dependent on providing liquidity. At the end of the day you're compensated for some kind of risk you're taking on for any given strategy. The liquidity providers are essentially taking on inventory risk (in the case that the market moves against them). Anecdotal example, a very well known HFT shop, IIRC Getco, purchased a bit of the flow from a few major retail brokerages (e.g. Schwab, Fidelity) and guaranteed that they would fill customer limit orders at a better price on average than their specified limit price. If that isn't a step in the right direction for the little guy, I'm not sure what is.
