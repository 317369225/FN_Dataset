★Who is bringing High Frequency Trading to the masses?It seems like a limited number of Funds and Firms are doing this now, and the rest of the population is being left out in the cold.  Would it even be feasible to bring some sort of high speed algo platform to average people?
It's a suckers game and one the masses shouldn't play. Short-term trading is a zero-sum game. By definition, HFT is all about speed. If you think there is a price discrepancy, then you buy first. I'd venture that any sell-side HFT solution marketed to the public will not be able to compete with the ultra-fast, ultra-sophisticated HFT firms who have crack teams who are solely dedicated to performance engineering. The masses shouldn't think about going faster. They should think about going slower. Don't play fast time-frames. Slow down your holding period. Go for minutes, hours, or days. This you can automate because it's a fairer game.
