★Does Ohm's Law change at extremely high frequencies?I was told by a college professor that one reason processors have not  exceeded 4 GHz was that the fundamental v=ir changes at extremely high  frequencies.  Is this true?
I want to re-emphasize Jacob VanWagoner's skin effect. Skin effect, increases resistance of transmission line (whilst still following ohms law). To address to, what your professor said: Digital circuits are not so much affected by resistance (because of low currents), as much as by L and C Other major issues are cross talk, mutual inductance, mutual capacitance, reflections from bad termination, heat dissipation.I would like to talk more on high frequency digital design, but limited by the scope of the question.
