â˜…What's the median salary of HFT (high-frequency trading) software engineers?Separating between base pay and bonus would be appreciated. Would also prefer salary for a new college grad.
I've heard of salaries between 70k and 130k, though the upper end of the curve definitely requires a masters degree or prior experience. IMO, if you're an undergrad who can really kill it in the interview and who has some solid intern/research experience, expect 80k AND the ability to negotiate it higher due to competing offers.
