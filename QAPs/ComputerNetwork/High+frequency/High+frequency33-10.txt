â˜…How does trading, especially high-frequency trading, add value to society?
"add value to society" is a flawed concept, but I'll entertain it. Society is made of people, and some of those people want to trade financial assets (or hire people to do it for them). HFTs enable that trading to happen efficiently and charge a very low premium for that service due to their economies of scale. Consider: * Why does the price of an ETF correctly reflect the price of its components? * Why does the price of a future correctly reflect the cost of the asset underlying it + carry cost? * Why does the cost of an ADR correctly reflect the price of the native asset + FX cost? ...etc. HFTs are responsible for all that and more. So to the extent there's value in being able to trade all those things without paying heavy premiums for mis-pricing, there's value in the service provided by HFTs. The main function they serve is information dissemination through various asset classes by maintaining proper correlations between them at a very low price to the users of these assets.
