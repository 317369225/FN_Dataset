â˜…How does trading, especially high-frequency trading, add value to society?
I haven't heard a compelling case for how HFT adds value to the economy. The main premise of HFT is that low latency technology can help some firms step in front of orders, or use their speed edge to correct almost indiscernable ineffciencies. It's more or less legalized front running, and mostly just adds to the slippage (ie: trading costs) for actual investors. To be more precise, the aspects of HFT trading I feel have almost no value to the real world is 'latency arbitrage', or that which shaves off a couple of microseconds of latency by purchasing a slightly closer colocated server to the exchange, uses flash orders to see market movements before everyone else, then just jumps in the middle. Some people say that HFT narrows bid/ask spreads. Of course bid/ask spreads narrow when you have people constantly stepping in the middle of everything, but ultimately the billions extracted from the industry every year represent mostly slippage for actual investors and a waste of technological resources in general. I'd point out that liquidity is very important for an efficient market, but the quality of liquidity that HFT provides is poor. When the market is up or flat they trade high volumes, but when a market crashes (which is when you actually need liquidity) the HFT volume disappears. There is some value in arbitrage, but true arbitrage is such a marginal portion of most HFT firm's profit that it's almost negligible. Even so, trying to arb inefficiencies down to the microsecond very quickly has diminishing marginal utility to the industry. This all being said, I respect that some traders have found an 'edge' (and latency arbitrage is certainly an edge) but I think it fundamentally provides little/no value to society.
