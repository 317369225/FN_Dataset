â˜…I want to know everything about high frequency trading and/or algorithmic trading, where do I start?
Aside from some of the good book recommendations listed here, my advice is that you need to start back-testing strategies as soon as possible and as much as possible. You need to understand what kinds of trading strategies work in what kinds of market environments. There are back-testing platforms on the web (Quantopian | Algorithmic Investing | Algorithmic Trading) (NinjaTrader stock, futures and forex charting software and online trading platform.). Or you can write your own (a non-trivial but enlightening experience). Start with known existing strategies (pairs trading, arbitrage, index trading) and see if you can create an automated strategy that makes money after costs within your chosen back-testing environment. I know traders who have literally tried hundreds or even thousands of different things. This exercise in of itself gives you an understanding of the market and what will and won't make money.
