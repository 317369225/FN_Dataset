â˜…Why are there "capacity constraints" for high frequency trading strategies?E.g. Why can't high frequency trades scale up their strategies to $10mil, $100mil, $1 bill, etc?
I will try to keep it simple and to the point, unlike some of the other answers. Several strategies involve providing liquidity to enter into most positions and taking liquidity as needed to manage the accumulated inventory. Do not let the word microseconds fool you - you may hold on to inventory for as little as few microseconds. If you have a good strategy it might be that, on average, you end up with some change after all is said and done and you are back flat (or very, very well hedged). The catch is that you needed to wait for somebody to come and take your resting order. Because only so many people will be willing to cross the spread on any given day on a given instrument or set of instruments, even if you have figured out a great way to handle that flow there is little you can do to get more of that, and there is your capacity constraint.
