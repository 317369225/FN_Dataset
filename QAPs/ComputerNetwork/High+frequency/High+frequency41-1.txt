★How can I invest in high frequency trading, algorithmic trading, or latency arbitrage?Is there any way for a regular person to invest in entities performing these kinds of trading?
I cannot answer regarding High Frequency Trading and Latency Arbitrage but my feeling is that it is extremely difficult for a "regular person". It require co-location and fast, very fast, machines. Regarding Algo Trading, what you need is "just" an access to a market or broker API and good algorithm that can be improved overtime. In a class at Stanford I met one a guy that is pretty much "retired". He wrote a program in .NET (if remember well), that is automatically executing around 500 trades a day and on average, he makes money. We talked about some details but of couses he did not reveal anything about his secret sauce.  We are friends on Facebook and he is always posting pictures of his frequent trips around the world.
