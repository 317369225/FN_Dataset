â˜…How will high frequency trading change hedge funds?
HFT algos and execution models will get more advance and continue to do so. There are a couple of factors that could potentially hinder the growth of HFT, however. HFT is perceived as evil. Lately, there has been a movement against HFT and I can't tell you what the future would be like for hedge funds. Regulators seem unwilling to do anything about it. In fact, a lot of regulators have a short term stint at the SEC and join an also shop themselves. My guess is that until there is a major calamity nothing meaningful will be accomplished by the regulators. HFT is already a crowded space. Their business is like a zero-sum game, and more algo shops mean more competition. This is one of the reasons that algo shops enforce stringent non-compete agreements toward employees, go to great lengths to protect their codes and strategies, and practice a culture of secrecy.
