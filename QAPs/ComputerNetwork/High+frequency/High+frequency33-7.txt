★How does trading, especially high-frequency trading, add value to society?
Same way that the checkout cashier at Walmart adds value.  You go to the counter to buy toothpaste, there is a "toothpaste trader" there that makes money buying toothpaste from a toothpaste manufacturer and makes it available to you right there and then. Stock traders do with stocks what toothpaste traders do with toothpaste.
