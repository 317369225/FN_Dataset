★Does Ohm's Law change at extremely high frequencies?I was told by a college professor that one reason processors have not  exceeded 4 GHz was that the fundamental v=ir changes at extremely high  frequencies.  Is this true?
Ohm's law, V = IR is not a physical law. It is an approximation derived from Maxwell's equation that is intuitive and easy to apply to practical circuits. Hence we can expect this relation to break when the other constraints of the circuit starts dominating. 1. Unstable resistance: When the electrical field through the device starts changing so fast, the resistors start displaying capacitive and inductive behavior due to second-order effects. This breaks the Ohm's law. Also resistance to a current appears due to a variety of factors, and these factors determine the point where the I-V relations start deviating from Ohm's law 2. Limited power: When the entire power that can be dissipated in the resistor is limited then, the current cannot go on increasing as the voltage keeps increasing forever. When the I.V reaches the power-limit, the Ohm's law breaks down.
