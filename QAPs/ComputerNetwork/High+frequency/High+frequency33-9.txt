★How does trading, especially high-frequency trading, add value to society?
The biggest value would be liquidity. Investors always want to know how and when they will get their money back.  Say you start up a business and get to a point where you need large amounts of money.  You sell off half your business to venture capitalist.  It grows and grows and gets to a point where the company will go public.  The investors want to sell off some or all of their shares, and you will sell off some of your shares.  The investors now have money in their pocket ready for a new entrepreneur.  Now I have bought 100 shares of your company.  I have made money and have found a better investment.  So I sell.  What would have happened to your business if you were not able to get the VC money because there was no way for them to cash out their investment?  What would happen to Joe Blow trader who has bought your company but has no one to sell to?
