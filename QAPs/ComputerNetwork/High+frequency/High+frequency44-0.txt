★High-Frequency Trading: Who gained from Knight Capital's $465MM loss?http://www.sec.gov/litigation/ad...
No one in particular - I think generally strategies that make money off of small inefficiencies had a significantly better than average day because there was a large inefficiency due to a bug on Knight's side. There are some cases when a big loss is associated with one or a few big winners.  For example, the blow-up of Amaranth's natural gas trade in 2006 ($6.5 billion loss) was good for Centaurus and Citadel because they were specifically betting on the opposite effect from Amaranth.  But my general impression is that big losses due to a technical glitch have many small winners.
