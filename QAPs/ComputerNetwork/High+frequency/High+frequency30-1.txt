â˜…Is high-frequency trading a zero-sum game?
It is a zero-sum game, but not in the way that you might think. HFT as currently practiced seems to be a way to prey on market makers. Bid/Ask spreads are contracting drastically. For retail investors this is great. You pay less of a spread to buy at a given price point, and HFT doesn't change the long term picture of a stock. If you're institutional and need to make large transactions it's unclear if this makes it better or worse than the old system of slow market makers who take on inventory risk. The main outstanding question is really whether they are a problem for market stability. They supply tons of liquidity that has a tendency to evaporate when you most need it.
