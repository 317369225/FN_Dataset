â˜…Are market makers the same as high frequency traders?
By definition they are two different things: Market Makers make a market by providing a customer a bid/offer (directly or anonymously through an Exchange). The customer pays the spread (difference between bid and offer) and a commission in exchange for immediate liquidity. High-Frequency Trading can refer to the speed of execution and/or Algorithmic Trading in general. In U.S. equities almost all market makers are HFT due to the small spread (1 cent) and speed at which the market moves. HFT has filled the role that thousands of human market makers did twenty years ago. Additionally, there are plenty of non-market making HFT firms in U.S. equities. In other asset classes there are varying percentages of human and HFT market makers. This is almost always a function of the market microstructure - liquidity, spread, and access.
