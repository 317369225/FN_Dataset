★Who is bringing High Frequency Trading to the masses?It seems like a limited number of Funds and Firms are doing this now, and the rest of the population is being left out in the cold.  Would it even be feasible to bring some sort of high speed algo platform to average people?
From my understanding, there is really a relatively limited space for HFT profitability.  First of all, the startup fees are HUGE as well as the necessary startup capital.  Secondly, with declining volume on the major markets, there are fewer and fewer potential trades the bots can make money on, this is in addition to more and more HFT firms coming on board crowding the industry further.  On top of this, the speed of the HFT connections and computer is not something the mainstream can compete in.  Firms have computers INSIDE exchanges - not possible for average company XYZ.
