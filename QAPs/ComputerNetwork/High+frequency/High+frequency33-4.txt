★How does trading, especially high-frequency trading, add value to society?
Break it down by HFT general strategy: Front running large block orders on flash order update I don't see how any type of front running strategy adds value.  It should be illegal straight out. Maker/Taker Rebate Arbitrage I'm on the fence because this does add liquidity at face value and tightens spreads.  But to get the volume of order flow the HFT firms are paying billions to the brokers, who then pass along the fees and lousy execution to the traders.  I think maybe it's neutral overall because of the extra speed and liquidity.  But essentially those rebates come from the poor spread execution from the participants that are actually taking position risk. SIP update time arbitrage I don't logically see how keeping an order tied up on the SIP price for a few microseconds and then cancelling, making, or taking based on a faster updated dark pool price adds a whole lot of value.  In fact, I can see how these strategies implement hoarding across exchanges to actually widen spreads.   These strategies just double (or more) the amount of transaction volume in the overall system and distribute the liquidity between the faster and slower connectivity - so neutral on that measure.  IMO SIP update time arbitrage is an end zone run around for exchanges to kick back to the investment banks and it keeps trading costs high, so it subtracts value on balance. Book sabotage I don't know enough about this family of strategies where one HFT tries to unbalance the book of another HFT or dark pool operator to induce a rebalancing squeeze move.  But I would guess that it's not all that great for the participants that are actually taking position risk.  It probably increases price volatility a bit, so that's good for position participants.  I dunno enough about the sabotage stuff to have an opinion.
