★Is high frequency trading possible in commodities markets?Do commodities markets still rely on individuals negotiating a price, the method that stock markets are using less and less?   Does the infrastructure even exist for automated trading of commodities?
Yup, and in HK, its easier to do HFT with commodities, because stocks have a stamp tax and commodities do not.
