★Will high-frequency trading be regulated in the future?In the following weeks, markets have been moving sharply up and down, and volatility has skyrocketed; many are beginning to wonder if HFT is creating too much disruption -- is there a risk of the establishment reining in computerized trading?
It already is well on its way to being regulated. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the U.S. regulator of futures markets, has groups looking carefully at high frequency trading (HFT) operations and how best to police them. O'Malia told reporters some regulation is "inevitable" to govern how algorithmic traders are granted "direct access" to exchanges, but the agency hoped to first gather more information from traders and exchanges by October. http://www.reuters.com/article/2... "Direct access" means the ability to interact directly with the order book without going through brokers, which increases the level of control that HFT operations have. (Big thank you to User for the clarification.) The SEC is also looking at HFT regulation. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro said her agency will examine whether market participants who buy and sell thousands of shares in milliseconds should face restrictions on their trading strategies. “High-frequency trading firms are subject to very little in the way of obligations,” Schapiro said at an event held today by the Security Traders Association in Washington. “We will consider carefully whether these firms should be subject to an appropriate regulatory structure governing key aspects of their market behavior, including quoting and trading strategies.” http://www.businessweek.com/news... Here, relatedly, is a report by the CFTC and the SEC on the May 6, 2010 "flash crash", where algorithmic trading was widely suspected as one of the culprits: http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/...
