★How can I invest in high frequency trading, algorithmic trading, or latency arbitrage?Is there any way for a regular person to invest in entities performing these kinds of trading?
If we start by defining these buzzwords more carefully, then you can see how you may do this. HFT : this is typically used for how often you turnover a position. If more than X times per day, then you have HFT. This is often confused with "low latency order placement." Low latency ssytems are often used to trade one side of a portfoliio, to lower slippage, say getting in and out of a med freqency statarb book. About the only way HFT is profitatble is via low latency systems. The entry point for this very low, which is why there are so many HFT wannabes. IF you have the money to invest, many BD's will set up up with a colo and a platform you can program. Good luck with that algo trading: This just means I'm placing orders via a program, rather than pressing a button on the screen or making a phone call to a broker. These systems are available to the retail market,.TONS of people do this, but the pros will beat you everytime latency arbitrage: This is taking advantage that some feeds are faster than others for disseminating the same information, so there are price discrepancies between exchanges and other venues sometimes. You listen to feed A, they to feed B, you can squeeze in the middle. This is largely going away. The truth is this: Many med freq  stat arb firms are now much more profitable because of two reasons: 1. Low interest rates push Sharpe ratios haigher. 2. Low latency trading makes for less slippage, therefore marginal strategies (i.e. that were passed over due to slippage) are now tradable Invest in those, its easier and more profitable.
