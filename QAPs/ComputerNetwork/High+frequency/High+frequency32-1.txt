â˜…Should passive investors care about (be concerned by) high frequency trading?
The answer by JC is off the mark on a few facts. Unfortunately there are no studies, so no proof, of the effects of HFT on long term investing. So that's a moot point. There are in fact are multiple exchanges, venues, and dark pools where stock trades get executed in the US everyday. About every day; about 30 of them. And , and that number is growing. . Also, do not use stop loss orders. They will get triggered on purpose by HFT. The super fast algos exploit open stop loss orders because they can see them. So they know you're willing to sell below the current market price. If you had an apple worth $2 and I knew you'd sell it if its value fell to $1.50, I'll just lean over and change the price to $1.50. You'll sell it to me. Now I just bought a $2 apple for $1.50. That is, in the simplest example possible, what HFT does to stop loss orders. . Now for passive investors, I suppose you mean a small number of transactions. In that case, the effects are lessened, but not eradicated. If every time you go to the ATM I steal a quarter and I follow you around for a whole year. Well you've lost some money and I've made some right? Same concept with HFT. It's a complex subject and I attempted to keep that as simple as possible. Hope it helps and best of luck!
