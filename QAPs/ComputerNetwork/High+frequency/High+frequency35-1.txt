★High frequency trading (HFT) in finance - what is it?I mean, not a dictionary type definition, i.e. HFT is algorithmic automated trading of financial instruments at low latency, but in practical sense. How does it work? Is it similar to frontrunning?
It is a form of front-running, but as HFTs use publicly available information to do so, it's not technically illegal. There are several HFT approaches, but one method is for the HFT to post small (eg Sell) orders for many stocks on a number of exchanges.  When a large buy order (eg from an investment manager) is executed against one of those small sell orders, the HFT technology races ahead to the other exchanges where that stock trades and buys the same stock in anticipation of selling it to the large buyer for a higher price when they fail to have their full order filled at the first exchange. So, in effect they are scalpers, taking a clip off each large order as it passes through the system.  They are not looking to take a position (or risk) for any length of time in the market.  It's basically an arms race in terms of speed to be the first in line for the reward each time.  While it may be legally allowed, some question its morality, as it is effectively privately taxing many small investors such as pension fund investors.
