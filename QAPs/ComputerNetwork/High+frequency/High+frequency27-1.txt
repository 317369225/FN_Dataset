â˜…Will high-frequency trading be regulated in the future?In the following weeks, markets have been moving sharply up and down, and volatility has skyrocketed; many are beginning to wonder if HFT is creating too much disruption -- is there a risk of the establishment reining in computerized trading?
It goes well beyond a risk to a near-certainty - although many people think of it more as an opportunity to improve the markets than a "risk." The SEC and CFTC have been looking closely at HFT ever since the flash crash. The Wall Street Journal reported just yesterday that regulators issued subpoenas to several HFT firms - see http://online.wsj.com/article/SB... The U.S. is likely to act given that the European Securities and Markets Authority recently issued HFT guidelines - there is an article on it at http://www.reuters.com/article/2... Note that this article mentions that Bart Chilton, a commissioner with the CFTC, "said any shift in HFT to Asia aimed at circumventing new regulations in the U.S. and European Union would likely be short-lived." That makes is sound almost like a fait accompli that there will be new regulations in the U.S.
