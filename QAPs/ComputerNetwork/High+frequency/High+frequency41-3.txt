â˜…How can I invest in high frequency trading, algorithmic trading, or latency arbitrage?Is there any way for a regular person to invest in entities performing these kinds of trading?
No. Generally it is impossible as most of these types of strategies are capacity constrained and the amount of trading capital required is fixed and usually small enough for the trading firm partners to take on with a couple of strategic outside investors.
