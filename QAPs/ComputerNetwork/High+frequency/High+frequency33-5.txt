â˜…How does trading, especially high-frequency trading, add value to society?
I go to buy USD on one exchange, but the price on another exchange has already fallen steeply. Without a HFT trading that away quickly, I could lose a lot of money by trading at the too high price. HFTs that arbitrage cross exchange differences are a very useful service. HFT isn't a monolithic industry. Some guys do a lot of damage spamming trades that are found DOA. Some guys do a useful service like making sure the price of oil is instantly updated around the globe. Same goes for trading. Some guys pump and dump. Other guys fund Google. It's more about the people than the industry.
