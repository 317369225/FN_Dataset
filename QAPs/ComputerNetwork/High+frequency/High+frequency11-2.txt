★What is the definition of high frequency trading?
There might be some different definitions, but essentially high frequency trading is any strategy that is traded systematically (automated) and there is no overnight holding required for the strategy (no positions last longer than one trading session and all positions are closed before the markets close). Ultra High Frequency is generally strategies traded sub 1min holding period, sometimes as fast as the millisecond level.  Mid Frequency has holding periods measured in days and low frequency can be systematic strategies that have weeks or months long holding periods as part of the strategy.
