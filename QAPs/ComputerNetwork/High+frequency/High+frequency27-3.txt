★Will high-frequency trading be regulated in the future?In the following weeks, markets have been moving sharply up and down, and volatility has skyrocketed; many are beginning to wonder if HFT is creating too much disruption -- is there a risk of the establishment reining in computerized trading?
If there is a future then high frequency trading will be regulated in it.  If high frequency trading is not regulated, there is not a future.  So the answer is certainly yes.
