★What is Wealthfront's position on high frequency trading?
Like many, we've become increasingly concerned at Wealthfront over the past year about the potential for high frequency traders to take advantage of individual investors.  As a platform, Wealthfront depends on our custodian, Apex Clearing, for trade execution.  That being said, ensuring the best possible results for our clients is critically important to us.  As a result, we're always looking for ways to improve execution for our clients. Wealthfront advocates and implements an investment strategy based on holding low-cost, highly liquid, passive index funds for the long term, so the overall impact of High-Frequency Trading (HFT) on Wealthfront clients is extremely small due to the small number of trades executed per-client, per-year.  Even at a potential cost of $0.01 per trade (many of the spreads for high-volume, liquid index ETFs are actually at fractions of a penny), the overall annual impact to the average Wealthfront client should be far less than 0.01%. We're continuing to investigate this issue as more information becomes available and a consensus on best practices develops.
