â˜…How does trading, especially high-frequency trading, add value to society?
The biggest thing is that HFT lowers trading costs and increases liquidity. Twenty years ago you might lose as much as 5% of your value every time you bought or sold a share (due to the wide spreads), now most spreads of major stocks are less than a penny, so trading costs for retail investors have gone down. This means you (or your pension fund) lose less money when you make and sell your investments. HFT also help ensure that assets are accurately priced. For example when you buy a share of an S&P500 tracking ETF, it would be annoying to know that you got a worse price than if you had bought the stocks that comprise the index separately (which would not be affordable for all but the largest investors). Similarly, HFT helps ensure that you get the same price for an asset no matter what market you go to in the world.
