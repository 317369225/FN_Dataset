★Does Ohm's Law change at extremely high frequencies?I was told by a college professor that one reason processors have not  exceeded 4 GHz was that the fundamental v=ir changes at extremely high  frequencies.  Is this true?
Yes, and no. Keep in mind that a resistor is itself an idealization that comes from integrating Maxwell's equation in a geometric configuration with no inductive or capacitive effects. Any real-life circuit will experience inductive effects (due to the time-varying magnetic fields) and capacitive effects (due to the fact that electric fields cause charge to redistribute. At low frequencies, you can usually ignore capacitors (by replacing them with open circuits) and inductors (by replacing them with short circuits), and model many simple networks with just resistors. At higher frequencies, those effects start becoming large enough that you cannot ignore them anymore and your V=I*R relation breaks down.
