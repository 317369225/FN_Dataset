★High frequency trading (HFT) in finance - what is it?I mean, not a dictionary type definition, i.e. HFT is algorithmic automated trading of financial instruments at low latency, but in practical sense. How does it work? Is it similar to frontrunning?
I couldn't disagree more with Alan's answer.  First of all, there are a wide variety of 'high frequency traders', and while Alan describes one particular strategy that Michael Lewis talks about in Flash Boys, it's not remotely close to being a good summary of 'what they do'.  HFTs try to profit by being the fastest guys to react to things.  For example, when a stock future ticks in Chicago, and these guys use the tens of millions of dollars they spend on tech to get that message to NY faster, they start trading the underlying stocks while other traders are still waiting to learn this.  There are tons of other examples of strategies that HFTs use, but what Alan describes is far from complete. Also, 'pension funds' are far from small investors.  Most funds use brokers with sufficient sophistication that they shouldn't be getting 'taxed' by HFTs at any noticeable amount.
