★Who is bringing High Frequency Trading to the masses?It seems like a limited number of Funds and Firms are doing this now, and the rest of the population is being left out in the cold.  Would it even be feasible to bring some sort of high speed algo platform to average people?
I agree with Arik. I don't think anyone is trying to do this, and for good reason. Even if it were technically or financially feasible, it would be pretty useless because access to the technology needs be extremely limited for it to be profitable. That being said not all systematic or algorithmic trading is high frequency. My company's product gives people access to automated trading without the need for programming or high level mathematical knowledge.
