★Does Ohm's Law change at extremely high frequencies?I was told by a college professor that one reason processors have not  exceeded 4 GHz was that the fundamental v=ir changes at extremely high  frequencies.  Is this true?
Ohm's Law is just a massive simplification of the underlying physics behind electrical circuits.  By making assumptions, you can throw out terms that don't appear macroscopically or at low frequencies.  However, as these assumptions are violated, Ohm's law begins to break down.  It is not that Ohm's law changes at high frequencies at all.  Ohm's Law is simply a model for macroscopic, low frequency circuits.  When making different assumptions, then the physics must be calculated straight out or a new model must be used. On a side note, it is very important to delineate models from laws.  Models always make assumptions to make the math easier.  By understanding those assumptions, you can realize where the model is applicable and where it breaks down.
