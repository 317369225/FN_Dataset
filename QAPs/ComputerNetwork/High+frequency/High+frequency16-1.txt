★Is high frequency trading possible in commodities markets?Do commodities markets still rely on individuals negotiating a price, the method that stock markets are using less and less?   Does the infrastructure even exist for automated trading of commodities?
Indeed. The commodities market (and futures in general) is one of the deepest, most liquid markets in the world and is very suitable to large-scale high-frequency trading operations. Many CTAs (commodity trading advisors) are purely quantitative, and probably has the highest concentration of quant investors than any other type of fund structure out there.
