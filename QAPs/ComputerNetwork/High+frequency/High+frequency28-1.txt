★What's the median salary of HFT (high-frequency trading) software engineers?Separating between base pay and bonus would be appreciated. Would also prefer salary for a new college grad.
The best way to look at the market is to view it in terms of tiers. The top Tier (Getco, DE Shaw, Citadel, Two Sigma, Knight) they will higher base of 110-115 for MS Degree + Bonus and sign on. Base of 125+ 75 guaranteed bonus + sign on for a PHD. At second tier firms, the requirements are lower and the academic bar is not as high thus increasing the pool of candidates and lower the compensation needed to  attract them. We have seen offers to undergrad only candidates with Degrees from top programs who have won significant recognition in the form of IOI medals, ACM Winners or other achievements of excellence, receive offers of 125+ bonuses of 75-100 or better.
