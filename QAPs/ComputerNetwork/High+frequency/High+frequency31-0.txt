★Is Julia being used in High-Frequency Trading?
I will answer, since my HFT friends probably won't be permitted to.  Julia is almost certainly not being significantly used in HFT. Julia was released recently (2012), while most HFT activities originate from firms significantly older.  They will be using legacy systems and languages. Julia was evidently created for scientific high performance computing.  HFT is real-time transactional by definition, and has different characteristics. Julia is a language unsuited for ultra high performance systems.  The need for garbage collection is one issue.  Cycles matter in HFT: developers will write assembly code to squeeze out more performance. HFT will be overwhelmingly using C and C++, with assembly when useful.
