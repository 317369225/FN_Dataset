★How does trading, especially high-frequency trading, add value to society?
Increased liquidity and price discovery are also useful.  Although the former can be disputed in certain cases, I believe price discovery is an extremely important benefit that trading adds to the economy.  It could also be said that proper hedging in the futures market can be very useful in stabilizing cash flows for commodity dependent businesses.  This stability sometimes allows firms to get reasonable long term financing they otherwise would be unable to receive.
