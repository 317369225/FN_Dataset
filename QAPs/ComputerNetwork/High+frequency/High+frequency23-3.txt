★Does Ohm's Law change at extremely high frequencies?I was told by a college professor that one reason processors have not  exceeded 4 GHz was that the fundamental v=ir changes at extremely high  frequencies.  Is this true?
Well, kinda.   Ohm's law is true for ideal resistors.    Real resistors have a bit of stray shunt capacitance and distributed capacitance to ground.  Shunt capacitance actually helps push high frequency edges along, but capacitance to the substrate or to other signals rounds off the high-frequency edges of pulse waveforms.   You have to replace the resistors in the equations and models with say maybe three resistors in series, with small, like fraction of a picofarad capacitors from the tie points to substrate.  If you run that simulation the sharp edges get somewhat rounded.  Then there's transit time-- it takes time for the electrons to scoot along.  The effect is much like having some invisible capacitance to ground.  This transit time gets really bad in old vacuum tubes-- even a small one like the 6AK5 ends up having its input impedance drop from hundreds of kilohms to like 20 ohms at 200MHz, all due to those lazy electrons between cathode and grid. So I don't think it's exactly that Ohm's law fails, it's that the components are no longer pure resistors with infinitely light charges.
