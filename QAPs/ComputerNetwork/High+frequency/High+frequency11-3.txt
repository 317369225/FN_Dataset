★What is the definition of high frequency trading?
There are three common types of trading strategies employed in a low latency or high frequency environment: Electronic market making Active strategies Passive strategies The first two provide market liquidity and are necessary components of the market structure. Market making was historically performed by human "specialists" and is now executed by algorithms. Active strategies involve identifying short term arbitrage opportunities across securities in order to keep prices inline and the market efficient.  When the media talks about high frequency trading they are usually referring to passive strategies which have been accused of adding questionable value to (or detracting from) the market structure. One of the most common passive strategies is known as rebate capture in which an algorithm is used to send a large number of "limit orders" to a market center (exchange, ECN, or dark pool) to ostensibly provide liquidity. Upon submitting an order the algorithm will monitor security prices in low latency and immediately cancel any order for which the price moves adversely. If an order is filled then the algorithm immediately closes out of the position but is paid a rebate of a few hundredths of a penny or "mils" by the market center. This strategy can be highly profitable because it involves little risk, but a large number of orders must be placed in order for it to be effective. This is one reason why the media reports stats the high frequency tradings is responsible for greater than 70% of order volume.
