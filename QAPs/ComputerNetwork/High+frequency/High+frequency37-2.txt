★Are market makers the same as high frequency traders?
No. All market makers trade frequently. But most high frequency traders are not market makers. Also, most high frequency traders only buy when think a stock is going to go up, and only sell when they think a stock is going to go down. Or a high frequency trader may choose to not own any stock at all for a period of time. A high frequency trader profits from buying low, waiting for a period of time, sometimes a short period of time, and selling high.   Market makers must buy and sell at more or less the same time, all the time. Market makers profit from the spread between the price of the buy and the price of the sell. When an average person buys a stock, they buy it from a market maker. When they sell a stock, they sell to a market maker. The exchange decides who the market maker for each stock is.
