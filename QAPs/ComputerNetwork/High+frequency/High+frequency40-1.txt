â˜…What algorithms are used in high-frequency trading?
There are many algorithms that can be used. These algorithms simulate the business rules used by traders. So one could model stop loss levels, take profit levels, patterns. Think of Moving Average cross overs, gaps between price highs and lows etc. High-frequency trading is quantitative trading that is characterized by short portfolio holding periods. All portfolio-allocation decisions are made by computerized quantitative models. The success of high-frequency trading strategies is largely driven by their ability to simultaneously process large volumes of information, something ordinary human traders cannot do. Specific algorithms are closely guarded by their owners and are known as "algos". Many practical algorithms are in fact quite simple arbitrages which could previously have been performed at lower speeds. Interesting source where algo's are indicated: http://www.automatedtrader.net
