★What are some good books on High Frequency Trading?I'm starting an undergraduate-level research paper on HFT and would really appreciate a brief guide through which books to start with. I know there're Irene Aldridge's "High Frequency Trading" and another called HFT Modeling both published by Wiley Finance. There are other analytical books popping up in Amazon search. Many got really mixed reviews I don't know where to start.
Books: 1. High-frequency Trading -  Maureen O'Hara, Marcos Lopez de Prado, David Easley. It is more like a collection of academic papers than a book. These three are among the best academic researchers on HFT. They have other interesting papers on HFT as well. 2. Inside the Blackbox - Rishi Narang. Narang is a HFT practitioner. He provides great insight into the industry. 3. Algorithmic Trading; Quantitative Trading - Ernest Chan. He is more of a hedgefund guy, the book is about systematic trading more than about HFT, but relevant to HFT. 4. Algorithmic Trading and DMA - Barry Johnson. This is more of a market microstructure book, than about developing strategies. Papers: 1. How Market Slowly Digest Changes in Supply and Demand 2. Machine Learning for Market Microstructure and High Frequency Trading 3. The Volume Clock: Insights into the High Frequency Paradigm 4. Time Series Momentum (Moskowitz) 5. Execution Strategies in Fixed Income Market Authors to follow: Maureen O'Hara, David Easley, J.P. Bouchaud, Robert Almgren.
