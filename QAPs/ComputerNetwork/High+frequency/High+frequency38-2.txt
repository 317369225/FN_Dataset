★Why are there "capacity constraints" for high frequency trading strategies?E.g. Why can't high frequency trades scale up their strategies to $10mil, $100mil, $1 bill, etc?
Same reason messengers in NYC use bikes rather than huge semi-trucks.  If you are riding a bike, you can move and out of traffic very quickly, you can responding instantly to market events.  If you have a huge semi-truck, you can't move very quickly, people know that you are coming, and you can't weave in and out of traffic without causing a big mess, and if you try it, you are much more likely to get the police to arrest you than a bike messenger. One other thing about bike messengers is that they are unlikely to harm other people.  If you are a bike messenger in traffic, you do stupid things and you get run over by a car, it's your funeral, so people are less alarmed when you do stupid things.  If you are a semi-truck you can roll over other cars, at which point the authorities *will* cause you a lot of problems, and you have to go through tons of bureaucracy. If you do $10K trades, you can move in and out like lightning, and you can do the trade before anyone knows what you are doing.  As you ramp up the numbers, it becomes more and more difficult to do the trade, because your trade moves the market.  Also because you start moving the markets, the regulators and exchanges start noticing and it becomes a big problem. Above a certain point, you just simply cannot do the trade in the exchanges and you have to go to the mergers and accquisitions route.
