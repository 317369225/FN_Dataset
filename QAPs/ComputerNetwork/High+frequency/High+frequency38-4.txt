★Why are there "capacity constraints" for high frequency trading strategies?E.g. Why can't high frequency trades scale up their strategies to $10mil, $100mil, $1 bill, etc?
In order to protect the interests of investors, J.P.  Morgan Asset Management (Europe) may find it necessary to limit the size  to which a fund is allowed to grow. This might arise for example, when  the investment manager is of the view that allowing further inflows into  the fund might have a significant impact on fund performance. Generally speaking, such a situation is more likely to arise with  funds following a highly specialist investment objective and with a  concentrated investment portfolio – however other reasons may also give  rise to capacity limits in a fund.
