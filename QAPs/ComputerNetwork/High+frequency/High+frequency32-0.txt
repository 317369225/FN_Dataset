â˜…Should passive investors care about (be concerned by) high frequency trading?
No, assuming that 'passive investor' is close to a synonym for long term investing. Long term investors compete with other long term investors for profits. HFTs compete against people with a sub-second time horizon. Almost all of the top-20 one day point fluctuations in the Dow Jones Industrial Average have happened since the advent of electronic trading and High-Frequency Trading in 1999. [1] If you're concerned about large fluctuations in prices over short periods of time most of all, then maybe you're not a long term investor. However, the biggest issue with that it seems to create for long term investors is that stops can be triggered unexpectedly during a gigantic whipsaw. The stops that are there to protect you from a loss could get triggered immediately before the price leaps back up, flash-crash style. I'm just some schmoe, so I don't really have good advice for how to deal with that. The standard spiel is to tell you to just suck it up when that happens. It doesn't seem like those kinds of occurrences engender a healthy market for many classes of investors. I think user experience matters for markets as much as it does for mobile apps. However, securities regulation prevents more competing exchanges from emerging within the US, so we're stuck with this set of affairs. I guess that if your stops get triggered, you can put in a limit order to buy your position back once the price returns to something that you're comfortable with. You're out transaction fees in that case, plus some other issues, but at least you're not totally screwed. [1]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis...
