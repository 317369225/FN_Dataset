★How can I invest in high frequency trading, algorithmic trading, or latency arbitrage?Is there any way for a regular person to invest in entities performing these kinds of trading?
The only practical and sustainable way would be to either start your own company that does this, or to join one that offers some equity to employees.  The reason is that most companies that do high-frequency trading do so with their own capital.  Since high-frequency trading requires less capital than other forms of trading, it does not make sense to do it on behalf of investors and get 20% of the profits when a company can do that for a few years, return outside money to investors, and continue to run the strategy with their own capital.  Therefore, even if you are lucky enough to invest in a hedge fund that has a substantial high-frequency trading component, which in itself is hard because many of them are closed to new investors, chances are, that fund will return outside capital at some point (as e.g. Renaissance Technologies has done). To take a step back, one way to understand why it is so difficult to invest in this form of trading, is supply and demand.  There is only so much supply of a form of trading that has limited capacity.  If it was easy to invest in it, many, many people would do so, and then the funds would be over their capacity and the strategies would stop working.
