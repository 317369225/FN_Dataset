â˜…What are the best features of HTML5?
HTML5 is used to mean both a proper specification (the W3C's 5th HTML spec. http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/ ) as well as a grouping of all the new stuff that browser vendors have been adding over the last few years. For this answer, I'm assuming the latter description. Some of HTML5's top features include: the <audio> and <video> elements and their respective APIs for multimedia in web pages and applications; a handful of new structural and semantic layout elements including <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer> to standardize some very common HTML document use cases; the <canvas> element and its API for 2d drawing with JavaScript; a GeoLocation API for websites to request user location for integration into services like mapping; new form input types like <input type="search"> and <input type="date"> and client-side form validation; some new attributes on form inputs like "autofocus", "placeholder", and "required"; the File API for for representing file objects in web applications, as well as programmatic-ly selecting them and accessing their data; the Web Sockets API for bidirectional communications between the browser content and the server; the IndexedDB API for structured storage with indexing support; the Web Workers API for running background scripts in parallel to the main page; support for the cash manifest, and online and offline events to enable offline web applications; the WebGL API for 3d graphics in web pages and applications; support for SVG and mathML content directly included in HTML documents; and I'm sure there are a few I'm missing, but those are the ones I've seen the most interest around from Web and browser developers over the last few years.
