★Is the future of Apps HTML5?As well as the applications for PCs, the "native" apps and closed will last a short time, maybe even Google know this already, what you think ? The future of Apps is HTML5?
I believe yes, if you have heard of the Firefox OS [Firefox OS - The Adaptive Phone - Great Smartphone Features, Apps and More - mozilla.org], they are actually experimenting with it in a big way. They are also launching mobile phones based on this OS.   Apple had even started off working on web apps, but Steve Jobs changed his mind...   The late Steve Jobs famously insisted that the Web was good enough for building apps for the original iPhone. But it wasn't long before he changed his mind and announced a traditional SDK for building apps with Objective C. Firefox OS apps will be built entirely using HTML5. According to Mozilla, the thousands of developers who already know how to build Web apps will be able to build Firefox OS apps with minimal additional training. And because they're built on open standards, Mozilla hopes that Firefox OS apps will work reasonably well on other platforms that support HTML5—which is to say, all of them Of course, until recently HTML5 didn't have all the features you'd need to build a full-fledged mobile OS. So when Mozilla says Firefox OS is built on "HTML5," that sometimes means it's built using Mozilla's own proposed extensions to HTML5 that it hopes will be accepted by the W3C (the Web's standard-setting organization) and implemented by other browsers.
