â˜…Is Bootstrap a complement or an alternative to HTML5 Boilerplate or viceversa?In one corner we have Bootstrap and Foundation, in the other we have HTML5 Boilerplate and similar HTML/CSS starting templates. Can they be used together or do we have to pick a side?
Both Foundation and Bootstrap are designed as frameworks that will, at least in part, govern how you build your site structurally. H5BP, like Nicolas says, is a much more agnostic starting point that delivers best practices, standard elements and pieces like Normalize.css for you to start from. That being said neither Foundation nor Bootstrap are complete solutions either - both are designed to encourage adaptation, modification and additions to create a complete site. Foundation actually includes a number of pieces from H5BP, since H5BP is probably one of the most robust sources of general best practices. Integrating Foundation and H5BP isn't really a plug and play operation, as there will be some conflicts, but it's also not extremely onerous.
