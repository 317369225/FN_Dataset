★Why is HTML5 worth all the hype?
There is only one: 1. HTML5 has managed to build an industry consensus around a robust set of mature and popular living specifications (HTML and CSS) where Microsoft, Apple, Google, and the open community (i.e. Mozilla) are fiercely competing on providing the best HTML[5] implementation across all platforms and devices.  This point said it all. a) HTML is multi-vendor b) Vendors are competing within the [living] specification (on performance and compliance) c) HTML is continuously evolving Everything else are details and relative to the application you are trying to build. So, yes, HTML fell asleep between 1999 and 2004, but thanks to Mozilla, Google, and Apple, it is more alive and well now than ever. Any Web developers should prioritize learning HTML technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript) over any other Web technology (i.e Silverlight, Flash, Curl, Java Applets, ...) Also, it is important to note that HTML5/CSS3 is just an evolution of their previous version. So, a good HTML/CSS/Javascript developer is by default a good HTML5/CSS3 developer. HTML5 is a hype only to those who have not realized that HTML5 is HTML.
