â˜…Who is working on HTML5 Document Viewers?
The New York Times have open sourced their document viewer at: https://github.com/NYTimes/docum... There is a blog post about their goals for the viewer here: http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/20... You can see the viewer in action here: http://documents.nytimes.com/cha... Their approach and end-result is VERY different to what Scribd have created but different isn't necessarily wrong... that is for you to decide. To convert the original source documents to something compatible with this viewer I would take a look at Docsplit from DocumentCloud: http://documentcloud.github.com/...
