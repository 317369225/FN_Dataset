â˜…Why is HTML5 worth all the hype?
There are quite a few reasons that are not mentioned here. I'll point out the big ones: Open. It embraces open standards for video and animation. A company(adobe) is not limiting and controlling your capabilities. You can play video in browser as well as develop games using canvas. Realtime. HTML5 exposes real sockets, which means true real time communication becomes a possibility. Watch for the next wave of web applications to support real time communication. SEO. Google is one of the main proponents of HTML5, and needless to say they have been pushing semantic tags very strongly. This allows them to figure out what is important on your page and what is not, providing better search results. Location. The old web was fairly anonymous and so it was difficult to provide you localized results, this is a big game changer.
