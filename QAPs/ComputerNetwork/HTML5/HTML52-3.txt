â˜…What are the benefits of HTML5 ?
I agree with Adam, html5 will certainly help with the speed of your site however as far as SEO goes html5 really doesn't hold enough weight. There are different benefit to using html5, most importantly how the page is read by the browser and search engines. It allows the search engines to use "microdata" which is an additional that came with html5 that allows the page to be compartmentalized and easier to display to your customers in search results. HTML5 simply gives a better user experience which is good for seo, (your user experience on a webpage) but not in the way you are thinking, it will not add or detract from any current page ranking. http://creativemain.com
