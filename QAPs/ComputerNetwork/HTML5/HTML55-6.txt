â˜…Is the future of Apps HTML5?As well as the applications for PCs, the "native" apps and closed will last a short time, maybe even Google know this already, what you think ? The future of Apps is HTML5?
Thanks for A2A. Some things to understand before jumping to any conclusion. 1. Most of the apps today are written in C/C++ 2. Java took more than 2 decades to be meaningful, and is still nowhere close 3. Speed and security is of major importance today. 4. Super sluggish performance on certain devices will kill any technology 5. HTML5 is the only cross compatible language as of now Speed of doing things is improving at a fast pace and hopefully it will enable HTML5 to match near native performance. Until then HTML5 remains future of Apps.
