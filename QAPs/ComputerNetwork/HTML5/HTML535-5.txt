★What are the best HTML5 practices on Internet, with HTML5 tutorials?
There a ton of online resources available for learning HTML5. I took a Jump Start HTML5 Training course from Microsoft Virtual Academy and really had a good experience. They have over 200 free courses and they’re all expert led. You can learn at your own pace which is nice too. Good Luck!
