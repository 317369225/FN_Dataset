â˜…What is so special about HTML5?What is so different about HTML5? How is it more capable than the previous versions and is there any capability of semantic web that can be potentially realized from HTML5?
The funny thing about HTML5 is that it's grown into a buzzword. That is, the general understanding of HTML5 is not the same as "revision 5 of the Hypertext Markup Language" HTML5 has come to encompass HTML 5, CSS 3, and a family of other specifications that all aim to strengthen the capabilities of the web browser. If all browser manufacturers manage to implement all the current items on the table, you'll have client-side technologies capable of doing everything typically expected of Flash apps, many native apps, and then some. There'll be client-side databases with capabilities similar to those on the server. There'll be 3D graphics. There'll be video and audio with complete access from JavaScript to build things like iTunes-style visualizers, live audio and video filters, and styleability via CSS. There'll be network access through web sockets. There'll be conventional ways to embed metadata in pages and access that metadata from JavaScript. And there's more... Much of this is available already in the developmental/alpha versions of leading browsers like Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. Even MSIE is getting into the game.
