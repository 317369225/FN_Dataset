★Does Facebook regret its HTML5 mobile strategy?Seem like it's moving more toward native apps these days.
Recently I had a chance to attend a great presentation for mobile developers here in at the Austin Facebook offices given by Charles Jolley, who is in charge of Facebook’s mobile web application.  Charles is the author of SproutCore and is a contributer to ember.js.  His company was acquired.   Charles explained Facebook is highly motivated to make mobile web work well and that over time Facebook will end up being motivating force behind mobile web standards adoption. He also pointed out that Facebook has the best motivation to make mobile HTML5 work given that they are not trying to advantage any hardware platform.  HTML5 mobile and Facebook work well together given the viral dynamics of the FB platform and friction-free "no install" installation. Charles also explained that Facebook is a key supporter of Ringmark (rng.io), a mobile browser test suite for checking mobile web feature sets in your mobile browser. In the same way that the browser ACID test helped shame browser vendors into supporting standard CSS (webkit not-withstanding), Ringmark provides a simple interface for testing mobile browsers against a standard feature set.  Net-net: FB seems to be heavily invested in making mobile web work and appears to be pushing standards mobile web standards forward.
