★What are the benefits of HTML5 ?
As most of us have come to notice, the web is a constantly changing and fluid environment. New ideas are constantly altering the way we view websites. But how are these developments changing the way Google and other popular search engines view your website? Much has been written about whether most developers should start incorporating the use of HTML5 into their client’s websites. Some, like myself, answer with a resounding “yes” while others seem to want to wait for HTML5 to be announced as an official supported web standard by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). Unfortunately, there is no answer and the benefits of HTML5 varies from project to project. For example, if most of a sites web traffic comes from browsers such as older browsers like Internet Explorer 7/8 then it might not be the best approach to use. However, if the majority of site traffic is a tech savvy audience that uses modern browsers like Chrome, Safari and Firefox you should be embracing these new technologies to not only enhance their browsing experiences but also set a pace for other late adopters to follow.
