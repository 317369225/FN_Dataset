★Is the future of Apps HTML5?As well as the applications for PCs, the "native" apps and closed will last a short time, maybe even Google know this already, what you think ? The future of Apps is HTML5?
No. There will always be a need for native applications. Not everything should be network enabled or sandboxed in a dynamic runtime environment. For the foreseeable future  you won't write apps that require lots of RAM, real-time processing, extensive multithreading, etc. in a browser or browser-like environment. Examples: Photoshop - maybe a very trimmed down version, but not the full app capable of handling gigabyte size images. Games with high end graphics and frame rates. Probably some day but not soon. Small specialized embedded systems where hardware needs to be used as efficient as possible.
