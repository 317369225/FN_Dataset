â˜…What are the best features of HTML5?
I am excited about WebSockets HTML5 supports; that seems the right way to go about doing decent real-time updates on a page, like using Comet (programming language) . That will however take years to get decent support. In the meantime, it's the small things I like about HTML5. The much easier doctype declaration, more semantic forms (look at how Opera checks the RFC for email formatting, for example). I am not immediately sold on the semantic markup tags as they seem way too specific but with some flexibility, it's clear there's a semantic markup tag for any use.
