â˜…Does Facebook regret its HTML5 mobile strategy?Seem like it's moving more toward native apps these days.
Yes, they do repent it! it is going to be about native apps for the next few years atleast! iOS users are not going to settle down for anything less than the awesome experience they get using a native ios app! it is all about the experience - I am a big believer in html 5 but i think it has a long way to go, and in the meanwhile it is important to have a strong native presence and sell experience to people rather than a product so that they will use it more! for now, the facebook app does not give us that experience like flipboard or the other beautiful apps out there!
