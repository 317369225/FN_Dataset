★Is HTML5 the future of mobile gaming?Will it eliminate fragmentation and allow developers to create one game for multiple platforms and operating systems?
No. Games have always been about producing responsive and rewarding experiences - from whatever hardware the player has. Game programmers are obsessive about wringing every cycle of power out of the platforms they use.  Look at any games programming forum, and you'll hear the anguished cries of developers, looking to squeeze an extra ten frames per second out of their renderer code. Mobile devices are interesting because they have lowered the bar. Mobile means less horsepower, less RAM,  weaker GPUs. The way to get the very best out of any hardware is to hit the metal. Developers want to run native code, write their own GPU shaders, and manage their own memory resources. HTML denies the game developer those opportunities. That is not to say that good game experiences cannot be written in HTML. But those developers looking to advance the art, don't sacrifice control willingly. They'd only look to HTML if all other opportunities have been taken away. What we might see is HTML5  replacing Flash gaming.
