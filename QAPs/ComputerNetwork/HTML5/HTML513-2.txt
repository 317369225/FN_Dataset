â˜…Is HTML5 better than Flash?
I think the ultimate test would be to have a showdown between some dev teams + see who can do what within a limited time period given the specs + scope of a theoretical project. Of critical importance, this includes time to debug, troubleshoot + reach a certain level of QA (quality assurance). Furthermore, compare the generated code + one will really be able to see the differences between the two! As I've said before, I would much rather create an animation or RIA (rich internet app) in Flash than HTML. The cross-compatibility checking alone takes significant time for the latter!
