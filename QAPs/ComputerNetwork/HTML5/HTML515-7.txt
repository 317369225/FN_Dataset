★Is HTML5 the future of mobile gaming?Will it eliminate fragmentation and allow developers to create one game for multiple platforms and operating systems?
Yes! Mobile gaming has never been better. 2014 is a great year for this. My new answer in 2014: Performance is top notch on modern iOS, Android and Windows Phone devices. Try this game: http://bit.ly/banana-jungle on your mobile browser.  Audio and visual works perfectly, and brands are using HTML5 to engage users on deep levels.   My old answer in 2013: Contrary to what people think about a fragmented Android world, we've actually seen some steady progress being made on the newer Android devices, thanks to innovation from Samsung and HTC. On the iOS front, it's been very encouraging to see Apple adopting all the latest HTML5 elements. We're hoping to see WebGL get approved in production devices in the coming months, hopefully culminating into a small 3D browser games industry. As for a "build once deploy everywhere approach", it's always been true, but with certain *customizations for individual app stores. Doesn't involve a lot of work these days.
