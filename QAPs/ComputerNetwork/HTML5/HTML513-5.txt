â˜…Is HTML5 better than Flash?
I believe in our increasingly mobile world, yes HTML5 is better. Back in the day and even now, there are some amazing sites and applications made with Flash, but it's performance on mobile devices is pretty awful. The things that Flash ended up getting used the most for (playing video, slideshows, navigation animations) really didn't make any sense if you look back now. All that stuff should be semantic, easily accessible and...well just HTML. I will say that Flash helped fill the gap when the browsers and HTML Consortium itself hadn't' caught up with the technology several years ago. But now, as we want to play video on small devices with limited power and need to access so much on the go, the proprietary, processor intensive Flash versions just don't make sense anymore.
