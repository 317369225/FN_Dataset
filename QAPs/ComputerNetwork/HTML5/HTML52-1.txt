â˜…What are the benefits of HTML5 ?
HTML5 allows for leaner markup (less code or text to do the same thing) than the previous HTML or XHTML which results in faster load times. As noted, in slightly ambiguous language, in the link in the reply above with HTML5 instead of embedding external media (like a video) into a page, it supports that function natively. Depending on the code, computer will probably be able to make more sense of the content (one of the big problems with image-based media and SEO is that to a computer images are nothing but lots of dots). Additionally, HTML5 has semantic elements. Previous to this, the basic 'block' of content was a very generic 'div' Now you can use (or not) elements like 'nav' (navigation), 'section,' 'aside' (for "tangentially" related content), 'article' 'header,' 'footer,' and even a 'link' (different from an 'anchor' which creates a clickable link) element within the body. In this context it means a link that is not clickable or even visible but is intended more to give attribution which is useful to computers trying to figure out what your site is about. And it looks purdy, the best SEO is (normally) what's best for your users.
