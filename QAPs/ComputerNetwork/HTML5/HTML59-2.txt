★Is Bootstrap a complement or an alternative to HTML5 Boilerplate or viceversa?In one corner we have Bootstrap and Foundation, in the other we have HTML5 Boilerplate and similar HTML/CSS starting templates. Can they be used together or do we have to pick a side?
I'd say they compliment each other.  The boilerplate is a great starting point that has no UI components and the Bootstrap is all about UI. I'm actually working on a bootstrap/boilerplate combo that I'm calling html5-boilerstrap here https://github.com/elgreg/html5-... I'm hoping to have it working end-to-end. The main goals: for both the boilerplate and the bootstrap to remain untouched from their originals (already broke that a little to get the normalize.css into bootstrap instead of the CSS reset) using git submodules for the boilerplate build script to still work for LESS to be supported and compiled I'll be presenting on it for work early next year and will post back here if folks are interested.
