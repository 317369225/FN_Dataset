★Is HTML5 better than Flash?
Horses for courses... Video (for desktops) = Flash (for at least 2-3 years) - Flash provides far greater features/functionality for developing/delivering video content to desktops than HTML5. Flash can (automatically) stream video at multiple bitrates vs HTML5 only offering progressive download (not stream) at a single bitrate (unless it's manually switched by the user). Flash has numerous ways to protect video content - HTML5 doesn't. Flash is far more ubiquitous than HTML5, so theres a higher likelihood end users will be able to view Flash content (on desktops) than HTML5 content. Video (for mobile)  = HTML5 - iOS doesn't support Flash so you're out of luck there, Android does have a Flash Player, but it's no longer supported by Adobe - so HTML5 is your best (long term) bet for video on mobile. Gaming = Flash - Flash offers a far greater tooling, ubiquity, and speed over HTML5. Flash's new 3D API (Stage 3D) also allows developers to leverage GPU hardware acceleration, a feature not offered in HTML5. Web Applications = 50/50 - Whist it's true that a lot of web applications are now being developed using JavaScript/HTML5 (and this number is growing), there are still a lot of rich internet applications out there developed with Flex (Flash). These will continue to need to be supported/updated. As such, Flex (Flash) will have its place in the future, but theres no denying that this place will gradually decline as time (and technologies) advance. Desktop Applications = Flash (AIR) - Whilst it's true that HTML5 has 'some' offline features, they are nowhere as advanced/comprehensive to what is offered by Adobe AIR. Whilst this is not strictly a fair Flash vs HTML5 comparison, I feel that as the AIR runtime contains Flash Player, it does fall into this argument.
