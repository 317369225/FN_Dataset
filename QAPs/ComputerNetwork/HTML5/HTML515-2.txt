â˜…Is HTML5 the future of mobile gaming?Will it eliminate fragmentation and allow developers to create one game for multiple platforms and operating systems?
Well, HTML5 certainly ain't the present of mobile gaming! For top performing, high-value games across platforms and devices, you still need to go native. The nice thing is that there are platforms available now (I'm a co-founder at one) that give you the advantages of native code on iOS and Android while still letting you develop cross-platform rather than having to write completely different native code for Android vs iOS. I don't believe we're going to see a rapid rise in HTML5-based gaming (certainly not the high-performance, high engagement games) any time soon. The platforms have more interest in pushing their platform-specific advantages rather than engineering to someone else's common specification. Even if you only care about a single platform (iOS or Android), native code is likely to give you the highest performance for gaming for the foreseeable future.
