â˜…Is the future of Apps HTML5?As well as the applications for PCs, the "native" apps and closed will last a short time, maybe even Google know this already, what you think ? The future of Apps is HTML5?
The future is hybrid. Native apps will stay, but they'll need so much dynamic content, that using HTML5 would make a lot of sense. Look at Kik, one of the fastest growing mobile messaging apps. They're providing developers with access to build 3rd party applications with HTML5. These would be embedded within the Kik native app, within the WebView element. As WebView elements get more robust, more "bridges" are being built between native and non-native. HTML5 content will be able to leverage all the native features.
