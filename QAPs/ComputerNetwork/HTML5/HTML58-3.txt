Use framework to manage your responsive content. This can make ad difference in your output. 2. Make use of App focused features of HTML 5. This way you will be  able to incorporate specific tags as well as universal Meta port tags. 3. Format content for mobile. This will make sure that your website  is compatible with the largest number of device that connects to the  internet. Have things be easily zoomed if necessary or just try to test  how it will work. 4. Slim down on JavaScript, css and images. This way you will be sure  of your websites speed. The speed is one of the major reasons why  people or consumers are drawn to your site. If it takes to load longer  than necessary then maybe you have to scale down a bit. 5. Do not use too many elements when not needed. You don t  have to nest a single <h1> in a header all the time. And if you  have <h1> heading already in your article then an <hgroup>  won’t be necessary just the same. 6. Have all browsers  understand your website. Include a CSS code to make mark up readable and  more semantic. Have it supported especially those in block levels.
