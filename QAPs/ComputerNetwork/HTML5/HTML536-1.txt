â˜…Why is HTML5 worth all the hype?
1. It's open 2. It's machine-readable 3. It's compatible with HTML4 4. It's drafted by w3c 5. It's extendable *UPDATE* After a couple of HTML5 mobile projects, I realized something quite big (which I partly wrote up here: http://www.wewillraakyou.com/201...) HTML5 is going to win on mobile. There is just no way Native SDK's (different on for each platform) can compete with a common framework like HTML5/CSS3/Javascript when it comes to speed of development and maintenance. All the downsides of HTML5 for app development, like lack of native look & feel, clumsy or no access to gps/accelerometer hardware, etc are being sorted out by very efficient library frameworks, like jQuery Mobile, Openlayers, Phonegap, etc. And with Phonegap or Titanium, you can develop in HTML5/CSS3/Javascript, and compile it down to a native app - one codebase for all platforms. A few more links that prove this: Facebook's considering moving their iphone app to HTML5: http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/27... Apple provided a very strong incentive to developers to move to HTML5: http://www.insidemobileapps.com/... Another cross-platform case: http://mashable.com/2011/02/22/h...
