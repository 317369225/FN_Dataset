â˜…What are some good examples of HTML5 mobile websites?
HTML5 was built to replace HTML4 with work starting as early as 2004 but things really became mainstream in 2010 when then-CEO Steve Jobs issued a public letter titled "Thoughts on Flash" where he concluded that "[Adobe] Flash is no longer necessary to watch video or consume any kind of web content" and that "new open standards created in the mobile era, such as HTML5, will win." In short, this technology allows companies to program on a non-proprietary and familiar technology that supports multimedia like videos and animation with great UI capabilities and gestures such as swiping, tapping, dragging, and dropping. It's built to support mobile devices without the need to create and support different apps and no marketing restrictions in the shape of app stores.
