â˜…Is Bootstrap a complement or an alternative to HTML5 Boilerplate or viceversa?In one corner we have Bootstrap and Foundation, in the other we have HTML5 Boilerplate and similar HTML/CSS starting templates. Can they be used together or do we have to pick a side?
HTML5 Boilerplate and Twitter Bootstrap are doing different things but it is relatively easy to combine them. The HTML5 Boilerplate (H5BP) is a starting project template that is designed to be adapted to your needs. Bootstrap is a specialised, modular, HTML/CSS/JS toolkit. H5BP contains a number of best practices or common inclusions for your initial HTML template, which is more like the generic "default" template you would use as server-side global template. Bootstrap does not provide anything like this (nor does it need or aim to). So in this regard, H5BP is perfectly suited to including HTML components from anywhere else (e.g. those from Bootstrap). The H5BP project also contains a comprehensive set of server configs to help provide an optimised experience. Again, this is unique to H5BP and can be used alongside Bootstrap to improve site performance, among other things. The H5BP CSS is a starting point that is largely based on Normalize.css (http://necolas.github.com/normal...http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css (links to: http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css)) (see the Normalize.css and H5BP wikis for comprehensive documentation on each line of CSS). It is there to get you started from a consistent and explained base, but is designed to be interchangeable if that is what you need to do. This means that you can easily switch the default H5BP CSS for the whole Bootstrap Less/CSS toolkit. The Bootstrap Less/CSS uses parts of Normalize.css, so you will still get some of the benefits packaged with the H5BP CSS when using Bootstrap's CSS. There are a few things in the H5BP CSS that you might want to add to Bootstrap - the print styles and some of the CSS helper classes. All the Bootstrap JS plugins are built to work with jQuery, which is included by default with HTML5 Boilerplate, so their inclusion is also not a problem. I hope this has explained how the CSS/JS of both projects is designed to be self-contained, making it easy to switch the CSS/JS subset of H5BP for the CSS/JS that forms the core of Bootstrap. The Initializr project - http://www.initializr.com/ http://www.initializr.com/ (links to: http://www.initializr.com/) - helps you to automatically integrate H5BP and Twitter Bootstrap. Mickael Daniel (aka mklabs) - a contributor to H5BP who has done all sorts of work on the build scripts - has also put together a script that automates the combination of H5BP and Bootstrap: https://gist.github.com/1422879mklabs/bootstrap-plugins.txt (links to: https://gist.github.com/1422879)
