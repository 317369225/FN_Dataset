â˜…Is HTML5 the future of mobile gaming?Will it eliminate fragmentation and allow developers to create one game for multiple platforms and operating systems?
No. HTML5 is great for all apps that are not graphics intensive. Games have to be very performant and have a huge resource requirement (GPU, memory). Moreover the programmers need to perform several optimizations for achieving the game physics and special effects. In app purchasing, notifications, access to gyroscope, accelerometer, GPS, GPU and local storage is essential for gaming. Javascript is not great at achieving hardware acceleration. Moreover OpenGL does not yet play very well with HTML even on desktop.
