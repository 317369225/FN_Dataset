â˜…Is HTML5 hard to learn?
HTML5 has been abused as an umbrella term to describe the whole set of new features that are arriving to various Web standards. This includes CSS3 and new JavaScript DOM APIs. HTML5, in itself, presents a set of new tags such as <video> and <canvas> that help you do nice things such as video-playing without using Flash or other third-party plugins. It also presents several other tags that aren't behavioral, but rather introduce new semantic definitions such as <article> and <section>. But in any case, the whole thing is not hard to learn at all if you already know HTML and CSS (and JavaScript to control elements to such as canvas). It's just 'more stuff and features', if you will to put it that way; no radical changes (although some features have been deprecated/removed, they have more semantically-valid alternatives available).
