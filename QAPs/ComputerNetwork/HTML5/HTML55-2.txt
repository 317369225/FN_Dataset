★Is the future of Apps HTML5?As well as the applications for PCs, the "native" apps and closed will last a short time, maybe even Google know this already, what you think ? The future of Apps is HTML5?
I think it depends.  If you are talking about internal enterprise applications, hybrid looks more promising.  However, if you are talking about consumer facing applications, native will probably remain dominant for most situations.  Native is a lot more stable than HTML5.  The later doesn't even have defined standards yet.  Although there is more coding using native, there is also a lot less QA testing.  HTML5, if you make one change, you have to do a ton of QA testing on multiple devices.
