★Is watching Netflix outside the US via VPN legal?As the VPN server is located in the US, wouldn't Netflix still be technically broadcasting to the US? so they haven't broken any copyright agreement. What do you think about it ? is it still copyright infringement?
First of all, VPNs are not easily obtained. They exist mostly in the corporate world, and their primary purpose is to make a secure connection between company computers, not access to the internet at large. So, chances are high that if you watch a lot of Netflix at work your boss will probably be putting you on the chopping block. Unless that is, they let you take the VPN home with you, which sometimes they do. Mostly in cases of people being sent to work in places like China, where Americans are unimpressed by the stupid government filter, and want real internet in their homes. After all that, I doubt Netflix cares much about people on American VPNs watching them since they're probably Americans, and it would make sense for them to want the US site.    Embed Quote
