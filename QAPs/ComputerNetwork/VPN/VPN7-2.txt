★What is the best free VPN?What are the best free vpn services and should I use vpn? Also how can I make the vpn available on any device with wifi using my computer?
It really depends on what you want to use the VPN for. Sajid's suggestion Zenmate works pretty well, but you can't use it as a full-fledged VPN. They currently offer a browser extension (unlimited traffic)and an iOS and Android app (500MB). I'd be cautions who I route all my traffic through, after all they can see everything! The best way to protect all devices at your home or office is actually quite simple, install a VPN on your router. That way all traffic from any device gets routed through the secure tunnel. The only drawback is that if a site blocks VPN usage, you'll have to disconnect the VPN on the router to use it, leaving all devices vulnerable for that period.  While I was researching Zenmate I found VPN Tips has a great ZenMate review and instructions on How to Install VPN on Your Router, installing IPVanish on an ASUS RT AC68R. ZenMate will NOT work for this purpose though.    Embed Quote
