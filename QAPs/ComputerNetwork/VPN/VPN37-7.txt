★Is watching Netflix outside the US via VPN legal?As the VPN server is located in the US, wouldn't Netflix still be technically broadcasting to the US? so they haven't broken any copyright agreement. What do you think about it ? is it still copyright infringement?
For now VPN is legal to watch Netflix outside the US but I heard some rumors about Netflix is cancelling user accounts, who watch Netflix with VPN outside US but I guess its not totally implemented yet. Choose Best VPN for Netflix - 2015 and enjoy. Cheers    Embed Quote
