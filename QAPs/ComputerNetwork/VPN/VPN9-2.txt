★What is a VPN, in layman's terms?
Perhaps an analogy would work best here. Let's pretend it's 1965 and you're working in an office building with a few hundred people. If you want to send a memo to someone, you could write their name and mailstop on a large envelope, slide your message in, and drop it into your "out" box. The internal mail people would collect the letter and route it to your colleague. This is a private mail system.   Now your company has another office on the other side of the country. If you want to send a memo to a coworker at the other office, you could, again, put his or her name on the large envelope and drop your memo in. Your company could have an employee whose only job is to carry a bag of mail back and forth to each office. That would be a true private network because those letters are never handled by anyone other than an employee of your company.   Or your company could save a pile of money by putting all of the internal letters destined for the other office in a sealed container and simply mailing it first-class through the U.S. Postal Service. A mail handler at the other office would unseal the container and then move the letters along to their final destinations. You wouldn't have to know the street address of the other office, nor would you have to buy any stamps. As far as you're concerned, your co-worker could be sitting one office over from yours rather than 3,000 miles away. This is equivalent to a virtual private network: it seems like it's all happening internally, but you're borrowing public transport to get your letters from one site to another.    Embed Quote
