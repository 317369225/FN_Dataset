★What is the best VPN service in Latin America?I'm going there in a few weeks and I need a strong VPN service with good down/up speeds thats works well in that area.
A few people I know who use a VPN service for US Netflix in Mexico and other Latin American countries recommend Overplay and HideMyAss.  I read a recent, interesting blog post on the the Best VPN Services in Mexico on FlashRouters: https://www.flashrouters.com/blo.... They claim: The most popular VPN service providers with US IP addresses are Overplay, HideMyAss, and IPVanish. All three have a large selection of servers in the US from the east coast to the west coast, NY, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, allowing you to easily switch between popular servers that may be slower than others. To skip straight to the most popular VPN services & VPN routers, read our Best Selling VPN Service/Router List of August. Hope that helps you out. Good luck with the search.    Embed Quote
