★How can I use a VPN in China?
I would greatly recommend a software/expanded application named Hongxin（红杏）in Chrome browser. With user-friendly functions and convenient setting, it is nearly no need for a user to concern with anything. Just for fun! What's more, this proxy provides two websites with VPN for free: Facebook and Twitter (if not change). May hope my introduction can help you.
