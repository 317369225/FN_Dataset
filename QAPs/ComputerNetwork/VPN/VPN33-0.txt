★Can sites accessed through a VPN be tracked?In my office Facebook, twitter, gmail is blocked. I bypassed these sites using VPNbook. Can that be tracked by my bosses??
I don't know that specific VPN service, but VPN done right means three things: Your ISP (in the present case, your boss, of at least your company) know you accessed a VPN service. If the VPN is decently secured (almost all are), they can have no clue to which sites you visited or what you did at all with it merely by monitoring your outbound traffic. The services you have accessed (facebook, or twitter, or whatever) know that they have been accessed from a VPN output node. If you logged in from that access, they know that you accessed them from that specific VPN service. The VPN service provider (in the present case "VPNbook") can theoretically know everything: where you connected from, which sites you accessed, and all the details of the connection (except if you used HTTPS or similar protocols which provide you with another encryption layer not under their control). What they actually do know and/or record/log depends on their privacy policy, their honesty, the legislation under which they operate, the amount of pressure they received from various third parties, etc. So globally: Your boss can easily know you used a VPN. They can guess that it is to work around some limitations/blocks in the corporate Internet access but they can't dig deeper or prove anything based on that information alone. But of course if they see you using Facebook or Twitter while those services are blocked and know you use a VPN, they can put 2 and 2 together. If they asked your VPN provider and if they would be willing to tell, they could hypothetically know which sites you accessed. But most VPN providers won't disclose any information about their users to anyone except people coming with a warrant or equally persuasive stuff.    Embed Quote
