★What is the best free or paid VPN service in Canada?
I have used IPVanish, Strong VPN, but they weren't my option since I wanted a free VPN. Now I'm testing Free VPN from Kepard. They have a super offer. I had just to create an account through a link which was provided by a friend of mine. So far I'm satisfied with it. In case you get interested just register through this link: goo(dot)gl/psm53 and get 15 days of free VPN, then if you like it just invite another friends of yours and get 30 days of free usage per invite. Just give it a shot. :)    Embed Quote
