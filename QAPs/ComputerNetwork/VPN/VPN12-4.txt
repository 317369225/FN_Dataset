★What's the best IPsec VPN client for Android?
I always prefer "Hotspot Shield" free VPN service for Android as it is available as a free VPN service and it just takes a couple of minutes to get complete internet protection for your Android and it allows you to bypass internet filters and access all the websites that you want with a U.S. IP address.    Embed Quote
