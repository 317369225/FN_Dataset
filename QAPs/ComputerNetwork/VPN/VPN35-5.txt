★What are the advantages of a VPN connection?
The main feature of VPN service is its security and privacy. It encrypts the traffic you transmit over the network. To give you more information, I'm going to point some advantages of using VPN in addition to its security and privacy. Surf the web anonymously by assigning a new IP address to your device and hiding your real IP address. Bypass  websites including Facebook, Twitter and Youtube that are restricted by your government, company, school and etc. Protect your data (login credentials, email account, internet banking service) from sniffers while enjoying WIFI Hotspots. Among all VPN services, I recommend betternet service which is totally free and available for iOS, Android, Firefox and Chrome. Check Free VPN Service by Betternet    Embed Quote
