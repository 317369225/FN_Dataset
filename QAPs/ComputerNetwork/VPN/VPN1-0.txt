★What's the best VPN service?
Updated on Jan. 22, 2015 Thanks for your upvotes. I would like to notice you that you can download the application from Page on honx.in directly if you have no access to Chrome App Store. In addition, both of us are able to prolong our warranty period by 10 days if you have installed and registered completely. May enjoy your trip in a new world~ Thanks. ----------------------------------Original Article--------------------------------- There is no "best" one; there is just the most suitable one for you. So, if you just desire to enjoy endless Internet by browsing websites and watching videos on YouTube, I would like to recommend you an application in  "Chrome" browser, which is called 红杏(Hongxing). It is not a free charge software. However, relatively service and high quality of communication. It is just enough for me. If you plan to run Dropbox and others which have been blocked in China. It is more convenient to try any other VPN for you. Otherwise, I am not familiar with these services, and I cannot recommend the one most fit you. Wish you could view a new, larger world out of the Great Fire Wall.
