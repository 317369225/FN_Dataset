★What are the uses of a VPN?Please list as many uses as you can think of.
There are three ways that VPNs are used.  The goal of all three is to connect two points securely. 1.  Site to site - You have two offices and you want to be able to access shared files, internal web sites, etc from both locations.  A VPN allows you to securely do that, which is also known as creating a WAN (Wide Area Network) 2.  Remote worker to office - You have an employee (or multiple employees) that need to access the above resources remotely.  You can install a client on the remote workers device (smartphone, tablet, computer) that gives you secure and encrypted access to the office network. 3.  Personal VPN - A personal VPN is used to encrypt traffic between you and the internet.  Users opt for this so that their traffic cannot be traced or to get through firewalls that block access to certain sites (as in some countries like China, Iran, etc).  Essentially a direct connection is made between your device and a server somewhere outside the country.  From there, you are free to search the web! VPNs come in all flavors and sizes using a wide range of technology (protocols) and topologies.  There are hardware VPNs that require manual configuration and networking know-how.  Then there are software VPNs that may or may not require configuration.  There are a ton of personal VPN providers out there that typically charge $5-$10/month for that service.    Embed Quote
