★Is watching Netflix outside the US via VPN legal?As the VPN server is located in the US, wouldn't Netflix still be technically broadcasting to the US? so they haven't broken any copyright agreement. What do you think about it ? is it still copyright infringement?
Paragraph 6.c. of https://www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse sates, in relevant part: You may view a movie or TV show through the Netflix service only in  geographic locations where we offer our service and have licensed such  movie or TV show.  The content that may be available to watch will vary  by geographic location.  Netflix will use technologies to verify your  geographic location. So, depending on factual details, the situation described in the question could violate the Netflix TOU. I doubt that it would constitute copyright infringement under US law; I am not qualified to comment on the law of other countries.    Embed Quote
