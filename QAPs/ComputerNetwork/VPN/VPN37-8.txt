★Is watching Netflix outside the US via VPN legal?As the VPN server is located in the US, wouldn't Netflix still be technically broadcasting to the US? so they haven't broken any copyright agreement. What do you think about it ? is it still copyright infringement?
It's blocked by your geography, in Australia I think it has to do with arrangements with studios. If you change your IP address it is possible to watch Netflix (the same goes for anything on the Internet). I am answering this question because I was requested to. I know you can watch it, I know media companies don't like you watching it. However this is similar to HBO and Game of Thrones. It is a highly acclaimed show and many big broadcast companies try and get a hold of the rights. However, Warner Bros and HBO don't seem to care too much. It's there stakeholders that care. In terms of law, I think it's hard to enforce. Technically its copy right infringement but are governements really going to throw people in jail for watching a movie subsequently forfeiting tax? Doubt it. Film and Media Companies will have to broaden the scope of business entities like Netflix, the old companies have lost. They need to adapt.    Embed Quote
