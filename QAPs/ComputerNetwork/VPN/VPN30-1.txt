★What is the best VPN app for Android?
There are both free and paid VPN apps for Android its up to you what you use I'd personally recommend paid VPN because free vpn is not secure and can't get good speed.. although if you need VPN for simple browsing you can check out this list Free VPN Android App. Some VPN offer limited bandwidth per day so if you can't afford to pay them keep using them as free with limited service.    Embed Quote
