★Is watching Netflix outside the US via VPN legal?As the VPN server is located in the US, wouldn't Netflix still be technically broadcasting to the US? so they haven't broken any copyright agreement. What do you think about it ? is it still copyright infringement?
I can't exactly say if it is legal or not, but I think if the use of VPN is illegal than it is also illegal. Lets consider that it is illegal on the basis Dana H. Shultz & Mohammad Zamani comments, then why Netflix is not taking any legal action against the VPN services or the users?    Embed Quote
