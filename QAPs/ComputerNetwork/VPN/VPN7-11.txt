★What is the best free VPN?What are the best free vpn services and should I use vpn? Also how can I make the vpn available on any device with wifi using my computer?
I recommend Privatoria VPN for Anonymous Surfing. It is not free VPN at all, I use it paid version (it costs only $2,9 per month), but there is goof free trial for 24 hours to test it. You get nearly 10 server locations for VPN and more than 60 for Proxy. Up to 5 simultaneous connections on different devices. There are tutorials about VPN settings: How to Set Up VPN on Mac OS? How to Set Up VPN on Windows Hope my answer will help you:)    Embed Quote
