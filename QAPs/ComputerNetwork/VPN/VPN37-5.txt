★Is watching Netflix outside the US via VPN legal?As the VPN server is located in the US, wouldn't Netflix still be technically broadcasting to the US? so they haven't broken any copyright agreement. What do you think about it ? is it still copyright infringement?
I have been using PureVPN to unblock Netflix for 2 years now. Not even once has Netflix ever asked me or suspected me of using a VPN. It is a HUGE source of revenue for them, after all.    Embed Quote
