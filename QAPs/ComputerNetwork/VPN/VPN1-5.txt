★What's the best VPN service?
It depends on your requirement. If you are looking for Speed than the provider offering 75+ countries would work best for you. Furthermore, you need to look at the provider on which protocols they offer. In my opinion, HMA and PureVPN are the two Top Tier provider. The only difference is that PureVPN is more economical.    Embed Quote
