★What is a VPN, in layman's terms?
In layman's term, think of the films when the spy is talking to his base and they both put a 'scrambler' on so that to any one else on the phone network it'd just be gibberish but both of them hear a clean conversation. It's as if they have a private point to point connection though actually they are using the public telephone network/ VPN is like that conversation. The difference is that it's 2 computers and data rather than 2 people and speech and the Internet instead of the telephone network.. Additionally, the VPN software at each end checks constantly that the data is coming from where it expects and hasn't been diverted or interfered with enroute. So, at both ends, you need Internet access and the appropriate software to establish and maintain the VPN, carrying out all the encryption, decryption and checking.    Embed Quote
