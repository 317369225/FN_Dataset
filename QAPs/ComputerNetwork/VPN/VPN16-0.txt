Drawback associated with PPTP is it will not provide security and it depends on the actual PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) in order to implement security steps. 2. Site-to-Site VPNSite-to-site is a lot exactly the same thing because PPTP except there is absolutely no “dedicated” collection being used. This allows different websites of the identical business, each using its own actual network, for connecting together to create the VPN. In contrast to PPTP, the actual routing, security and decryption is completed through the routers to both the finishes, that could become hardware-based or even software-based. 3. L2TP VPNL2TP or even Layer in order to Tunneling Protocol is comparable to PPTP, because it also does not provide encryption also it depends on PPP process to get this done.
