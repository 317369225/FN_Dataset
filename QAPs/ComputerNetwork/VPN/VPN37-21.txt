★Is watching Netflix outside the US via VPN legal?As the VPN server is located in the US, wouldn't Netflix still be technically broadcasting to the US? so they haven't broken any copyright agreement. What do you think about it ? is it still copyright infringement?
Netflix doesn't consider those who use VPN services as a serious threat. I watch US Netflix with Hideninja VPN Android Apps on Google Play    Embed Quote
