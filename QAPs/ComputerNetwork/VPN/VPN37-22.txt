★Is watching Netflix outside the US via VPN legal?As the VPN server is located in the US, wouldn't Netflix still be technically broadcasting to the US? so they haven't broken any copyright agreement. What do you think about it ? is it still copyright infringement?
I used VPN many years. Often watch TV shows on Netflix or hulu with VPN. I am fine now.    Embed Quote
