â˜…What are the best virtual private networks (VPNs) for use in China?Am looking for something that's easier to set up and has more stable access that works well on PC, Mac and Smartphones.
For advanced users, set up your own virtual private server in Hong Kong, Taiwan or USA with a static IP. There are numerous services out there for this. Just find one that gives you unlimited or high transfer per month. With this you can basically do anything you want, including setting up VPNs, tunnels or encrypted proxies as you need. As for smartphones, note also that all Blackberries running on plans outside of mainland China will not be subject to blocking inside China, because they go through APNs outside China. It's one of the seldom-mentioned advantages of BB's over iPhones/Androids/other devices. However, you will still need to find a reasonably-priced international data plan to do this without being charged a fortune. I have one, but it's not a well-advertised plan (and most of the customer service reps or stores don't actually know how it works).For advanced users, set up your own virtual private server in Hong Kong, Taiwan or USA with a static IP.
