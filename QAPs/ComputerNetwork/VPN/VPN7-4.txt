★What is the best free VPN?What are the best free vpn services and should I use vpn? Also how can I make the vpn available on any device with wifi using my computer?
For  my VPN I use Onavo Protect. It's free on the App Store and very easy to  use. You just have to download the app, let it install a profile, and  you're done. You can then turn it on and off from the main settings  page. There are no extra charges, and it's free forever.    Embed Quote
