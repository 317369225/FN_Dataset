★Can sites accessed through a VPN be tracked?In my office Facebook, twitter, gmail is blocked. I bypassed these sites using VPNbook. Can that be tracked by my bosses??
If you are using any free VPN then he can easily be tracked and even you are on risk with your data which can be stolen as well so better to use reliable VPN service.. There are many available at cheapest cost use them if you want to access blocked sites.    Embed Quote
