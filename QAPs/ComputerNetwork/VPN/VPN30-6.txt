★What is the best VPN app for Android?
It depends on what you're looking for. There are plenty of providers out there with Apps and most will provide you with set-up guides for using the built in VPN services. Unfortunately the built in settings only allow for PPTP and L2TP and OpenVPN is the most secure so you will need to download an app. Most providers don't put OpenVPN into their client apps actually so you might be better off just downloading the OpenVPN Client App and using .ovpn configuration files. This is of course all subjective depending on what you wish to use it for and how you wish to use it. The best way to determine which one is best for you is browsing review sites such as ours 5 Best VPN for Android - By BestVPN or any others mentioned within these comments.    Embed Quote
