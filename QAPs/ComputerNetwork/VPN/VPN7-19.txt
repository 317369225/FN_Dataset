★What is the best free VPN?What are the best free vpn services and should I use vpn? Also how can I make the vpn available on any device with wifi using my computer?
I don't trust on Free VPN if you ask me. They are quite unworthy to trust. If your concern for using a VPN is to secure your identity then Free VPN is the worst decision you will going to make, believe me. But if you want to try their services, then yes it is quite a wise decision. Like 15 days trial or a month free VPN. And, if your concern is unblocking website then Zenmate is way better than any VPN. you also have Hola.    Embed Quote
