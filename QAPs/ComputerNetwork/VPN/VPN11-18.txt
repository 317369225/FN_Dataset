★What are the best virtual private networks (VPNs) for use in China?Am looking for something that's easier to set up and has more stable access that works well on PC, Mac and Smartphones.
Many VPN providers you can use. I suggest you to install VPN before arriving in China. Free: FlyVPN(free trial everyday), VPN Gate, SoftEther. Paid: FlyVPN, StrongVPN, Astrill I've been using FlyVPN for 3 years. It always work for me. Chinese government is blocking some VPN providers like StrongVPN, Astril, PureVPN... You can use FlyVPN trial VPN account to test in China before investing money. I think there is no risk for you. Good luck! Official website: http://www.flyvpn.net .    Embed Quote
