★Is watching Netflix outside the US via VPN legal?As the VPN server is located in the US, wouldn't Netflix still be technically broadcasting to the US? so they haven't broken any copyright agreement. What do you think about it ? is it still copyright infringement?
How can USA law apply to somebody in South Africa, Australia or the UK that is using a DNS or VPN to workaround geo restrictions. Personally I would not touch a VPN for this, a DNS option is a lot easier, cheaper and provides better performance, both to Netflix or to other websites you browse at the same time. If you use a DNS service like Unblock-US then anybody anywhere in the world can gain access to Hulu to watch totally free tv shows and Netflix, Hulu Plus and Prime Instant Video to stream as much tv and video you can consume. If you are from outside the USA then check out Unblock-us.com and stop missing out. It does not cost much but there is a free trial so you can test it out first for free in a trial.    Embed Quote
