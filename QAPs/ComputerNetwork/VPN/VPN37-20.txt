★Is watching Netflix outside the US via VPN legal?As the VPN server is located in the US, wouldn't Netflix still be technically broadcasting to the US? so they haven't broken any copyright agreement. What do you think about it ? is it still copyright infringement?
Yes, you're change ip only, and it is not prohibited . I often go to Europe for work and because I want to watch netflix, we have to find a way out - use this service here: Boxpn VPN Service Provider Gives a stable and fast connection.    Embed Quote
