★Free VPN X Paid VPN. What is the difference?
With Free VPN you always have speed issue, streaming issue, security issue, data can be stolen, logs issue, no gaming support (Lag/Ping issue), limited features, less IPs, easily traceable etc.. With Paid VPN you can get good streaming, gaming support, high security with great protocols, complete anonymity, full features (split tunneling, kill siwtch etc), dedicated IP, multi login, different countries servers, no logs etc.. Paid VPNs available at cheap cost so better to use them "Cheap VPNs that Deliver Value for Money".    Embed Quote
