★Is watching Netflix outside the US via VPN legal?As the VPN server is located in the US, wouldn't Netflix still be technically broadcasting to the US? so they haven't broken any copyright agreement. What do you think about it ? is it still copyright infringement?
From a company perspective they wouldn't care provided you pay for their services. From a legal perspective anything can happen. There is an old Indian saying that if you are riding on a camel a dead dog may climb up and bite you. It depends upon how much negative thoughts you can put in. Most of the times you have to use common sense in these occasions. VPN service blocks your IP from being broadcasted. There is a way to still know what your IP is but regarding the fact that you're using a paid entertainment service I would doubt that will be the course which any agency will choose. I am not a lawyer so I don't believe in the dead dog hypothesis.    Embed Quote
