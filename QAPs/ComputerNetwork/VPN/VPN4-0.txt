★What are the uses of a VPN?Please list as many uses as you can think of.
Here are some important uses of VPN: 1) Use Public or Hotel wi-fi securely: Public wi-fi offers no encryption security to its users, and your signals are broadcast for anyone savvy enough to eavesdrop, therefore some people use VPNs at Wi-Fi hotspots to prevent snoopers from collecting private information. Generally, the most effective way to keep your data from entering the wrong hands is by using a VPN service which makes all Internet use totally private and secure. 2) Secure Communication Between Sites: Many businesses today have branch offices, and connect these branches to the main office over the Internet using a site-to-site VPN connection. For example, a businesses can enable workers with laptops on the road or at home to connect to the company network as if they were sat at a desk in the office. A company that has offices in two locations can connect them using a VPN across the internet so there appears to be one network. Linking remote sites with a main office lets users send and receive information via a secure connection. Employees can use file servers and printers which are not physically in the same office. 3) Bypass the Web Censorship and Content Surveillance: Some countries put up firewalls to restrict what their residents see, hear, and share with other people within and beyond their borders. Connecting to a VPN server will enable you to 'tunnel out' of the censorship restrictions and access the full World Wide Web. 4) Access to the restricted contents: By using a VPN service, you can manipulate your machine's IP address to specific location like US, therein you can unlock access to Netflix and Streaming Content from Outside the USA.    Embed Quote
