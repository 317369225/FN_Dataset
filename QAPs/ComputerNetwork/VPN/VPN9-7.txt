★What is a VPN, in layman's terms?
Virtual Private Networks are computer networks that use secure access to the organization through public telecommunication infrastructure. The purpose is to maintain the security of data transmission in and out of the intranet while being cost effective at the same time, this connection is facilitated by a process called ‘tunneling’. VPN, could therefore, be divided into two, one of them could be two independent physical networks to make them operate as one, while the other could be a client who is connected to an organization network to work as part of that entity. In a nutshell, works over private as well as public networks like the internet does though without the intervention of any outside party.    Embed Quote
