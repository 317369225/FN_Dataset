★Is watching Netflix outside the US via VPN legal?As the VPN server is located in the US, wouldn't Netflix still be technically broadcasting to the US? so they haven't broken any copyright agreement. What do you think about it ? is it still copyright infringement?
Simply put there is no law to dictate these circumstances. Until somebody takes someone else to court over this issue, legally speaking currently it is not legal or illegal. I am not an attorney nor do I practice law, take this advice at your own risk.    Embed Quote
