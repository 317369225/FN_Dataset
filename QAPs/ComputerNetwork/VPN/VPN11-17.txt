★What are the best virtual private networks (VPNs) for use in China?Am looking for something that's easier to set up and has more stable access that works well on PC, Mac and Smartphones.
In my opinion, business VPN service has the potential risks of packet sniffering, unstable connecting and great chance of being shut down by GFW, espeically these can be found by web search and have a lot of users. More likely, some of the long-standing VPN providers are honey pots involved with the government. So I bought a  cheap foreign vps to build VPN servers for myself and friends.  BTW, if you want a short-term VPN service, I would provide you with mine for free.    Embed Quote
