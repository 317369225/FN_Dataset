★Is watching Netflix outside the US via VPN legal?As the VPN server is located in the US, wouldn't Netflix still be technically broadcasting to the US? so they haven't broken any copyright agreement. What do you think about it ? is it still copyright infringement?
I don't think so, but I'm not an expert in this area. I haven't heard of anyone being charged for doing this and I think the practice is fairly widespread. It seems like Netflix would be reluctant to punish paying members for this as it would be bad for business.    Embed Quote
