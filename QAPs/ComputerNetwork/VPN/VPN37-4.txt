★Is watching Netflix outside the US via VPN legal?As the VPN server is located in the US, wouldn't Netflix still be technically broadcasting to the US? so they haven't broken any copyright agreement. What do you think about it ? is it still copyright infringement?
Bypassing region restrictions through gimmicks like this is not illegal in a criminal sense. Nor does it impact Netflix's licensing agreement with the content owners, unless their agreements specifically say "don't allow people to use VPN". Which is entirely likely.    Embed Quote
