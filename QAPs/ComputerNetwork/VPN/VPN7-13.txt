★What is the best free VPN?What are the best free vpn services and should I use vpn? Also how can I make the vpn available on any device with wifi using my computer?
There are actually a lot of free VPNs over the web. I personally use ZenVPN I tried it for free at first then subscribed when the free trial expired. If you value your privacy its necessary to use a VPN or you can also use it to access websites that are not available on your region.    Embed Quote
