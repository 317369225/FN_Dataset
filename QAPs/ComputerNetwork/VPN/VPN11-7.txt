★What are the best virtual private networks (VPNs) for use in China?Am looking for something that's easier to set up and has more stable access that works well on PC, Mac and Smartphones.
I have no  idea about the situation now as the sophisticated Chinese firewall  keeps upgrading however, last year, purevpn software helped me to bypass  the restriction. One of the things it asks when it sets up the software is where you're  based - with the two answer you can give being: 1) China 2) Rest of the world So I think they still have that all locked down - so I think it worth to give it shot.    Embed Quote
