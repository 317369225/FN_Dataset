★What is the best free VPN?What are the best free vpn services and should I use vpn? Also how can I make the vpn available on any device with wifi using my computer?
There are many services to choose from like hma, vyper, ipvanish, astril & purevpn. I am personally using PureVPN I have tried their free trial in the beginning and then bought their subscription and using it since past 8 months and I am really satisfied as they are offering unlimited bandwidth with 5 multi login. You can try their free apps on Google Play & iTunes stores for android & iPhone.    Embed Quote
