★What's the best VPN service for China?
based on the reviews read here, i opted for Astrill VPN ...eh...also because it was the only site that opened in china as well. its really good, superfast. immediate connectivity even during peak hours.FYI, webfreer and freegate have been blocked since 1st jan 2015. the rest of the paid VPN mentioned here do not open here in china nor are they available at torrent sites. so pls do ur homework at home, before landing here. will try another VPN after 6 months and will post my review here.    Embed Quote
