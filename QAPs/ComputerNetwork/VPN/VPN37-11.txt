★Is watching Netflix outside the US via VPN legal?As the VPN server is located in the US, wouldn't Netflix still be technically broadcasting to the US? so they haven't broken any copyright agreement. What do you think about it ? is it still copyright infringement?
Yes and no. Technically yes it is a violation and you are the violating party. No in that there is no way that they can prove you are the violating party in a court if your VPN is doing its job right. Since most VPNs do not do a good job of protecting your identity the only thing really protecting you is the amount of work getting their proof versus how much coin you can be sued for. As an example, HBO knows for a fact that more people download illegally Game of Thrones than watch legally on TV. They do not do anything about this.    Embed Quote
