★What's the best VPN service?
I have used many.  HideMyAss has proven to be trustworthy, reliable and has tons of servers to choose from.  They may be more pricey, but it's worth it. If you are looking for something less expensive, Tunnel Bear gives you 500mb a month free and if you give a shout out on twitter once a month, they give you an extra 1GB free, each month.  Decent speeds and good customer support as well.    Embed Quote
