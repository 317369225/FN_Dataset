★What's the best VPN service?
I use Witopia in China to get around the Great Firewall.  I occassionaly have speed or connection issues but I've so far been very happy with it and recently renewed my annual subscription.  You can also browse under a US IP and access sites like Hulu, etc.  Actually, they offer IPs from just about every major city in the world.    Embed Quote
