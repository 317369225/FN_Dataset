★How many types of VPN are there?
Their are two main  categories of VPN.  1) Lan to Lan (aka Site to Site) and 2) Remote  access.  With lan to lan VPN's, there is some device (router, firewall,  concentrator) that terminates bot ends of the connection.  With Remote  access, there is a piece of software installed on a PC/Laptop on one end  and the other end would be terminated into a router, firewall or  concentrator.   Within  each of those two broad categories, there are many technologies that we  use to achieve security and access accross a public network.  This is  where you get into some crazy acronyms like ISAKMP, IPSEC, AH, ESP, SSL,  DTLS, DH, RSA etc, as well as EZ VPN.  So I could probably spend the  rest of the day going into details of each of those, so let me know  where you still have confusion.   Regarding  main mode, vs aggressive mode.  Main mode is preferred.  Most equipment  will attempt main mode first.  There are exceptions.  One of these  exceptions is when using EZ VPN (typically from a Remote Access  solution) with pre shared keys.  Since the group name is necessary to  authenticate against the preshared key, we need to send the IKE ID  earlier on in the setup.  So if you allow remote users to connect with  the Cisco VPN client using a preshared key, if you disallow aggressive  mode, the connections will fail.   Beyond  that, the most important thing is that the technologies on both ends  agree on what will be used.  Post back and let me know which areas that  you need more discussion with.    Embed Quote
