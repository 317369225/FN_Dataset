★What is the best VPN app for Android?
Hidemyass is pricey, but you can't beat the amount of servers and speeds they offer.  It is my VPN of choice. Otherwise, TunnelBear is good.  You get 500mb a month, free and if you give a 'shout out' via twitter, they throw in an extra 1GB each month.    Embed Quote
