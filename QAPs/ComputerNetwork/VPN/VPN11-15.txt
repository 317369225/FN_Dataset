★What are the best virtual private networks (VPNs) for use in China?Am looking for something that's easier to set up and has more stable access that works well on PC, Mac and Smartphones.
StrongVPN... I've been using it for the last 3 years... smooth, fast, and has enough servers to play around on that if one gets blocked, another pops up... Most of my friends use Astrill but it went down earlier this year and has been spotty since (according to friends)... My VPN worked smoothly the entire time Astrill was down...    Embed Quote
