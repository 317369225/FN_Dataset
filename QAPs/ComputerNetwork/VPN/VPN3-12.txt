★What's the best VPN service for China?
I would suggest you to try a couple of different options to verify they are operational from China. Most major VPNs offer a free trial or money-back guarantee. My own favorites include IPVanish, Private Internet Access, BolehVPN, HideMyAss, and VyprVPN. HideMyAss and VyprVPN both have beautifully designed apps with builtin Killswitch.
