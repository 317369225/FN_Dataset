★Is watching Netflix outside the US via VPN legal?As the VPN server is located in the US, wouldn't Netflix still be technically broadcasting to the US? so they haven't broken any copyright agreement. What do you think about it ? is it still copyright infringement?
You are a paying customer of Netflix, so you are not stealing from them in any way at all. The content being provided on Netflix has all passed copyright laws as long as you’re paying to access it. When it comes to the specific question of whether or not it is legal to watch Netflix in Australia this quote probably sums it up best: A spokesperson for Attorney-General Robert McClelland told The Australian last week: “In relation to the use of VPNs by Australians to access services such as Hulu and Netflix, on the limited information provided there does not appear to be an infringement of copyright law in Australia.” So it doesn’t violate any copyright law in Australia. Australia also has a parallel import law in conjunction with the USA which also clearly defines accessing Netflix as legal. - See more at: Page on netflixaustralianow.com.au    Embed Quote
