★Can you use a VPN on an iPhone or iPad?
Sure, iPad and iPhone supports 3 different types of VPN.  1. PPTP VPN  2. L2TP over IPSec VPN + pre-shared key or RSA  3. Cisco VPN  PPTP is the most popular one and supported by most of VPN providers.  L2TP has in general better encryption, but since most VPN providers uses common pre-shared for all users it becomes increadible weak comparing to PPTP with 128-bit MMTE encryption.  Please find setep by step instruction of PPTP VPN for iPhone here:  VPN iPhone Seed4.Me - Private VPN Club  Or setup by step instruction of PPTP VPN for iPad here:  VPN iPad Seed4.Me - Private VPN Club    Embed Quote
