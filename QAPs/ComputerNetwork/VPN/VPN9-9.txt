★What is a VPN, in layman's terms?
In layman's terms VPN is a way to encrypt all your internet traffic between you and us and pass it out through us. Those on your local network, whether a public wifi or other unsecure location, will be unable to see what you do or the data you pass. The Virtual Private Network is a safe connection to the network by using a "tunnel". Businesses use them therefore people can canal through externally (Internet) in to the company's personal network & get access to sources just as in case your setting at the desk at the office. VPN provides a layer associated with security so other people can't (hopefully) log on towards the corp network and use it can resources or see data transmissions between computers on the web. with good vpn for turkey.    Embed Quote
