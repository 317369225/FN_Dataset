★What is vpn?
A VPN is a network that uses a public telecommunication infrastructure, such as the Internet, to provide remote offices or individual users with secure access to their organization's network. A VPN ensures privacy through security procedures and tunneling protocols such as the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol ( L2TP ). Data is encrypted at the sending end and decrypted at the receiving end.
