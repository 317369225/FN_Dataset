★Is watching Netflix outside the US via VPN legal?As the VPN server is located in the US, wouldn't Netflix still be technically broadcasting to the US? so they haven't broken any copyright agreement. What do you think about it ? is it still copyright infringement?
I am not completely sure, however it is most likely one of those times when the action is technically violating the Netflix Terms of Use, but is so widespread that it is virtually legal. As others have mentioned, it would also depend on the specific laws in the foreign country pertaining to copyright.    Embed Quote
