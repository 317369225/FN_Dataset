★What is the best free or paid VPN service in Canada?
Free: VPN Gate, SoftEther VPN.... You can search free VPN in google, you will get millions of results. Paid: http://www.flyvpn.com,  http://www.blackvpn.com..... I don't know which one is the best paid or free VPN services. It all depends on your usages. If you want to use VPN just for anonymous. I suggest you to buy paid VPN service to protect personal privacy. If you want reduce ping/fix lag for online games, FlyVPN recommended. You can also test with its trial VPN service before purchasing. I glad to find some VPN services which can provide trial service before paid. Because many factors are effecting VPN performance. Only test by yourself can show you which one is the best VPN service.    Embed Quote
