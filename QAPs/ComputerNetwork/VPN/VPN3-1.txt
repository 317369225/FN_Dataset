★What's the best VPN service for China?
on mobile phone,i use a app named fqrouter2.it's friendly to the newbie and totally free. On pc, i use goagent(it's not a vpn program but proxy program). It's free and quick but now it's very difficult for newbie to setup. So i strongly suggest buy a vpn service. Dont use free vpn service ,they all slow and unstable    Embed Quote
