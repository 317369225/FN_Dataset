★What is the best free VPN?What are the best free vpn services and should I use vpn? Also how can I make the vpn available on any device with wifi using my computer?
I like using OpenSSH (openssh.org) software to create VPNs of own using TCP forwarding. It's free software. So I power up a little AWS micro instance for this.    Embed Quote
