★Where is the Fourier sine/cosine series ever used in the real world?While studying maths I had a lecturer tell me that the only place he'd ever seen the sine series used was in a biscuit factory where it was/is used used to check the roundness of biscuits (cookies) on a production line. Any more examples?
To take a special case of Rob Weir's answer, one of the simplest and most impressive applications of the Fourier series is in musical synthesizers.   (See Moog Synthesizer http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moo... and Fourier Synthesizer http://www.physics.ucla.edu/demo...). What's really cool is that it doesn't take too many superimposed sine waves to get close to a real world sound, like a violin string. There's even an "app for that" : http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/f... This can be an engaging way to introduce students to the topic.
