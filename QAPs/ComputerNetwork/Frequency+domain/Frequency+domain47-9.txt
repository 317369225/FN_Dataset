★What advice would you give to an electrical and electronics student that you wish you were given when you started your course?All advice  are welcome!
"Change majors." No really, I wish someone had convinced me to do so. Electrical Engineering was hell on earth for me. My passions and interests lie elsewhere, and I tricked myself into thinking I could just power through the intense curriculum. I did it, but it was rough. The extreme work load forced me to see a therapist in order to cope with pre-existing issues. Stress does that to people. I think a secondary piece of advice that would have led me to a better decision as to my major in college would have been to get an internship, research position, etc. that allowed for hands on experience with Electrical Engineering. Whatever you decide, you will be happy on the other side of your degree. I certainly am.
