â˜…Where is the Fourier sine/cosine series ever used in the real world?While studying maths I had a lecturer tell me that the only place he'd ever seen the sine series used was in a biscuit factory where it was/is used used to check the roundness of biscuits (cookies) on a production line. Any more examples?
One great application that has been left out is MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). The raw data that comes out of the MRI scanner is in the Fourier Space which is converted to an image by the software in the scanners.
