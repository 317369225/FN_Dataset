★What are basic difference between time domain signals and frequency domain signal? What are some daily life examples for these type of signals?
These are just two different ways of looking at the same thing.  A continuous signal can be operated on using a Fourier transform to give a series of discrete frequencies, whereas a transient signal when operated on by the transform gives a continuous band of frequencies.  The former is more useful usually. In practice, a continuous note can be usefully considered as a sum of various frequencies, while a transient noise is more usefully considered in the time domain as a sudden change of sound pressure, rather than as a smeared out array of frequencies. In audio, you can hear the difference in approach when comparing a loudspeaker designed for frequency response flatness as compared with one designed for transient accuracy.  Often the latter will be more exciting but colored sounding, while the former is accurate but drab.
