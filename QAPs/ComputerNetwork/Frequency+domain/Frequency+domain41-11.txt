★What are things that electronics and telecommunication engineers (ECE) know while other engineers don't?
1. Electronic Engineers know that "B.B.ROY of Great Britain had a Very Good Wife" :D This is a line most Electronic Engineers (at least in India) use to remember and calculate resistor values. The letters in CAPS/BOLD represent the Color Codes used on Resistors: 2. Electronic Engineer's are fond of something called as 'Moore's Law' which states that : "over the history of computing hardware, the number of  transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every  two years"  ( from Co-founder of Intel; Gordon Moore) and the fact that we have moved from this, to this, is a testament to the Moore's Law. Moore's Law for the past 10-12 years: 3. John Bardeen,the inventor of the most basic element used in Electronics i.e  'Transistor',  is the only person to have won 2 Nobel Prizes for Physics. He is also the inventor of Superconductivity. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCS... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tra... 4. Electronics Engineers work at a different scale than what we as humans can perceive. The variations of voltages by a 100 mV can cause a reputed company like Intel losses upto 1 Billion Dollars. http://venturebeat.com/2011/01/3... They also work in a nanosecond time frame. The designs are super complex and something like 100 ps/100 ns can be a big differentiator on whether your phone sends that text message to the right person or not. 5. Only Electronics Engineers can build something awesome & low-cost like this. A DIY LE-Dominoux: Find similar awesome low-cost 555 timer projects @ http://makezine.com/2011/04/21/5... 6. The "Special" tone available to users of Nokia phones when  receiving SMS (text messages) is actually Morse code for "SMS".  Similarly, the "Ascending" SMS tone is Morse code for "Connecting  People," Nokia's slogan. The "Standard" SMS tone is Morse code for "M"  (Message). 7.A simple concept like Static Electricity( yes, the one we used to attract paper pieces to comb in our childhood) is a huge factor in Electronics and Semiconductor Industry. Industry experts have estimated average product losses due to static to range [up to] 33%. Significant precautions are taken to ensure that chips are not prone to ESD (Electro Static Discharge) Failure. ... (more)Loading...
