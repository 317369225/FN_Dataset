â˜…Where is the Fourier sine/cosine series ever used in the real world?While studying maths I had a lecturer tell me that the only place he'd ever seen the sine series used was in a biscuit factory where it was/is used used to check the roundness of biscuits (cookies) on a production line. Any more examples?
everywhere, for example, you use it to explain colours of a Rainbow!
