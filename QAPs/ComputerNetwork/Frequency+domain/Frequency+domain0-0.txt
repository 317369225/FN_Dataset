★What is frequency domain in image processing?
In basic terms, an image is a signal that's perceived in 2 spatial dimensions: height and width.  When analyzing signals, it's often helpful to represent it in a form other than spatial extent (AKA the time domain).  If you perform a fourier transform on the image (signal), you can represent the signal another way, in a frequency domain, where the signal has been decomposed into a series of constituent trigonometric functions.  This representation allows you to see, measure, and modify the signal in a different way than is possible in the spatial domain. Techniques like Fourier analysis are sufficiently valuable that many college courses in 2D image processing require a prerequisite course in 1D signal processing.
