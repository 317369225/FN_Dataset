★What are things that electronics and telecommunication engineers (ECE) know while other engineers don't?
Electronics and Telecommunication (ECE) Engineers are like magicians we can do everything. Muggles you want to see some magic. Time Bomb Ahhh Stupid Muggles. This is what they think It's R.E.T (Remote electric tilt) Hey  Muggles you want to learn something today First of all what is Tilt ? The tilt is used when we want to reduce interference and/or coverage in some specific areas, having each cell to meet only its designed area. Tilt has two types: 1. Mechnical Tilt 2. Time bomb ( R.E.T) Mechnical Tilt It's very easy to understand just push the antenna. Tilt can be Up or down. We mostly use down tilt. R.E.T Now this is your time bomb attached to Antenna Stay away from tower. By the help of R.E.T we can achieve any tilt. In this case we change the characteristics of signal phase of each element of the antenna. So if you aren't getting enough coverage in you area. Just by our single script run .... Ahhh I think you got it. See you later Muggles.
