â˜…When people talk about converting a time domain graph to a frequency domain graph via Fourier analysis, is the frequency domain graph at a specific time in signal or does it represent the entire signal's period of existence?
A Fourier transform is always about the entire time history of a function from to . If you provide a function fragment defined over a finite interval to any of the standard FT flavours it will be implicitly extended to infinite length in a way that may or may not be what you expect or want. If you use a Fourier series (where you do an integral over the function and end up with an infinite series), the function is implicitly extended by making an infinite number of copies so as to make a periodic function of which the source is just one period. If you use a Fourier integral (where you do an integral and end up with another function), then the function is implicitly padded out to infinity with zero. And if you use a Discrete Fourier Transform (where you sample the function at N points and get back N complex or 2N real amplitudes) then then the time domain source function is implicitly padded with copies as for the Fourier series and in addition the resulting frequency domain function is forced to be periodic. This results in aliasing, where high-frequency (above half the sampling frequency) components in the original signal show up in the low-frequency section (as well as all the implied copies of it).
