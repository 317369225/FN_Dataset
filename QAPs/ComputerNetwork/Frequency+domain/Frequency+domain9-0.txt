â˜…Digital Signal Processing: How do you explain (without doing any calculation), that convolution in time domain should imply multiplication in frequency domain?I'd like to know about some non-mathematical argument or intuition.
Multiplying two periodic signals means adding their frequencies. A periodic signal is and if you multiply it to some other signal you get . The point of the frequency domain is you make a signal up out of a bunch of different frequencies, i.e. But to take a simple example, let's have If you want to multiply them, you have But this is just what is meant by the convolution of and . From here, I think it is easy to understand more complicated cases. I don't think that an explanation "without math" (as the question originally asked) makes any sense. To do it without calculation, you might try to translate what I've said here into pictures of rotating circles (as in Mark Eichenlaub's answer to What is an intuitive way of explaining how the Fourier transform works?), but I think that would actually make it harder to understand, not easier. see also Mahesh C. Shastry's answer to Digital Signal Processing: What can one do to explain convolution and its importance in the most simple manner?
