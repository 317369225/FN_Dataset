★Does pole zero modelling belong to time domain or frequency domain?
Pole-Zero modelling belongs to Frequency Domain. When you express the behavior of a system in terms of a rational expression which is simply the z-transform of output divided by the z-transform of the input (in the case of CT systems, it is the laplace transform), the poles and the zeros help you in characterizing  that how would the system behave in terms of the  frequency characteristics of the input and output.  Several properties of a system like stability can be characterized in terms of such quantities. Such arguments can be used to predict the behavior of a system in response to some time-domain input. However that is also done by examining the time-domain input in terms of its frequency characteristics....
