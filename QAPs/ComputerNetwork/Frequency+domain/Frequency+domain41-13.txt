â˜…What are things that electronics and telecommunication engineers (ECE) know while other engineers don't?
I, personally love the field of communication and probability theory better than any other subjects. We might study some outdated syllabi from different authors but we know that the particular field of study never goes outdated. I am an Electronics & Telecommunications Engineer working now, as a Software Engineer. Frankly speaking, I do programming for a living. Apart from my own experience, on the global basis, we are silently better programmers than the obvious Computer Science and IT amateurs. We might not have the concepts of C or OOPs at first, but once begin to understand, we feel the code behaviour better and we will have better approaches while programming. It may be because we come with the concepts of execution and machine cycles from Microcontrollers etc. but that was only a nudge as a student. At the very least, we always have a basic idea of what's happening inside of laptop or a smart phone. We know what's happening between hitting the call button and receiving the response from the other side. India might not have produced as many good Electronics & Communication Engineers as we would have liked but the field still seems promising for the foreseeable future to come.
