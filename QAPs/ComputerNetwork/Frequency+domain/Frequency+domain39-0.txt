â˜…What are the real world applications of Laplace transform, especially in computer science?
In computer science it is hardly used, except maybe in data mining/machine learning. Laplace Transform is heavily used in signal processing. Using Laplace or Fourier transform, you can study a signal in the frequency domain. This can be a powerful tool. For instance, if your signal is smooth over time, it means that, in the frequency domain, you're very likely to find only small frequencies. Similarly, the concept of filtering signal/data is based on a frequency domain interpretation. The only difference between a Laplace transform and a Fourier transform lies on the domain. A Laplace transform can be seen as a generalization of a Fourier transform. From a system point of view, a Fourier transform gives information on the steady state, while the Laplace gives information on the steady state as well as the transient state.
