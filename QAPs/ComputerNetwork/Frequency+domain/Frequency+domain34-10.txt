â˜…Where is the Fourier sine/cosine series ever used in the real world?While studying maths I had a lecturer tell me that the only place he'd ever seen the sine series used was in a biscuit factory where it was/is used used to check the roundness of biscuits (cookies) on a production line. Any more examples?
FROM OP: I can understand your frustration with my lecturer but please be aware that this was back in 1986. This is long before the digital revolution which (from comments) relies heavily on the implementation of the series in modern digital communication devices. But thanks to everyone I now have an answer!!
