★What is the meaning of frequency domain?
A lot of Electrical Engineering involves problems which can be addressed more readily by considering signals as composed of sines and cosines at various frequencies.  Just as logarithms make multiplication problems easy, working with capacitors and inductors as frequency sensitive components makes solving some circuity problems much easier.  The mental switch from attempting to solve a problem as a time dependent function to expressing it as a function of frequency is referred to as working in the frequency domain. Fourier transforms adds additional breadth and rigor to the approach.  In that case every signal expressed as a time dependent function can also be matched to its frequency dependent pairing.
