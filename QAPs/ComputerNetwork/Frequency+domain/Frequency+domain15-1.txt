★In OFDM, (if IFFT is used to convert signals from frequency domain to time domain) how do we take the IFFT of the input signals without transferring them into frequency domain first?If I'm wrong, at which block of the OFDM flow diagram does the input signal first gets transferred to frequency domain in order to take IFFT effectively?
Basically OFDM is a specific form of Multi Carrier modulation. So when we have bit stream it can be modulated onto a carrier using a sine and/or cosine pulse. So in effect we can use a exp(jwt). Let Xi be the symbol to be transmitted on the ith sub-carrier.Modulated signal Si=Xi*exp(j*2*pi*i*(B/N)*t) where B is the Bandwidth and N is the number of sub-carriers. And B/N is the carrier spacing and each subcarrier is at i*(B/N)  Hence the net transmitted signal summation of all Si, since they are transmitted simultaneously. Summation (Si)=S(t) = Summation (Xi*exp(j*2*pi*i*(B/N)*t)) Now, this would require us to have N modulators corresponding to the N sub-carriers which is difficult to implement. So, in this case what we do is we look towards Nyquist. The Bandwidth of the signal= B. i.e from -(N-1)B/N to (N/2)(B/N) in steps of B/N. Hence the signal can be sampled at a rate twice the maximum frequency to recover the original signal. So, in our case,        sampling rate= 2* (N/2)*(B/N)= B.       sampling time = Ts= 1/B. Hence considering the 'uth' sample we simply replace 't' by 'uTs '                         Si(uTs)=Xi*exp(j*2*pi*i*(B/N)*uTs) Now replacing Ts =1/B we get                          Si(uTs)=Xi*exp(j*2*pi*i*(B/N)*u/B)                          Si(uTs)=Xi*exp(j*2*pi*i*(u/N) Now the composite symbol Summation of S(uTs) = Sum(Xi*exp(j*2*pi*i*(u/N))) which is nothing but the IDFT of Xi. Thus, I feel that it is a mathematical interpretation that has led to the signal being treated in this format. Instead of N modulators, we can perform IFFT on the signal to get the IDFT which is the samples of the modulated transmit signals. Therefore an FFT on the receive side will act as a coherent demodulator for the signals.
