★What is the advantage of carrying filtering in the frequency domain over spatial domain?
The primary reason is that in frequency domain, the process of filtering i.e. convolution simplifies to multiplication. Basically the concept of frequency domain mathematics says that given a function and a kernel , the filtered output can be written as where * represents the convolution operator. Convolution can be explained as placing the kernel over the signal and basically summing up the element-wise products and replacing the anchor value with the sum. On the other hand, in frequency domain, the output is simply given by where   and are the Fourier transforms of their respective functions. This representation is both computationally and spacewise efficient as both may be represented as sparse matrices as well in most cases. And hence, we use frequency domain for filtering. Generally though, for separable filters, it makes more sense to just use the separated components one at a time.
