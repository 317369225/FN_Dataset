â˜…I know that Laplace, Z and Fourier Transforms converts a function in the real time domain to a function in the complex frequency domain, but what is the inherent difference between the three in layman's terms?
There are (arguably, in a broad sense) six kinds of transforms, not just three. For continuous-time signals: Laplace transform (LT) Continuous-time Fourier transform (CTFT) Fourier series (FS) coefficients - only for periodic signalsFor discrete-time signals: Z transform (ZT) Discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) - only for finite duration signals The table below gives a comparison. Below is some technical explanation: LT is defined inside a region of convergence (ROC) in its frequency domain. Outside ROC, its value is undefined. CTFT is a special case of LT. For a continuous-time signal, CTFT exists only if the ROC of its LT includes . This corresponds to imaginary axis on the s-plane. For such signals, the CTFT can be calculated by substituting . FS coefficients of a periodic signal can be thought of as sampled version of its CTFT in the frequency domain. Analogous to above, ZT comes with an ROC, and DTFT of that signal is defined only if the ROC includes unit circle on the z-plane, i.e., . Thus DTFT is a special case of ZT. DTFT is periodic in frequency domain with a period of because . DFT can be thought of as discrete-time analogous to FS, and also as the sampled version of DTFT in the frequency domain. Since continuous signals cannot be stored on a computer, the transform used in most practical signal processing applications is DFT. We should also note that discrete-time signals can have any real amplitude (which includes irrational numbers), so they need to be quantised in amplitude while storing on a computer (thus making them digital signals).
