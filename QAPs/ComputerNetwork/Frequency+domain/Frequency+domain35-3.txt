★What is something electrical engineers know that others don't?
Ever Wondered What’s Inside This Bead At End Of Your Laptop or Mobile Charger? This is called ferrite bead or, more generically, a choke. It’s a fancy name for what’s basically an electromagnetic wave-bouncer. If you open this bead, you will not find any complex circuits but only a ferrite cylinder that is magnetic in nature. It is this magnetic quality of the bead that serves the purpose. So basically, when current passes through any cable, it generates electromagnetic interference (EMI). Electronic gadgets generally produce EMI during operation. For example, if you connect a camera to your monitor, the camera would produce intereference and cause your monitor to flicker without the presence of a ferrite bead. If left unabated, EMI can wreck havoc with your computer peripherals. These ferrite chokes ensure that signals are only sent in the intended directions and no EMI is transmitted between the peripherals. The choke dampens these EMI waves by acting as an EMI blocker. The blocking is most effective when it is near the source of the EMI, that's why you will only find these ferrite beads near the end of the cables. source: Bead At Charger
