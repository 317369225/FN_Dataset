★What advice would you give to an electrical and electronics student that you wish you were given when you started your course?All advice  are welcome!
1. Get involved with as many clubs as possible. IEEE, society for engineers, most campus' have tons of things going on. 2. Meet people. This correlates to #1 but don't limit yourself to just students. Most professors are more than willing to help with questions you have or point you to someone who can help. The people you meet today are the future leaders of tomorrow. 3. Play with the engineering tools! Labview, MATLAB, Cadence, IAR - Most universities offer this software to engineering students for free. The more of these you familiarize yourself with now the less shocked you'll be when you get to the real world. 4. Fail often, fail fast. You should already know this but very rarely is your first attempt at something going to work flawlessly. Especially in senior design. The quicker you fail the quicker you get to something that works. 5. Find a mentor or mentors. Find an engineer you want to be like and ask them lots of questions. They love to pass on stuff to younger folk. 6. Biggest thing is to remember that you're going to school to learn how to learn. Keep your textbooks for reference.
