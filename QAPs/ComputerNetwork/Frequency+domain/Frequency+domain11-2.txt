â˜…When people talk about converting a time domain graph to a frequency domain graph via Fourier analysis, is the frequency domain graph at a specific time in signal or does it represent the entire signal's period of existence?
An infinite sum of fourier components with fixed amplitudes in time will work. What gives the particular value of the original pulse amplitude at a particular time is the relationship between the phases of the component sines at that instant.
