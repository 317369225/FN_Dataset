â˜…If I apply a Fourier transform on a decaying/rising pure sine signal of frequency f, what value of amplitude do I get in the frequency domain for f? Is it the average amplitude of the signal over the time interval that I'm considering?
Why dot You try it on MATLAB or any such software! Actually trying it yourself and then analyzing the reason for the particular frequency response is perfect for learning ! Post your answers too
