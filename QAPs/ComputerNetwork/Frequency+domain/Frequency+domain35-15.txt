â˜…What is something electrical engineers know that others don't?
The buzzing noise you hear just before an incoming call doesn't prove that your psychic powers are working. Your mind doesn't detect phone calls. (sorry!) Source: Pix Your PC speaker set or the TV simply converts the conversation (pulsations) between your cellphone and the network tower from radio frequency to audio frequency. Solutions to avoid that noise? - Move the phone away from your speakers - Airplane mode (to remain undisturbed while listening to music) - Create electromagnetic shielding (I would love to see your Faraday cage if this is how you choose to eliminate the noise) Here's a technical explanation of the interference I found on MetaFilter. The type of interference can occur if the following things happen together: 1) a pulsing radio transmitter, 2) with relatively strong power, 3) in very close proximity, 4) to a non-linear circuit element. The non-linear circuit element is usually some sort of solid state device such as a transistor or diode. If the non-linear element is subjected to a strong pulsing radio signal, it will act as a rectifier and "detect" the pulsating waveform, i.e., convert the pulsations from a radio frequency to an audio frequency (if the pulsation rate is in the pass-band of audio frequencies.) For example, a hearing aid consists of a microphone, an audio amplifier and a small speaker. If a strong pulsating radio signal impinges upon the first transistor amplifier stage, the transistor will be driven into its non-linear range and detect the pulsations. If the pulsation rate is in the audio frequency range, the rest of the hearing aid amplifier will amplify this and deliver it to the speaker, to the great annoyance of the hearing aid wearer.
