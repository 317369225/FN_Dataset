â˜…How does a Laplace transformation of any time domain function give a function within a frequency domain?
I'm sure some will offer complete answers to this question but it seems confusing. Why ask a variety of individuals, many who are poorly qualfiied, to explain the frequency domain/time domain transition when it is so straightforward to read a text or Google it or even look it up in Wikipedia? How would you even know how to evaluate the validity of our (Quorans) response? I will continue to follow the question. If it becomes clear that you are looking for something more specific, I won't hesitate (if possible) to help.
