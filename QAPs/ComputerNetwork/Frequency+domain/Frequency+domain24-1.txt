★I know that Laplace, Z and Fourier Transforms converts a function in the real time domain to a function in the complex frequency domain, but what is the inherent difference between the three in layman's terms?
In layman's terms there is no difference.  The differences are pretty technical.  They convert from time domain to frequency domain, just like an equalizer on your stereo. The difference though is that the Fourier transform is similar to the Laplace transform, but is a little less general.  The Laplace domain variable is a general complex number, whereas that of the Fourier domain is purely imaginary.  In the Laplace domain, you have a 3D surface which is a function from one complex number to another.  This actually requires 4 dimensions to represent.  The Fourier domain is just the slice of the Laplace domain along the imaginary axis.  And this requires 3 dimensions to visualize, but is usually represented by 2 2D plots: frequency versus magnitude and frequency versus phase.  Finally, the Fourier transform can only be applied to stable systems, that is, ones that don't "blow up" as time goes to infinity. The z transform maps to the same domain as that of the Laplace transform, but a version of it that has been "rolled up into a cone and flattened". See the bilinear transform. en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_transform Disclaimer that this is my understanding, Im not certain that my explanation is accurate, I would be happy for someone to validate.
