â˜…What are things that electronics and telecommunication engineers (ECE) know while other engineers don't?
An Electronics and Telecommunication engineer would know what goes behind the 1600 x 1000 wallpaper you see. Every black and white image is an m-by-n matrix. Every element of this matrix represents a pixel of differing gray level intensity values, typically ranging from 0(black) to 255(white). The matrix for the above image is too large to fit in the screen(503 x 319 = 160457 matrix elements). So, here is an example: A colour image is made of 3 basic colours- RGB(red,green,blue). For a colour image, each pixel has 3 such values- one for each of RGB. Here is a sample: This link may give a better idea: Matrices and Digital images
