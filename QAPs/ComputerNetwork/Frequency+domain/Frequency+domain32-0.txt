â˜…If I apply a Fourier transform on a decaying/rising pure sine signal of frequency f, what value of amplitude do I get in the frequency domain for f? Is it the average amplitude of the signal over the time interval that I'm considering?
That depends on how it rises or decays. You'll get the frequency component of the fundamental plus the frequency components of the rise or fall profile.
