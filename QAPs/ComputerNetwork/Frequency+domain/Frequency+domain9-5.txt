â˜…Digital Signal Processing: How do you explain (without doing any calculation), that convolution in time domain should imply multiplication in frequency domain?I'd like to know about some non-mathematical argument or intuition.
For simplicity, I consider the discrete time domain. Consider two three digit numbers 111 and 222. Their multiplication yields 24642. This can be viewed as convolution of two discrete time signals [1,1,1] and [2,2,2] whose convolution yields the signal, [2,4,6,4,2]. Here, the digits in each of those numbers represent the component of the three frequencies: 1, 10 and 100 and hence, their convolution in frequency domain (111 * 222) yielded their multiplication in the time domain (24642).
