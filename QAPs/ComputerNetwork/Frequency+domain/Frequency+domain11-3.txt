â˜…When people talk about converting a time domain graph to a frequency domain graph via Fourier analysis, is the frequency domain graph at a specific time in signal or does it represent the entire signal's period of existence?
It will represent the entire signal's period of existence, and not some particular instance. It, thus, works perfectly if the signal is periodic, or, the frequencies in play exist for the entire duration of signal. Else, if signal is something like: 10Hz for first half, and 20Hz for second half; the transform would give the set of frequencies which play for entire duration to create a similar effect - it will be approximate, and would never be able match the original signal exactly. Several other transforms (like short time fourier transform) try to overcome this by using a sliding-window approach; window represents a portion of time axis. and conversion is done in segments of that time axis - one window at a time - as the window slides. (As John noted, Heisenberg's uncertainity principle doesn't allow you to know the exact frequency details at exact time instances; you can specify a time-range, and get a description of frequencies in that range.)
