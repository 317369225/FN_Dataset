â˜…What is the solution for solving the diffusion equation in a frequency domain for tissue?I have this image and I want to know how they reached this equation by solving diffusion equation. I can send the full article if you want to. Thanks in advance.
I assume (for the sake of brevity) that you understand the meaning of the terms and assumptions involved in writing the diffusion equation, and that your main hurdle is understanding how to go from the time domain to the frequency domain. It actually just involves taking the Fourier transform of the entire equation (originally in the time domain). If you compare the original diffusion equation (in the time domain) with the one in the frequency domain, you'll notice that there is essentially just one term that is different: in the time domain has been replaced by . This is just a consequence of the fact that a derivative in the time domain is a multiplication by in the frequency domain. It is fairly easy to prove this once you know the definition of the Fourier transform (here is one such short proof). Note that the rest of the derivatives in that equation are with respect to spatial co-ordinates, and hence remain unchanged after taking the Fourier transform (only time-dependent derivatives get transformed). Also note that and are actually the Fourier transforms of and .
