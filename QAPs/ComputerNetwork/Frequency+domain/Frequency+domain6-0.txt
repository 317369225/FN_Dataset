â˜…Does the brain produce and process EM waves in the frequency domain?
Does the brain produce and process EM waves in the frequency domain? This is a confused question. First, the brain does not produce nor process EM (electromagnetic) waves. The neurotransmitters in the brain and central nervous system use an electrochemical process. Second, there are brain "waves" at different time durations known as "slow" waves and "rapid" waves and stuff in between. Since they are at different frequencies and are processed, they are are processed in the frequency domain. Anything in the time domain that is comprised of different frequencies is processing in the frequency domain as well.
