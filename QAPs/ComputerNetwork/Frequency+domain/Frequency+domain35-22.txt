â˜…What is something electrical engineers know that others don't?
That the highest ROI (Return On Investment) for a university major or even independent study is Electric Engineering and Computer Science, and that one of the easiest ways to create a "unicorn" (a start-up valued at $1 billion or more) or a "decacorn" (start-up valued at $10 billion or more) is to create new communication devices. There are 7.5 billion people in the world (official counts undercount by hundreds of millions) and by 2020 at least six billion of us will be connected to the wireless broadband Internet. A person who understanding electrical engineering is able to design a device, or be part of a team that designs a device, that can get funding, and reach an audience of thousands, millions or billions of people, who think there is a huge barrier to creating new and novel electronic devices. Consider the "King of the Unicorns", Xiaomi's CEO, Lei Jun. His company is now valued at $46 billion, based on making an inexpensive mobile phone. If you understanding electrical engineering, designing a new mobile phone is simple. If you don't, it seems difficult. As the author of the first book on 4G, "Brave New Unwired World: The Digital Big Bang and The Infinite Internet", published by John Wiley in 2002, I can assure you that even when you spell things out for people in writing and give them a decade, it still takes entrepreneurs a very long time to get around to making new and novel form factors for electronics. We are only at the first 1% of different mass marketed electronic devices related to wearable computing, augmented reality, and virtual reality, but only those who understand electrical engineering have a straight path to building products and companies in this area without reliance on a partner, who might think, "What do I need you for? I am the inventor."
