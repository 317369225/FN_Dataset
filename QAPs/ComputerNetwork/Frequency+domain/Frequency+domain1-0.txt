â˜…What is the meaning of frequency domain?
Mathematically, it means taking the Fourier transform of something that is a function of time. Intuitively, it means taking something something that varies in time and figuring out how 'much' of various frequencies went into it. You can think of it as sort of like taking a batch of paint that somebody has mixed and separating it into its constituent colours. And here's something freaky: Your ears to this for you. Try getting a hold of a keyboard or a piano and play a C major chord. Wolfram Alpha is kind enough to not only show you which keys to press but also inform you that the frequency of the notes are 261.63, 329.63 and 392 hertz. Let me show you what the air pressure hitting your ear drums looks like as a function of time - i.e. in the time domain: (It'll look differently with a real piano due to noise and overtones, but with three perfect tone generators making just the notes c, e and g, that's what you'll get). Hmm, we can see there's something periodic about it, but what? If we Fourier transform it into the frequency domain, we get this: Narrow peaks around the frequencies that went into the signal. Oddly enough, this is what your brain experiences - not a seemingly chaotic signal varying in time, but three clear and distinct notes. It's awesome. Of course this is an idealized signal - in reality, you obtain something like this: Apparently this was used to work out the notes and instruments that went into the famous opening chord of Hard Day's Night a few years ago: Mathematician Cracks Mystery Beatles Chord. Anyway, I hope that provides a bit of intuition.
