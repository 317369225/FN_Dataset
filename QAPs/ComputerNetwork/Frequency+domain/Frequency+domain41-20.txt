â˜…What are things that electronics and telecommunication engineers (ECE) know while other engineers don't?
The difference between 'k' and 'K' while mentioning units of data or throughput. When I prepared rough copy of my M.Tech project thesis and showed it to my Professor in IIT-M, he immediately pointed out that I used "Kb/s" and "kb/s" interchangably at various locations in my thesis. He told that even many people who work in industry also does this common mistake. k stands for kilo expressed in powers of 10, i.e., k means 1000 K stands for kilo expressed in powers of 2, i.e., K means 1024 So, 2 kb/s means 2*1000 = 2000 bits per second where as 2 Kb/s means 2*1024 = 2048 bits per second. Not sure whether this point is known exclusively to ECE engineers because CSE engineers are acquinted with it too. Nevertheless, I feel it is worth mentioning it in this topic. :) *EDIT* I searched for standard, turns out actual way of writing is "Kib" or "KiB" for 1024 and kb for 1000. :) You can check from official link here: The binary prefixes
