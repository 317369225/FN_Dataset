★What are the differences between the Fourier series and the Fourier transform?
The series is the result you will have when you do a transform to a function, you get such long list with sin and cos,which you calculate easier, or make it possible to analys a funktion that doesn't look pretty, in the case of  non periodic funktion we need Laplace transform, this thing looks the same like Fourier but has some items with factors with minus exponent, that's the part of the funktion exceeded the period you manually selected...
