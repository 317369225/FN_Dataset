â˜…Digital Signal Processing: How do you explain (without doing any calculation), that convolution in time domain should imply multiplication in frequency domain?I'd like to know about some non-mathematical argument or intuition.
I just read this and found it pretty convincing: What can one do to explain convolution and it's importance in the most simple manner? In his answer, he uses the z-transform to make his point. Very elegant, IMO. Convolution -> Polynomial multiplication. It is that simple. It is the coefficients which you see as the time domain expression, and the polynomial (sum of exponentials) which you see in the frequency. Makes perfect sense in the discrete domain.
