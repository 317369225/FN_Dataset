★Which domain is more important, frequency domain or time domain for communication engineering?
For communication Engineer asking this question is equivalent to asking what is important for life whether it is water or air.    Time domain relationship describes  all changes occurring as the time changes,it gives information with respect to only parameter time.     But in frequency domain, we get information about how randomly or how fast signal is changing.According to great scientist Fourier,every periodic signal can be constructed using combination of sine and cosine signals,so frequency domain analysis describes how many and exactly which are sine and cosine signals to be added to get original signal,in short tells maximum and minimum frequency component present in signals.  So for Communication Engineering,knowledge of both domains is must i.e. communication engineer should know all the relationship between time and frequency domain along with changes that are going to happen in other domain when something is changed in either of two.people will say frequency domain since it gives more information along with time,but communication engineer also has to care about what is going to happen in time when some operations are done in frequency domain otherwise it will hamper quality of signal .In my opinion studying both thoroughly is must.
