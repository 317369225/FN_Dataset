★What advice would you give to an electrical and electronics student that you wish you were given when you started your course?All advice  are welcome!
We've already got some awesome pieces above. A few more: 1. Never be scared of learning any topic/subject which seems difficult, or is perceived by others that way. (Try to) Study everything! You may never find your interests unless you explore all the options. 2. Throughout your course, grab one subject/topic/area of interest which YOU like, and get your basics clear in it. That knowledge will give you the needed self-confidence for your bright career ahead.
