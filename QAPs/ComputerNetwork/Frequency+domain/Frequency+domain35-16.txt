â˜…What is something electrical engineers know that others don't?
LOWER FAN SPEED DOESN'T MEAN LESS POWER CONSUMPTION. A regulator has a Resistance in it.The Regulator can be a Rotary one that enables smooth increase or decrease of fan speed, or may have Steps as 1,2,3,4 ,5,, this raises the speed in steps. The energy consumed by any fan is not reduced by regulator. As you turn the regulator it moves on the variable Resistor (Resistance) and depending upon the point of contact of the regulator , the voltage applied to fan is varied and consequently the fan either speeds up or slows down.The Energy consumed becomes two parts now.One is lost as heat energy in the regulator and the balance is used for rotating the fan.You can see feel the regulator getting hot by touching it. It has ventilation provision at the top , so that the heat can go out easily. So a Regulator of a fan has nothing to do with the Energy. But with the advancement of technology, this drawback has been eliminated.
