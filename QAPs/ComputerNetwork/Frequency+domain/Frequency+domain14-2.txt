â˜…Why does sampling in time domain result in periodicity in frequency domain for any signal?
First of all how do we sample a signal? We multiply the signal by the dirac delta at specific points with equal spacings. Now you are in the stage prior to transforming the signal to the frequency domain. Consider you have a real signal, say, a recording of you saying something for 5 seconds. If you plot the waveform you'll know that you're signal is not periodic. Fourier transform, however, "assumes" periodicity. This is called periodization. You take your 5 second recording and plot it again and again once your recording gets over. By doing this you get a periodic waveform. Imagine this as plotting your sample points on a circle from 0 to 2Pi. Once you reach 2Pi (or 0) your samples repeat. So what you'll see in the fourier domain are replicas of your original band centered at 2pi, 4pi and so on. So, for this waveform of your voice, the fourier transform is periodic. Hope that helps.
