★Digital Signal Processing: How do you explain (without doing any calculation), that convolution in time domain should imply multiplication in frequency domain?I'd like to know about some non-mathematical argument or intuition.
The first challenge is to explain convolution without talking about integrals and time shifting inverted functions.  The simplest thing I could find in the Wikipedia article might still be too complex.  So, with some some oversimplification that you may or may not find acceptable, you could describe convolution as replacing every point on a first function - call it f(t) - by a second function - call it g(t).  For example, if you convolute a square function - f(t)=1for 0<t<1, otherwise f(t)=0 - with the familiar bell curve, you get a round shouldered square.  How far the shoulders extend depends on how spread out the bell curve is.  So then you can think of f(t) as a sine or cosine function with some frequency and g(t) as another periodic function with a different frequency.  Think of the convolution as replacing every point on the function with lower frequency by the function with the higher frequency.  The resulting function will have a higher frequency that the low frequency function.  The higher frequency turns out to be the product of the frequencies of f(t) and g(t).  You could prepare and show pictures of f(t), g(t) and f*g to illustrate this. Let me know if this is satisfactory.
