★What advice would you give to an electrical and electronics student that you wish you were given when you started your course?All advice  are welcome!
To add specificity to some of Koustubh's points: 1) Learn applied math. Specifically - llinear algebra, differential equations, probability and statistics. You'll find tons of excellent resources online (MIT OCW etc.) 2) Join a local HAM radio club or robotics club. Form one with like minded people if there isn't one already. 3) It never hurts to have CS knowledge. Participate in programming competitions, open source projects (GSOC for instance), and read about compilers, operating systems, principles of programming languages on your own (Udacity is a good source).
