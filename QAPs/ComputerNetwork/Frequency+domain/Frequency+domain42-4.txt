★What is the difference between an 'integrator' and a 'low pass filter' & 'differentiator' and a 'high pass filter'?
I don't think you can say a low pass filter and an integrator have "no difference."  A low pass filter will try to reproduce on its output the low frequency portion of whatever signal is applied on its input.  That means that if you apply a fixed non-zero DC voltage to a low pass filter, it will produce a proportional fixed DC voltage on it's output.  The same signal applied to an integrator will produce an ever-increasing voltage, rising at a rate which is proportional to the applied DC voltage, but not leveling off (subject, of course to the limitations of power supply voltage).  These two behaviors are definitely different, not "essentially the same".  Similarly, a high pass filter will try to reproduce on its output the high frequency portion of whatever signal is applied on its input.  This means that if you apply an AC signal at a frequency above the high pass filter's cutoff frequency, it will produce on its output a signal proportional to the input signal.  The same signal applied to a differentiator will produce an AC signal whose amplitude is proportional to the rate-of-change of the input signal, not proportional to the amplitude of the input signal.  These two behaviors are definitely different, not "essentially the same".
