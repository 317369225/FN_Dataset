★What is something electrical engineers know that others don't?
When electricity was harnessed there was a debate between AC alternating current and DC direct current. Mr. Edison wanted DC current and Mr. Westinghouse wanted AC current. The public wanted neither forms of power due to its lethality in their homes.

AC is more efficient for transmission, but can't be stored as AC;  and DC  can be stored in batteries but is not efficiently transmitted. http://www.smithsonianmag.com/hi... After Edison developed the first practical incandescent light bulb in 1879, supported by his own direct current electrical system, the rush to build hydroelectric plants to generate DC power in cities across the United States practically guaranteed Edison a fortune in patent royalties. But early on, Edison recognized the limitations of DC power. It was very difficult to transmit over distances without a significant loss of energy, and the inventor turned to a 28-year-old Serbian mathematician and engineer whom he’d recently hired at Edison Machine Works to help solve the problem. Nikola Tesla claimed that Edison even offered him significant compensation if he could design a more practical form of power transmission. Tesla accepted the challenge. With a background in mathematics that his inventor boss did not have, he set out to redesign Edison’s DC generators. [more in link above]
