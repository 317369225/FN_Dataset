★Where is the Fourier sine/cosine series ever used in the real world?While studying maths I had a lecturer tell me that the only place he'd ever seen the sine series used was in a biscuit factory where it was/is used used to check the roundness of biscuits (cookies) on a production line. Any more examples?
The Fourier series essentially tells how any periodic signal can be decomposed into a weighted sum of simple sine waves.  So you can have two equivalent representations of the same function:  one in the "time domain" (amplitude as a function of time) and one in the "frequency domain" (power as a function of frequency).  You can transform back and forth between these representation using the Fourier Transform.  The power comes from the fact that there are important operations that can be done very easily in the frequency domain.  For example, to filter out certain frequencies in a sound clip is almost trivial to do in the frequency domain.  So you have applications where a signal is transformed from time domain to frequency domain, then modified in the frequency domain, and then transformed back to time domain.  Filtering, noise elimination, etc. Similarly, this generalizes to 2D functions as well.  So you can have 2D Fourier transforms of images.   This can be used for powerful techniques, such as deconvolution, where an image that is blurred can be restored. In a world of digital data, in sound, image and video, the Fourier series is almost everywhere, most commonly via an algorithm called the Fast Fourier Transform or FFT.
