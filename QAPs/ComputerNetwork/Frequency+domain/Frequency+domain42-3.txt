★What is the difference between an 'integrator' and a 'low pass filter' & 'differentiator' and a 'high pass filter'?
These terms are distinct and describe the properties of a filter.   A 'low pass filter' passes signals below a cutoff frequency and attenuates frequency components above that frequency.   A 'high pass filter' passes signals above a cutoff frequency.   A 'band pass filter' passes signals within a particular frequency band (of interest).   A 'differentiator' provides the derivative of the signal, and  has a particular frequency response .  This has a magnitude response which is proportional to frequency, and a phase response of 90 degrees.   An 'integrator' provides the integral of the signal, and has the frequency response .  This has a magnitude response which is the reciprocal of the frequency, and a phase response of -90 degrees.  (It has infinite gain at DC.)   These properties can be combined into a single filter.  You can, for example, have a 'low pass differentiator', which outputs the output of the derivative of the low frequency portion of the signal; or a 'band pass integrator', which integrates the particular band of interest only.
