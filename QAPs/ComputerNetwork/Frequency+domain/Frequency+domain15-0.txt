★In OFDM, (if IFFT is used to convert signals from frequency domain to time domain) how do we take the IFFT of the input signals without transferring them into frequency domain first?If I'm wrong, at which block of the OFDM flow diagram does the input signal first gets transferred to frequency domain in order to take IFFT effectively?
OFDM is a frequency-division multiplexing technique using multiple orthogonal carriers. Each channel uses a Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) technique. In the transmitter the components of the complex input of each channel are lowpass filtered with pulse-shaping filters, multiplied respectively by a cosine and sine carrier, and added together. Alternatively the complex filtered input can be multiplied by a complex carrier. In other words instead of using cos(jωc t)  and sine(jωc t)  it uses   exp(jωc t), where ωc is the carrier angular frequency of the channel. Basically it performs the operation (I + jQ ) exp(jωc t). However this is the typical operation performed by an FFT or IFFT. In the IFFT the  complex conjugate of the product is used. The OFDM uses the very efficient algorithm of the FFT to perform the QAM modulation (in the transmitter) and demodulation (in the receiver) of the channels. By convention they decided to use the IFFT in the transmitter and the FFT in the receiver. In the receiver the complex conjugate version of the transmitter  carrier is used.
