â˜…Is frequency domain processing always faster than time domain processing because of FFT?We use FFT for large scale signal processing in usual because we can replace complex convolutional processing in the time domain to less complex multiplication processing in the frequency domain. Hence, it is wondering wether frequency domain processing is always computational efficient than time domain processing or not. If it is not, could you show some related examples for easy understanding?
Depends on the situation. For a counter example see Juillerat, N., Schubiger-Banz, S., & Arisona, S. M. (2008, July). Low latency audio pitch shifting in the time domain.
