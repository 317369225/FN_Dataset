â˜…Digital Signal Processing: How do you explain (without doing any calculation), that convolution in time domain should imply multiplication in frequency domain?I'd like to know about some non-mathematical argument or intuition.
My 2 cents.. Consider the simplest filter of them all, one that simply scales and translates any input. Now, if you observe the time-domain input-output relationship of this filter, you will clearly see that that the output signal is scaled and translated by the designed amount compared to the input. Mathematically, this can be expressed as convolving the input signal with a scaled dirac delta to obtain the output. Now, consider the effect of this filter on the input signal's frequency spectrum. The filter's frequency response is simply a scaled DC function with constant phase.You will see that the spectrum of the output signal is also simply a scaled version of that of the input signal with a constant phase offset. Again, mathematically, this amounts to simply multiplying the input signal's spectrum with the filter's frequency response. Hence the connection.
