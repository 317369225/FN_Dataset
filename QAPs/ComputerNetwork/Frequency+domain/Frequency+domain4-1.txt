â˜…Which domain is more important, frequency domain or time domain for communication engineering?
Time Domain- In the time domain, the data is analysed over a time period.We only get to know a certain amount of properties.Some of the properties are not visible in the time domain. -ex:Checking the Amplitude of the signal wrt time.(We need to note down values for every time instant) Frequency Domain- The properties that are hidden in the time domain come to light in the frequency domain which gives us a better understanding of the overall signal. -ex:Checking the response of the signal wrt frequency.(The variations in the signal provide us sufficient information about the signal) Frequency domain is mostly preferred because it's gives us a broader point of view but that again depends on what type of analysis you really want.
