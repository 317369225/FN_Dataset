â˜…What is something electrical engineers know that others don't?
Electricity is like water. Given two paths, it will always take the path of least resistance. Often, folks have difficulty understanding why certain circuits operate the way they do because they haven't considered this truth. [Note: As the comment below correctly points out, the above is an over-simplification in order to get the point across to those who are not electrical engineers. Given two paths, electricity will indeed divide itself in inverse proportion to the resistance of the two paths (higher resistance implies lower voltage/current). However assuming nearly zero resistance in one path and nearly infinite resistance in the other path, nearly all of the electricity will flow down the path of least resistance.]
