★How did Fourier understand that he can convert a wave from a time domain to a frequency domain?
Here is some speculation. Fourier actually only came up with Fourier series.  Fourier transforms which relate functions in the time domain to functions in the frequency domain came later.  They were named to honor him, not because he invented them. John Bailey's answer to What is the relationship between Laplace Transform and Fast Fourier Transform in evaluating convolution integral? provides speculation on how the transform concept originated.  Note specifically in this case Laplace was a contemporary of Fourier and did develop his transform in that period. In his work in which he originated the use of Fourier series concepts, they were used to describe the way heat flows in a metal bar.  The partial differential equation that describes such flow is one and the same as the Black-Scholes formula for options pricing. In a later paper Fourier showed the fundamental mechanism for Global Warming! In the 1820s Fourier calculated that an object the size of the Earth, and at its distance from the Sun, should be considerably colder than the planet actually is if warmed by only the effects of incoming solar radiation. He examined various possible sources of the additional observed heat in articles published in 1824[14] and 1827.[15] While he ultimately suggested that interstellar radiation might be responsible for a large portion of the additional warmth, Fourier's consideration of the possibility that the Earth's atmosphere might act as an insulator of some kind is widely recognized as the first proposal of what is now known as the greenhouse effect. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos...
