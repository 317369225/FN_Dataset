â˜…How does analysis of signals in the frequency domain become easier?
One reason why people go for frequency domain analysis is that there are many uncertainties about a signal in time domain. What I mean is signal amplitude is always random. Let me explain it with the help of an example. Consider a speech signal. As you know it is impossible to find any pattern in the signal, so very hard to perform any analysis (Probabilistic Analysis is possible though). But speech signal are generally limited to 4000 Hz in frequency domain. So irrespective of amplitude response, just the information about the bandwidth of a signal gives you a strong basis to design a system. Ex: All the filters are designed with the information about bandwidth and cutoff frequency.
