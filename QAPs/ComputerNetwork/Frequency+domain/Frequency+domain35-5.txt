★What is something electrical engineers know that others don't?
There is a specific reason for usage of Incandescent Bulbs in industries, rather than Stroboscopic Effect. Flourescent: When the light of specific frequency emitted from CFL bulbs falls on rotating parts like ,Exhaust fans,Enthey create some optical illusion due to  reflections and make the rotating parts appear slower or sometimes reflects  its rotation in reverse direction. This is called stroboscopic effect. Here are some examples: This might lead to accidents sometimes. Hence they use Incandescent bulbs in industries to prevent stroboscopic effect. Instead of using incandescent lamps, They use two which eliminate stroboscopic effect by producing out of phase intensities from those two bulbs and thereby nullifying the effect. Source: Stroboscopic effect Light the dangers of stroboscopic effect With Single phase supply, one lamp of tube light is connected with capacitor so that the intensities of each bulb will be out of phase. Our human Eye has a property of Persistence of vision.When we use two lamp-tube light, the intensity of one bulb will be maximum, at the same instant  when the other bulb intensity is zero.(Due to phase shift currents) Thereby you will be having uniform illumination when the light reflects on rotating bodies and your eye literally see continuous motion. Consider this waveform:
