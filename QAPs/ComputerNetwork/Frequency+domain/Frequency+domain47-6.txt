★What advice would you give to an electrical and electronics student that you wish you were given when you started your course?All advice  are welcome!
- Build a clear picture of how the different concentrations in your interest correspond to fields in industry, and the products/applications/research that exist/how long they've existed/and are new designs dwindling or expanding. -Specifically go to the websites of research lab groups and look at their projects/published papers.  You won't understand them in the beginning but it is extremely helpful to get even a small notion of what is hot in the field and whats out there. -Talk to as many graduate students as you can.  These guys will have a much clearer idea of the field.  Talk to Professors and people in industry as well. -Absolutely make sure to build a portfolio of projects.  Pick something that interests you the most and has enough breadth to be started with a simple but conclusive design, and allows you to make it more complex, for example, pick a circuit design application and start with already made chips and breadboard, simulate that with cadence/spice, then as you learn more in your coursework, do IC level designs on it.
