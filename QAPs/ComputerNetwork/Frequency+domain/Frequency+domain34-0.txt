â˜…Where is the Fourier sine/cosine series ever used in the real world?While studying maths I had a lecturer tell me that the only place he'd ever seen the sine series used was in a biscuit factory where it was/is used used to check the roundness of biscuits (cookies) on a production line. Any more examples?
The Fourier transform, which converts a signal into a weighted sum of sine waves and then back again, is the secret ingredient that makes all lossy media compression possible! MP3 is a lossy audio compression algorithm, as is JPEG for still images and MPEG for movies. These centerpiece of these algorithms is the conversion of the audio or image signal into 1D or 2D sine waves, then deleting the parts that "won't be noticed", and then later converting the data back into the original signal with the deleted frequencies missing. (The loss is deliberate and strategically applied to reduce data without reducing perceived quality.) The Fourier transform is also the key enabling technique for all spread-spectrum wireless data technology, including WiFi, digital cell phone broadcasts, 4G mobile data broadcast, and dynamic bandwidth regulating DSL. A key difference between the ideal Fourier transform and the way it is applied is that the ideal Fourier transform turns infinitely-long signals into infinitely long sine waves, which on a practical scale is impossible and not useful. The applied Fourier transform uses "wavelets" which are sine waves that quickly taper to zero, representing, for example, a few milliseconds of sound (in MP3) or 8x8 pixel image blocks (in JPEG). An example wavelet:
