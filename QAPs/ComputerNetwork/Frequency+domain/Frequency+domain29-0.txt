â˜…What is the need to convert a time domain signal to a frequency domain signal and vice versa?
Time domain signals, just provide the information regarding the value of a function/signal at any given instance. They do not convey the information as to the rate at which the signal is varying. Thus the need arises to represent the signal in another domain, describing the rate at which they vary, or the frequency. Generally much of the concepts can be visualized or rather well understood for 1-d signals. So here I use an Image with variations in one of the directions to explain the concept. Here there is an image undergoing changes along horizontal direction.The spectrum of it also depicts the same.As we move away from the center, the frequencies are higher ones. This one is for changes in intensity along the vertical direction, the spectrum depicting values along the vertical axis. Not only to know the rate of change and it's magnitude, but also in some systems the acquisition itself is in frequency domain, say MRI for example. This signal has to re-converted back to spatial domain. The necessity exists from Analysis and reconstruction,both perspectives.. The figures were generated with the help of MATLAB7. Hope this helps..
