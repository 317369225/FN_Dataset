â˜…Where is the Fourier sine/cosine series ever used in the real world?While studying maths I had a lecturer tell me that the only place he'd ever seen the sine series used was in a biscuit factory where it was/is used used to check the roundness of biscuits (cookies) on a production line. Any more examples?
The equalizer you see in your audio player is a Fourier representation of the music that you are listening to. (Well not 100% accurate in most cases) What the Fourier transform indicates is the strength of each frequency component of the signal. It decomposes the signal into its sine and cosine components and its amplitudes. There are variants of the Fourier transform, which are built around a multitude of engineering applications like Radar data processing (using sound waves to detect stuff..), in medicine where we have Ultrasound and in the Navy where we have SONAR. In most cases we use the Fourier Transforms discrete counterpart which works on real world data. Measurements made by most modern devices and sensors are discrete. There are several efficient algorithms and in several devices we also have special hardware for this.
