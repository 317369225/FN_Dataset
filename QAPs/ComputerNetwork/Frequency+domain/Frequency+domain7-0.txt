★Why is signal analysis performed in frequency domain rather than time domain?
We don't always have to, but in some cases we prefer to do it. Because most signals of interest are characterised by frequency and not time or space (there's a caveat, keep reading). What are the time characteristics of a G# chord played on a piano? Are you more interested in it's time duration or in what makes it sound the way it sounds? Time dictates when you hear something, but frequency dictates what you hear, which is much more central to the true nature of signals. Having said that, don't fall in the trap of assuming that only frequency is important. If that were true, it would obviously mean that time is not important. Consider a song as the signal under consideration. If you were not interested in time, the whole point of processing that signal would be lost. Rhythm and timing are the very heart of good music, and not something one can afford to neglect. In this case, we want to know when the drums kicked in, as well as what notes were being played on the guitar. If we perform only frequency analysis, all time information would be lost and the only information we would have would be about what frequencies were played in the song, and what their respective amplitudes were, averaged over the duration of the entire song. So even if the drums stop playing after the second stanza, the frequency spectrum would show them playing throughout the song. Conversely, if we were only interested in the time information, we would be hardly better off than simply listening to the song. The solution to this is Time–frequency analysis, which is a field that deals with signal processing in both time and frequency domains. It contains essentially a collection of methods that allows us to make tradeoffs between time and frequency processing of a signal, depending on what makes more sense for a particular application.
