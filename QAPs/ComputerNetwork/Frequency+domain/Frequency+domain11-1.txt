★When people talk about converting a time domain graph to a frequency domain graph via Fourier analysis, is the frequency domain graph at a specific time in signal or does it represent the entire signal's period of existence?
In Fourier analysis, the time function is often weighted with a "window" function, which spans the time interval of interest but tapers down at the boundaries of this time interval.  The tapering serves to minimize artifacts in the frequency spectrum due to sharp edges at each end of the time interval.  (In audio spectrum analysis, these edges might be heard as clicks if listened to.)  The weighting function otherwise is designed to take into account all parts of the signal within the window interval.   A compromise in involved that is analogous to the "Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle."  Various solutions to this problem have been devised.  A particularly effective one is the "4 term Blackman Harris window function."   But careful attention must be paid to all aspects of the signal structure.  For example, if we are looking at a speech waveform, we would have to know whether our interest was in the sound components of a particular phoneme or whether we were interested in some kind of average speech spectrum.
