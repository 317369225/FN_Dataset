★I know that Laplace, Z and Fourier Transforms converts a function in the real time domain to a function in the complex frequency domain, but what is the inherent difference between the three in layman's terms?
Fourier transform: used with continuous, periodic functions. You have to know that the function repeats after a certain time. Laplace transform: used with continuous functions in general. You no longer have the periodicity requirement, but the result is no longer purely imaginary—the result have both imaginary and real parts. z-transform: used with functions (a.k.a. sequences) which only are defined at regularly spaced points, which are usually understood to be integer multiples of some fundamental time period.
