â˜…Where is the Fourier sine/cosine series ever used in the real world?While studying maths I had a lecturer tell me that the only place he'd ever seen the sine series used was in a biscuit factory where it was/is used used to check the roundness of biscuits (cookies) on a production line. Any more examples?
Your lecturer was nuts if he said that. You cannot use or understand Fourier Transforms of unbounded-time signals without first understanding Fourier Series decomposition of bounded-time signals. In fact, the Fourier Transform is really just a generalization of Fourier Series applied to time-unbounded signals. Fourier Transforms are so utterly fundamental and ubiquitous in every aspect of modern communications technology that it's too ridiculous to point out their every individual use.
