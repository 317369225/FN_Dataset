â˜…What is the difference between an 'integrator' and a 'low pass filter' & 'differentiator' and a 'high pass filter'?
What is the difference between an 'integrator' and a 'low pass filter' & 'differentiator' and a 'high pass filter'? Essentially, not much. The integrator and differentiator terms are generally applied to opamp versions of filters and how they were used in analog computers (computers meant to model differential equations used up to mid 1970's). Since filter equations will contain either an integral or differentiation term, such filters integrate or differentiate the signal applied to them. If you are interested, I believe LabView enables one to simulate differential equations like an old analog computer.
