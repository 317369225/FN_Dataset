â˜…Signal Processing: What does the concept of frequency domain mean in case of mechanical systems?Signals and systems are abstractions which are used to represent all kinds of phenomena. In case of a speech signal and images, frequency domain refers to the components of frequencies that compose them .What does frequency domain mean in case of mechanical systems like ones having spring and mass ,or pistons and so on
Vibrations and resonant frequences mostly, plus multiples of the rotational frequency of rotating parts. There's a whole science and industry called "condition monitoring" where the analysis of a machine's vibrations is a centerpiece. Changes in the frequency distribution of the vibrations can reveal worn ball bearings, leaking lubricants, etc. The data source may be vibration sensors that are fastened at various places on the machine, but microphones are also an option. experienced human machine operators have some of the same abilities, quickly recognizing a malfunction from a change in the noise from the machine.
