â˜…Why does sampling in time domain result in periodicity in frequency domain for any signal?
The frequency domain representation is actually the measure of periodicity which you are referring to (keep in mind that depending on your sampling rate you may or may not see the benefits of a transformation to the frequency domain. That's what Nyquist's sampling limit theorem tells us.) When you apply a Fourier transform (or other frequency domain transform) to a continuous signal, what you get, as you eloquently noted in your question, is a measure of periodicities across the whole spectrum of frequencies. Now, through the limitation of having to sample the continuous signal so that we can process it digitally, we no longer have a continuous time signal and we can not apply a continuous time transform, but subject to some limitations (sampling theorem), using a discrete transform such as the DFT, we'll still get a representation of the periodicities of the original signal across a finite set of frequencies. That is what the discrete transform is all about.
