â˜…Where is the Fourier sine/cosine series ever used in the real world?While studying maths I had a lecturer tell me that the only place he'd ever seen the sine series used was in a biscuit factory where it was/is used used to check the roundness of biscuits (cookies) on a production line. Any more examples?
The Fourier transform is a very powerful tool. With the development of computers the FFT algorithm has become very popular. The FFT is used for filtering images and videos with noise. It is an extremely efficient way of getting clean images from images corrupted with grainy or seemingly periodic noise. FFT is also used for getting the power spectra of a time series signal in order to find out out if there exists some frequency peak that is carrying the bulk of the power of the signal or is the time series almost purely random.
