★What is something electrical engineers know that others don't?
Ever wondered why a crow sitting  on an electrical transmission line doesn't experience shock? ​​ ​It is because, the movement of electrons, that is, current, is the ultimate thing which causes shock. It is the electric current that burns tissue, freezes muscles, and fibrillates hearts. Here, the current doesn't pass through the crow. To know why, you have to understand these things: 1. Elecric current flows through the path only when there is a potential difference between the starting and ending points of the path. Electric current doesn't occur by itself. We need voltage (potential difference) across a path. It is just similar to two buckets of water connected by a small pipe. The flow of water is anological to the flow of electrons, that is, current. It requires a difference in potential for the flow. ​ ​ ​​2. Electric current flows only when there is a closed path. But here is a closed path. It's crow's left leg, crow's body, crow's right leg and the wire makes it a closed path. 3. How to calculate the voltage drop? The formula for the voltage drop is v=iR. where, i is the current and R is the resistance of the conductor. Generally, the resistance of the transmission line between crow's legs is very negligible. Very close to zero. So, if the voltage at crow's left leg is 11,000 volts, then the voltage at crow's right leg is also 11,000 volts as there is no voltage drop in the line.  So, the potential difference v across the crow's legs is nearly equal to o (11,000-11,000), which makes  the current not to pass through the crow. ​ ​Update 1: Thank you guys for your upvotes and promotions. This is my first answer with more than 1k upvotes. Update 2: I know that these concepts are taught in school level itself. This is for those who forgot or didn't grasp it when they are taught.
