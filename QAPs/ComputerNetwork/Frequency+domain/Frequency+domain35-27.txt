â˜…What is something electrical engineers know that others don't?
Most of the answers here are too thought provoking and are true and most realistic, narrates my same experience in those situations, I get to know the following things V won't Kill you. I will is the best answer I like 1. The Importance of the study of a subject called Power system,while the world is fascinated by what electronics(the mini version of Electrical) can do,I was fascinated by what Power system can do(the maxi version) and the real logic and meaning behind an assumption 2. There is no big scientific or electrical reason as to why in US and certain other parts of the World they use 60Hz and in India and certain other parts of the World they use 50 Hz(actually there is an argument that power quality is good and losses are less in 60Hz transmission. But producing 60Hz is a bit costlier affair also 50Hz has its own advantages).It is just the way it has been started and it continues so,changing the system will require complete change in all manufactured and to be manufacturing components 3. The explanation of why the Earth pin is larger and Longer than the Phase and Neutral pins is that We all know that the earth pin is used to protect the user in the event of a short circuit resulting in the leakage of current through any of the metal regions of an appliance But the reason for its abnormal length and size is that Below diagram illustrates a simple earthing circuit (i)If a conductor has a large cross sectional area the resistance offered by it is very less hence larger size (ii) Imagine the following scenario, An user is holding a plug in one hand and has the other hand in contact with an appliance that has a current leak thorough the metal body and is trying to connect it to a live socket(ref above diagram:the switch is already in ON position even before connecting the plug): If the earth pin is of normal size the user may get electrocuted due to short circuit and the surge current that may flow through the metal body due to the live socket. but if it is longer,the earth pin goes and sits in the socket first so whatever current that may flow through the user to ground will flow through the earth pin to ground,thus the user is protected
