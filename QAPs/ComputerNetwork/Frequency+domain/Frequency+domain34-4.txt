★Where is the Fourier sine/cosine series ever used in the real world?While studying maths I had a lecturer tell me that the only place he'd ever seen the sine series used was in a biscuit factory where it was/is used used to check the roundness of biscuits (cookies) on a production line. Any more examples?
On your stereo if it has a graphic equalizer. This is a physical hardware implementation of the Fourier Transform. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equ... The idea that an arbitrary waveform can be decomposed into sine waves, or that sine waves can be combined to make an arbitrary waveform, is so prevalent in electrical engineering that it is hard to notice. (sort of like the faint lines on graph paper)  It's just the way things are done, and thought about.  To use a software analogy, it's part of the <std.io>  (standard input & output) module for electronics. It is used in almost every modem in the DSP, and in DSL systems as discrete multi-tone modulation. Fourier's idea shows up once again when we look at a stereo speaker which has a woofer (bass), mid-range, and tweeter (high notes) - the combination of the sounds in the air reproduces the complex music waveform.
