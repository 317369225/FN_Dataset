★What are things that electronics and telecommunication engineers (ECE) know while other engineers don't?
When any new Gadget release in Market. Every body see its Look and way of usages. Where an every ECE engineer thinks Which controller  chipset would be used in that? What would be operating frequency? Which sensor would be used in that? Which RTOS or OS would be used? How much interfaces would be supported in that? How would that sync with my Laptop/Mobile? When somebody makes call on their mobile they just makes calls but for ECE students below thoughts came in his minds for a fraction of seconds. 1) when he dial number in Dialer app Android framework has started main activity of dialer app Touch screen driver has given cordinates of touch and based on that Android framework has called event of dialer app's keycode button event Now dialer app knows number which he  sends to telephony manager 2) When he listen call making tune Now nearest BTS has received my call request. Now BTS would connect me to  BSC station BSC station would connect me to MSC station MSC station has record of my friend's numbers location so he will connect to required BSC station then BSC will connect my friend's BTS and my friends BTS connect to my friends mobile 3) And now Ring goes to my Friend's mobile.. and i listedn ring in call also.
