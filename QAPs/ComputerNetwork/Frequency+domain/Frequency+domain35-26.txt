★What is something electrical engineers know that others don't?
That a transformer is present inside this (mobile charger) and this is not the same as the those seen on the road side but a different type called Switch Mode Transformers. ​ ​ Mobile batteries require around 3.7-4.2 volts, but our house is supplied at 230V. So we need a step down transformer in order to charge our mobile, which is present inside our charger. How does this transformer work? These rapidly switch the current on and off, allowing the alternating current to be changed to a higher frequency. This is often between 50 kHz and 200 kHz. At these frequencies, a much smaller and lighter transformer than normal is able to reduce the potential difference. As a result, these transformers are suited for use in power supplies such as mobile phone chargers. When the device is plugged in and the batteries are recharging, a load is being applied (the transformer is drawing power). Switch mode transformers use very little power when the plug is left switched on but no load is applied (such as when the device’s batteries are not charging). This is another advantage for using switch mode transformers in applications such as mobile phone chargers. ref: http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcs... Note: This answer is not specific to mobile charges only, but to every device that requires less voltage than the standard 230V supply such as laptop chargers, mosquito bats.   Update: The frequency to which the AC current is changed to will be in between 50kHz to 200kHz.
