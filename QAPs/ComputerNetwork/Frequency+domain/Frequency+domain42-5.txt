★What is the difference between an 'integrator' and a 'low pass filter' & 'differentiator' and a 'high pass filter'?
The simplest explanation is to consider mainly the differentiator and integrator circuits.  These can be of a very similar design, based on the Time constant of components, usually a resistor and a capacitor or inductor.  Based on the time constant as calculated, the input waveform frequency will either be differentiated or integrated.  If the time constant is around 1/10th of the frequency applied, it is a differentiator; if the time constant is around 10x or higher, the circuit acts as an integrator.  Other answers have already pointed out that the high-pass/low-pass filtering is related to differentiator and integrator.
