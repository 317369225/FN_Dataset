â˜…What are things that electronics and telecommunication engineers (ECE) know while other engineers don't?
How 700 MB of space translates to roughly seventy minutes of audio when you burn an Audio CD. Remember, when you burned CDs, there was this special option of burning an 'Audio CD', which gave you the option of burning 70 minutes of audio, on a disk with 700 MB space? If you opted for an MP3 CD option, you could fill 700 MB of songs. Then why did the audio CD have space for only 70 minutes? The difference lies in the format. Audio CD encoding encodes songs in the CDA format. For those interested, here is the explanation: First of all, the audio we listen to is sampled at 44.1 kHz, or 44100 'snapshots' of the audio signal are taken every second. This is because computers can only work with discrete snapshots of signals. The sampling rate should be slightly more than twice of the highest frequencies contained in the sound. We can hear only up to 20 kHz, so the rate is 44.1 kHz. Each snapshot needs to be measured and assigned a value, so we put a sort of ruler next to it. This ruler has 65536 levels. So, we measure each snapshot and give it a number between 0 and 65535. Now, we need to encode these snapshots in the language of computers, or binary numbers. These are sequences of 0s and 1s. A 0 or 1 in this sequence is called a bit, and each sequence of n bits can be used to represent 2^n numbers. So, 65536 can be represented using 16 bits. So now we have the recipe. Each second, we take 44100 snapshots, and each snapshot has 16 bits in computer language. So each second has 44100 x 16 bits. Now, 8 bits make a byte. So each second has 44100 x 2 = 88200 bytes. Our audio is composed of separate sound in 2 channels : left and right. This is called stereo audio. So now, each second has to be represented by 88200 x 2 bytes. Multiply that by 60 and you will get the number of bytes in one minute: 10584000. 1024 bytes make up 1 kilobyte, and 1024 kilobytes make up one megabyte. So if you divide 10584000 by (1024 x 1024), you get 10 MB roughly. So, one minute equals 10 MB. 70 minutes equal 700 MB. PS: I realized this in my Communication Systems exam in my fifth semester. I got it wrong because I didn't multiply by two for the stereo sound. I was still getting 5 MB per minute which sounded ridiculous to me. Only later did I realize that this was the CD Audio format and had I multiplied, I would've had ten MB per minute, which was right.
