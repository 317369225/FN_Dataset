â˜…What are things that electronics and telecommunication engineers (ECE) know while other engineers don't?
Frankly Speaking, I have heard other engineers talk about us. The most controversial thing we ECE engineers know and others don't, is how to grab a job of any other field of which we might or might not have imperceptible or say regular knowledge about. E.g. IT or Electrical. On a technical note, I would say we people have collective knowledge about so many things. Consider Embedded Systems, we can perceive, design, implement and execute them successfully without others assistance. Same goes with Robotics. Lastly, one more thing on a lighter note. People say love is in the air. Ask an ECE engineer and she/he would say "No, EM waves are....!!!!!". :) By the way, thanks for A2A. Made me feel how unique we ECE engineers are.
