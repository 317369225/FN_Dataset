â˜…Why is signal analysis performed in frequency domain rather than time domain?
The main idea is that, most of the signal processing techniques involve some sort of convolution. For example, filtering in the time domain involves convolution (big equations with integrals) of the 'signal to be filtered' with the 'filter'. This is reduced to just multiplication (signal x filter) in the frequency domain. Frequency domain gives you the representation of the signal as basic building blocks - Frequencies. It answers questions like, What are the various frequencies available in the signal? What is the amplitude of each of the frequencies? If I want some specific part of the signal, which frequency should I eliminate? (This is not possible in time domain- - You cant reduce or modify the signal at particular 'instant' and expect it to reflect all over the signal). Take a look at this post. It gives the significance of Fourier or frequency analysis of a signal and why it is some times easier. http://visionandbeyond.blogspot....
