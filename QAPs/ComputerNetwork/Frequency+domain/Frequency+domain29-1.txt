â˜…What is the need to convert a time domain signal to a frequency domain signal and vice versa?
It is because an operation that is hard to perform in time-domain may be very simple in frequency domain. The best example is convolution of two signals in time domain, which corresponds to multiplication in frequency domain. Convolution in time domain is not straightforward, and is more complex than multiplication. Another example is JPEG compression, which uses Discrete Cosine Transform and quantizes the transformed co-efficients to achieve better compression. Since human eye cannot really perceive high frequency components better than low frequency ones, the high-frequency terms are heavily quantized. Many signals that exist in nature have changing frequency characteristics (e.g., speech, image etc). Such characteristics cannot be captured effectively by making use of time-domain alone. (Well, not be frequency-domain alone too, that's the reason we have the idea of Time-Frequency Analysis) In many applications, usage of frequency domain data reduces the effort by a great margin.
