★What advice would you give to an electrical and electronics student that you wish you were given when you started your course?All advice  are welcome!
I would like to begin by saying that you are going in for a real challenge when it comes to a career in electrical engineering. You need to start working on your resume as soon as you enter university. Do not think its too early. As opposed to other fields, in electrical engineering  you need to be an expert at some specific field/skillset. Companies in this field mostly hire people who are specialized in some specific technical area and can contribute with their indepth knowledge in that. So focus on building your strong points. By working on your resume, I mean get hands on experience in companies preferably the ones with the big name( it does help you in the long run rather than joining a startup in this field). Although it is good to have experience with different firms, I would say try doing couple of your internship terms in the same company because this will place you above other new grads trying to get a full time job in the same company. In the end do not waste your time doing an internship with a software company if you know you want to work in a power/energy company. As for your school, you need to maintain high grades to be able to apply for a good grad school. It is highly likely that you will need your masters in a technical field since an undergrad in engineering might not be enough to get you in the core fields of electrical engineering in the long run. Lastly, it is always good to work on some skill sets on the side. Even if you are not taking programming courses, keep yourself familiar with some basic programming (C/C++), good data mining/data analytically skills, MATLAB etc. It will be an asset for you and will work in your favor where ever you go.
