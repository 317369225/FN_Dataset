â˜…What is something electrical engineers know that others don't?
I am going to reveal a secret where you can be real SMART among your peers. Ever wondered why in 3 pin plug, the top plug is thickest and longest? First go and check the plug in your house and then read below to find the reason. Because when it is inserted into the socket first of all it grounds the circuit or equipment .Due to this it avoids from shock to the person & give safety. Update: The reason of thickness of 3rd pin is to identify the earth pin to make it distinguish from other 2 pins.(Otherwise people would try to fit it into the plug the wrong way like it happens for USB nowadays). Thanks for the correction Soumendu Majee
