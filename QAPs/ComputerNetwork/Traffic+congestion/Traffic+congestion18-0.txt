★What can be done to reduce traffic congestion in Bangalore?
First and foremost, increase speed across all of Bangalore's roads. The average speed has come down from 35 kmph in 2005 to 20 kmph.  Considering the increase in the number of vehicles, this is a massive problem.  In order to do this: Improve road quality.  No potholes, no slowing down.  People should be able to get out of anywhere quickly. Secondly, reduce the waiting time at signals from those ridiculously long 180 seconds etc., to 30 seconds.  There is no reason vehicles should have to wait in such long lines. Erect many parking structures with steep fees.  One shouldn't be on the lookout for a parking space and spending hours cruising in the busy business districts.  It should be a quick and efficient process and people are willing to pay. Provide incentives for people to take buses, the metro (when it reaches everywhere) and at worst, cabs, instead of driving their own cars.  There can be big parking lots like the one near Byappanahalli metro station where people can leave their cars and board the metro etc. Stagger school timings so there's no mad rush at some given hours clogging up traffic. Ensure buildings provide sufficient parking while planning development.  A long line of cars parking on the street outside office buildings is ridiculous. Improve signs.  There cannot be badly placed or barely visible, confusing signs or signs hidden in the clutter of hoardings and advertisements.  It should be clear to road users which road leads where so they don't have to slow down or stop to ask. Remove ineffective administrators, and corrupt, inefficient contractors from taking up public works.  A hole on the road shouldn't be taking months to fill.    Embed Quote
