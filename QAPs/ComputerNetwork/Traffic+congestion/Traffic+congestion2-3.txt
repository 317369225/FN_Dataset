★What's the most feasible way to reduce traffic congestion in Los Angeles?I'd love the place otherwise.
1. Reward carpooling. 2. Support, widen or build bike lanes/ pedestrian bridges. 3. Replace traffic lights with roundabouts in vicinity areas (not city the city center) 4. Free shuttling services to 3 largest centers. 5. Open up parking spaces on city center borders and radically decrease number of parking spaces in city center.    Embed Quote
