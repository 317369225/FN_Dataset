★What types of people choose to live in Palo Alto over San Francisco?
Many people with kids move here for the high ranking public schools.  In fact, that is a major reason why real estate is so expensive here.  I preferred living in urban areas (SF, Berkeley, Hong Kong) pre-kids.  Having kids adds a new dimension that makes you rethink a long commute, ease of parking, safety, and more open space to enjoy.  I grew up in Palo Alto and never thought I'd end up back here, yet here I am.    Embed Quote
