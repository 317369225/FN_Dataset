★Do ring road systems in cities create more traffic congestion?
In North America, ring roads tend to encourage urban sprawl.  The original ring road will go around the outer edge of the city, but then development occurs along the road and outside it, creating low-density sprawl and ultimately outgrowing the capacity of the original ring road.  Maybe that's a good thing, relieving pressure on the inner core.  Or maybe it just means more people traveling into the core.  If the development outside the ring includes industry and business space (and not just residential), then theoretically it should help reduce congestion.    Embed Quote
