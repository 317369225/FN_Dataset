★How does traffic congestion happen?
Let me explain this to you by using the fundamental diagrams of traffic flow theory. This figure roughly shows how flow, speed and density interact on a given roadway. As you can see from the flow-speed diagram the extreme point on the right of the curve is called flow (or speed) at capacity. It is the point where a roadway can provide it's highest flow output with a speed roughly half of the free flow speed. This capacity is mostly a function of the roadway itself.  Now if the density (i.e. number of cars per km) increases past the point of capacity both flow and speed begin to drop to a point where stand-still traffic, which is the most extreme case, will occur.    Embed Quote
