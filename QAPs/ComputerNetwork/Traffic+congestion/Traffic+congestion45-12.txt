★Do drivers who keep extremely huge gaps between their car and the car in front of them in heavy, very slow stop-and-go traffic cause the congested traffic to be worse?
In a country like India, especially in cities like Chennai and Bangalore where bumper to bumper traffic is very common, the drivers dont keep large distance between each cars because it would encourage motor bike riders to occupy that space, so ultimately the car drivers are further slowed down.    Embed Quote
