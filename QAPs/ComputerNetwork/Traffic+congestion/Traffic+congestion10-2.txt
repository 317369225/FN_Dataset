★Did the Delhi Metro solve Delhi's traffic congestion problem?Also please mention other ways in which the Metro may have impacted city life in Delhi. Please provide your sources if possible.
No - there's just too much pressure on Delhi roads and the transit system. More people need to work from home , if at all possible, and maybe all companies should have 5 day weeks.    Embed Quote
