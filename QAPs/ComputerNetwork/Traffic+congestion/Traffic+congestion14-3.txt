★Is metro really a need for Kochi and will it be profiable and add to the already worst traffic congestion?
Of course yes. A 100%. But the way the authorities are handling the congestion caused due to its construction is questionable. But I think Kochiites don't have a right to questions as our road etiquette are bordering on anti-socialism oft times.    Embed Quote
