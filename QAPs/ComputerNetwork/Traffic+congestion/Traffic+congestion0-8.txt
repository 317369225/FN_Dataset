★Will driver-less cars reduce traffic congestion?
If the cars are somehow able to exchange data, then with a clever algorithm it may reduce congestion by optimising the path taken by the car in order not to run into traffic jams and creating even more congestion. I think self driving car wil help to reduce the overall number of cars by allowing people to share or rent a car. Instead of sleeping on the parking spot the car will keep running throughout the day. At the end you won't be consuming the car as a product, but as a service.    Embed Quote
