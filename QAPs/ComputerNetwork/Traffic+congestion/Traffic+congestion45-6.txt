★Do drivers who keep extremely huge gaps between their car and the car in front of them in heavy, very slow stop-and-go traffic cause the congested traffic to be worse?
There  is no difference between leaving a large gap in front of you and being  the lead driver of a convoy on a road (totally empty in front of you),  as long as you "go with the flow", i.e. vary your speed to keep the same  distance all the time. Having a large gap in front of you will allow  you to slow down when need be, such as when you see brake lights going  on ahead of you, without having to step on the brake yourself. You may  come home a second or two later because you do have to travel through  that gap to reach home and if seconds are more important to you than  anything else, I don't think reasoning can make you change your habit. If  you go with the flow and if the cars in front of you are travelling at  maximum speed limits, the cars behind you also can go at that same  speed. If the flow speed is too slow, the cars behind you may want to  pass and they have more chance to do that safely because they have more  room to maneuver.  If you follow too close, eventually you will have to  brake suddenly and a flow disruption will ensue. The main  problem with keeping a small gap is that our reaction time is variable  and depends too many unpredictable factors--causing distraction--and  anything creating a flow disruption will create a chain reaction,  slowing the traffic more. So, keeping a large gap does not make a traffic congestion worse. It helps to make the traffic less accident prone.    Embed Quote
