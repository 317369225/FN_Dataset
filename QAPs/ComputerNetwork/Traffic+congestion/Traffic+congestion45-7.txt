★Do drivers who keep extremely huge gaps between their car and the car in front of them in heavy, very slow stop-and-go traffic cause the congested traffic to be worse?
If everyone kept a proper gap between vehicles then traffic would actually flow more smoothly with less braking and stress for all. Think about the slinky. When people tailgate and run at the back end of the car behind them they are like a slinky. It actually causes more danger and stress to all. Congestion is a function of the number of vehicles on the road not how people are driving. If congestion is a fact of life in your daily commute then keep your distance and put on some relaxing music and leave yourself enough time to get there on time.    Embed Quote
