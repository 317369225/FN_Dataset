★Is it right time to make strict rules to minimize vehicles in India to reduce traffic congestion?
The only way forward is to improve public transport.Cars for example,spend 90% of their time stationary.Where cars are really needed are in rural areas,but in urban areas they just use up space.Once the 'last mile' problem is fixed with public transport,they are the only way forward. The city of Hamburg in Germany announced that they are banning cars from 2030 onwards.    Embed Quote
