★In my daily conveyance to work, I come across a railway gate where motorists coming from both ends don't follow lane discipline causing traffic congestion despite the arrangement of divider railings to an extent of road. How can this be controlled?
I think the approach should be multifaceted, with focus on the following factors: 1) infrastructure - the development of roads that are adequate to accommodate traffic. Also the installation of equipment (e.g. traffic lights, monitoring cameras) as well as loading and unloading areas in strategic locations. This should be done with a forecast of the volume of vehicles for a long period of time and of other related factors. Monitoring cameras may be used to substitute traffic enforcers in apprehending violators to avoid Bribery or extortion. 2) a review and overhaul of the existing traffic laws and regulations, and the bureaus/offices responsible for them. Are they appropriate? Do they make sense? 3) proper enforcement of those laws and regulations - the person in charge should not be politically motivated. Strict compliance, Zero-tolerance for violators. 4) Inform, educate and communicate on all levels - road courtesy/safety should be consistently part of basic education. As a form of mitigation, this should also be done to pedestrians (gen public), private vehicle owners and public utility vehicle drivers.    Embed Quote
