★Do drivers who keep extremely huge gaps between their car and the car in front of them in heavy, very slow stop-and-go traffic cause the congested traffic to be worse?
Depends what you mean by "big" and "small," of course, but I'll do what I can... When traffic gets very heavy, other effects come into play. Taking your line of thinking a bit further, ideal traffic would consist of cars that move in convoys, with their bumpers separated by inches. However, human reaction time being what it is, that won't be practical until computers take over the driving duties. Since people are prone to reacting too late, then over-reacting to compensate, following too closely tends to cause a compression wave to travel backward through traffice, like an audio wave through air. This phenomenon slows traffic so much that it outweighs the theoretical benefit of following closely. And this is also why some areas are experimenting with variable speed limits - during peak traffic times, speed limits are pre-emptively reduced in an effort to prevent people from braking abruptly and triggering a backward-travelling wave of cars that brake abruptly to avoid hitting the car ahead. Of course it all depends on what exactly you mean by big gaps and small gaps, but it is likely that the people you've observed using larger following distances are actually increasing the rate of traffic flow by acting as a low-pass filter on these shockwaves:    Embed Quote
