★Do drivers who keep extremely huge gaps between their car and the car in front of them in heavy, very slow stop-and-go traffic cause the congested traffic to be worse?
I had to reread the question details a couple times to understand what point that part is driving at but, ok, think I have it now... Yes, it is reasonable to decrease the size of the gap in front of your car as you go from high speed to low speed. It is simply maintaining a constant of (or at least an equivalent of) the "2-second-rule". Some people miss the point, however, and maintain the same distance, e.g. between lamp posts, which would only appy to when travelling at 70mph., causing them to leave an over-sized gap. Regarding the question title (in isolation from the question details)... No, drivers who k̶e̶e̶p̶   ̶e̶̶̶x̶̶̶t̶̶̶r̶̶̶e̶̶̶m̶̶̶e̶̶̶l̶̶̶y̶̶̶ ̶̶̶ h̶̶̶u̶̶̶g̶̶̶e̶̶̶   ̶̶̶g̶̶̶a̶̶̶p̶̶̶s̶̶̶ ̶ b̶e̶t̶w̶e̶e̶n̶  ̶t̶h̶e̶i̶r̶  ̶c̶a̶r̶ ̶ a̶n̶d̶ ̶ t̶h̶e̶  ̶c̶a̶r̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶ f̶r̶o̶n̶t̶ ̶ o̶f̶  ̶ t̶h̶e̶m̶  ̶i̶n̶  ̶h̶e̶a̶v̶y̶,̶  ̶v̶e̶r̶y̶  ̶s̶l̶o̶w̶  ̶ s̶t̶o̶p̶ -̶a̶n̶d̶ -̶g̶o̶  ̶t̶r̶a̶f̶f̶i̶c̶  ̶d̶o̶  ̶n̶o̶t̶ ̶ c̶a̶u̶s̶e̶   ̶t̶h̶e̶   ̶c̶o̶n̶g̶e̶s̶t̶e̶d̶  ̶t̶r̶a̶f̶f̶i̶c̶ ̶ t̶o̶ ̶ b̶e̶ ̶ w̶o̶r̶s̶e̶  create a buffer zone to the "accordion effect" ahead, of stop-and-go traffic, reduce the build-up and bottle-necking of traffic behind them (but of course without any advantage to their own progress). If the driver maintains smooth constant speed and adjusts speed smoothly --as speed ahead slows or increases-- they will reduce the chance of bottlenecking behind them. *This is not always appreciated though. The same principle applied to approaching a red light --anticipating the change by monitoring the contravening lights, for instance-- may enable more following traffic to cross before the timing change, as they will not have slowed to a stop.    Embed Quote
