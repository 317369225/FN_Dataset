★What are some solutions for reducing traffic congestion in Hyderabad?
Zebra crossings Not many zebra crossings this creates enough issues and slows down traffic very very badly In some cases there are crossings but not serving the purpose Give me Way, I'm in hurry! - Wrong side driving This is most irritating, just becuase of one person's negligence commuters on both sides need to slow down Everyone contributing their own to the choas Let's everyone take it seriously before PM starts another campaign on Traffic :)    Embed Quote
