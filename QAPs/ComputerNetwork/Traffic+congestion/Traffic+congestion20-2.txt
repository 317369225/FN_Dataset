★Aerospace and Aeronautical Engineering: Why don't we have vertical take off (VTOL) pods to reduce traffic congestion?I went to the Hiller Aviation museum and saw these vertical take-off pods that were about 4 ft in diameter and were prototyped in the 1950s. Why aren't these more widely commercialized today?
In addition to what's already been said, going straight down using either propeller blades or a jet engine is hazardous. A propeller blade needs to cut fresh air. If it's going down, it will cut air that it has already cut previously on its way down. This air is already traveling downwards, so will provide much less lift each time it is cut. It is very tricky to fly a helicopter straight down, especially if there are some unpredictable winds or turbulence around. A jet engine needs air to enter the front, so its problem is similar.    Embed Quote
