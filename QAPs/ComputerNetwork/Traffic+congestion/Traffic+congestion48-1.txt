★What percentage of Seattle construction projects that congest traffic are aimed at improving traffic, rather than confounding the problem?
they are all aimed at improving traffic. That does not mean that the processes to get that done, or the solution itself is actually going to be helpful. There's also an issue of whether the individuals doing the work or making the decisions are actually experts in this, and whether they have enough money to do the most ideal solution. Or, whether they are doing a mid-level or interim solution, in the meantime. No construction project on an interstate or a road is ever pretty, but not all things are equal, either. And not all towns and cities have the same funding, expertise or diligence.    Embed Quote
