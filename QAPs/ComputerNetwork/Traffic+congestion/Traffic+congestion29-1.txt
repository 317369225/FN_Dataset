★How early in the morning should I start driving on the road to Hana in order to avoid traffic congestion?
It depends where you start from, but ideally you're on the road around 7am.  That will give you a winning shot to beat some of the larger tourist vans and buses that start clogging the road later in the morning.  It will also give you a shot to enjoy a good chunk of time in and around Hana which, in my opinion, is the best part of the trip.  (Better yet, spend a night or two in Hana instead of doing a full day tour.) But if you can't get on the road that early, you'll still be fine... it's just a bit of a drag but still well worth the trip.  One tip: since most people arrive to Maui from the mainland, they'll likely be at least 3 hours jet lagged which means it should be easy to wake up early.  Schedule your trip to Hana early in your vacation so you can take advantage of the jet lag and get on the road early!    Embed Quote
