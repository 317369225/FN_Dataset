★Aerospace and Aeronautical Engineering: Why don't we have vertical take off (VTOL) pods to reduce traffic congestion?I went to the Hiller Aviation museum and saw these vertical take-off pods that were about 4 ft in diameter and were prototyped in the 1950s. Why aren't these more widely commercialized today?
You will spend far more fuel to fly than to roll on the ground. As we don't have unlimited free energy yet, the operating cost to fly is too high. It's not extremely high, but it can be compared to operating a semi truck.[1] As far as control is concerned, we have platforms like the Ardupilot[2] that successfully pilot drones, including traditional helicopters, today. There is no engineering reason why they can't evolve to be adapted for autonomous human flight, which would take the human error and skill factors out of the safe operation equation. The problems of power lines, bird strikes, and trees are solvable with the computing power we already have today. [1]Helicopter Mileage [2]Open source autopilot    Embed Quote
