★How important are new ride-share services like Lyft Line and UberPool for the ultimate goal of reducing traffic and traffic congestion (August 2014)?
A driven car is still a driven car. You are ride sharing, which is great but the overall impact will be slight. The creation and utilization of balanced transportation alternatives reduce congestion. Options to implement are infrastructure for bicycle, public bicycles, subway, light rail, bus, carpools, ride sharing, car share, ferry, high-speed rail, the ability to walk to work, and housing density. Adding driverless car does nothing to balance the infrastructure or lack thereof. Reducing people's reliance on automobiles will relieve congestion.    Embed Quote
