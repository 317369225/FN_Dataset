★Is it possible for an economically prosperous city to not have congested traffic?
If we ignore traffic caused by unexpected outlier events like a major accident or snowstorm then yes. The only theoretical requirement for eliminating congestion is variable pricing of usage of particular roads at particular times such that demand does not exceed uncongested supply at any time. Such a system could be implemented by requiring cars using city streets to be equipped with GPS so that tolls can be assessed based on when and where the car went. Algorithms monitoring traffic could pretty easily figure out proper pricing within weeks and travel patterns are generally stable enough that consumers would have a good sense of how much a given trip would cost beforehand. Note that this system would have the additional benefit of improving traffic flow optimization by having micro data on traffic and routing people (if they use GPS to plan their route) towards paths that have spare capacity. Most economists agree that pricing for congestion increases economic efficiency (by pricing negative externalities) so in theory a city would be more prosperous under this paradigm. The only potential problem would be high skill workers opposing the system, or more to the point choosing to live elsewhere, because of privacy concerns. However, I don't think these privacy costs would dissuade very many people from living in that city.    Embed Quote
