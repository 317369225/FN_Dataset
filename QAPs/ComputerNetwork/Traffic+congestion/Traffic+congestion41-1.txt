★What can be done about the heavily traffic congested Indian cities? How can it be made more free with respect to available parking spaces and keeping in mind the population increase?What are some innovative transportation and urban development ideas?
I am in the USA, in a medium sized city, so I probably do not have a great answer, but I will try to answer this. Physically, build high rise parking garages near your transportation hubs, so people could drive to the hub, park and take public transportation. Keep the price of parking there low. Make sure that these garages have plenty of spots for bicycles, watched over by the gate guard. Have a public area in the parking garage with tables and chairs for people to meet and share rides back to the same community. Politically, encourage people to use public transportation, walk and use bicycles by keeping public transportation inexpensive. Maybe the city could buy bicycles and provide them to the populace if the citizens would not steal them.    Embed Quote
