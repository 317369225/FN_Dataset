★How do externalities in traffic congestion cause a less than optimal allocation of resources in road transport?
Externalities, by their definition, are not measured in the Cost Benefit Analysis of Resource Allocation, and Negative Externalities impose costs other than on the entity doing the allocation, though it may be efficient for them to perform as they do precisely because the external costs are not borne by them. Inefficiency (non-optimal outcome) is observed by taking a whole-systems view of all costs & benefits, external or not. Traffic Congestion is one such negative externality which results from inadequate road capacity for offered traffic. Generally, negative externalities cease to be so when law is written to require that those costs be measured and borne.    Embed Quote
