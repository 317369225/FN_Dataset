★What do you think is the best solution to traffic congestion in Central Ahmedabad?
There is an outright lack of basic traffic sense in the people of Ahmedabad. Having stayed in quite a lot of mega & metro cities, I have only found that the traffic sense is the worst in Ahmedabad. When the people are not ready to follow the basic traffic signals and avoiding wrong side driving, not much can be expected. And this has a lot to do with the law enforcers too. Had the enforcers been strict enough (read: non corrupt) the rules could've been enforced in a much better way.    Embed Quote
