★What can be done about the heavily traffic congested Indian cities? How can it be made more free with respect to available parking spaces and keeping in mind the population increase?What are some innovative transportation and urban development ideas?
Densely populated cities around the world will always have traffic congestion. (See my answer to What have been some of the most effective ways that cities have overcome or are dealing with road congestion?) This is just the nature of cities; there will always be more people who want to drive somewhere than you can possibly build for. Automobiles have a lot of advantages as a transportation system; but they also have a huge flaw: they fail catastrophically (meaning: no movement) in any kind of density. So my first answer to your question is to build and support other transportation modes that do support density: walking, biking, metro, buses. These will be what keeps your city moving. But you will still have cars. So the secondary answer to the question is how to manage the inevitable congestion. Economists believe the best way to do this is by using price: make it very expensive to drive and park in the city, and only rich people will do it. Then use the funds raised to support public transit. Shanghai does this, for example, by auctioning off license plates; it currently costs over US$10,000 to get a license plate, and most of the millions of dollars raised goes to transit. London, Singapore and Stockholm do this through congestion pricing: it costs a certain amount of money to drive on major congested roads or to enter the city center. New York accomplishes this informally by charging hefty tolls on bridges and tunnels entering Manhattan, and by market pricing of parking which keeps it quite expensive. These policies won't eliminate congestion, but they will keep traffic flowing.    Embed Quote
