★What are the best examples of the law of unintended consequences in action?These could be from any arena -- politics, business, economics, science, startups, etc. -- but should be actual, real-life examples, not hypotheticals.  See Unintended consequences if this is not a familiar concept already.
My favorite is the story of when old fashioned, energy inefficient traffic signals that were hung in the middle of intersections in the Northeast were replaced with energy efficient LED lights, it caused a rash of traffic accidents at the beginning of winter, but not for the reason you would think. It seems the old, energy inefficient incandescent bulbs, since they had the secondary effect of giving off infrared light (heat), were defrosting the traffic signals during the winter months. When winter hit, the LED lights, that only give off light in the visible spectrum, became so frosted over that the weight of the frost and ice caused them to come crashing to the ground in the middle of the intersection.    Embed Quote
