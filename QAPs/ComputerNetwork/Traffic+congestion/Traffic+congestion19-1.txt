★How do externalities in traffic congestion cause a less than optimal allocation of resources in road transport?
The exact mechanism, or you could say the reason why traffic congestion is a negative externality, goes like this: Any one person entering a road causes that road to be more congested. Congestion is a cost (remember, time=money :-)), but it's borne by other drivers, not by the person choosing the road - that's the definition of a negative externality. So the road becomes congested as a by-product of a lot of individual drivers, all of whom are following their own self-interest. That's the rationale behind congestion pricing (in which a charge is assessed to take a particular road when it's congested,) to make people pay the true cost of taking that road.    Embed Quote
