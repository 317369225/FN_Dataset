★What's the most feasible way to reduce traffic congestion in Los Angeles?I'd love the place otherwise.
Algorithm controlled traffic. Changing social behaviors, such as the political institutions that hesitate in implementing them, and physical infrastructure is difficult even at small scale. Not just lights, but routes and speeds moderated in real time. Tragically the "technology" has proven it power in financial markets for decades without helping mitigate the plight of wasted time and resources experienced in this phenomena.
