★Aerospace and Aeronautical Engineering: Why don't we have vertical take off (VTOL) pods to reduce traffic congestion?I went to the Hiller Aviation museum and saw these vertical take-off pods that were about 4 ft in diameter and were prototyped in the 1950s. Why aren't these more widely commercialized today?
would you ride with this guy? It is difficult to control I wouldn't want to try to do this part time. VTOL requires thrust to be greater than weight - that is a hard task to design. Not efficient either.    Embed Quote
