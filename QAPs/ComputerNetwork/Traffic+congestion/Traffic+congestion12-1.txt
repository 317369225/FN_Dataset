★What will LA do about its traffic congestion on the freeways?I was recently in LA.  The freeways have traffic jams mid-day on a Saturday.  If LA population wants to grow at all, what will they do about the roads?
There will be the occasional widening project, but the governor has said there will be no new freeways. More use of public transit and carpooling will be encouraged. Beyond that, tough luck.    Embed Quote
