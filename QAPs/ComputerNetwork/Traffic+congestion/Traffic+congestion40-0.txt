★Do you think an increase in the price of fossil fuel may reduce the number of wheels on the road, and thereby decrease traffic congestion and environmental issues?
First thing is that the prices of fossil fuels like Coal, Natural Gas, Diesel, Petrol, LPG and Kerosene are bound to increase from time to time like all other products and services due to the effect of inflation. If the increase is not abnormal compared to inflation, surely it would not affect the consumption. Now, the question is what would be the effect on the consumption if the prices are increased abnormally ? I don't have the statistics, but from the past trends it appears that even when the prices were increased abnormally, the consumption was curtailed for short periods only to pick up thereafter.Perhaps, factors like poor public transport, reluctance to forgo the comforts, change in the spending habits and increase in purchasing power capacity made public to abandon the idea of curtailing the consumption. However, if the prices are increased to such an extent that even the upper middle class could not afford, with a view to curtail the consumption, it would adversely affect  the inflation of other products and services (not to mention public furore) to such an extent that the solution would appear far worse than the problem. The better alternative to curtail the consumption could be to improve the public transport, roads and develop alternative sources of energy    Embed Quote
