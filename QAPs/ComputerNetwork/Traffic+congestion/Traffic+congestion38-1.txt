★What extent do you agree or disagree? The best way for the government to solve the traffic congestion problems in cities is to provide free transport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Disagree. How would you propose paying for this "free" service? The cost of vehicles, maintenance, personnel, traffic routing and dispatch, convenience scheduling...ad infinitum? We all know there is no such thing as free. MASSIVE taxation would be required for subsidizing such a free service, which means YOU pay for MY transportation, and vice versa, as well as those who sit at home subsidizing your transport needs.    Embed Quote
