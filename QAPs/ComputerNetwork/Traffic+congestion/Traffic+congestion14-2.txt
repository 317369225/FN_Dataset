★Is metro really a need for Kochi and will it be profiable and add to the already worst traffic congestion?
It is hoped that once the metro becomes operational people who used to commute on their two wheelers or cars will use the metro instead.I dont think there really is any profit to be made in the endeavour,if profit was the motive we could started a beverages shop instead.But taking into account the reduced congestion and fuel costs the project is sure to be a social success....    Embed Quote
