★What types of people choose to live in Palo Alto over San Francisco?
For me, I'd rather live in Palo Alto because I have more friends, and also for the Stanford social dance scene. Plus, road biking is much more accessible in Palo Alto than in SF. In general, Palo Alto residents are decent, fine, upstanding people who are likely just as boring as people who live in the city.    Embed Quote
