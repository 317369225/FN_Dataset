★Traffic Congestion: Will multi-tiered highways ease traffic congestion?An example of a multi-tiered highway is the old Bay Bridge. Why don't we have a similar concept for our regular highways as well? The only difference in exits would be that the top most "floors" of a highway have to exit earlier so that they can get to the "ground floor" level when making an exit.
It's usually more expensive to build multi-level highways than to buy the land to widen the highway. Multi-level highways may be economic, however, in countries where land prices are high and labor is cheap. Also, multi-level highways are more expensive to maintain, and have a negative aesthetic value when built through urban neighborhoods. Lastly, in earthquake-prone areas, they are liable to collapse if not engineered and built properly.    Embed Quote
