★How can we improve traffic congestion in Los Angeles?
Alas we can't. It's a structural issue that is being addressed by municipal planners. There's a surge in urban apartments (almost lofts) located near new rail/train stations layering most of the city from Santa Monica onward. Uber (and I suppose Lyft) are changing commuting as many people simply use their services instead of driving to work or out as the cost is similar to parking fees. Bicycle lanes have to be improved, as they are in Santa Monica (Fancy Monica). Public transportation changes are happening, alas it takes years. The move to urban not suburban living is real and changing everything. Living within walking or biking distance of work, shopping, entertainment and then reaping the benefits of less traffic.    Embed Quote
