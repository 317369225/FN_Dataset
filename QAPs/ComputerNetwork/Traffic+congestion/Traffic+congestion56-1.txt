★What are the best examples of the law of unintended consequences in action?These could be from any arena -- politics, business, economics, science, startups, etc. -- but should be actual, real-life examples, not hypotheticals.  See Unintended consequences if this is not a familiar concept already.
My favorite example of the law of unintended consequences is Hoy No Circula, the traffic rationing policy of Mexico City. Mexico City is notorious for its traffic and the large amount of air pollution that vehicles cause.  In order to stop this problem, the government designated certain days as "No drive days", meaning, if your car's plate number ended with certain digits, you could not drive on specific days. For example, On Mondays, Number plates ending with 5 or 6 weren't allowed on roads. On Tuesdays, 7 or 8. Wednesdays, 3 or 4, Thursdays 1 or 2, and Fridays 9 or 0. It seemed like a neat idea, and although the move was supposed to reduce the number of vehicles on roads and thereby reduce air pollution, the exact opposite happened. The reason for that is mentioned in the book Think Like a Freak, by the Freakonomics authors. People in Mexico City bought cars, mostly very old second hand ones, making sure that the number plates had different last digits from the ones they already owned! So now the number of cars that people owned virtually doubled. When it was the "No drive day" for one car, people would simply use the other car. And because there were more old cars on road, pollution increased, not decreased. Hence the solution to the problem exacerbated the problem itself.    Embed Quote
