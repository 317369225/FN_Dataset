★Will driver-less cars reduce traffic congestion?
Once driverless cars reach (about) 30% of traffic on the road, they will greatly have an effect on congestion. Until then, it will not be the driverless cars themselves that have an effect, but the way they are used (shared, connected, intercity services, between neighborhoods, as taxis, integrated with public transport and other systems etc.)    Embed Quote
