★Will having variable speed limit reduce traffic congestion?Will the average time a car spends on the road decrease because of variable speed limit? If yes, how will the right speed limit at any point in time on the road determined?
I will explain this to you through the fundamental diagrams of traffic flow theory. The diagram on the right shows the relationship between flow and speed on a given roadway. As you can see the highest amount of flow output occurs at qmax. At this point the average speed of the roadway is almost half of the free flow speed but maximum throughput is being provided. The reason for variable speed limits is to prevent the traffic characteristics to pass this point  and enter the lower part of the flow speed diagram which we have less output flow and lower speeds. So the speed may not be too high at the chosen speed but at least it will be consistent rather than a stop and go situation.    Embed Quote
