★How important are new ride-share services like Lyft Line and UberPool for the ultimate goal of reducing traffic and traffic congestion (August 2014)?
As a person who is pro-competition, I think having services like Lyft and Uber are ultimately good for the consumer since prices will need to remain competitive (in order for people to use it), However, I doubt it will do much to ease traffic (especially in NYC where I live) since most of these services are meant for individuals and not necessarily for car-pooling types.    Embed Quote
