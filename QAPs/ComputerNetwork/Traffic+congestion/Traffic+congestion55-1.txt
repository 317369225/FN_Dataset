★What types of people choose to live in Palo Alto over San Francisco?
After living here for 10+ years, I find Palo Alto is one of the few places in the USA where I can: Walk to work Walk to groceries Walk to great coffee (Caffe del Doge!) Walk to great restaurants Walk to at least 5 parks within a mile with my 3.5 year old son Walk to Caltrain Walk to Farmer's market(s) Walk to Stanford Note: Above true for University Avenue +/- 5 blocks, California Avenue +/- 5 blocks replace walk with "bike" for the rest of Palo Alto. And my property taxes go towards good public schools, I have a choice in buying green energy (a portion).    Embed Quote
