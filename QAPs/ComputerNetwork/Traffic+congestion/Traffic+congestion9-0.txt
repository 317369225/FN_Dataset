★Is traffic congestion linear in the number of cars? Why or why not?This excellent Ted talk claims traffic jams are non-linear: That a 20% decrease in the number of cars will cause a decrease of more than 20% in the level of congestion. Is this true? Is there a model that explains this phenomenon? Jonas Eliasson: How to solve traffic jams | Video on TED.com
The theory that is best to look at when understanding the relationship between traffic volumes and speeds is called traffic flow theorey. I could go into the their a bit, but it will probably be benefitcial for you to have a read yourself . Basically the relationship wouldn't be linear unless every car in traffic wasn't affected by the cars in front of another. But since each car's speed is affected from the car or cars in front of it, the speed reduction would increase as density (current volumes) increase to the point to where a traffic jam would occur. http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publicat...    Embed Quote
