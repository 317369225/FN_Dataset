★What are the specific infrastructure projects that can solve traffic congestion problems of Bangalore?
I think something along the lines of Ahmedabad BRTS would work very well in Bangalore and could be the only scalable solution. From my experience driving around bangalore for the last 8 years, most of the issue/traffic jam happens when either the bus stops somewhere and all the cars behind the bus try to squeeze into the other lane or when a lot of buses line up at a stop trying to get back one another and clog up the road. Something like the Ahmedabad BRTS would ensure The buses get out of the fast lane and don't block other traffic the buses themselves get faster as they don't have to jostle for space with the cars and bikes. Emergency vehicles like police cars and ambulances have their own lane. This will ensure that lot more folks will start taking bus thereby taking additional vehicles off the road. And given how difficult it has been to build out the metro, this may be the only hope for Bangalore to have a mass transport system built out quickly.    Embed Quote
