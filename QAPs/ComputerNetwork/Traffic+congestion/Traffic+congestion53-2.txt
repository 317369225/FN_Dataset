★What's the difference between packet transmission delay and bandwidth?
Let's understand what some of the implication of the result to make our understanding more concrete : i) A bandwidth of 50 passengers per hour doesn't mean at all that the bus service can make 50 people reach the other end in 1 hour. It is just an average. For example, if the bus service increases the frequency of its buses  by 3. Then the bandwidth will triple to 150 passengers per hour. Yet it will take at least two hours for one person to reach from point A to point B. ii) Transmission delay can be reduced in certain ways. For example 10 minutes is a significant transmission delay for a 2 hour bus ride. So the bus service may want to decrease the transmission delay by reducing the number of passengers by one third. This will result in a transmission delay of only 3 minutes 20 seconds. But this will impact the bandwidth of the service down to about 17 passengers per hour. The bus service may again decide to increase the frequency three times. This will take the bandwidth back to 50 passengers per hour but might result in higher costs. Also you can do the calculation the other way and add the transmission delay to the travel time and hence arrive at a slightly lesser bandwidth. Generally transmission delay. Note, also that this is the bandwidth of the bus service and not the road link. The road can take even more number of people and be used by multiple bus services (or other services) simultaneously.    Embed Quote
