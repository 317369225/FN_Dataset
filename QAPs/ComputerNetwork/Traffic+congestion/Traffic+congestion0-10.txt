★Will driver-less cars reduce traffic congestion?
It is possible that driver-less cars can reduce traffic congestion temporarily. Driver-less cars will have a faster reaction time than a human being, and therefore can follow closer to the car in front of it. The car would also be able to automatically calculate the fastest route based on traffic conditions, spreading out congestion more evenly than it is currently. However, as many cities have learned, if the congestion reduces, often more people hop in their cars to drive (this is called induced demand Page on worldbank.org).  So, if we assume the same number of cars will be on the road, then yes, congestion will feel lower because of reaction time and, when possible, vehicle to vehicle communication. However, as Roderick pointed out, one of the best ways to reduce traffic congestion is to provide other transportation alternatives and move people out of personal vehicles. If driver-less cars allow for people to more comfortably share cars, or if they allow for lanes to be reserved for public transit alternatives, traffic congestion could be reduced for reasons other than driver-less car efficiency themselves. Here's some more on induced demand: Page on globalcitizen.net Report: Traffic Studies Systematically Overstate Benefits of Road Projects Basically, unless driver-less cars are used correctly and we figure out a way to store them either where people want to go or nearby so they are accessible, they will not reduce congestion.    Embed Quote
