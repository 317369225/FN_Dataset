★Is metro really a need for Kochi and will it be profiable and add to the already worst traffic congestion?
With the present convertion rates between Rupie and Dollar the budget for the project will increase much more. so it will increase the period taking for the project being profitable but being in Kochi for more than five years I can say that It can reduce the traffic problems to an extent. It can reduce the traveling time from Aluva to Kochi considerably. Read it along the plans of Kochi city authorities to ban bikes and private cars entering to the city and to promote puclic transports. Considering there is no further real estate for developing roads which is vital for the future development authorities have to depend on something like metro or water traffic. So I believe that Kochi metro will definitly help to reduce the traffic but not to a great extend. And for that they will have to relay on other plans. For being profitable, it will take time.    Embed Quote
