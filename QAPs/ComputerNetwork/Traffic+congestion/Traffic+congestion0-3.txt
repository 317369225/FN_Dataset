★Will driver-less cars reduce traffic congestion?
Not in urban areas. Pedestrians will jaywalk in front of them at all opportunities and slow traffic. Driverless cars will need some serious safety/ reaction equipment which will force them to err on the side of caution if any pedestrian is in the road.  The companies making driverless cars will have to be this extreme because if a pedestrian is ever hit and killed, the cars will be banned (think of all the cliches in the news: "robots cannot really replace human judgement" etc). Pedestrians, knowing this, will experiment with these cars and learn how they can optimally jay walk so the cars yield to them. It can be as simple as when a car is stopped at a red light in busy midtown Manhattan, when the light turns green the incessant flow of pedestrians just refuses to stop, and the mob of pedestrians moves on. Think of how many people jaywalk or are jerks in traffic right now. With the driverless cars, you don't have to stare down a steaming driver when you block his path. Without impossibly high levels of traffic cops, dense urban areas will be inaccessible by car.    Embed Quote
