★Is metro really a need for Kochi and will it be profiable and add to the already worst traffic congestion?
Have you seen the kochi traffic...? and you still ask this question? So what are the ways in which we can reduce the traffic? 1) Drive less vehicles,use cycles,walk, use public transport like buses.. 2) Widen the roads. Build flyovers. 3) Stop stepping out of your houses. But do you think that this can be implemented..? People have already started adopting the 3rd option due to the traffic. But is that desirable? And the population of Kochi is only going to increase. The Metro is for the future. I dont see any other viable alternative for easing the congestion. But will it be profitable? Most metros in the world are not built fr profit (the reason why most metros are built by the govt). But a one-off 5000 crore bill is nothing when compared to the overall development of the city.    Embed Quote
