★Is there a solution to Melbourne's growing traffic congestion? It's speculated that in a few years the population is going to double and one can only imagine the traffic situation with the current infrastructure.
The population is growing and the need to plan but also take action now IS urgent Hers my plan   1. build bike lanes next to all waterways that don't already have them. A rather quick solution 2. build bike lanes by all rail lines. Few of those exist except by disused rail lines. Another relatively quick one 3. eliminate street parking within 100m of the approach side of traffic lights 4. allow turning left on a red light- do this right now. It works in other countries, why not here 5. build the east west link (former government plan) AND proceed with rail tunnel (current government plan). Huge cost but worth it. 6. Do proceed with eliminating rail level crossings....not just 50 of them  in next few years but all of them (360 I think). This part will take decades, but     start now.   The above, whilst expensive will not only reduce traffic in the short term but the longer term. We seem to be in a downturn in the economy. Building infrastructure is a great investment and creates jobs   I have ideas on how to fund the above but this isn't the place for it. I might run it past the politicians.    Embed Quote
