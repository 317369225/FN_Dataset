★Why shouldn't public bus transport in cities in India be opened to the private sector? Will that not alleviate some of the traffic congestion issues?
Delhi has Blue line buses as well as DTC buses. Private and government owned respectively. While DTC buses are hard to spot amongst Blue line buses, blue line buses are notorious for the road accidents they involve in. The Blue line bus drivers get bonus for extra trips they make during fixed time leading to rash driving. Most of the auto drivers also drive rash as they run against the clock to maximise gains.    Embed Quote
