★Why shouldn't public bus transport in cities in India be opened to the private sector? Will that not alleviate some of the traffic congestion issues?
Opening up Public bus transport is a wonderful idea for the BJP government. But they have to do it on professional lines - like Air Plane Operators - INDIGO / VISTARA - The government has to ensure that the chosen operator has the capacity to invest and operate a modern service for the benefit of one and all. Rickshaws are one of the worst forms of public transport - it is the equvivalent of a chaffuer driven vehicle - average occupancy is only one - however it is never available during peak hours. Rickshaws also clog the roads - One bus can accomodate passengers equivalent to 40 rickshaws - so one bus driver against 40 rickshaw drivers on the street - that is a nightmare for any traffic policeman. Rickshaws are also know to break the speed and momentum of heavier vehicles thereby bringing down the average speed of traffic. Most rickshaw drivers are prone to breaking all laws whether in their profession or in their day to day life because they know how to bribe or how to politically circumvent the law (vote-bank) Therefore any move by the government has to be carefully thought, planned and executed - else  we will continue to suffer in the domain of public transport.    Embed Quote
