★What types of people choose to live in Palo Alto over San Francisco?
I've lived in each of San Francisco and Menlo Park (within about 2 blocks of Palo Alto) for years. I think the types of people who choose to live in Palo Alto value some of the following: Reducing the Commute -- I believe that long commutes are very painful and a significant waste of time.  Since I have been working in the Palo Alto area for 7+ years I chose to move very close to work. Enjoying Better Weather -- The Palo Alto area has a significantly more consistent weather profile than San Francisco.  While I'm a huge fan of the temperate climate in the bay area, Palo Alto is usually sunnier, warmer, and seems to have less rain. Enjoying Better Access to Hiking, Cycling, and Swimming -- Palo Alto has fantastic opportunities for outdoor training activities -- possibly better than San Francisco (see number 2!) Living with Less Stress -- The Palo Alto area has fewer distractions in the form of parking tickets, traffic congestion, noise, garbage, and homeless residents. Better Schools -- While this isn't a concern for me, I have heard many people describe the elementary and high schools as important to their choice to live in Palo Alto. In choosing to live in the Palo Alto area I give up the following from San Francisco: Closer proximity to some of my best friends Golden Gate Park, Presidio, the beach More diversity of restaurants More activities and parties More spontaneous get-togethers Better coffee shops    Embed Quote
