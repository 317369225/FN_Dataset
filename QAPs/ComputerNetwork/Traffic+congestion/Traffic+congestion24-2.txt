★How important are new ride-share services like Lyft Line and UberPool for the ultimate goal of reducing traffic and traffic congestion (August 2014)?
The impact most likely will still need to be seen. Will Lyft Lime and UberPool make carpooling more desirable? Probably not, but at least they'll make carpooling more accessible. Greater accessibility will encourage those who find carpooling to be desirable but inaccessible to actually carpool. Of course, the question then becomes, how many people are out there who want to carpool but can't find carpool partners? As for the traffic impact, if these services can get many groups of three or four people to carpool together, that removes two or three cars off the road per carpooling group, which then starts feeling like a significant impact. How many groups of three or four carpoolers will these services form? Also, Lyft drivers sometimes act more like car-hire services, in that they can be making trips not because they are going in that direction anyway, but because they're doing it for Lyft. If someone makes a special trip just to get someone else from Point A to Point B, that actually can add another car onto the road, rather than reduce congestion.    Embed Quote
