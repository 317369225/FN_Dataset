★What types of people choose to live in Palo Alto over San Francisco?
Schools, kids, families reign supreme.  It's literally impossible to justify the expense of real estate in Palo Alto unless you take into account the fact that the public schools are outstanding; they displace $15K-20K per year in private school tuition per child.  I say this as one who graduated from Palo Alto High School (Paly).  I went off to a top liberal arts college in the Northeast and found myself as well-prepared as my classmates who'd attended elite private boarding schools.  Gunn also excels academically (even though it sucks in general -- yes, there's a little rivalry).  Public schools in SF, like most of CA, are awful. Of course there are many other factors cited in the other answers.  In general, I think people who choose to live on the Peninsula place less value on diversity, political activism, gay and lesbian community activities, and hard-partying nightlife.  (SF is a great place to drink heavily because most people don't have to drive.)    Embed Quote
