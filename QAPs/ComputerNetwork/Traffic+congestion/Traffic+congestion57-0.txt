★Did the Delhi Metro solve Delhi's traffic congestion problem?Also please mention other ways in which the Metro may have impacted city life in Delhi. Please provide your sources if possible.
Oh yes it did to a very large extent. Delhi metro is used by more than 20 Lakh people daily. Delhi Metro daily ridership crosses 23 lakh Can you imagine the number of cars, buses, autos, taxis that have been prevented from going on the road because of the metro. Now imagine the amount of diesel/petrol the government/public has saved by travelling via the metro and not using other means of transport? And add to that the amount of pollution we have controlled and the green house gas emissions we have controlled. The shutting down of the Blue line bus service in delhi was only possible because of the delhi metro. Otherwise who have carried the load if the blue line had been shut down?
