★Is there a solution to Melbourne's growing traffic congestion? It's speculated that in a few years the population is going to double and one can only imagine the traffic situation with the current infrastructure.
Car Pooling, congestion tax, better public transport. Unblocking the streets that were narrowed to force traffic onto the toll ways. Implement double-decker trains (if possible) as they have done in Sydney. Double decker buses.  Stagger the work hours. Decentralize the CBD.    Embed Quote
