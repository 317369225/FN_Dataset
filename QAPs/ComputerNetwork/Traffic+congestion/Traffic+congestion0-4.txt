★Will driver-less cars reduce traffic congestion?
Yes, it will reduce traffic congestion to a great extent. Some of the possible methods/reasons are listed below: The headway (distance) between the cars can be significantly reduced, hence allowing high density along with high speed. With human drivers, it is not possible because humans are required to maintain a certain distance based on their speed and reaction time. You won't feel comfortable to drive at 100 kph with only 1 meter distance between vehicles. The speed limits can be increased (to design speed without safety margin) as the driver-less vehicles' reaction time would be very little as compare to humans. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Infrastructure-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure communication technology along with driver-less technology can reduce delays at signalized intersections both by reducing the "waves" (as mentioned by Peter Gribble) and also the imperfect signal cycle timing (extra red or extra green or yellow time). I personally feel that if this is perfectly executed, it can eliminate the need for signals. Furthermore, driver-less vehicles along with V2V can "work together" and aim for System Optimal routes which will decrease the total travel time of the system as a whole. But, humans would still want their driver-less vehicles to select routes which will minimize their individual travel time (User Equilibrium).    Embed Quote
