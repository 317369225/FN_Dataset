★Aerospace and Aeronautical Engineering: Why don't we have vertical take off (VTOL) pods to reduce traffic congestion?I went to the Hiller Aviation museum and saw these vertical take-off pods that were about 4 ft in diameter and were prototyped in the 1950s. Why aren't these more widely commercialized today?
What everyone else has written and Weather. Unless you're in one of those lovely parts of the country which has Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) most of the time, you will need a machine capable of operation in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). Such machines are likely to be much more expensive (requiring Radar and Synthetic Vision systems) and thus out of the reach of the general public when it comes to adoption for practical use.    Embed Quote
