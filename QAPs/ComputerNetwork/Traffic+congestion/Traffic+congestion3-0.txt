★How does a flyover reduce traffic congestion?Earlier when there is no bridge, there always seem to be a jam, but with a bridge, the traffic flow becomes smooth again. How?
As with a bypass the traffic is allowed another route and so capacity is increased. Also junction redesign may have improved the flow and so increased the capacity too.    Embed Quote
