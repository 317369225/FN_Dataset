★Why aren't cars with auto transmission not popular in India? Isn't it easier and lesser stress to drive an auto car on the traffic-congested roads?
For a country obsessed with milage and pricing its a pretty tough market. Automatic transmission consumes more petrol than a manual transmission and the initial investment for a car with AT is more than MT. Indians always try to make economic sense of whatever they buy. You make a AT car with the pricing of MT and all the features that comes, along with mileage, they would be happy to buy it. In someway Suzuki has tried to achieve this through celerio but the performance doesn't match to that of swift or i20 in that segment. Didn't really take off. Price of the car n its mileage are what people see. The thumb rule is this: More for Less! ( more features less money) You get this one thing right. You will see AT vehicles plying the road.    Embed Quote
