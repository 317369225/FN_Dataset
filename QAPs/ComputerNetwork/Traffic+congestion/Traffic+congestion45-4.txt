★Do drivers who keep extremely huge gaps between their car and the car in front of them in heavy, very slow stop-and-go traffic cause the congested traffic to be worse?
Yes. At times some of us are aware other people may have problems. I occasionally drive on U.S. 101, which goes to bumper to bumper every week day commute time. And yes, many of us aware of the benefits of the buffering & smoothing effects mentioned by Eddie Xue and Nate Waddoups. However, much more important to some of us, are reaction time and distances need to brake both for OUR cars and for FOLLOWING cars. I don't want to hit the car in front of me , when (not if) the have to brake suddenly. I don't want to be hit by the car in back of me. Even if I can go from 60 to 0 in 170 feet*, the car in back of me may take longer. So I am going to allow a little extra so that. So I do reduce traffic density enough that the net through put drops. And I know it. Even when traffic is moving slow, and stopping distances are shorter, reaction time plus getting from the accelerator to the brake takes about 0.8 seconds.  At 30 mph, that's about 35 feet, and then there is still stopping distance. So about 3 car lengths of space will be needed, not 1 car length. I am going to put MY SAFETY ahead of OTHER PEOPLES CONVENIENCE. And the other people are welcome to go pound sand. * Those of you with high performance cars take note - You may be able to 60 to 0 in 140 feet (BMW, Audi and some Mercedes) or 120 feet (Porsche etc.) or even  105 feet (Nissan GT- R.  Be sure to put your contact lenses back in after you stop) But... The average car can take 170 to 220 feet. The average pickup truck takes 2400 feet or more.... (meaning if where the truck is going to stop is 90 feet past where your rear bumper stops, you may hear a very loud and expensive sound)    Embed Quote
