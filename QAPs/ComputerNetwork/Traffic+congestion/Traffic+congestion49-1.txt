★Are the sky rocketing housing prices and increasingly congested traffic and public transport in Singapore a result of poor urban planning?
It's not. In fact Singapore has the best urban planning in the world. The current situation is due to its liberal immigration policy which attracted many foreign immigrants and workers to stay in singapore. Singapore has become one of the most densely populated cities in the world. This drives the housing prices to sky high and caused other problems you mentioned.    Embed Quote
