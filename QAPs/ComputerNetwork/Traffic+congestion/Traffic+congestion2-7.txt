★What's the most feasible way to reduce traffic congestion in Los Angeles?I'd love the place otherwise.
Whatever solution we come up with, better not involve building some more.  Please. It is the people that congest cities like LA with a ridiculously high number of people driving alone in large cars.  It is a phallic obsession with the USA, to drive as big a vehicle as possible.  I'm cool with soccer moms taking entire teams in their SUVs, but I'm not for a single person driving anything on four wheels when the weather is just fine, and in LA it bloody well is fine for most of the year. Motorcycles are a fantastic alternative, but it would take a lot of convincing, since Americans are scared of being killed by cars while on a bike.  There aren't enough motorcycles around to justify exclusive lanes for them at the moment, but there's enough incentive to get everywhere on time. Little changes like pizza delivery can definitely be done on bikes and scooters.  The pizza will get there piping hot, and a scooter won't be a hassle to park. Public transportation basic infrastructure is quite good in LA, but the sprawl is hard to beat if you have to make changes and transfers.  That said, I have a friend who was commuting from Pasadena to Universal Studios every day and I asked her why she doesn't take the train.  Just out of curiosity she tried it, and fell in love with the idea of parking her car at the train station in Pasadena, and then taking two trains that bring her very quickly to Universal.  She loved the savings too!  But she just hadn't tried it for years! The damn obsession with cars and driving must go down and hopefully LA will truly grow up in this one area I find it to be really regressive in at the moment.    Embed Quote
