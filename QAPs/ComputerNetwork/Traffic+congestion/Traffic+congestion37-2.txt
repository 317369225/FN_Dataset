★Is there a solution to Melbourne's growing traffic congestion? It's speculated that in a few years the population is going to double and one can only imagine the traffic situation with the current infrastructure.
Melbourne is growing way to quick, and our infrastructure plans for the state are at what seems to be a stagnant point. Instead of widening roads or even building new ones, our government are more concerned about what terrible art piece they want on land that could be used in many better ways. By the time the Western Ring Road was completed (the upgrades to it that is) it was already, again incapable to swiftly and safely help motorists to their destinations, its a prime example as to how this government are terrible at growing Melbourne, with its population rise. I guess what I am trying to say is, hope is not so good.    Embed Quote
