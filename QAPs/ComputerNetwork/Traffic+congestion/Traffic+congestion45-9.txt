★Do drivers who keep extremely huge gaps between their car and the car in front of them in heavy, very slow stop-and-go traffic cause the congested traffic to be worse?
The most frequent cause of unnecessarily slow traffic that I've seen  has been hogging of the passing lanes by cars that are not passing any other vehicles. Why do drivers behave this way? Either because they're uneducated drivers, or  unconscious of the cars stuck behind them or because, for their own dark purposes, they want to control the speed of the cars behind them. The government should  invest some money broadcasting public service announcements educating drivers to "Drive Right; Pass Left".    Embed Quote
