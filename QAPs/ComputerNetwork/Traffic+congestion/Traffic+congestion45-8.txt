★Do drivers who keep extremely huge gaps between their car and the car in front of them in heavy, very slow stop-and-go traffic cause the congested traffic to be worse?
No, they are not the cause. The cause of slow or stop-and-go traffic is something acting as a bottleneck, something that is limiting the speed of flow. When police pull a car over, people slow down to look. They take a small moment of their time, but they also slow down everyone behind them. Then, the next person does the same thing, keeping the speed low. The traffic stop and the "rubber-necking" created a point of congestion. When three lanes reduce to two and traffic needs to merge, that causes congestion as cars slow to allow space so density doesn't increase. This is a point of congestion. When a car stalls in one lane and two lanes must merge, it is terrible congestion because of the merge and the rubber-necking. The person who leaves space doesn't slow the speed of traffic, he just wastes the space of one or two cars. If he sped up to consume the gap, traffic would speed up too and in 10 seconds or so, the waste would be gone, then it would be right back to the same speed. A point of congestion, by comparison, stays slow.    Embed Quote
