★Do ring road systems in cities create more traffic congestion?
I don't think Ring Roads can create more traffic congestion as they allow people who want to bypass the city (to go to another one) or to those who want to commute between large distance parts of the city to use Ring Road. I live in Ahmedabad and the S P Ring Road (Outer) is very efficient in large distance travel as well as bypassing Ahmedabad on a long journey in state. Also the 132 ft Ring Road (Inner) is efficient as one doesn't have to travel through narrow old city roads. Ring Roads take the pressure off the city roads.    Embed Quote
