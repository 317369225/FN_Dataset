★Will driver-less cars reduce traffic congestion?
I don't think it's an easy yes or no answer to this. Granted there will be closer headways, but that will aid in increasing capacity and nothing else. Consider a situation where the driverless car indulges in idle trips. You go to work at 8, reach your work place at 830 and instead of parking the car, you send it back to pick your kid from home whose school starts at 9:30. It undertakes an idle trip from work to home, picks up your child, drops in school ad is awaiting ur next command. This is a situation that driverless cars might come to face, yes it's a foreseeable amount of time away, but this kind of a situation will only increase congestion and reduce vehicle occupancy rates.    Embed Quote
