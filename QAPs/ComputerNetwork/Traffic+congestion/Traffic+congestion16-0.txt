★What's the quickest way to solve a city's traffic congestion?
Don't. Traffic congestion is the most efficient way to use a road. It is also safer (less accidents and fatalities per capita). And it is the best incentive for individual drivers to find alternative methods for getting around in the city. A far better solution is to fund infrastructure that supports alternatives to driving a car: Develop complete neighbourhoods, that allow most residents to walk to most of the services and amenities they need. Develop high density urban centres, and stop or discourage the development of suburbs. Design streets that are safe and attractive for all users according to a set of priorities that places pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders first and drivers last. Build an extensive network of bike trails and cycling infrastructure (bike lockers, bike rental stations, bike stands, etc.). Create a reliable and extensive bus system which may include, as needed, “Rapid Bus” service. Develop a tram, trolley, moving sidewalk, and subway system as needed in areas of highest density to link remote areas to a core urban area. Discourage the development of parking lots, encourage a policy that reducing parking requirements throughout  the city. The best way (but, maybe not the quickest way) to deal with traffic congestion is to make alternatives to driving easier, safer and more attractive. The sooner this is done the sooner the city can reap the economic, social, public health and public safety benefits that result from having a more efficient transportation system.    Embed Quote
