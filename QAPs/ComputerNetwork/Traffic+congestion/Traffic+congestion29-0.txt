★How early in the morning should I start driving on the road to Hana in order to avoid traffic congestion?
Were I doing that drive, I'd start at daybreak or even a little before. The whole reason for doing it is the beauty of the scenery, and you'll want lots of time for photos, and gawking.  Take a good camera and a variety of filters... circular polarized, straight polarized, sepia polarized, and perhaps a fish eye.    Embed Quote
