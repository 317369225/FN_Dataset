★What's the most feasible way to reduce traffic congestion in Los Angeles?I'd love the place otherwise.
Make all the streets one way -- it's cars turning against oncoming traffic that screws everything up. You could also try to synchronize the traffic lights -- that might help alleviate the accordion effect. Pedestrian overpasses would also help quite a bit, but I don't think that would fit nicely under the umbrella of feasible.    Embed Quote
