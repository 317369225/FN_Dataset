★Why shouldn't public bus transport in cities in India be opened to the private sector? Will that not alleviate some of the traffic congestion issues?
There is no written law which stops private sector from entering this domain.. The thing is it involves with more investment and less output. So the private sector isn't interested in it. They provide bus service for long routes which get faster returns as compared to within city.    Embed Quote
