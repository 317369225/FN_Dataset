★Do drivers who keep extremely huge gaps between their car and the car in front of them in heavy, very slow stop-and-go traffic cause the congested traffic to be worse?
My answer to this is based on driving around Europe. In places where people obey the road law then there is a lot less chaos. You are talking between a free for all and an ordered flow of traffic. So the traffic runs a lot better in Germany than it does Italy. It isn't what the rules are it is the fact that the rules are there to help you and deciding to break them may give you a short term advantage, but leads to chaos.    Embed Quote
