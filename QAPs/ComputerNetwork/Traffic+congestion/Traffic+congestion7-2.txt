★What are some solutions for reducing traffic congestion in Hyderabad?
The major task is to improve the infrastructure (broader roads with less bumps! and more highways). A few others to list down, ->Automated traffic detecting signals, so that we don't have to wait if there are no vehicles on a road at a junction. ->This one is a farfetched idea for Indian roads,but anyway, to have CCTVs at traffic signals so that there are less traffic violations (at least for the fear of being fined) and hence less accidents that cause traffic jams often.    Embed Quote
