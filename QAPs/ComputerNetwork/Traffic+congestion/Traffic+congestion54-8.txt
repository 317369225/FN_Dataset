★Is it right time to make strict rules to minimize vehicles in India to reduce traffic congestion?
Yes,it's the best time to minimize vehicles on earth. How a government can minimize this? Govt should manke some rules like:This points are for traffic in india and should follow on daily basis. 1.)Charge minimum 50 rupees if car<5 Lacs,100 for car<10 Lacs,And 150 if car less than<15 Lacs. 2.)After this follow exponential function to tell their bill. 3.)No place for parking in Market place or if someone use vehicles in market charge atleast 5,000. 4.)If any neta does this kind of crime charge them 50 times more than actual cost. Now i am going to write why this points. *Explanation for point 1.)If car price is less than<15,means he/she comes in upper middle class in india and fortunately they avoid any other kind of farzi kharcha. *Explanation of point 2.)This people are greedy and want to show their cars(Car price more than 15 lacs),but the problem with this people that they can even afford exponential money asked by government,so it is better to make one more rule that if they commit this kind of crime more than 2 times they will charge double of exponential and media will meet him in lockup. *Explanation of point 3.)Dude you are in market for buy things,not for showing your car or whatever(It is possible that some one thinking that,i will go to every shop by using my car,so please promise me you will not go for morning walk in park by using your car.) *Explanation of point 4.)No need to explain after so much explanation. Why relating with money? We indians love to spend on food clothes,but not for farzi things(Like:Tax,Toll tax etc.). So,yes it's the best time to reduce vehicles.    Embed Quote
