★Is there a solution to Melbourne's growing traffic congestion? It's speculated that in a few years the population is going to double and one can only imagine the traffic situation with the current infrastructure.
Although the infrastructure is always limited, making investments in expanding transportation infrastructure is a must. However, that is not the only solution. Using methods to make more efficient use of the available infrastructure is also needed. You may have also realized that a large portion of delays in the urban traffic network is caused by poor signal timing. Investing in ITS is a fast, cost efficient and reliable method of making the best use out of the available infrastructure.    Embed Quote
