★Aerospace and Aeronautical Engineering: Why don't we have vertical take off (VTOL) pods to reduce traffic congestion?I went to the Hiller Aviation museum and saw these vertical take-off pods that were about 4 ft in diameter and were prototyped in the 1950s. Why aren't these more widely commercialized today?
First, welcome to the neighborhood. Now, as to why we don't have these: That big ring around the bottom is a duct, and inside of it is a large spinning helicopter-style blade (rotor). You would be on top. If you step off the platform, you die. If you drop something, it's chopped to smithereens, breaks the blades, you lose lift, you fall, and you die. You'll notice that unlike a helicopter, the center of gravity is above the rotor. If you tilt even a little bit too far over to one side, you will tumble so that the center of gravity is beneath the rotor. That's still providing (now negative) lift, so you auger into the ground at high speed, and you die. Millions of these little things darting around are sure to cause an air traffic collision. You fall and you die.    Embed Quote
