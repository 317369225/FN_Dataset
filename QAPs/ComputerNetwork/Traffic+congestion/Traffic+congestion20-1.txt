★Aerospace and Aeronautical Engineering: Why don't we have vertical take off (VTOL) pods to reduce traffic congestion?I went to the Hiller Aviation museum and saw these vertical take-off pods that were about 4 ft in diameter and were prototyped in the 1950s. Why aren't these more widely commercialized today?
Tony Li made great points about the hazards of this particular design. In a broader sense, we could also ask why we don't have more vehicles that can exploit the third dimension (a.k.a "flying").  I've concluded that the biggest reason is that it would be incredibly dangerous for a large number of people to be able to hop around just anywhere.  Perhaps once we've mastered self-driving cars, then we can look into self-flying cars. Just a few of the considerations that make flying impractical for the average "driver": If your car breaks down, you pull over to the side of the road.  If your flying machine breaks down, gravity takes over.  You're going to land either in the middle of traffic (who likely won't see you coming), or on someone's home or yard... or dog... or child.  We can include running out of fuel in this category. There are a LOT of vertical obstructions.  Street lights, trees, cell towers, and worst of all, power lines.  Unlike the fairly clear two-dimensional corridors we call streets, flying poses a veritable maze of hazards.  (Yes, I know: "Just fly over them!"  But, what goes up must come down at some point.  You'll at least have to worry about them when taking off and landing.) The human element.  You've doubtless seen how reckless some people can be while driving.  Imagine if they weren't confined to roads, but could instead drive right over your house.  Or land on it.As an anonymous responder pointed out, these are not insurmountable obstacles, but neither are they simple ones.    Embed Quote
