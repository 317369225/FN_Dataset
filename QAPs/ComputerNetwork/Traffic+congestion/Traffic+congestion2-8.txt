★What's the most feasible way to reduce traffic congestion in Los Angeles?I'd love the place otherwise.
Put everyone on a motorcycle or scooter and you'd reduce traffic congestion, , gasoline consumption, pollution and road rage! Two wheel riders are always happier than people riding in cages! Not ONCE have any of our elected officials in LA OR the media EVER talked about two wheels as an solution to our traffic problems in LA. You would be surprised how much stuff you can carry on two wheels! I for one will be picking up my Christmas tree on my bike this week, a 6-foot Noble Fir!!! Who needs an SUV and who needs Costco! LOL!    Embed Quote
