★How does traffic congestion happen?
Because people drive erratically. Let me explain. The best analogy I find for traffic is that it is a fluid. Roads are like funnels and the cars are water molecules. Imagine an empty road. Anybody can drive on this at any speed, right? So let's add a few cars. As long as there aren't very many cars, each one can go as fast or as slow as it wants to without any detrimental effects. Once there are enough though, then each car's action starts affecting the others. However, if all the cars were to move in lockstep, we could move cars as fast as we wanted through the funnel. Let's suppose we have a bunch of cars zipping happily along at 60 mph on the freeway. Let's say, however, that a very interesting cat has appeared on the side of the road and one rubbernecking guy decides to slow down and look at it. Suddenly he has created a wave: His slowing down causes the cars behind him to slow down, etc. etc, until you get a traffic jam (or at the very least a severe slowdown). This is true even if the cat moves away and there is nothing to look at! Think about it: I can't move until the person in front of me moves, and until he does I have no room to move forward. The only way to instantly clear this jam would be if every car affected moved forward at the same time. Yet, we can't do that, so that's why sometimes you will see slowdowns that appear completely arbitrary. If you want to know more, this person has done a pretty good write-up of the whole issue. http://www.eskimo.com/~billb/ama...    Embed Quote
