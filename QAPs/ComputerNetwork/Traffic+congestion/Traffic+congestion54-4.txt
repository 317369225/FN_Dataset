★Is it right time to make strict rules to minimize vehicles in India to reduce traffic congestion?
Your solution seems good on the face of it. (And strict rules are definitely needed). Let's make cars expensive and discourage people from driving in general. But what then? How do people get from point A to poiny B?Singapore has done this. As have many other major cities in developed countries. Driving is discouraged via heavy duties on vehicles, strict rules, and ridiculously expensive parking rates. But one thing common across all these cities is that they offer an extremely good public transportation as a substitute. Notice that roads only shift bottlenecks from one overcrowded junction to another. The only long term sustainable solution to traffic is a well functioning public transportation system capable of absorbing the daily commutes. I do agree with what Balaji Viswanathan said about new cities decongesting the existing cities. But that is a very long term solution. Major projects need to be initiated to install and improve metro lines and buses in all of the major Indian cities. Also, the new cities that would come up need to be 'smart'; that is they need to minimize reliance on small vehicles for commuting.    Embed Quote
