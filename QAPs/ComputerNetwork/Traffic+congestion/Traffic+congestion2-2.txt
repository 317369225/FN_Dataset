★What's the most feasible way to reduce traffic congestion in Los Angeles?I'd love the place otherwise.
Viable mass transit. Little things like: * A mass transit line that follows the 405 from the San Fernando Valley all the way down to Irvine. * Free shuttles/tram between the Aviation/LAX train stop and LAX. * More rail lines everywhere, or barring that: * Less-expensive/lower-impact mass transit (construction/maintenance) like The Gondola Project that can be scaled up to meet the present and future needs of Los Angeles Or alternatively, housing that people will live in, near the jobs that they want to work at. (I know several people who live in east San Gabriel Valley, but work in Long Beach, Santa Monica, and/or Venice - they choose SGV because they can buy there and afford it).    Embed Quote
