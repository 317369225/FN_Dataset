★Has the growing acceptance of non-traditional working hours eased rush hour traffic congestion in the Bay Area?Flexible working hours (not the old school 9-5) seem to be getting more and more common. Has this had much of an effect on traffic? I would imagine since driving times are staggered more, it would, although it still seems to be the worst around 9 and 5. Has anyone studied this?
Rush hour is still bad but it in short it has been stretched over a greater period of time while the local amplitudes at certain points may have decreased a little bit. I am not a traffic expert or anything, but I have lived here all my life and I can say you can expect traffic in the afternoon from 2-8 pm. Now it will be worst from about 4-7 pm but don't be surprised if you see a lot of traffic before or after that window. Several reasons for that: 1) long-distance commuters try to leave work before the rush hour traffic gets too heavy, 2) Traffic from parents picking up kids from school, 3) People with flexible schedules taking off early to do something outdoors (sports, beach, happy hour, etc) on a nice afternoon and make up the work at home later that night, 4) People who work really late getting off and going straight to the bars and restaurants.    Embed Quote
