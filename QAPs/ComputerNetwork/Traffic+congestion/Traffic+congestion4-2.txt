★Traffic Congestion: Will multi-tiered highways ease traffic congestion?An example of a multi-tiered highway is the old Bay Bridge. Why don't we have a similar concept for our regular highways as well? The only difference in exits would be that the top most "floors" of a highway have to exit earlier so that they can get to the "ground floor" level when making an exit.
I suppose multi-tiered highways will help but they are costly and ugley. Most roads were not built keeping multi-tiers in mind, therefore it will require a lot of rework.    Embed Quote
