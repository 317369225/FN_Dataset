★What's the difference between packet transmission delay and bandwidth?
Assuming a highway, and two points A and B in that highway. The highway represents a communication channel, cars represent packets, A represents a packet sender, B represents the receiver. Bandwidth can have two definitions if we refer to the highway (bandwidth) or the cars (named throughput). From the perspective of the highway, its bandwidth is the number of lanes it supports and the admission rate. It says nothing about the speed of the cars, or the actual number of cars travelling (throughput). It simply says that more cars can travel simultaneously from A to B. From the perspective of the traffic, its bandwidth is the amount of cars that are traveling at a given instant and is actually named throughput. The traffic throughput must always be lower or equal than the highway bandwidth. That is: if the highway has 3 lanes, only 3 cars can travel simultaneously. Latency is the time the cars take to travel from A to B. And is the sum of several times: the time the driver takes to enter the car (serialisation of data), the time the car takes to enter the highway (insertion), the time it travels through the highway, the time it takes to exit the highway, and finally the time it takes for the driver to leave the car (de-serialization). A frequent misconception is that bandwidth is related to latency, which simply is not true. Even if the bandwidth is high (10 lane highway) if the car speed is low (or one of the latency components is high), total latency will be high as the car will take a long time to go from A to B.    Embed Quote
