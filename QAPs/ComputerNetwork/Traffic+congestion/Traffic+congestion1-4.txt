★How does traffic congestion happen?
The previous answers assume that a certain number of cars need to be on the road at any given time, and that the question is how to move them as quickly as possible. But steps can also be taken to reduce the need for vehicular trips, or shorten the length of these trips, through good land use planning that brings origins and destinations closer together, and through facilitating other means of transport (public transit, walking, bicycling, etc.). No matter how much capacity a road or highway has, it will eventually get filled up due to what is known as "induced demand", so in the long run simply supplying more capacity will not solve traffic problems. Demand for time on the road has to be reduced through other means.    Embed Quote
