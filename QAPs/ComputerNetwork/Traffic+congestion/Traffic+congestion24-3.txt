★How important are new ride-share services like Lyft Line and UberPool for the ultimate goal of reducing traffic and traffic congestion (August 2014)?
I find the idea of those services quite good. Although to have a significant impact on traffic, they should get a critical mass of active users, let's say, 10% of citizens of any taken city.    Embed Quote
