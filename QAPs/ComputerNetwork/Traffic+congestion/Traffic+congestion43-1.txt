★In my daily conveyance to work, I come across a railway gate where motorists coming from both ends don't follow lane discipline causing traffic congestion despite the arrangement of divider railings to an extent of road. How can this be controlled?
These people will not listen. Bring one of your friend, with you tell him to stand on the road and just manually stop them. My cousin and I have done it many times, when the normal red light does not function. People create a havoc because of their idiotic mindset and low IQ acts. People of these type exist throughout the country, and there is only one way, stop them by standing out. I have suffered from the same problem on a road with divider. Manually control the traffic, when people misbehave. Maybe some more people will help you do this. Try to bring your friend. Always KEEP BLOWING HORN AND DON'T WAIT FOR ANYONE, WHEN THE RAIL CROSSING OPENS. PEOPLE HERE WILL DISOBEY TRAFFIC RULES, AND DO MORE STUPID ACTS. IF YOU WANT TO CROSS, STAY IN YOUR LANE BLOW HORN AND DON'T WAIT. Thanks for asking Todd.    Embed Quote
