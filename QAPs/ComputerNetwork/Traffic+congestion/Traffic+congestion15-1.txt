★How's the traffic congestion condition lately in Sao Paulo?It was voted in the world's worst traffic back in 2010. Is it getting better or worse since then? http://www.foreignpolicy.com/art...
Definitely getting worse. You are basically unable to drive during rush hour in the morning and evening, and rush hour can be about a 2-3 hour period depending on the day and time of year. For the World Cup and Olympics coming up, it's incredibly unclear to me how the city will function — what with all the extra people and presumably all the extra taxis they'll have to put out, given that public transit is generally unusable for tourists; hard to imagine how else they'll move tourists around other than by adding more cabs. I imagine that for these events, the government will issue rules whereby a certain percentage of cars can't circulate on each given day.    Embed Quote
