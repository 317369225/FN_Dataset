★What are the best examples of the law of unintended consequences in action?These could be from any arena -- politics, business, economics, science, startups, etc. -- but should be actual, real-life examples, not hypotheticals.  See Unintended consequences if this is not a familiar concept already.

When the law passed liquor stores immediately responded with this: The two-pack. Priced more competitively than a single, so vagrants can get twice as drunk --  for less!    Embed Quote
