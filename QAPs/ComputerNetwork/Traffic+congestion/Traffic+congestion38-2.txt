★What extent do you agree or disagree? The best way for the government to solve the traffic congestion problems in cities is to provide free transport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
This proposal makes no sense since even if there was free transport, there can still be traffic congestion from the public transit vehicles themselves. Have you ever seen a line of buses stuck in their own traffic jam? Guess what? It happens every day at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York.    Embed Quote
