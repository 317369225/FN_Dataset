★Why does Silicon Valley's Hwy 101 always have traffic congestion in both directions at Hwy 92?
The congestion happens, of course, because of the heavy intersection. However it happens in both directions (when one would expect a uni-directional rush hour) because of the homes/jobs distribution.  The Bay Area is peculiar among big American metros in that there is less of a traditional city business center. For example, San Jose is the only city in the top 20 (by population) that has fewer people during the day than at night. People leave San Jose to go to work (in Santa Clara, Mountain View, Palo Alto, SF.) San Francisco is a bit more traditional - it has a much stronger business core, and the East Bay population commutes into the city - but still has similar characteristics to San Jose along 101 as people commute to reach those same employers down the peninsula. It's likely also a function of demographics. The hip kids live in the city, the older people with some cash live down the peninsula. Companies need both types and companies are located in both places. The result is a bi-directional commute. The current boom cycle has exacerbated that phenomenon.    Embed Quote
