★Is it right time to make strict rules to minimize vehicles in India to reduce traffic congestion?
Increase car rates by double or triple and increase public transportation like bus. I see so many people driving Sedan and in the whole big car, they are the only ones sitting. Imagine 1000 cars like this in a day contributes to so much of traffic. In the same space, a bus can go and it will carry 50+ people. Also, there should be a rule that you can't drive the car if you are the only one sitting in it. That would encourage car pooling. It seems very strict but these kinds of steps are needed if you want to control traffic. Creating more cities and more flyovers are not a solution. It means cutting more trees and creating more havoc to the environment. We have done enough damage already.   It's time to choose necessity over luxury. If not, we will have to pay a huge price.    Embed Quote
