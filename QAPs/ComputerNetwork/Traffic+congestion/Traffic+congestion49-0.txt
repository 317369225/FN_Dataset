★Are the sky rocketing housing prices and increasingly congested traffic and public transport in Singapore a result of poor urban planning?
The increase in housing prices has been attributed to the liberalization of the policy on foreigners buying private properties in 2005. Prior to that, foreigners were not allowed to buy apartments in blocks with fewer than 6 storeys and landed properties. In 2005, these restrictions were relaxed. The housing price index has been rising rapidly since as the proportion of foreigners buying properties in Singapore increased.
