★Do drivers who keep extremely huge gaps between their car and the car in front of them in heavy, very slow stop-and-go traffic cause the congested traffic to be worse?
Providing space also allows other drivers to merge more freely. On top of improving internal reorganization of traffic  flow between lanes, this dramatically smooths the flow of new cars onto the highway. The most persistent, forms-every-day type of traffic jam occurs where new traffic merges onto the highway and multiple lanes must slow down to negotiate merging. Providing more space between cars raises the density threshold at which new vehicles can merge in without interrupting traffic flow. Do I even need to mention accident reduction? Large following distance is extremely highly correlated with reduced accident rates. A highway fatality can shut down the entire viaduct for hours.    Embed Quote
