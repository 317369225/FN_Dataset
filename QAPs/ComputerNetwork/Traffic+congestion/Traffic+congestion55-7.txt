★What types of people choose to live in Palo Alto over San Francisco?
Some people just don't like cities. Personally, I don't understand why anyone would ever choose to visit San Francisco a second time, much less live there. Aside from special events, there's very little worthwhile in the city that can't be found in the south bay.    Embed Quote
