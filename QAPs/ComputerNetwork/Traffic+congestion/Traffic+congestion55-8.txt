★What types of people choose to live in Palo Alto over San Francisco?
People that want a yard. We have two small fuzzy dogs that would be miserable any place we can afford in the city. Also, I refuse to commute more than 10 minutes - quality of life thing. Preferably 10 minutes by bicycle, but by car is ok.  I could spend an hour commuting in Atlanta, I came to the Bay Area for a more balanced life than that.    Embed Quote
