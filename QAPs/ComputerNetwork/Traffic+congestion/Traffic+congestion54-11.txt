★Is it right time to make strict rules to minimize vehicles in India to reduce traffic congestion?
Traffic chaos can not be controlled only by strict rules. It will require measure to control the city population as well as smart long term  planning. 1. Government should move a lot of non core.businesses out of the metro cities 2. New businesses should be only approved on need basis with strict code and public opinion 3. As an incentive government should  approve tax sops for businesses moving out of metro cities 4. Office timings should be changed such that some office should open by 8 am some by 12 pm and some by 3 pm. 5. Some big employers like IT companies should be moved away from cities. 6. Wherever possible water transport routes should be explored. 7. Single occupancy cars should be banned for social cause. 8. Builders should not be allowed to build tall residential building since it puts lot of pressure on utilities like water and public transport. This will disincentive people to live in cities. 9. Better career opportunities should be made available in small cities. 10. Slums make a big part of population hence all slums should be rehabilitated to make way for only roads, junctions, flyovers etc.    Embed Quote
