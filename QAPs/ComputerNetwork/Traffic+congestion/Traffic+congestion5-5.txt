★Is it right time to make strict rules to minimize vehicles in India to reduce traffic congestion?
I would say NO for this question, the reason being: We don't have the sufficient number of officers to enforce this ruling ( for example, take the helmet rule) and we have no alternative to provide for the commuters. In London, They levy a congestion charge for vehicles in the core city area but it is provided with a very efficient network of public transport. To reduce the traffic burden the few alternatives I can come up is the Metro rail or Light rail transportation systems along with feeder bus network or the BRTS.    Embed Quote
