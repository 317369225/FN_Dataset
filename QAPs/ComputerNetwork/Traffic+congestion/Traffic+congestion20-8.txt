★Aerospace and Aeronautical Engineering: Why don't we have vertical take off (VTOL) pods to reduce traffic congestion?I went to the Hiller Aviation museum and saw these vertical take-off pods that were about 4 ft in diameter and were prototyped in the 1950s. Why aren't these more widely commercialized today?
Things like these, including jetpacks, are waiting for the next Elon Musk (or the current one) to tackle them. Sure, one can list all the practical problems with them, like safety, maneuverability, air traffic control issues etc. but, they are not insurmountable with a strong directed effort from a dedicated team of engineers.    Embed Quote
