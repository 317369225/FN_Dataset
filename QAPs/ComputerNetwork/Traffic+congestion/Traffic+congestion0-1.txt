★Will driver-less cars reduce traffic congestion?
Potentially, yes, especially if they're linked together using V2V (vehicle to vehicle) communications. Linked, autonomous vehicles could create more efficient use of the road space by working together to move more efficiently, reducing the "waves" that appear in traffic as a result of driver reaction times and making the use of intersections smoother. Of course, this requires *all* cars on the system to be driverless, otherwise it will likely just cause more accidents as manual cars not plugged into the hive mind aren't able to respond in the same way.    Embed Quote
