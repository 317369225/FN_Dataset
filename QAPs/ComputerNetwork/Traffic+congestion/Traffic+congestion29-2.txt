★How early in the morning should I start driving on the road to Hana in order to avoid traffic congestion?
That really depends on your route. Use Google Maps to search the route at certain times of the day to see how much it deviates from "normal" time. The time as of the answering of this question is 10pm, so there is negligible deviation: The best time to travel would probably be between when the sun has risen and when other people starts waking up at hitting the road, which from empirical experience is 6:30am. Besides Google Maps, Waze is a really good map tool. You can actually pick the time you want to travel and see the differences in time and route options (which are limited in Hawaii). Also available for mobile devices.    Embed Quote
