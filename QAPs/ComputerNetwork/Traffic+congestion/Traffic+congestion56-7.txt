★What are the best examples of the law of unintended consequences in action?These could be from any arena -- politics, business, economics, science, startups, etc. -- but should be actual, real-life examples, not hypotheticals.  See Unintended consequences if this is not a familiar concept already.
Way back in 1921, american expat Elizabeth Lee, in her role as principal of the private Fukuoka School for Girls, decided that her students should wear a uniform. However, she also wanted to make a statement. Thus, on one hand, she was looking for a design that would look neat and tidy... but on the other hand she also wanted to emphasize her vision that women should take a more proactive role in Japanese society. Because of this, she opted for a female clothing style that was fairly popular in the West at the time - but which also signaled a somewhat masculine, self-confident "can-do" and "go-getter" attitude. Namely, the sailor-style dress: ​1920s SEARS Winter Catalogue Little did she know that, in due time, her decision would not only define the look of female school uniforms across Japan... ​ ...but that this dressing style would also become so completely synonymous with "school girl", that it would ultimately re-enter Japanese popular culture in strange and unexpected ways: ​Sailor Moon (Unfortunately also in a number of other, less benign ways...with a few of them carrying connotations that were decidedly not what Mrs. Lee had originally had in mind.)    Embed Quote
