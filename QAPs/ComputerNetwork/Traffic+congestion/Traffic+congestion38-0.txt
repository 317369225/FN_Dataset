★What extent do you agree or disagree? The best way for the government to solve the traffic congestion problems in cities is to provide free transport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
I strongly disagree. Free public transport is not the solution. Beijing has super cheap public transport. The subway has a fixed price of 2 CNY (0.33 USD) wherever you get on and wherever you take off. I think this is pretty close to free. But it's insanely congested by commuters in peak hours. Even if it runs 24-7, it only increases the financial burden. No commuter would get up 2 AM in the morning for work.    Embed Quote
