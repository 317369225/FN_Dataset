★I want to simulate traffic congestion in vehicular ad hoc networks with SUMO, OMNetpp, and Veins. I have some ideas: simulate an accident or limit speed in specific areas in the road. Can you validate these ideas and give me more ideas how I can do this?
maybe it's your responsibility to validate these ideas. SUMO use modified krauss car following model to simulate cars' motions, so there will be no collision on same lane except that some cars may collide when they exit a same intersection because their speed difference. You can modify SUMO's car following model to the model you want. And speed limit for a lane is very easy to set in SUMO. I didn't use OMNetpp yet so I can't provide any information about that.    Embed Quote
