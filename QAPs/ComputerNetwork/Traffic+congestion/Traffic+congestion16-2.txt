★What's the quickest way to solve a city's traffic congestion?
Wait until after the evening rush hour. The people will go home and the traffic will drop. That being said, making communities friendlier to pedestrians and non-auto transportation, as Daniel Appel points out, is a common approach to the traffic question. In olden days (i.e., the 1950s), it was common to build limited-access highways in congested cities, but those highways also got congested. That being said, if someone were to build a spread-out suburb, of low enough density and with big enough roads, they might be able to avoid excessive congestion. However, those places are not congested to begin with, so they cannot be viewed as a solution to existing congestion.    Embed Quote
