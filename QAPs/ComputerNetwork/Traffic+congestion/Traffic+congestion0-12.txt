★Will driver-less cars reduce traffic congestion?
Yes, for the reasons outlined in Matt's and other responses. However, in the short term, we'd see some noticeable improvement if more people just used adaptive cruise control. That's because it does a better job of slowing down gracefully when the car in front slows down. When the distance between cars is already tight, most people over-brake, so each successive car gets slower and slower, until cars start to stop. Adaptive cruise control doesn't over-brake, so you get less of that concertina effect.    Embed Quote
