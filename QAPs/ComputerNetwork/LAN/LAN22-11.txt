★Does it make sense to wire my house for a LAN given how fast wireless has become?We're doing renovations on our house and are going to redo the electricity and we thought about pulling Ethernet cables (or something fatter like Optical Fiber), but does it make sense to do this at all given that wireless is getting faster and faster?
Yes, if you have to open up your walls anyway, you may as well put in some cabling. Simple reasoning is that even though wireless is getting faster and faster bandwidth wise, it still holds no competition as far as latency. A typical wired LAN connection has <1ms ping time. Depending on distance and interference Wifi can have greater than 10ms. Also you will never see paper bandwidth with a Wifi connection, as interference comes into play. You can expect about one third of rated speed from wireless technologies. This latency may not come into play if you're only browsing the web and watching videos. But if you're a gamer, wired makes all of the difference. There are plenty of guides, Youtube videos, etc. that will show you the ropes if you want to DIY your ethernet runs. One video I like to reference is If you're uncomfortable DIYing it you can have the electricians run the smurf tubing and boxes, then have a computer/network person do the actual runs and terminations.    Embed Quote
