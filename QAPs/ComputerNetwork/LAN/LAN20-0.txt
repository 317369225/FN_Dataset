★Is it possible to FireSheep in a non wireless (ie physical, cable based) LAN?I very well know that FireSheep can be used to sniff packets and info from unsecured wireless network. But can it be used over a physical Local Area Network ?
Yes, so long as the HTTP traffic comes across the interface it will work fine. The sniffer code just uses libpcap on an ethernet device, exactly like the command-line tool tcpdump. On a switched network you would need to ARP-poison the network to direct traffic to you first, or otherwise force clients to direct their traffic to you. On a hub based network, it would be very similar to operating on an open wifi network, just configure the interface for promiscuous mode and you would then see traffic from other hosts on the hub.    Embed Quote
