★How does Dropbox LAN Sync work and protect users' privacy when they enable this over a shared LAN?
Disclaimer: I don't work for Dropbox. However the provided link gives enough details to hazard an educated guess. When a client connects to Dropbox servers, it passes along additional network information like public and private IP addresses. When additional clients connect from the same public IP address, Dropbox tells them that there might be other clients on the private network and sends the private IP addresses list. The client then probes computers off that list, and once a computer is found there is an authentication handshake to confirm it's the same account. Once authorized, LAN sync is enabled.    Embed Quote
