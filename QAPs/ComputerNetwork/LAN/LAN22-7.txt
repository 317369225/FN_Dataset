★Does it make sense to wire my house for a LAN given how fast wireless has become?We're doing renovations on our house and are going to redo the electricity and we thought about pulling Ethernet cables (or something fatter like Optical Fiber), but does it make sense to do this at all given that wireless is getting faster and faster?
Absolutely yes run as much wiring as you can, at least one outlet per room. I used Cat5e (Cat 6 preferred, but 5e does the job, make sure they don't kink the cable) for home runs back to a GigE switch. WiFi, even with MIMO antennae, still does not get consistent 100Mbps bandwidth from certain rooms in my house back to my networked drives. Today's cheap Netgear NAS boxes can produce read output of well over 200Mbps. So getting a 1000Mbps (GigE) is a cheap investment with great ROI.    Embed Quote
