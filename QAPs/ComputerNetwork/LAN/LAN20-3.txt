★Is it possible to FireSheep in a non wireless (ie physical, cable based) LAN?I very well know that FireSheep can be used to sniff packets and info from unsecured wireless network. But can it be used over a physical Local Area Network ?
There was a time (a decade ago or more) when Ethernet was used primarily with a device called a "hub". This device essentially allowed all frames to be sniffed from any port. Hubs have since been replaced by switches such that the Ethernet frames are only placed on the appropriate port. I doubt if you will find an infrastructure anywhere these days which uses hubs, but if you do, then this sniffing attack should work.    Embed Quote
