★What is the LAN speed at IIIT Hyderabad?
may i ask why do you want to know? -scenario 1: you are deciding your future college based on LAN speed ....  I know this is a very important factor, but also look at other factors like how many trees the campus has ? how many stray dogs in the campus ? do any of the faculty members have a maruti 800 car? -scenario 2: you're just an inquisitive soul, thinking day and night about such burning questions of the cosmos. in that case, i don't know.    Embed Quote
