★How do LANs work at the IITs?Expect detailed working regarding hubs, sharing, etc
(IITB) The LAN works just like the LAN works. Nothing special about it LAN works the same way everywhere, more or less. If you're asking about the details of what's on the network and how it's isolated, well: The subnetwork is a class A (10.0.0.1/8) subnet There are fiber connections to the hostels. The main backbone will be upgraded soon as well, and speeds will drastically increase. Internal transfer speeds are wicked fast, and outside downloads are pretty fast too, depending on when you try. The network is behind a squid proxy -- both a normal one and a captive portal'd transparent one, you can choose which you want to go through. This is the source of much annoyance as not all software plays well with authenticated proxies. With the introduction of the transparent proxy, stuff works better, though. The only outside ports allowed are 80 (HTTP via proxy), 443 (HTTPS, via an HTTP CONNECT if you use the proxy), and 22 (SSH, no proxy). Internally, all ports are allowed. The computer center has a centralized way of turning it off for certain switches (eg in the hostels). This is how the much-dreaded LAN ban is (was) implemented at nights. There are DC++ hubs scattered throughout the institute (most have been set up by students, afaict). One can connect to a hub and share files, the hub keeps track of who has what files and P2P connections are made when someone wants to download a file, usually downloading from multiple sharers.    Embed Quote
