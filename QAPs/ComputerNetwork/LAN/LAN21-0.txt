★Can I connect to a LAN and Wireless Network at the same time?My company has a secured network and an unsecured wireless network. The unsecured network is for people who want to stream music. Most people use a separate device, but I don't own one and have no desire to buy one. I'd like to be able to be connected to both networks simultaneously. How would I do that?
If you're talking about two wireless networks, then no, you can't do this unless you add a second wireless card so you'll have two physical radios that can operate simultaneously.  (There are two-radio chips/cards designed for use in access points, but I've never heard of one being built into a general-use computer.)  Even then, or with one wired connection, it can be difficult to (a) persuade the OS to enable both simultaneously and (b) get the routing right so that connections happen the way you want.  What's often easier is to connect to the unsecured network, then connect to your corporate VPN (assuming you have one) through that.  The inefficiency of going through an extra hop or two should be minimal, and in the process most VPN software will do a pretty decent job of setting up the routes properly for you.  You can do something similar with ssh tunnels as well (it's how I connect to my office from anywhere else) but that's a bit more complicated.    Embed Quote
