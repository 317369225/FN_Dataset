★How to share an Internet Connection with a Wireless Hotspot and LAN at the same time?My computer is connected to the internet using a USB Modem. That internet connection is then shared with a LAN so that other computers can access internet. My computer has a wireless card so I tested and it can be turned into hotspot. The problem is that how do I allow USB Modem's internet connection to be shared with both LAN and Wireless Hotspot at the same time.
