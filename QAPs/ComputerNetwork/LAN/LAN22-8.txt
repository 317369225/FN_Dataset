★Does it make sense to wire my house for a LAN given how fast wireless has become?We're doing renovations on our house and are going to redo the electricity and we thought about pulling Ethernet cables (or something fatter like Optical Fiber), but does it make sense to do this at all given that wireless is getting faster and faster?
I would also recommend at least one CAT6 drop per room.  While you're at it though, run two right next to each other.  You never know if some guy doing sheet rock will put a screw through something.  Finally, if you're building new, run a conduit from the basement to the attic.  It's not quite as good a solution as the surf tube that Tom Cook mentioned, but it's a lot less effort initially. As it is, CAT5 can handle gig-e over shorter distances.  Similarly, CAT6 could probably handle 10gig and it's going to be a long, long time before that's a limitation for any practical application.    Embed Quote
