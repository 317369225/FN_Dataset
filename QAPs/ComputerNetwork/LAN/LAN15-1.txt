★What is consider decent latency / RTT for WAN / LAN?For instance, is 8ms across 40 miles horrible? =)
The biggest factors that affects latency are link speed and utilization and distance. Without knowing this its not possible to determine decent parameters. Generally latency is due to: link congestion, distance and high CPU utilization of endpoints . Keep in mind that latency that you measure by ping is not true latency, as it traverses the OS IP stack and such. This is why you would see 1 msec even between directly connected hosts. To measure true latency network testing rigs like Ixia or SmartBits are used. To your specific example: 8 ms is fairly typical for a 40mile distance in a metro location.    Embed Quote
