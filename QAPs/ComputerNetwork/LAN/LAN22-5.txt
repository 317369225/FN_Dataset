★Does it make sense to wire my house for a LAN given how fast wireless has become?We're doing renovations on our house and are going to redo the electricity and we thought about pulling Ethernet cables (or something fatter like Optical Fiber), but does it make sense to do this at all given that wireless is getting faster and faster?
You'll have to wire up your WIFI access points somehow... so you need LAN cabling anyway (repeaters will eat up some bandwidth). Also, if you put in some decent Cat7-cabling and a good switch, your LAN-speed can be 1GB, that's still faster than Wifi    Embed Quote
