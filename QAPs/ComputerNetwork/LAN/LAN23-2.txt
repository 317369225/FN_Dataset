★Is "Ni Hao, Kai-Lan" a good show to learn Chinese?
It's pretty much at the same level as Dora the Explorer is for learning Spanish. Everything introduced is going to be extremely basic, it is mostly in English, and the 'interaction' will feel very silly if you're more than 7 or 8 years old (every episode features between 10-11 minutes of 'audience interaction', e.g. Kai-Lan asks the viewers to help her wake up the sun in the morning by reaching out and tickling the TV screen). Don't lose sight of the fact that this show was targeted at preschoolers, and the primary goals are introducing children to a different cultural perspective and helping them learn about their feelings. It's not meant to be a complete course in Chinese. If you're looking for something to introduce your small child (i.e. between 3-6 years old) to Chinese, then Ni Hao Kai-Lan is probably your best option in English. If you are looking for something for an older child or for yourself, look elsewhere.    Embed Quote
