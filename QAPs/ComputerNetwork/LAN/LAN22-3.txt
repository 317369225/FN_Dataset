★Does it make sense to wire my house for a LAN given how fast wireless has become?We're doing renovations on our house and are going to redo the electricity and we thought about pulling Ethernet cables (or something fatter like Optical Fiber), but does it make sense to do this at all given that wireless is getting faster and faster?
You'll see lots of (contrary) advice on this topic and that's not because anyone here is saying anything incorrect.  The reality is that it depends.  Here is the basic flow I'd use to answer your question. 1)  Do you need now or think you'll need in ~5 years the extra speed and/or security that a wired connection delivers in your present home.  If speed is a driving factor, how fast do you need? 2)  Do you have the ability to run & terminate Cat5e/6/7 cabling if not do you have a friend that would help you for free (or a nominal cost like dinner/beer/etc)? 3)  Do you have existing cabling that could be used instead?  (powerline via HomePlug, MoCA over existing coax, etc)  Does the existing cabling support the speed identified in #1? 4)  How many ports do you see yourself needing? 5)  What is the longest run from a wiring perspective and keep in mind that you need to keep your longest run below 100 meters over copper so if they need to be longer you have to make a big jump to MM fiber.    Embed Quote
