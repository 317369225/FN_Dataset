★Does it make sense to wire my house for a LAN given how fast wireless has become?We're doing renovations on our house and are going to redo the electricity and we thought about pulling Ethernet cables (or something fatter like Optical Fiber), but does it make sense to do this at all given that wireless is getting faster and faster?
Your conduit that distributes 110v@60HZ is really more than enough to use as a fallback for hardline data transfer in case the .11 goes nips-up. HPN is very inexpensive, performs decently, and can be deployed with security. Utilizing wired infrastructure for 2 purposes instead of just one, instead of stringing Cat5/6 and patch panels everywhere is really a no brainier if you ask me.    Embed Quote
