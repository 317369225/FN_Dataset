★How to share an Internet Connection with a Wireless Hotspot and LAN at the same time?My computer is connected to the internet using a USB Modem. That internet connection is then shared with a LAN so that other computers can access internet. My computer has a wireless card so I tested and it can be turned into hotspot. The problem is that how do I allow USB Modem's internet connection to be shared with both LAN and Wireless Hotspot at the same time.
Many wireless routers have USB ports and ethernet switches built in. I would find one supported by your wireless Internet provider, plug your wireless air card into the USB port on the router, and plug your LAN into one of the ethernet ports.    Embed Quote
