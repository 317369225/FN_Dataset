★Is "Ni Hao, Kai-Lan" a good show to learn Chinese?
Haha, I didn't watch this show, but I have some suggestions for you to learn Chinese. Whatever you learn, you have to learn how to learn it by yourself. In my primary school, everyone has to learn Pinyin, some kind of a phonetic alphabet. Then you can learn how to pronounce Chinese. For example,"Ni hao"is the Pinyin for the phrase "你好". And then you have to learn word, as you know Pinyin, you can learn words in dictionary by yourself.    Embed Quote
