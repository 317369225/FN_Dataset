★How do I make a chat messenger (that uses LAN or Google API)?I am a third year civil engineering student with interest in Computer Science.I have my placements next month and am preparing for an IT job. I am interested in making a chat messenger over LAN or Google API. I have decent knowledge of C++,C and data structures and algorithms.What all subjects are prerequisite for making that app a reality.
If you want to use your Chat Messenger on your local network then its easy to make by using Sockets. For that you have to first know about the Sockets, In languages like C# and Java there is a dedicated class for Sockets. The first thing you have to create is a Server socket and a client socket. You can get a lot of help and details regarding Server and Client sockets on CodeProject and MSDN. On a Local network if you know the IP Address of your freind then you can easily Install the application on two different PC's and start chatting. If you want to create a Messenger to be used over internet, then it will be a little tedious as you have to have a Central Server who will serve to all the users who want to chat with each other. In such case your application will by default communicate with the Central server and the server will act as a middle layer between the two PC's.    Embed Quote
