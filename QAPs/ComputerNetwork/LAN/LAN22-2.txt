★Does it make sense to wire my house for a LAN given how fast wireless has become?We're doing renovations on our house and are going to redo the electricity and we thought about pulling Ethernet cables (or something fatter like Optical Fiber), but does it make sense to do this at all given that wireless is getting faster and faster?
Absolutely.  I don't consider wireless to be fast.  Not nearly as fast as wired anyways.  If you only browse the web, but stream no audio/video or download no files you may not think the difference is that great.  But honestly wireless has a long way to go before it is fast enough for me to consider abandoning my wires.    Embed Quote
