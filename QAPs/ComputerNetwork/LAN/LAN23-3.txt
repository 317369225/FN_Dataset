★Is "Ni Hao, Kai-Lan" a good show to learn Chinese?
I don't think so. There's not enough Mandarin language used in the show, repetition or explanation. The show is 95% English with a sprinkle of Mandarin. This should be reversed to really teach the language. As it is it only gets kids mildly familiar with the sound of the language and the culture, both good things, but in the end it's just a show first, a learning tool second. That said I've only seen the show a few times around my neices and nephews. If they're learning Chinese through other means this could be a fun way to reinforce it. But I couldn't see anyone getting far with the show by itself. It's kind of like learning Spanish by watching the Fast and Furious movies (except for Tokyo Drift of course).    Embed Quote
