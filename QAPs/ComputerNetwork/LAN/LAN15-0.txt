★What is consider decent latency / RTT for WAN / LAN?For instance, is 8ms across 40 miles horrible? =)
The general question is hard to answer since it depends on the application and on the technology being used. In your specific example, what is the topology?  8ms may be perfectly reasonable if there are several devices switching or routing the traffic, especially if they are lower-end or consumer grade devices.  If you are measuring between two high-end routers across a fiber link, the 8ms would indicate a problem.  If, however, you are measuring from a laptop across a WiFi to a home router then through a cable modem, across the internet, and through a similar set of technologies at the other end, then 8ms would be remarkable. Is 40 miles the actual wireline distance or the line-of-sight distance?  It's not unusual to bounce around through a couple different cities just to get to your neighbor if you are using different service providers.    Embed Quote
