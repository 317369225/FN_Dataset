★Does it make sense to wire my house for a LAN given how fast wireless has become?We're doing renovations on our house and are going to redo the electricity and we thought about pulling Ethernet cables (or something fatter like Optical Fiber), but does it make sense to do this at all given that wireless is getting faster and faster?
I like Tom Cook's answer.  My only addition is that wireless always has the issue of interference and power dissipation to deal with that wired connections do not.  A 150' wired connection (the distance limit, as I remember) is nearly always better than the "equivalent" 150' wireless connection.   You can verify this yourself with statistics that your network equipment probably already tabulates.   You'll want to follow the EIA/TIA 568 standards to do it properly (bend radius, power-line proximity, distance -- all these are important). Most people probably don't realize it, but their wireless connections are probably re-sending twice as many or more packets than their wired connections.  It's counter-intuitive, but just because they have the same speed doesn't mean it's just as fast.    Embed Quote
