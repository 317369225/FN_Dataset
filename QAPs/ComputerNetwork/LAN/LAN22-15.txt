★Does it make sense to wire my house for a LAN given how fast wireless has become?We're doing renovations on our house and are going to redo the electricity and we thought about pulling Ethernet cables (or something fatter like Optical Fiber), but does it make sense to do this at all given that wireless is getting faster and faster?
Why not buy a router and modem that can handle TV, computer and streaming video. That would cost considerable less than pulling ether net wire.    Embed Quote
