★Can I connect to a LAN and Wireless Network at the same time?My company has a secured network and an unsecured wireless network. The unsecured network is for people who want to stream music. Most people use a separate device, but I don't own one and have no desire to buy one. I'd like to be able to be connected to both networks simultaneously. How would I do that?
Unfortunately that is not possible. You can be connected to only "one" Internet and not two. Even if you have a Wired (Ethernet) connection plugged in and a Wifi Connection on, the OS would pretty much go with what has a higher preference to connect. In addition to this, some advance OS setups may even look at the Network Metrics, to see which network NIC gets preference. But all in all, on your computer alone, without any software modification (like installing a WAN Load-Balancer) you can only have one internet gateway for your traffic at any point in time. If you however had a WAN Load Balancer, you can connect multiple WAN gateways (2 or more) and assign setups as to which traffic flows through which WAN, for example, you could setup FTP to go through WAN port # 2, and HTTP/HTTPS through WAN Port # 1, and Mail and everything else through WAN Port # 3 and 4. This would be the only way you can essentially have multiple WANs working for you.    Embed Quote
