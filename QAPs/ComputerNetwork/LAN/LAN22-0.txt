★Does it make sense to wire my house for a LAN given how fast wireless has become?We're doing renovations on our house and are going to redo the electricity and we thought about pulling Ethernet cables (or something fatter like Optical Fiber), but does it make sense to do this at all given that wireless is getting faster and faster?
Short answer: yes, you should run ethernet through your home. It gives you more options in the future and will increase the resale value of the home. As Juergen says, you'll have to plug in the wireless base stations somewhere, and running the backhaul over ethernet will offer better performance than wireless repeating. Long answer: You should consider how technology changes, and what a "modern house" might want in 10-20 years. Today Cat6 is the baseline for delivering ethernet up to 1Gbps, but in the future 10Gbps ethernet might be cheap and you'll need better cable or even wiring systems that today would seem exotic, like fiber optics. Instead of running the bare wire through the walls, use "smurf tube", terminating at the wall boxes. You'll run the tube as though it were regular cable, then run the cable you want through the tube. It looks like this: In 20 years when Cat6 is old and busted, smurf tube will greatly decrease the complexity of upgrading to a new wiring standard. You basically pull the old ethernet out of the tube, fish the new cable through, and terminate it at the wall plates and your wiring closet. This is compared to opening walls/crawling through attics/basements/etc.    Embed Quote
