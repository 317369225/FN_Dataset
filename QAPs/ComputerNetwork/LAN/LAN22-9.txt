★Does it make sense to wire my house for a LAN given how fast wireless has become?We're doing renovations on our house and are going to redo the electricity and we thought about pulling Ethernet cables (or something fatter like Optical Fiber), but does it make sense to do this at all given that wireless is getting faster and faster?
Another consideration for running Cat6 is beyond just for a LAN.  These days, you can do things like run HDMI over Ethernet, so having the flexibility to throw say one cable/satellite box in a central location and distribute it all over the house with cheap cable is a very attractive thing.    Embed Quote
