★What are the various methods to develop voice chat using LAN?
There are 2 major competitor protocols in VoIP, Session Initiation Protocol H.323There are open source implementations available for both protocols. I have a preliminary knowledge of both of them. H.323 is more like a protocol made by telephony guys, so one is more likely to encounter words which are more easier to understand for a 'telephone guy'. While SIP on the other hand is more of a framework developed by the Internet guys. They are more comfortable to a person who is accustomed to the networking theories. SIP is more popular these days and widely used in the industry. Some popular libraries in various languages are -- Sofia-SIP Library; developed at Nokia for GNU/Linux. the Javascript SIP library; The GNU oSIP library and The eXtended osip library - Summary and it's open source implementation Linphone, open-source voip software. Open Source Voice, Video and Fax supports both SIP and H.323. http://www.pjsip.org/ in C. https://code.google.com/p/sipml5/ by Duboungo Telecom runs entirely on HTML5. P.S. Leaning VoIP is a steep learning curve, and might require huge patience on the developers' part. Good luck with your development.    Embed Quote
