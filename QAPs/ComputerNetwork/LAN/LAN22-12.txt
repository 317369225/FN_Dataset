★Does it make sense to wire my house for a LAN given how fast wireless has become?We're doing renovations on our house and are going to redo the electricity and we thought about pulling Ethernet cables (or something fatter like Optical Fiber), but does it make sense to do this at all given that wireless is getting faster and faster?
Running ethernet is overkill these days for residential use. I was having all sorts of problems with wifi and picked up an ethernet over powerline kit for about $100. Fantastic stuff, and it works with the otherwise useless ungrounded outlets that clutter my old rental house.    Embed Quote
