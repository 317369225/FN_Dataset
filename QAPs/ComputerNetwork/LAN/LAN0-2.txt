★What is the LAN speed at IIIT Hyderabad?
Decent enough. LAN transfers (which people use a lot for big file transfers - Linux distro images, TexLive (the full thing is 2.5GB!!!) ) can go upto 11MB/s (i.e. 100 Mbps). Internet access speed is highly variable, because of caching at the proxy level. Simply put, if a lot of people access a big file, such as a youtube song, it is automatically stored on campus servers, from where it can be served faster. It varies from 200 KB/s (1.6 Mbps) to 2 MB/s (16 Mbps), depending on the file being accessed and the time of the day (traffic is much higher between 6pm to 12pm, since no one has classes and everybody is awake at that time). Of course, the actual bandwidth available is much higher, and bandwidth availability to users is throttled to ensure decent experience for everybody. And trust me, it's 10x better than the offices of atleast one MNC I know of (one of the largest players in their field). Hope that quells your curiosity, but I also hope that's not a factor in your college selection.    Embed Quote
