★Does it make sense to wire my house for a LAN given how fast wireless has become?We're doing renovations on our house and are going to redo the electricity and we thought about pulling Ethernet cables (or something fatter like Optical Fiber), but does it make sense to do this at all given that wireless is getting faster and faster?
I suppose it also depends on how large your home is and what materials it's built in. I have a large old house with thick stone walls, so I have no choice but to have, as a minimum, cabling to 4 areas of the house just to put in wifi access points. In a newer house with thinner inside walls, wifi may well be fine.    Embed Quote
