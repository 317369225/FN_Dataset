â˜…Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are prohibited by Chinese government. Why does the Chinese government cut off its citizens' channels of communications with the outside world? What is it afraid of?I really don't understand what the Goverment thinks about it. Is it to protect the local Internet Companies? But some media called the Chinese Internet is flourishing. Is it really? Or maybe it is just an illusion?
maybe she didn't fear.i am a chinese,but i can use quora and find some different opinions about china.so just like the case that foreigner banks are also banned in china,it is just not the time to do it.
