★Do techniques such as CDMA, channel coding and general spread-spectrum techniques make it impossible for modern communication systems to be jammed?Aside from blasting power over all frequencies, has there been a case of a malicious party bringing down such a radio comms system using signal jamming?
The direct answer to your first question is NO.   CDMA has roots in military communication.  CDMA improves the chances that communication will go undetected because it spreads energy across a band in a manner that makes it appear to be only background noise.  That makes the jamming strategies more challenging.   CDMA channels use a special code for what is called the "pilot" channel, which is essential for any CDMA communication.  While it is more challenging to jam a single CDMA call, all calls on one channel in one physical area can be "jammed" by messing up the pilot channel.  In fact, if there are too many pilots, most phones will be unable to support a call, so one could just build a beacon or two broadcasting bogus pilots to wreak havoc.
