â˜…Is it OK to use the Twitter direct messages as a direct communication channel instead of email?Let's say I have a web site, with no registration form. The site lets the user to connect (register) using either, his/her Twitter account or his/her Facebook account. Twitter does not provide a way to ask the user for his/her email address (Facebook does), so: Is it OK to send DM to the user via the api? I mean is it a good practice?
It is fine and I use it intensely. It's like SMS, but it doesn't replace email. As I wrote in another answer, you expect a reply faster than by email. It is also "trusted", since the person you are sending the DM to must be following you to receive it. I definitely encourage the usage of DM as a way to quickly send messages to contacts, very effective.
