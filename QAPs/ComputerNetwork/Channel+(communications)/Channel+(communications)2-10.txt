★Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are prohibited by Chinese government. Why does the Chinese government cut off its citizens' channels of communications with the outside world? What is it afraid of?I really don't understand what the Goverment thinks about it. Is it to protect the local Internet Companies? But some media called the Chinese Internet is flourishing. Is it really? Or maybe it is just an illusion?
Er。。。I think it is useless,too. I am a Chinese but I can see the website outside China by VPN like now U0001f602U0001f602. BTW, I am just a high school student. so my English is poor. Please be  patient. ThanksU0001f618
