â˜…Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are prohibited by Chinese government. Why does the Chinese government cut off its citizens' channels of communications with the outside world? What is it afraid of?I really don't understand what the Goverment thinks about it. Is it to protect the local Internet Companies? But some media called the Chinese Internet is flourishing. Is it really? Or maybe it is just an illusion?
Maybe they are afraid of being overturned after people's knowing of those doings done by every communist country in the planet. But we already have known Tiananmen massacre and Falungong or some other bloody events, and most of us aren't gonna to overturn the CCP. So I'm wondering if our dear party could unblock these cool sites for our ordinary people to explore the real amazing "Internet"? lol.
