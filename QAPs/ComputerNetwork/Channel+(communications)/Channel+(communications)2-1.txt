★Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are prohibited by Chinese government. Why does the Chinese government cut off its citizens' channels of communications with the outside world? What is it afraid of?I really don't understand what the Goverment thinks about it. Is it to protect the local Internet Companies? But some media called the Chinese Internet is flourishing. Is it really? Or maybe it is just an illusion?
I am a software engineer of China，I have been seeing how fast the Internet grows and aspect the Chinese in the late 15 years. I first saw a computer in 2002 in my Middle School in town. At that time, the net bar with  less than 10 or more than 100 computers was the major place Chinese surfing the Internet, most were teengers.Parents extremely hate that kind of places, cause some students drop school privately and spend their time day and night playing games.That was the time net addiction seen often in papers. From 2003 to 2008,  it's the net bar growing period. Later it starts to decrease as personal computers in most famalies, especially in the cities, I own my first mobile, smart mobile, NOKIA 6120c in freshman year, 2008,and my own laptop in 2009. In 2012, I first see Iphone and nokia starts to be out of time, I  graduate and starts to do android in a firm. From 2008 to 2012 that was the time Internet starts to be part of our life, Goods purchasing from internet becaming fashion. From 2012 by now,Surfing in Mobile phone is becoming the major path and is the same with most advanced countries now. As for the government's supervision, it's political like most politics, the only aspects to me is Ihave to find google' developing data with agents.
