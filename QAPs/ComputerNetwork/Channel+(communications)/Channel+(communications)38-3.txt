â˜…Is MailChimp a strong alternative to ExactTarget? Is it as robust?
I have used both MailChimp and ExactTarget from the developer perspective. I will agree that MailChimp is suited more towards small business, not enterprise. As for ExactTarget, I am currently actively looking for an alternative as this is a nightmare to integrate with. Just few things I have struggle with: Their REST API is in fact a SOAP API wrapped with REST, which causes a lot of problems when using it. Email queue will stop if it finds an error in the email, so if someone mistyped an email that could stop the whole campaign from being sent.
