â˜…Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are prohibited by Chinese government. Why does the Chinese government cut off its citizens' channels of communications with the outside world? What is it afraid of?I really don't understand what the Goverment thinks about it. Is it to protect the local Internet Companies? But some media called the Chinese Internet is flourishing. Is it really? Or maybe it is just an illusion?
As for the Chinese internet, it is indeed flourishing, at least in the terms the government would understand. It's making huge profits for Alibaba and other giant companies, Taobao has become the most popular place to buy many products, and most young Chinese of my acquaintance spend hours a day online. From the user's standpoint, some of the Chinese internet products actually have advantages over their foreign counterparts. WeChat, for instance, has a very intuitive interface on mobile devices, and it has features such as voice messaging and location sharing that no single American-based service bundles together into one program. By comparison, Facebook is a dinosaur! The Chinese internet also does an amazing thing for the Chinese government, something no other government in history has been able to do: it allows the government to collect information from the people about local corruption, bad government performance, and other problems, without fear that the information will get out of control and lead to a revolution. They can collect information through microblogs and other platforms, but then shut down the discussion when the government thinks it's getting out of control. For the corrupt, authoritarian government of China, that's quite a tool!
