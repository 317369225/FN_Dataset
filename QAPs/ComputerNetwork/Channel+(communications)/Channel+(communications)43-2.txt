★Do international relations (politics) affect academic research in natural sciences?For example, if two countries are at war or in bad relations, can scientists in them still collaborate and do they? Do some scientific journals refuse to publish papers by authors from some countries?
I would say that they do.  For example, when all of this nonsense with Russia and Crimea started going down NASA supposedly stopped working with the Russians.  I'm not sure if they are still on a hiatus but for a little while there was some tension.  That being said NASA and the Russian Space Agency are funded by their respective governments.  I do not think that politics would prevent university researchers from collaborations with other foreign researchers regardless of where the funding comes from unless it got extremely bad.
