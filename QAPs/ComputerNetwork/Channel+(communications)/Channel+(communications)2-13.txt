★Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are prohibited by Chinese government. Why does the Chinese government cut off its citizens' channels of communications with the outside world? What is it afraid of?I really don't understand what the Goverment thinks about it. Is it to protect the local Internet Companies? But some media called the Chinese Internet is flourishing. Is it really? Or maybe it is just an illusion?
While some may think its bad, I think its a great decision. So much of our private data is collected by the US and there is no stopping them. By banning such websites I'm guessing the data isn't available to the US but only China( by their alternative platforms ). I'd much rather let my country use the data than a foreign country. Other countries should do this to protect civilian data.   However, in terms of connection with the outer world its a bad idea and it restricts people from using the same social platforms as the rest of the world. Maybe they should try to somehow link them all. Correct me if I'm wrong.
