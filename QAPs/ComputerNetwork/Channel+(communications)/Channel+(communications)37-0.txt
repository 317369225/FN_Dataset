★Why doesn't Beijing ignore the Dalai Lama?The Dalai Lama poses little threat to the structural integrity of China, yet anytime he meets with a Western leader Beijing throws a temper-tantrum. Instead of giving the Lama credibility as a human rights activist by opposing him and his cause, shouldn't China's leaders ignore him and those he meets with?
Actually, China doesn't throw a temper-tantrum.  They run the standard press release.  As far as whether or not China should just not throw out the standard press release, this would be a bad idea because, if you don't express the fact that X annoys you, people will start to assume that X doesn't annoy you and they press the issue further.  If China doesn't object to the US government meeting with the Dalai Lama, then the next set of meetings will be with higher level officials in the Tibetan exile community. Also, there are some back channel communications between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama and through him to the Tibetan exile community.  If the Chinese government "ignores" the Dalai Lama then they is no communications channel at all with Tibetan exiles and that would be generally a bad thing.
