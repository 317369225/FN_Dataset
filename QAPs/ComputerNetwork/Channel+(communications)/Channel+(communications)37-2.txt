â˜…Why doesn't Beijing ignore the Dalai Lama?The Dalai Lama poses little threat to the structural integrity of China, yet anytime he meets with a Western leader Beijing throws a temper-tantrum. Instead of giving the Lama credibility as a human rights activist by opposing him and his cause, shouldn't China's leaders ignore him and those he meets with?
You ignore them, they say you are silent because you know you are wrong. You criticize them, they become high and continue play with you. You keep silent, they say you are not transparent. You keep speaking, they say you are lying. No mater what you do, your opponents will always find a way to annoy you. Even if Dalai Lama never exists, some other guy would stand out and do the job. This never ends. After all, how could a *developed* *free* USA let a *developing* *communist* China alone? Have an idea about Dalai Lama's successor? Maybe 'master' Li Hongzhi? Let's go and see. Five years later, we may see something in the news like the President of the XXX hosts Mr. YYY today, a Nobel Peace Award winner, who is the peaceful and spiritual leader of ZZZ. Politics is a game and the truth is often the first casualty. And, not everyone cares about the truth, they just need something to play with. To push issues like the the so called Tibetan problem, money is in great need. Suppose you are going to pay the money, you simply expect people to live a better life there or try to guarantee that they can preserve their religion which is different to yours? Why would you use the money from your tax payers to handle others' problems? In the Tibetan case, those peoples live on the other side of the planet. If the world is so harmony in this way that countries all put great effort to help others, I would thank the god, no matter whether he is there or not.
