â˜…Do international relations (politics) affect academic research in natural sciences?For example, if two countries are at war or in bad relations, can scientists in them still collaborate and do they? Do some scientific journals refuse to publish papers by authors from some countries?
There can be several aspects to that: 1) politics affects everyone. For example one project collapsed because Switerland was expelled from Horizon 2020 due to its refusal to accept Croatian workers in its country. There is nothing special to science in that. Politics just affect everyone. 2) The second aspect is when national prejudice are shared by the scientists themselves and by their own will, they contribute to the shit. I would say it is much rarer. There are heated discussions, but to translate that into things like refusal of article is another matter. It did happen in the 19th centiry with French journals refusing german authors and vice versa, but recently, i am not aware. 3) Scientists have their own prejudice, not influenced by politics. There are some groups that have bad reputation and are not accepted in some journals. But this is not done along nationalists lines.
