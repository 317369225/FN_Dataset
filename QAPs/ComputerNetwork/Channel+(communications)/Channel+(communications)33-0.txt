â˜…What is the output of Viterbi decoder? Does it reconstruct signal to be like convolutional codes (if the signal was transmitted over noisy communication channel)? Or will it produce the original data before convolutional encoding is taken?
The viterbi decoder uses the extra bits inserted in the encoding process to retrieve the information bits before the encoding was performed. Here is a tutorial on how it's done http://home.netcom.com/~chip.f/v... There is no need to find the transmitted signal since that is just a tool to send the information bits over the noisy channel.
