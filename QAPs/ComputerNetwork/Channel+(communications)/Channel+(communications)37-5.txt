â˜…Why doesn't Beijing ignore the Dalai Lama?The Dalai Lama poses little threat to the structural integrity of China, yet anytime he meets with a Western leader Beijing throws a temper-tantrum. Instead of giving the Lama credibility as a human rights activist by opposing him and his cause, shouldn't China's leaders ignore him and those he meets with?
The best response would be one that parallels the Dalai Lama, and accurately reflects both the feelings of Beijing, and their views on the whole "Free Tibet" movement. It would need to be appropriate, and, if possible, should embarass those who are trying to embarass China. Given the Dalai Lama's popularity in Hollywood, it would help to have a similarly popular yet annoying figure. The perfect solution is clear: announce that, from now on, every time an American leader meets with the Dalai Lama, Beijing will hold a similar meeting with AIM. Who is AIM? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ame... Basically they are to America what "Free Tibet" is to China. Oh, and that Hollywood friendly spokesperson? Means died a few years back, but surely with some looking, China could find another one.
