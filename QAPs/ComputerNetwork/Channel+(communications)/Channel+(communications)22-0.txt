â˜…What is a description of a formal communication channel within an organization?
A formal communication channel is an 'official' means of disseminating information in the organization hierarchy. In other words, it's any system by which you can communicate with colleagues, superiors or inferiors as part of your authorized duties. Informal channels of communication are everything else. For example, you can learn that you're going to get a promotion if (for instance) you run into your boss' assistant in the cafeteria and s/he mentions it to you. That is hearing the information over an informal channel. You don't actually get the promotion, though, until the information comes over a formal channel: some direct, official notice from the boss him/herself.
