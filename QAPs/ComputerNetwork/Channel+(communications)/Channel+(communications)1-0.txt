â˜…Have you tried customer flow communication, which combines marketing automation, inbound marketing, and multi-channel communication?
The real trick to awesome customer marketing though is understanding the customer journey, and being able to put yourself in their shoes. Figuring out step by step, what information (and means of delivery) would make their customer experience better at each step. Marketing Automation offers some amazing opportunities in terms of customer experience and customer marketing. These are areas which really do need to see a revival in their importance to marketers today. Generally speaking once a company has it's inbound house in order, I work with them on setting up their customer marketing using the marketing automation tools they have. This can be limited to reactive email marketing which guides the lead through the early customer journey, to one that includes drop shipping a box of chocolates and a start up kit as a lumpy mail thanks to a cooperative arrangement with a drop shipping facility. Integrating a human factor and having people call in to high value customers is also an integral part of building out an effective customer marketing experience which can now be semi-automated since the instruction to call be sent out by the system. If you can nail creating an amazing customer journey, you're going to be getting upsells, cross-sells, repeat buys, and great WoM all day long!
