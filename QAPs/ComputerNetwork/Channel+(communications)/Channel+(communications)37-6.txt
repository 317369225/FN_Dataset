★Why doesn't Beijing ignore the Dalai Lama?The Dalai Lama poses little threat to the structural integrity of China, yet anytime he meets with a Western leader Beijing throws a temper-tantrum. Instead of giving the Lama credibility as a human rights activist by opposing him and his cause, shouldn't China's leaders ignore him and those he meets with?
What would you say if Putin or China met with the exiled leader of the former Confederate States of America (hypothetically)?  It was just a friendly visit they said. He represents a group of people that are important. Maybe they would say we meet at University. In the Chinese eyes he represents the leader of separatist group which wants to break up China. He represents a group which would take Tibet out of direct communist party control.
