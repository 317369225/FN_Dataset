★Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are prohibited by Chinese government. Why does the Chinese government cut off its citizens' channels of communications with the outside world? What is it afraid of?I really don't understand what the Goverment thinks about it. Is it to protect the local Internet Companies? But some media called the Chinese Internet is flourishing. Is it really? Or maybe it is just an illusion?
They are willing to communicate with rest of countries.why not?accelebrating economic development and product import and outport in a huge profit.  but in order to keep network security and intellegent date from leaking and in additional prevent a bunch of bad ass rail against Chinese government they have to give in even if they acknowledged what  they did in the past.may be somewhat afraid of politic unstable .that is the only point.
