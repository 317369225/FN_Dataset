â˜…Do techniques such as CDMA, channel coding and general spread-spectrum techniques make it impossible for modern communication systems to be jammed?Aside from blasting power over all frequencies, has there been a case of a malicious party bringing down such a radio comms system using signal jamming?
No. The techniques mentioned may make it more or less difficult to jam. The design goals of these commercial systems are not anti-jam, but bandwidth, number of users, etc. Second question is a yes. One of the early CDMA tests was jammed for days simply by a CDMA cell phone locked into transmit mode and placed up in a tree. This happened prior to the Federal Communications Commission decisions on CDMA. You can look up cell phone and GPS jammers on the World Wide Web (don't buy one); they are pretty small, and can use battery power. Cell phones are one of the ways of controlling Improvised Explosive Devices. These signals get jammed every day in Iraq. Modern communication standards have made casual intercept most costly and difficult, however. Your next door neighbor isn't going to hear your cell phone with their scanner anymore.
