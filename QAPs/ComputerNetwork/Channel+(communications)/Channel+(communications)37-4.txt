â˜…Why doesn't Beijing ignore the Dalai Lama?The Dalai Lama poses little threat to the structural integrity of China, yet anytime he meets with a Western leader Beijing throws a temper-tantrum. Instead of giving the Lama credibility as a human rights activist by opposing him and his cause, shouldn't China's leaders ignore him and those he meets with?
you cannot ignore the Dalai Lama as he is the officially appointed Dalai Lama. Religion plays big in Tibet. I think what Beijing is doing is now waiting in patience for his death and then quickly finds a new one.
