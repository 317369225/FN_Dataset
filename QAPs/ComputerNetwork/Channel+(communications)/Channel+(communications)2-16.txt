â˜…Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are prohibited by Chinese government. Why does the Chinese government cut off its citizens' channels of communications with the outside world? What is it afraid of?I really don't understand what the Goverment thinks about it. Is it to protect the local Internet Companies? But some media called the Chinese Internet is flourishing. Is it really? Or maybe it is just an illusion?
I have to say I'm not pretty sure why they do this. But I do know that this makes me very upset. In terms of the government's intentions, it is partly because they can thus have a tighter control on the Internet by blocking social websites and replacing them by local counterparts. They carry out censorship on microblog easily while Facebook or Twitter are not willing to give in to such censorship. This may explain something, but it doesn't explain the blocking of Coursera and Gmail, as they have little chance of delivering speeches against the party.
