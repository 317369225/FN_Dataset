â˜…What social media channels are the most effective for Internal Communications?
The answer to their question is entirely going to depend on your company's culture. There's no one answer and no way we, with no details about what you want to accomplish, how widely you are spread around the globe, or what kinds of thing you communicating, can answer this. The answer is "The one that your employees use." In most companies I work with, email is still the channel that is most used.
