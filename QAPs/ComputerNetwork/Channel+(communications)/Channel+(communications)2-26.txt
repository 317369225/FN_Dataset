â˜…Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are prohibited by Chinese government. Why does the Chinese government cut off its citizens' channels of communications with the outside world? What is it afraid of?I really don't understand what the Goverment thinks about it. Is it to protect the local Internet Companies? But some media called the Chinese Internet is flourishing. Is it really? Or maybe it is just an illusion?
A prominent website like Facebook or Google is probably more than a communication channel. It is more like an extension of US intelligence agency. The US government can access the data and spy on the users. And if they are not blocked, many Chinese people will use them. There are local versions of these communication channels. For example, Baidu, Wechat, QQ, Weibo, Renren, etc. Facebook, Google have so much money and influence, yet they cannot find a way to do business in China. Those local companies somehow can do business properly. I think these US companies are bound by the US law such that they cannot cooperate with Chinese government anymore.
