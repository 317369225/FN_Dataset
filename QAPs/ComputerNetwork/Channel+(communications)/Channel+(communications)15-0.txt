★Why did Senator John McCain decide to take questions on Quora? What did he feel Quora offered that his usual channels of communication did not?He's a prominent politician with a wide public following.
It's safe to say that if you asked John McCain what Quora was he'd have no idea.   He was likely told that it was an online question forum. The better question is - why does his staff think it's a good idea.  In that regard, they likely chose Quora to show some level of understanding of online communities and where people go to get answers and debate complex issues. Quora is a long-form type platform that allows for more than the "boxers or briefs" question and users of Quora are likely interested in deeper answers than can be given in other formats. It likely can be shown via analytics that we actually read those long answers.
