â˜…Is it OK to use the Twitter direct messages as a direct communication channel instead of email?Let's say I have a web site, with no registration form. The site lets the user to connect (register) using either, his/her Twitter account or his/her Facebook account. Twitter does not provide a way to ask the user for his/her email address (Facebook does), so: Is it OK to send DM to the user via the api? I mean is it a good practice?
Since the only way a business can send a DM to another user is if that user follows the business, I think it's fine. As long as there is no trickery or deception going on, using the DM feature like anyone else is perfectly acceptable.
