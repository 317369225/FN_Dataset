★If President Obama wanted to open a direct, secure and private communications channel to Edward Snowden without his staff or US intelligence services having any knowledge of it, could he do it?
Yes.  You do it the old fashion low technology way.  Find someone you trust and fly them over to Moscow or where ever and have a chat with someone that knows Snowden.  Apparently this is how someone in Hong Kong told Snowden that he would not be stopped at the airport. Now *why* he would want to do this is a big question.
