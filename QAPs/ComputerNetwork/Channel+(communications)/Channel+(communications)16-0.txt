★How can I avoid someone from switching the channel of communication to suit their means at work?There is an email with a couple of people in cc about a topic to which the response is rather negative and unclear.  When asked to clarify by email, the person switches the channel to a phone discussion and skips the other two people that were on the email thread.  So this gets split into a separate thread over email and another over phone with different people.
You can talk to the person on the phone and at the end, send out a summary on the same mail trail....sayin " as per our discussion on the fone, we have decided...." etc. And attach his other mails. You must document it in the same channel.
