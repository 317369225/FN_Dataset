â˜…Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are prohibited by Chinese government. Why does the Chinese government cut off its citizens' channels of communications with the outside world? What is it afraid of?I really don't understand what the Goverment thinks about it. Is it to protect the local Internet Companies? But some media called the Chinese Internet is flourishing. Is it really? Or maybe it is just an illusion?
It's all about control, they want control all the ways people getting information hence control how people think about everything. And they do it so slowly and gradually and most blocked service have a local, fully controllable alternative, so many people won't even notice the change. Google for example, it wasn't being blocked overnight. They start with slowing the connection speed, then ones for a while, they block about one connection request in ten or so, then increasing frequency of blocking till everyone started to switch to Baidu or something else locally. Like boiling a frog in warm water. For some less popular(in China) service, they could be blocked overnight though. Mostly because people start to discuss "sensitive politic topics" on it. Those local copycat benifit from this action is more likely to be a side effect.
