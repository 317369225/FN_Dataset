★High channel capacity, high SNR and large BW, which is required for faster communication?
Thanks for the A2A! It's pretty much what Stephen Scholnik said (actually, not pretty much--more like, precisely what he said). Maybe I can elaborate a little however. So, if you're willing to agree that 'faster communication' means 'more information transferred per unit time' then the simplest answer to your question would be: channel capacity. Ultimately it's the channel capacity that quantifies the information rate (in fact, they're pretty much synonyms); however, the channel capacity is a function of the channel's SNR and BW. As described in the Shannon–Hartley theorem: So as you can see, channel capacity is directly determined from the SNR and BW and not independent of it. So SNR and BW are also correct answers to your question, but that's just semantics.
