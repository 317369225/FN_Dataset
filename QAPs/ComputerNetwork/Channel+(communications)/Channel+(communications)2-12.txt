★Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are prohibited by Chinese government. Why does the Chinese government cut off its citizens' channels of communications with the outside world? What is it afraid of?I really don't understand what the Goverment thinks about it. Is it to protect the local Internet Companies? But some media called the Chinese Internet is flourishing. Is it really? Or maybe it is just an illusion?
The Chinese government don't want to cut off the channels, but what they want, is to control the channels of communications. In China, there is a proverb - "防民之口，胜于防川". What's this mean? It means, it's much harder to stop people's communication than to stop the flood. The government know they can't stop all the channels of communications, so they just want to control of the channels, at first, we can use Facebook inChina, but something happened, the government found that they can control such channels, so they blocked these channels. Now the government encourage the similar websites, even Quora, we have a similar website called "Zhihu". So, it's true that Chinese Internet is flourish. And, because these websites are under the control, so, if there is any information that the government does not want the people to know, they can delete all of it.
