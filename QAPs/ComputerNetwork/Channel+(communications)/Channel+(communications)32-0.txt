â˜…How is it legal for a publicly traded company's subsidiary television network like Discovery Channel (Discovery Communications, Inc. On NASDAQ) to make shows like Moonshiners where the plot includes the filming of a reality show where the people are clearly breaking the law?
The show is not real. Why hasn't Moonshiners star Tim Smith been arrested? Is the show fake?
