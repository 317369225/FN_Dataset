â˜…What is the communication channel like between doctors and pharmacies?For instance, do pharmacies tell doctors when patients haven't picked up prescriptions?
From my limited experience, actual communication between pharmacies and doctors is very scant. As far as I know, doctors are not notified at all about a prescription once it leaves with the patient unless there is a problem. As far as I know, the patient is the only one who is notified if they fail to pick up their prescriptions. If the patient doesn't even bother to get the prescription to a pharmacy, I don't think that anyone would have a way of knowing, short of the doctor's office calling the patient to follow-up. The reasons a pharmacy will be in contact with a doctor's office are usually either: a) the patient's insurance requires prior authorization from the doctor's office in order for the insurance to cover that prescription, b) there is a contraindication in the patient's profile for that particular drug so the pharmacist may call to suggest an alternative (note that some people choose to fill prescriptions at a couple different pharmacies, so the pharmacist might not even have the patient's full medication list in order to screen for potentially dangerous interactions), or c) no one in the pharmacy can read the doctor's handwriting. Other than this, doctors' offices and pharmacies operate pretty independently of one another. Most hospitals, on the other hand, have a much more collaborative approach between the doctors and pharmacists. Doctors at the hospital view the hospital pharmacists as a much more approachable resource. I have found that doctors, especially residents, won't hesitate to call the staff pharmacist for dosing recommendations or other questions. There are also pharmacists that may round with the health care team, getting to review the patient's charts with the doctors and be the resource for treatment options. These are known as clinical pharmacists.
