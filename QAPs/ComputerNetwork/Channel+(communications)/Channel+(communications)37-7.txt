★Why doesn't Beijing ignore the Dalai Lama?The Dalai Lama poses little threat to the structural integrity of China, yet anytime he meets with a Western leader Beijing throws a temper-tantrum. Instead of giving the Lama credibility as a human rights activist by opposing him and his cause, shouldn't China's leaders ignore him and those he meets with?
Nobody cares about Dalai Lama in China for normal people. It's religious and you all want to pursue something called belief. What about iran? If Dalai lama is taking control of tibet, will tibet people can cast votes?  I don't think so.  Beat it and leave it to the politicians
