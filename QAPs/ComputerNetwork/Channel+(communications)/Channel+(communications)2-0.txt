★Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are prohibited by Chinese government. Why does the Chinese government cut off its citizens' channels of communications with the outside world? What is it afraid of?I really don't understand what the Goverment thinks about it. Is it to protect the local Internet Companies? But some media called the Chinese Internet is flourishing. Is it really? Or maybe it is just an illusion?
There are 2 major reasons: 1. Control the dissemination of information: We have seen in other countries and regions how quickly information can spread on social media without local authorities being able to do a thing about it. Had it not been for Facebook, Twitter etc. the "Arab Spring" wouldn't have unfolded so rapidly. Control of information is key in 2014. The dissemination of information is what makes governments fall or remain in power today. Therefore, by blocking Facebook, Twitter etc.  and replacing them with Chinese alternatives (Weibo, RenRen etc.), the government has a much tighter grip on information flow. They can, to a significant extent, decide who is allowed to say and share what information online. A strong online presence and ability to interfere when necessary is a key component in the government’s application of soft power.  2. Stimulate economic growth in the tech sector: Choosing not to allow Chinese users access to various social media websites, video streaming services etc. has enabled a number of Chinese-born businesses to "fill the void" by setting up companies very similar to their foreign counterparts. Examples include YouKu (Youtube clone), RenRen (Facebook clone) and Baidu (Google clone). Many of these companies produce huge turnovers, plenty of jobs and a nice stream of tax revenue to the government which would otherwise have gone to foreign enterprises.
