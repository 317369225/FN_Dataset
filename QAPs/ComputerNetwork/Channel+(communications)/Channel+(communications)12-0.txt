â˜…Is there a possibility of writing directly to Prime Minister's Office or is there a separate channel to communicate with PMO?
Bro, I don't think you even need to know the complete address. Most probably the Post-office won't even mind it if you don't have a stamp on the envelope. Just put your letter in an envelope with the address "To Prime minister of India, New Delhi" It will in all probability reach him. I have known of people who just write "Amitabh Bacchan, Mumbai" and it actually get's delivered to Amitabh bacchan's house. Letter to Prime minister will definitely reach him. The other day I read about a girl in Mumbai who actually did that. She sent a letter to Prime minister with some suggestion and even received a letter from him signed by Narendra Modi himself thanking her for the suggestion. You do the same.
