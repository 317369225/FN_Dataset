â˜…Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are prohibited by Chinese government. Why does the Chinese government cut off its citizens' channels of communications with the outside world? What is it afraid of?I really don't understand what the Goverment thinks about it. Is it to protect the local Internet Companies? But some media called the Chinese Internet is flourishing. Is it really? Or maybe it is just an illusion?
Because many hot-blooded young people are not satisfied with the situation they are living in and are not able to think rationally about anything. And those people are very easy to manipulate which could cause instability in the society, which is the worst thing the Chinese government want to see. The Chinese government is simply using the most simple and straightforward way to take precautions against something horrible to happen. The method is definitely far from ideal and I don't think you can use this method for a long time. But, you know, the government apparently thinks other things are more important at this stage for the country and so it just temporarily put a bandage on this still open wound.
