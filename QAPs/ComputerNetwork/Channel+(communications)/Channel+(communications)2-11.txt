★Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are prohibited by Chinese government. Why does the Chinese government cut off its citizens' channels of communications with the outside world? What is it afraid of?I really don't understand what the Goverment thinks about it. Is it to protect the local Internet Companies? But some media called the Chinese Internet is flourishing. Is it really? Or maybe it is just an illusion?
1.Chinese goverment wants to protect its own companies' development,after all chinese companies are competing with foreign ones in some aspects. 2.I think culture is also the important reason.Chinese people has many differents with western people,such as in values,in sex and so on.Goverment doesn't want publics contact so much,in a word,it's just culture protection,protect the Chinese   culture from deserting in the western cultures.   No matter how many websites Chinese goverment has prohibited or will be prohibited,they won't stop the influence which the websits brought. It is just like the Hollywood films. What is said above is all my personal view.
