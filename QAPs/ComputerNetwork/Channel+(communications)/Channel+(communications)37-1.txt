â˜…Why doesn't Beijing ignore the Dalai Lama?The Dalai Lama poses little threat to the structural integrity of China, yet anytime he meets with a Western leader Beijing throws a temper-tantrum. Instead of giving the Lama credibility as a human rights activist by opposing him and his cause, shouldn't China's leaders ignore him and those he meets with?
I think they just send out the same press release each time. There is little reason to change course and get asked why you are changing course. China's official protest does not significantly add or subtract from the Dalai Lama's threat to China, which is now nearly zero.
