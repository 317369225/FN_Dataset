★How can submarines intercept communication channels of a country?Referring to this famous Submarine incident off Kildin Island, it is claimed that US submarine aimed at intercepting Russian military communications. But how can a submarine eavesdrop on communications at a very long distance, given that most communications are sent via wires and communication towers transfer data at another tower?
Submarines can help in the monitoring of communications carried by underwater cable.  Divers from the submarine can place sensors on the outside of the cable to capture communications by electromagnetic inductance, A submarine might also be able to monitor microwave transmission between towers by placing its own antenna in line with the transmission beam between two microwave antenna towers (either between the towers or behind the receiving tower).  The submarine's antenna would put the submarine in danger of radar detection.
