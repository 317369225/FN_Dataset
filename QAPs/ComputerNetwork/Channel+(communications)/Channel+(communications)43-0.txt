â˜…Do international relations (politics) affect academic research in natural sciences?For example, if two countries are at war or in bad relations, can scientists in them still collaborate and do they? Do some scientific journals refuse to publish papers by authors from some countries?
Political frictions can certainly affect research, particularly if it involves field work in one or the other of two countries unhappy with each other. Field workers already labor under suspicion that they may be spies... after all, they're out there in the middle of nowhere, ostensibly studying things no politician can hope to understand. Researchers in high-tech or biology are already in areas of concern and many if not all of them are getting government funding in some form or other. Research projects do get cancelled; visas get cancelled. Collaboration can become fraught with danger. All you need is a professional competitor to start whispering about how you're involved in communications with someone from the enemy state and your career can go down the tubes in an instant. Back-channel communications often continue -- and personal encryption methods and the Internet + social media make this much easier -- but there's still danger. Even using encryption can be seen as suspicious in itself, or be made to seem so.
