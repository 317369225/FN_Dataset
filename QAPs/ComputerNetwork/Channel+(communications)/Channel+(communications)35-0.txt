â˜…How likely is it to build an Earth-Mars optical communication channel that can allow people on Mars to fluently connect to the internet? What will be the signal power, relative stationary obits, content delivery caching storage, and bandwidth constraints?
There was a proposed Mars Laser Communication Demonstration but the the Mars Telecommunications Orbiter it was attached to was cancelled in 2005. However the technology developed by the MIT Lincoln Laboratory was later used in the Lunar Laser Communications Demonstration on the LADEE satellite launched in 2013. It showed a download rate of 622 megabits per second from lunar orbit and an upload rate of 20 Mbps transmitted from a ground station in New Mexico to the spacecraft. Laser communications have also been demonstrated in Earth orbit. [Laser communication in space] Optical communications have advantages in power and bandwidth compared to radio frequency so it seems likely it will eventually be used from Mars. The distances involved would require new protocols for Internet use. There is ongoing research on an Interplanetary Internet.
