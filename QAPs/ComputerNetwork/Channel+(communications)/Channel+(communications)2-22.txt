â˜…Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are prohibited by Chinese government. Why does the Chinese government cut off its citizens' channels of communications with the outside world? What is it afraid of?I really don't understand what the Goverment thinks about it. Is it to protect the local Internet Companies? But some media called the Chinese Internet is flourishing. Is it really? Or maybe it is just an illusion?
The reason is quite complex, but to tell some simple reasons for our level of perceiving: -lack of some system like motion picture rating system, and youtube has loads of that kind of videos, I still remember when I was high school in china I saw a video of human anatomy. -a part of chinese are easy to be instigated -to give some local company a chance to develop and when they grow up, to join the world economy like Alibaba. PS: we can never understand the wisdom of the leader of china, and most of us do not know the running of this world, when you read more book about history and policy and philosophy, you will find what under the world but most of doesnt do that, so we can only talk about some surface angry like this, because this world is not only right and wrong.
