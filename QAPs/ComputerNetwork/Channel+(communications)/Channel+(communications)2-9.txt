â˜…Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are prohibited by Chinese government. Why does the Chinese government cut off its citizens' channels of communications with the outside world? What is it afraid of?I really don't understand what the Goverment thinks about it. Is it to protect the local Internet Companies? But some media called the Chinese Internet is flourishing. Is it really? Or maybe it is just an illusion?
It's because there's strong censorship on the contents on internet in China, and the gov't doesn't want his citizens to view things politic sensitive, such as Six-4. BTW, I have tons of messages on FB unreplied, anyway can teach me an easy way to log on?:)
