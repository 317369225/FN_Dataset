★Which other countries are capable of shutting down their internet and communication channels as quickly as Egypt?
I don't have much specialist knowledge, but I used to work for a CLEC and I was astonished at how much power the Govt had - so I would have thought almost any of them.could do so whenever they wished. According to this article: http://www.fastcompany.com/17217...  last summer Joe Lieberman proposed a bill to give US Goivernment the explicit ability to do this (''Internet Kill Switch''), and there has been a ''renewed push'' to pass it recently. (indeed, I am only surprised this power was not already in Patriot Act?). This article quotes Gartner that most countries do already have the power: http://www.pcworld.com/businessc.... ''However, because of that legal authority most countries have, the Internet, the mobile networks and the fixed-line phone networks could all be cut off.'' If you look at the reaction to Wikileaks, with Amazon cloud, DNS servers & Paypal all following government requests, I would be confident that ISPs would co-operate, much as Egyptian ISPs and mobile phone companies have done.
