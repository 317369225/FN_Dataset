â˜…Is it OK to use the Twitter direct messages as a direct communication channel instead of email?Let's say I have a web site, with no registration form. The site lets the user to connect (register) using either, his/her Twitter account or his/her Facebook account. Twitter does not provide a way to ask the user for his/her email address (Facebook does), so: Is it OK to send DM to the user via the api? I mean is it a good practice?
I think it's fine, but it's really going to come down the user's individual preferences. The best way to handle this is to provide notification options and let the user choose whether they want to be contacted via DMs or not. I should note that out of all the Twitter apps that I've authorized (30+), I've only seen one of them contact me via DM.
