â˜…How fast is the Internet connection in Larry Page's and Sergey Brin's offices?
Probably gigabit Ethernet on their desktop, and 802.1AC on their laptop. Which is fast, but unlikely to be any faster than the rest of the employees in that building, or most other google buildings. Or employees at lots of other buildings for that matter - at least in major US metro areas. What is likely faster than most other places is the network supporting those connections. Most offices are unlikely to have more than a gigabit to the Internet for the entire building. Google's office has at least 10s if not 100s of gigabits to the internet.
