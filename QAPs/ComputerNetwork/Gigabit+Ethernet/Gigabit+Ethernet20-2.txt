★If I want to provide gigabit Ethernet connection to 1000 users, is it better to use a single business class router which is expanded via Ethernet switches or Is it better to use multiple routers?
Like Kelley said, lots of variables. The router enters into the equation first because of the traffic that leaves your domain and goes elsewhere.  Here, the router and specifically the bandwidth of outbound circuit(s) will be your limiting factor to elsewhere. I'm assuming you're using programmable devices, such as Cisco routers and switches.  Brand isn't as important at features available.  In regards to your thousand users,  your major issues are the topology (where the users are), and how much traffic they generate and to where. Switching is faster than routing and is preferable for this reason.  You could route between locations, and in some cases you could run layer 2 connections, but the topology and connections between various connections may limit that. Assuming you could get your hands on one single switch that had 1000 access ports (good luck with that, by the way), you'd find that you'd want to use multiple VLANs, as 1000 endpoints in a single broadcast domain probably wont perform that well.  So much for a logical design. Physically, that many access ports would require a minimum of ~20 switches each with 48 ports each (plus spares).  Some switches can be stacked, so you'll need a minimum of three stacks of access switches.  If you need more stacks, because of multiple floors, buildings, etc, you probably want to have a distributuion switch as well.  Connectivity betwen distribution and access switches could use single or multiple uplinks.  See "Spanning Tree" and EtherChannel".  If two users on two differet vlans need to talk to each other, you'll need a layer 3 device to connect them.  See "Router on a stick", and "switch virtuial interface".
