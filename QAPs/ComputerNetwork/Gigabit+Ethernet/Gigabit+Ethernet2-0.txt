â˜…Does Baker House have gigabit ethernet?If so, what do I need to do to make sure I am taking advantage of it? (e.g. what type of cable do I need [and can I get one from IS&T]?, are only some of the jacks in my room gigabit?, etc.)
Yes, Baker House (and Maseeh and most new dorms on dorm row) have gigabit ethernet. You will need a computer that has a gigabit ethernet card (some mid-range laptops or most high-end laptops have them). Most ethernet cables should work (they're commonly made to the CAT-5 specification). If you're unsure, you can get one from IS&T (or your dorm's residential computing consultants).
