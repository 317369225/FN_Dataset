GBIC (Gigabit Interface Convertor) and SFP (Small form pluggable) are standards sized components to enable empty GBIC or SFP slots inside switches, routers, NIC cards and other network components to support a form of network connectivity. Most network ports are copper but you do ways to connect fibre optic cables, and since there are multiple connectivity options for fibre (eg LC / SC connections) and multiple types (eg SR / LR / ER) you need these modules to support different connections. GBIC has pretty much been superseded by the miniGBIC or SFP. These generally are 100Mb or 1000Mb. For 10GbE connections you generally need SFP+.
