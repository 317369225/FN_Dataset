★What do engineers change in their houses that other people would not think of?Similar to Dilbert's Ultimate House, though it may be extreme. http://www.hwd3d.com/news/dilber...
To make the changes I want, it would be simpler to build a house. What I have done to change our house since we bought it a few years ago: Installed four 4 foot long 40W each LED lights in the living room, as my wife and I hate dark dungeon-like living rooms (unless we're watching TV). There is a 48 port 10/100 network switch in the living room, next to the cable modem/WiFi. I have run two 5e cables to every room, concealed in the walls and routed through the attic. This house has two garages, one is two cars wide, the other two cars long (weird, I know). One is now wired up as a laboratory with my electronics bench, and a whiteboard and greenscreen for future YouTube instructional videos. Neither had outlets. Everywhere I've added an outlet, I've put in a double box and two pair of outlets, so four outlets in each location. I've started adding recessed panels behind the TVs with a pair of outlets, cable connector, and ethernet. So Roku or smart TV can hide behind it without visible wires. The major thing I'd want in a house, assuming I won the lottery big and built a house: No drywall. All inside walls, floors, and ceilings are made of 4x4ft  panels removable with 8 screws. Naturally, I'd want the things everyone wants. Internet of things, every room with network outlets, plenty of AC outlets, etc. None of that is specific to engineers, though.
