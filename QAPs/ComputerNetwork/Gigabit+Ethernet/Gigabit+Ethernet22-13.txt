â˜…What do engineers change in their houses that other people would not think of?Similar to Dilbert's Ultimate House, though it may be extreme. http://www.hwd3d.com/news/dilber...
Back before the days of ubiquitous cell phones, I had a phone-monitored alarm system, but it seemed to me that any professional burglar would just cut the phone wires where they came into the house. Then the monitoring company would not get notified of the break-in. So I re-routed the phone wires: the cable from the pole went behind a bush near the house before going to the junction box. I spliced the cable at that point and fed two fine wires painted white directly through the wood into the attic to a secret junction box, then wired all the phones from there. The cable still looked the same, still went to the old junction box, but one couldn't see the new wires without careful inspection. I have a 80's state-of-the-art spectrum analyzer that probably cost 50K new ($500 for me). It has a synthesized local oscillator and 10MHz to 22GHz range. This means I can monitor which WiFi channels my neighbors are using and choose my own channel for least interference. I have a plan to someday drill holes in my double pane windows so I can pump in liquids of different colors for appropriate mood lighting. (Yes I know, this is probably not a "good" idea for the safety minded.)
