â˜…If I want to provide gigabit Ethernet connection to 1000 users, is it better to use a single business class router which is expanded via Ethernet switches or Is it better to use multiple routers?
While you could use a single enterprise router with VLANs and subnets and use a number of switches. Each situation is different in how you attempt to accomplish your goals. With the limited information about the situation you have provided. A single enterprise router with multiple switches off of the edge router would be a simple option. VLANs allow you to limit the broadcast load on your network and can even disallow clients on one subnet to talk to another depending on how you would configure the core router.
