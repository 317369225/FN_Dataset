★Should I buy the new 13.3" MacBook Air w/ 128 GB for $1299 or a regular MacBook for $999?I'm replacing my laptop/primary computer and was going to go with the MacBook. With the new MacBook Air, is it worth the upspend?
I think it comes down use.  If you regularly require an optical drive, I would go with the MacBook.  With the MacBook Air, in this case, you would need to consider the additional weight and cost of carrying an external optical drive around. If you are primarily looking for a mobile computing solution that is light, packs a lot of punch, and optical drive use is secondary, get the Air.  Otherwise the MacBook.
