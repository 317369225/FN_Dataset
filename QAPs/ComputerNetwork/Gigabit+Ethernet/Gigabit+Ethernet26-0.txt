â˜…In enterprise networking and data centers, which switch is used more: hardware cut-through or store-and-forward? What's the typical performance value for each of them considering latency?
I haven't seen a cut-through switch in a long, long time. Store-n-Forward is the thing. Performance difference at Gigabit Ethernet or 10 Gigabit Ethernet speeds is negligible. I've seen a packet go through 6 switches in well under 1 millisecond. (All the switches were within 20 feet of each other.) Lots of pros for using store & forward. Lots of cons for using cut-through. Not sure why anyone would use the latter these days.
