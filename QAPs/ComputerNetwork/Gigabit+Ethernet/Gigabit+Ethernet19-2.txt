★I have 2 laptops with gigabit ethernet connected to 2 adjacent ports in an office. One of the laptops seems to be limited to 10Mbit speeds. What is the best way to troubleshoot or isolate the 10Mbit link?
Is the switch manageable?  If so, check duplex settings on both sides (i.e., both at the switch and at the slow laptop).  If one side (it doesn't matter which) is set to Full Duplex while the other side is set to Auto, it'll default to half duplex (see Duplex mismatch for why) and the resulting performance will seem like 10Mbps.  Both sides should be set the same way (i.e., either both Auto or both Full).
