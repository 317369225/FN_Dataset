★Why aren't the 13" and 15" MacBook Pro and MacBook Air being shipped with a gigabit Ethernet adapter?
Apple is no stranger to abandoning features it thinks are heading for the graveyard of technology. The new MacBook Pro without a built-in gigabit ethernet adapter is the perfect epitome of such forward-thinking that, however, isn’t without its pitfalls. As home networks have increased in popularity, so has the wireless router. The rise of Wi-Fi has also caused the downfall of wired networks (in homes, at least), and many consumers now see Ethernet cords as being rather old-fashioned. If users doesn't have wifi at home, you can buy a Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter from apple.
