★Can you hard-wire one router to another?I have a router upstairs that is hard wired, through the walls with a CAT-6 cable to the downstairs TV for Netflix and the like.  The wifi down there is spotty because the router is several rooms and two floors away from the family area. What I'm wondering is can I hook a router up to the CAT-6 cable, and have a second wifi point down there?
Yes.  If one or both sides has Gigabit Ethernet, it will work with any combination of  straight through or crossover cable.  If both sides are 10/100, you will need an Ethernet crossover cable on one side.
