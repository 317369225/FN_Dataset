â˜…How important is linear algebra in computer science?what is the relation between computer engineering and linear algebra
In computer gaming, linear algebra is widely used: 3D graphics is all about linear algebra. Plotting shapes, including rotating them, moving them around, placing cameras in certain spots, etc. Physics in 2D and 3D as well (forces, collisions, etc) - Pool games, angry birds, flight simulators, driving games, or just plain 3D shooters. 3D effects programmed with shaders use linear algebra and hardware to compute huge amounts of calculations very efficiently using parallel processing.
