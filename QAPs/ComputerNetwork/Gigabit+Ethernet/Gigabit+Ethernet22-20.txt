★What do engineers change in their houses that other people would not think of?Similar to Dilbert's Ultimate House, though it may be extreme. http://www.hwd3d.com/news/dilber...
My stepdad is an Engineer. He wired up some simple LED lights so they act as night lights - they are in their bedroom and bathroom so they can see in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. He hates to waste water so while waiting for the hot water they save the cold water and use it for cooking and humidifying the house. He has lots of gadgets to tell him the temperature around the house and outside on a window. Such an inquisitive mind - so much more to tell you but he is most proud of getting a high efficiency rating from our city electric services. Now if I can get him to stop using Word.  (fat chance)
