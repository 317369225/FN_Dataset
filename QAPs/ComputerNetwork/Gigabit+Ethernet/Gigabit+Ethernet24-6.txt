★How important is linear algebra in computer science?what is the relation between computer engineering and linear algebra
It is absolutely essential in Machine Learning. Previous answers didn't stress that actually Linear Algebra is language of machine learning - vectors for lists of features and matrices are used all the time. I'm doing machine learning at coursera and it is mainly about getting actual machine learning problems translated to linear algebra/Numerical Analysis problems (which were solved long time ago). It is also very important in Computer Graphics. For example in OpenGL  camera and object positions are represented with matrices (every object has its own coordinate system). So it is helpful to have strong linear algebra background.
