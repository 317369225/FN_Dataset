★Can you hard-wire one router to another?I have a router upstairs that is hard wired, through the walls with a CAT-6 cable to the downstairs TV for Netflix and the like.  The wifi down there is spotty because the router is several rooms and two floors away from the family area. What I'm wondering is can I hook a router up to the CAT-6 cable, and have a second wifi point down there?
That depends on the firmware of both routers.  You would first set up the second router to be an access point only, with a static ip, not dhcp, attached to the first router.  With the second router set as an access point only, it will forward all the dhcp, and internet request through the first router which will act as the gateway to the internet.
