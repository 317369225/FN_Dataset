â˜…When will 10 gigabit Ethernet overtake 1 gigabit Ethernet in deployment?
Datacenter: already happening and will likely complete within 3-4 years before 100Gbps takes hold outside of trunked 10Gbps Home: entertainment hubs, laptops, and desktops will begin shipping with 10Gbps chipsets (Intel Light Peak) next year for limited market release and the first SOHO routers and broadband devices as well as general I/O for things like monitors and flat panels -- in addition to MIMO solutions already starting to overtake standard 100Mbps... just remember that many homes in the US still have SOHO routers that actually degrade the actual Internet speeds that many ISPs can deliver now (i.e. 10/100 Mbps interfaces that rarely ever perform beyond 12-15Mbps).
