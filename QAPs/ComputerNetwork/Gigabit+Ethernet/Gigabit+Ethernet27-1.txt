★Can you hard-wire one router to another?I have a router upstairs that is hard wired, through the walls with a CAT-6 cable to the downstairs TV for Netflix and the like.  The wifi down there is spotty because the router is several rooms and two floors away from the family area. What I'm wondering is can I hook a router up to the CAT-6 cable, and have a second wifi point down there?
Of course. Essentially all routers are "hard wired". However, I would suggest a switch. Using a second router makes things more complex, while a switch is "plug & play". The real question is about your WiFi APs. It sounds like your router is a router / switch / AP, which is somewhat common. I'll assume that for now. Some APs are made to work together, some are not. But you can make them all work together if you want. Typical consumer-grade APs need to be set on separate channels (e.g. 1 and 11), but use the same SSID to work together. That way your computers, phones, etc. will just "roam" between them. Next you have to ensure the second one is in bridge mode. You want IP addresses handed out (DHCP server) by your router. So plug a new AP downstairs with the same SSID & different channel, and you are done. (Channels are tricky, it says there are 11, but only 1, 6, 11 do not overlap.) If you do not have enough cables in the wall, no worries. You only need one. Plug that one into an AP with a built in switch, plug the TV & whatever into the AP. AP/switch combos are very common these days. Hope that helps. EDIT: Typos.
