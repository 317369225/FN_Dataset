â˜…Is a plugged-in internet connection faster than a WiFi internet connection?
Like any good technical question, the answer is: it depends. Specifically, in this case, it depends first, on the rated speed of the two connections you're talking about. e.g. a Gigabit ethernet network is probably going to be faster than a 802.11b network (rated at 11Mbs) Second, even if you are comparing the rated speeds, the actual speed of a wireless network never really approaches the rated speed. Using our 802.11b network from above, you'll never really get about 5Mbs at best due to overhead in the WiFi protocol. Similarly, a 300Mbs rated 802.11n network will typically get about 150Mbs at best. And depending on distance from the router, and whatever other interference is going on in the area, the number only goes down from there. Finally, and probably most importantly, speed of a connection is really the lowest speed of all links in the connection. Since you mentioned an Internet connection, your ISPs download and upload speeds are most likely going to be a factor. If your Comcast network has a rated download speed of 12Mbs, then having a a Gigabit ethernet connection is not going to make much difference vs. a 54Mb (rated) 802.11g network.
