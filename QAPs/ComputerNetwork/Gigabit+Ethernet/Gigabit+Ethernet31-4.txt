★Why hasn't Ethernet gotten any faster in the last 15 years?I meant this question in relation to common consumer hardware. In 2000, higher-end PCs started having gigabit Ethernet ports, and today, PCs still have the same gigabit Ethernet. I know 100Gb fiber exists, but it's not for consumers, whereas WiFi, USB, etc are all common on normal computers.
I think this is why Google has started offering residential fiber internet service.  I don't think Google has any interest in being an ISP, I think they want the other ISPs to step up their game and I think they want consumers to be unsatisfied with something like 10 Mbps internet for $50 a month.   I live in Provo, Utah where Google bought the fiber network.  They offer two internet options.  You can get 5 Mbps for free.  (well, you have to pay the setup fee, but for me that was a one-time $30 charge).  At that point, there is no reason not to have 'high-speed' internet.   The other option from Google is 1 Gbps, which, for normal consumers is a ridiculous amount of bandwidth, and it costs $70 (which I think is a lot for internet).  If you bought the TV package too for $120/month they throw in a TERABYTE of cloud storage, and an Nexus 7 for a remote control.  I think they want to show what you can do if you have insane amounts of bandwidth... for instance, with a TB of cloud storage, I could store literally all of my music, pictures and even video files in my Google drive, and at gigabit speeds, I just could stream everything.   And guess what? Now Comcast offers 250GB internet in Provo.  Another local ISP, Veracity, has a billboard offering 10Gbps.  ISPs stepping up.
