★Should I buy the new 13.3" MacBook Air w/ 128 GB for $1299 or a regular MacBook for $999?I'm replacing my laptop/primary computer and was going to go with the MacBook. With the new MacBook Air, is it worth the upspend?
I'm going to piggy back off Qing Liu and just add this for your reference: http://www.anandtech.com/show/39... If you're looking at light basic use (Basic Office Suite, Web browsing, etc) and would like something portable -thin (0.11 to 0.68 inches!) and light (2.9lbs) - the 13.3" Macbook Air is great. It's also got a good SSD drive and an amazing screen (one of the best of any laptop).  Its battery life *WHEN DOING LIGHT WORK (i.e. non-flash web browsing, mp3 playback, word processing)* is actually significantly better than the Macbook Pro 13 (671 minutes vs 585 minutes).  However, under flash-browsing or with heavy load, the MBA 13 battery life is less than the MBP 13 (you can check the review above for the exact numbers). If you're looking to do a lot of compiling, Adobe (photoshop, flash, etc), video editing, or whatnot, you're probably going to want to go with the MBP with its better specs. It really comes down to use.
