â˜…How important is linear algebra in computer science?what is the relation between computer engineering and linear algebra
I agree with Jesse Reiss that you can be a software engineer without knowing sophisticated linear algebra, though it's crucial as an academic or a specialist in certain fields. Linear algebra in computer science can broadly divided into two categories: Linear algebra for spatial quantities. Here you're dealing with 2-, 3-, or 4-dimensional vectors and you're concerned with rotations, projections, and other matrix operations that have some spatial interpretation. This is the kind of linear algebra that comes up, for example, in computer graphics or physics simulations. Linear algebra for statistics. Here you're dealing with vectors in high-dimensional spaces that have no particular spatial interpretation and you're interested in matrix decompositions and so on. This domain includes signal processing, statistical machine learning, and compression.The first is really a special case of the second, but for practical purposes the math that you'll be interested in will differ substantially across this boundary.
