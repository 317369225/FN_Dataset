â˜…If you want to hardwire a network through your house, as opposed to wireless, via plug outlets, what is the best product to do that to support high speed?I have wireless router but the signal comes and goes which make th the xbox fluctuate between HD and not. I am looking for another alternative that has a stable but equally high speed connection.
Depends on which media you are plannig to use for wiring. Here are the standards that are out there: Powerline - HomePlug AV - 200mbit Cable/Coax - MoCa 3.1 - 600mbit/sec Anything(power,phoneline,coax) - G.hn - 1Gig HomePlug and Moca are already there and have devices available. G.hn is supposed to have devices this year. One thing to keep in mind, is all these are using shared media, like half-duplex Ethernet, so if you are considering this to improve your latency in games, it might not give you as much as you expect. Try to keep it to 2 devices on the same segment.
