â˜…I have 2 laptops with gigabit ethernet connected to 2 adjacent ports in an office. One of the laptops seems to be limited to 10Mbit speeds. What is the best way to troubleshoot or isolate the 10Mbit link?
Check the switch. It is possible you have one laptop plugged into a 10mb port. You can also check your network cards properties. You may have to adjust the media type to 100BaseTx with full duplex, or higher. Seems yours may be on 10BaseT.
