★Is a plugged-in internet connection faster than a WiFi internet connection?
Wired is faster because as Alan Cohen points out, Wireless is half-duplex, a device talks OR listens. However, Wireless is also shared, meaning only *I* talk and you don't until I am done. This is why a congested airspace impacts everyone performance. There are sets of non-overlapping channels on 802.11 wireless (channels 1, 6, 11 for 802.11b, for example). If you set your AP, or your AP discovers,  a non-overlapping channel, the congestion can be relieved.somewhat. Wired connections are typically full duplex ans switched. In fact, you would be hard pressed to find a wired hub (aka shared) today. Even low end home routers are switched. If you live in a multi-tenant building like an apartment or townhouse, you might be able to work with your neighbors to share the airspace. Or you can jump up to 802.11a or n which uses 5 Ghz range and outside of other AP's.
