â˜…If you have a standard 2 MB/s Comcast cable connection, is it meaningless to have a gigabit ethernet router because you'll never get speeds that high?
Meaningless? Maybe sometimes. A gigabit router is going to likely be newer and have more advanced packet processing hardware than it's 10/100 counterparts, so that's worthwhile. Additionally, due to relatively limited routing abilities, most consumer routers can't handle over 20-30MB/s of internet traffic anyway. They are limited because of their packets-per-second ability, measured in MPPS (millions of packets per second) This limitation only applies to routed traffic, not to traffic between devices on the LAN.
