â˜…Should I buy the new 13.3" MacBook Air w/ 128 GB for $1299 or a regular MacBook for $999?I'm replacing my laptop/primary computer and was going to go with the MacBook. With the new MacBook Air, is it worth the upspend?
Consider the differences and see which set of advantages aligns better with the way you plan to use your machine. MacBook Air: - Thinner - Lighter - Higher resolution display (1440x900) - Launches apps faster (SSD) MacBook: - Cheaper - More/upgradeable RAM and storage - Slightly longer battery life - Faster CPU - Optical drive - Gigabit ethernet (need a dongle on the MacBook Air, and it's not gigabit) And finally, consider the aesthetics. Which one would make you happier when you use it?
