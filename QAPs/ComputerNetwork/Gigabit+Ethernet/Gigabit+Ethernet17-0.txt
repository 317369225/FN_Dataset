â˜…If you have a standard 2 MB/s Comcast cable connection, is it meaningless to have a gigabit ethernet router because you'll never get speeds that high?
Depends on whether you're doing transfers between local computers. Probably the only thing big enough for this to be an issue is video, although if you plan on copying around whole music libraries or lots of pictures (or doing backup over the network), you might appreciate the extra speed. If you're only using a single computer (or not transferring anything in-house), or if you're only using a wireless connection, then GigE is unnecessary.
