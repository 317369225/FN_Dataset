★What do engineers change in their houses that other people would not think of?Similar to Dilbert's Ultimate House, though it may be extreme. http://www.hwd3d.com/news/dilber...
I hard plumbed my air compressor with quick connects for both sprinkler manifolds.  Now when cold weather is on the way, I just snap a hose between the anti-siphon and my quick connect, and blow out the pipes. Covered all the exposed wires in the garage with corrugated cable covers, like case modders use.  Painted all the mechanicals black to match.  It looks good. On my cabin, to keep the basement dry, during construction I put black tar on the outside of the basement wall, then before backfilling hung a rubber membrane that drips into the drain tile.  Used attic trusses on the cabin to increase the finished square footage by 40%. Built in dust collection for the wood-shop, with a floor sweep. 40ft slot car track. Climbing wall.
