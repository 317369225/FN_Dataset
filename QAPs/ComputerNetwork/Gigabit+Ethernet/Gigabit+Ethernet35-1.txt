â˜…Does this internet speed make any sense? Please refer to the attached image
It's perfectly fine. If you yourself feel comfortable accessing internet at say 1Mbps at your home, with no delay in surfing,watching videos,etc experienced by you, imagine how much bandwidth would be required by a university to provide all such services to all of its students at a time. That's why the need such high speeds. Here is one more picture which will show you that universities have high speeds. Hope this helps :)
