★What do engineers change in their houses that other people would not think of?Similar to Dilbert's Ultimate House, though it may be extreme. http://www.hwd3d.com/news/dilber...
Oh my, such expense!  I live by "Faster, Better, Cheper" Demand response thermostats help us do our part to shave energy use during peak periods. For energy efficiency, I've seen lots of ideas up top but the simplest and by far highest payback: $10 worth of latex caulking and thin film plastic treatments on the windows of my 1930s house. We also are tracking energy use for benchmarking.  In our region, Con Ed of NY provides a report giving the last two years. CAT6 is great, but try PowerLine v2 for wireless throughout the house.
