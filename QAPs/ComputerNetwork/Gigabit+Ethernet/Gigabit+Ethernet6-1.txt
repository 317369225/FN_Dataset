â˜…Is there a portable thunderbolt to gigabit ethernet adaptor suitable for use with a MacBook Air?Yes, I know about the 27" LCD/LED monitor. That's not portable. Looking for a dongle that goes in a laptop bag. Universal Serial Bus (USB)-based Ethernet just sucks.
It looks like Sonnet will release their adapter "Q2 2012". That is sneaking closer and closer. Source - http://www.sonnettech.com/news/p...
