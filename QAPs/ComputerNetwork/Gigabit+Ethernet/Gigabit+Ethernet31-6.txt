â˜…Why hasn't Ethernet gotten any faster in the last 15 years?I meant this question in relation to common consumer hardware. In 2000, higher-end PCs started having gigabit Ethernet ports, and today, PCs still have the same gigabit Ethernet. I know 100Gb fiber exists, but it's not for consumers, whereas WiFi, USB, etc are all common on normal computers.
I agree that Ethernet advancement is at a bit of a stand still. I find it annoying that many computers sold after 2005, and many still sold today only have 100mb Ethernet and not at least Gigabit. 10Gb+ should also be much cheaper by now. It took a while for Gigabit switches and NICs to come down in price, but now they are very cheap to implement. 10Gb should be affordable by now, but it is not. There is a bit of a chicken and egg problem here, but I still think the price should be much lower by now. As for those stating that 1 Gigabit is sufficient, this is not true for an in home NAS. It is very easy for network storage to exceed the speed of Gigabit, particularly if there are SSDs involved. This also matters when transferring data between 2 computers with SSDs over the network. The only company selling consumer electronics capable of networking over a Gigabit is Apple, because technically Thunderbolt is capable of 10Gb Ethernet. The only issue is that this is rarely ever used and there still aren't affordable 10Gb switches, and especially not those capable of using Thunderbolt. Even so, it is possible to do 10Gb Ethernet between 2 Macs in a peer to peer arrangement over a thunderbolt cable today.
