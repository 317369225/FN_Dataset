★Why LAN cable have 8 wires? Does it affect the speed of data transfer?
8 wire cable predates LAN cabling. Structured cabling and the Registered jack system arose from a "Bell System under a 1976 FCC order ending the use of protective couplers provided exclusively by the telephone company."  The 8 wire form of this jack (8P8C) was typically used for data applications, and became the wiring model of choice for PBX vendors for their specialized phones of the early to mid 1980s.  The ethernet over twisted pair pioneers chose to reuse that wiring infrastructure for LAN. In common 10 megabit (10BaseT Ethernet) and 100 megabit (100Base-TX Fast Ethernet) LAN, two pairs (1-2, 3-6) are used for the LAN: One pair for transmit and one for receive.  You can theoretically put two independent parallel signals ("lanes") of that kind of Ethernet on an 8 wire cable, or you can use the two spare cable pairs (5-4, 7-8) to carry other signals (POTS telephone, power for the device). In 1000BaseT gigabit Ethernet Gigabit ethernet, all 4 pairs are used, with a bidirectional signal (PAM-5) on each pair. You can go swimming in the technical detail in the Wikipedia article, ethernet over twisted pair. The number of wires is not as important as for the speed as the many other qualities of the wire which are summarized by the cable "category," such as Category 5 cable and Category 6 cable. Speeds faster than gigabit call for more specialized cable, like ISO/IEC 11801.
