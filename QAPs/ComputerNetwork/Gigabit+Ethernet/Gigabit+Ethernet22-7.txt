â˜…What do engineers change in their houses that other people would not think of?Similar to Dilbert's Ultimate House, though it may be extreme. http://www.hwd3d.com/news/dilber...
Installed a heat pump water heater. Provides cooled air in the summer and plenty of hot water without having to pay to generate the heat. All light bulbs are CFLs and will become LEDs with the next generation. Ceiling fans (the best I could get) in every room. Soon to have a +25 SEER split system heat pump for HVAC. (Operates effectively down to about 18 deg. F). wood stove for backup heat. (Yes we sometimes loose power in the winter and I enjoy the process of using it). Wood warms you twice.... once when you cut/split it and again when you burn it. Planning to build a covered porch/deck all around three sides of the house for year round use and to reduce heat gain in the summer. Building a green house (12' x 20') for extending the growing season (+/- 120 days). Have a small "victory" garden for herbs and veggies outside the back door. Also have two larger gardens for carrots/tomatoes/ cabbages/beets/cucumbers/ onions/kale/celery. Building a chicken coop for REAL eggs and non GMO fed chickens who will help feed us and LOVE vegi scraps and peelings.
