â˜…What do engineers change in their houses that other people would not think of?Similar to Dilbert's Ultimate House, though it may be extreme. http://www.hwd3d.com/news/dilber...
I visited a friend in Copenhagen, Denmark and I believe her father is an engineer. There were a couple creative things he installed during a remodel which I would love to have in a future home. Nothing too technically crazy, but useful indeed: Heated bathroom floor tiles, on a countdown timer Bathroom fan would come on with the lights, and would continue to run for 5 minutes after the lights are turned off Glass top for the stove that would work as additional counter space, and fold up when the stove was to be used
