â˜…Should I buy the new 13.3" MacBook Air w/ 128 GB for $1299 or a regular MacBook for $999?I'm replacing my laptop/primary computer and was going to go with the MacBook. With the new MacBook Air, is it worth the upspend?
I'll give you this: I've always considered the $200 bump to the 13" MBP to almost be a no-brainer, and after using my sister's 13" MBP alongside my new 13" MBA, The Air is the definitively more awesome machine, so much so it easily overcome's any complaints against it. ( in day to day use, it is the fastest computer I've ever used ) So A > B > C, and you're comparing A & C...
