â˜…What are the best recommended research topics on databases according to edge technologies and recent research trends?I recently started to work in a databases to produce a paper and I thought it was a good idea to run a personal survey/research about what topics in the databases area can be potentially successful to research according to recent investigations worldwide, edge technologies and general demand.
There are three annual conferences which attract the lion's share of research papers: ICDE [1], SIGMOD [2], and VLDB [3]. There are also a pair of biennial conferences held on alternating years which include more experimental work: HPTS [4] and CIDR [5]. Some leaders of the database research community meet irregularly to summarize the state of the field. Examples of reports produced by these meetings include the Asilomar Report on Database Research [6] from 1998 and the Claremont Report on Database Research [7] from 2008. Recently, a great deal of database-related research has been published at conferences more traditionally associated with systems research. For example, Google published details on GFS [8] at SOSP [9] in 2003, and on BigTable [10] at OSDI [11] in 2006. In acknowledgment of this trend, the database and systems research communities recently came together to create a new conference called SoCC [12]. In addition to perusing the proceedings of these conferences, you can also check out their related publications: the ICDE Data Engineering Bulletin [13], the SIGMOD Record [14] and the Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment [15]. I'll stop here; on a later date, I might extract some of the relevant trends from the content listed above, but for now, the exercise is left to the reader.
