★What is the most inexpensive NAS solution that simply puts one SATA or USB 3.0 hard drive on a network with Gigabit ethernet, with support for SSH?Synology has a number of offerings, but they are overkill for this particular application, and all I need is something cheap and barebones as described.
If it was not for the gigabit Ethernet, a possible solution could be a @Raspberry Pi. It is about 30€ + power (a few €) + the USB disk. It is not a NAS but a complete Linux system (based on Debian) - which makes it a super-NAS :) I would go for that solution. Another possibility is the @CuBox-i -Mini Computer for XBMC player, Android TV Box and Linux (about 130 $)
