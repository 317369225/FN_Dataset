â˜…Are there any very small 3-port gigabit ethernet switches?Is there is a small module available off-the-shelf that only has a power connector and no less than three RJ45 headers? Ideally it would not be more than an inch or two on a side.
It doesn't seem that there are, so far. That form factor would be aggressive, considering that you'd need room for the PHYceiver, a Gigabit LAN connect interface (GLCI) with three RJ45 8P8C pin sets and receptacles, and a power-supply interface, a multiplexer controller, and enough space on the PCB for signal traces. You'd probably want a heatsink as well, even if the switch were being run without an enclosure. You could try buying a 5-port switch and de-soldering the un-needed parts, then cut the PCB around the 2 un-needed receptacles, but you may still end up with 3 inches on one of the sides. You could also try contacting Mouser, Allied Electronics, or another parts distributor to see what they might suggest, but hand-soldering your own switch from components may not be possible.
