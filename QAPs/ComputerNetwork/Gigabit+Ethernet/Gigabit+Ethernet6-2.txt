★Is there a portable thunderbolt to gigabit ethernet adaptor suitable for use with a MacBook Air?Yes, I know about the 27" LCD/LED monitor. That's not portable. Looking for a dongle that goes in a laptop bag. Universal Serial Bus (USB)-based Ethernet just sucks.
Take a look here http://www.apple.com/thunderbolt/ ... they mention something called "Sonnet Presto Gigabit Ethernet adapter".  Also little something here http://www.thunderbolt-periphera.... Appears though that not quite yet for sale?  Quick search didn't show any in the obvious online retailers ...
