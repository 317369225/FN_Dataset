★What do engineers change in their houses that other people would not think of?Similar to Dilbert's Ultimate House, though it may be extreme. http://www.hwd3d.com/news/dilber...
Engineers install programmable thermostats in their homes.  Then they analyze how air circulates in their homes, and locate where hot and cold air collects. Then they adjust the air intake and exhaust vents, and program the thermostat to ensure the most efficient and cost effective management of the heating and cooling system. Then they repeat the process for every season.
