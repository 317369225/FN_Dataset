★What do engineers change in their houses that other people would not think of?Similar to Dilbert's Ultimate House, though it may be extreme. http://www.hwd3d.com/news/dilber...
Here are a few examples of things I am currently working on, recently completed or plan to do soon: Turn an alarm clock into a crappy yet functional speaker for my xbox360 Turn a European power supply into a North American one so that you can use a far superior speaker system for your xbox360 Take out and repurpose the power supply, motors and gears from an old printer. Use a cheap cutting board as the body of a robot made partially out of the above items. Turn an xbox360 into a cheap and very powerful linux server for whatever desire you may have Turn the kinect from that xbox into a powerful 3d visual sensor for the robot above. Retrofit and use the batteries from an old cordless drill to power that very same robot. Turn old snowboards into a bench to sit on while you are on the starting ramp of your terrain park made out of old pieces of wood and metal. Write a script that automatically filters your downloads into directories based on what kind of file it is. etc. The list of things I want to create or modify in my house is endless. The only thing that stops me from doing everything is the time commitment a lot of these projects take. But anything that a normal person would hire someone to do I would do myself. I am still quite young but up to this point I have never taken my car to a mechanic, or my computer to a technician. I have never hired a plumber, electrician, carpenter or whatever other kind of handy man you can think of. When something breaks I see an opportunity for me to buy some new tools, and acquire some new skills. Essentially I want to take apart and modify every single thing that is inside of my house.  So to answer your question with a question, what don't engineers change in their house that other people would not think of?
