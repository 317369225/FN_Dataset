â˜…Why hasn't Ethernet gotten any faster in the last 15 years?I meant this question in relation to common consumer hardware. In 2000, higher-end PCs started having gigabit Ethernet ports, and today, PCs still have the same gigabit Ethernet. I know 100Gb fiber exists, but it's not for consumers, whereas WiFi, USB, etc are all common on normal computers.
I remember reading a year or so ago that we have reached almost the theoretical limit of fiber optic efficiency and speed. The only area for improvement left is the transfer and junction connections which lose at least some signal. I'm guessing the extreme fibers you speak of incredibly high quality and take longer and more money to produce. The accuracy of the material needs to have next to no imperfections or blemishes to transmit massive amounts of information unscathed. Also realize that you also just need larger cables sometimes. There are even larger cables. Submarine communications cables are what connect the continents and countries across the ocean, not satellites. Satellites only account for about 1% of the total traffic between continents. These cables are insane, transmitting in the terabits per second and costings hundreds of millions of dollars to be laid on the sea bed and maintained year after year. So long story short, we're working on it. In 2000, the need for a 100Gb/s cable was an absurd fantasy. Now it's a realistic dream of the average consumer even though that would be more than enough to watch 50 simultaneous Netflix streams in HD.
