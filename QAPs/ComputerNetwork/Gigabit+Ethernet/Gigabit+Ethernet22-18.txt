â˜…What do engineers change in their houses that other people would not think of?Similar to Dilbert's Ultimate House, though it may be extreme. http://www.hwd3d.com/news/dilber...
Replace regular or even CFL light bulbs with LED lights; the CREE ones are cheap, and backed by a 10 years warranty - save the CUP and bill. Ref: Cree 6-Watt (40W) A19 Warm White (2700K) LED Light Bulb (1-Pack)-BA19-04527OMF-12DE26-1U100 at The Home Depot - 10$. There is also a lot or MR16 (spotlight) and E12 (candelabra) format LED lights available on eBay, so you can replace all those bathrooms and dining room bulbs too. Replace the regular or programmable thermostat with a Nest. Extra points for controlling it using a PHP script to stop the HVAC fan when the temperature is 1oC past the set temperature, and to enable or disable Away mode on a schedule, and according to the X10 motion detectors around the house. Ref: nest-api to control the Nest using PHP. Replace or augment the regular alarm system with a bunch of X10 motion detectors, monitored using a computer and with email notifications when movement is detected outside the normal hours. Replace the door bell with a wireless, battery-powered one that you can bring with you outside during the summer. Also allows you to turn off or at least lower the volume of the door bell when the little ones are asleep (daily nap). Replace the regular phone service with a VoIP provider, and install an ATA (or two, for redundancy) to re-use your existing phones lines and devices. Replace TV cable service with a home-made ATSC antenna, stored in the attic.
