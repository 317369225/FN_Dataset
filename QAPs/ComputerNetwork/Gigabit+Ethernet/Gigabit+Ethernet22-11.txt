★What do engineers change in their houses that other people would not think of?Similar to Dilbert's Ultimate House, though it may be extreme. http://www.hwd3d.com/news/dilber...
I just built a house last year.  Here are things I did that most people probably wouldn't. - outside water has a separate circuit so if I add a filter or softener, the outside water won't go through that.  There's also a compressed air quick connect and valve so I can blow out the outside circuit for winter (part of it goes through an unheated garage). - the garage has a separate workshop area which includes a kitchen style sink for washing hands, car parts, etc. - 25 gallon air compressor in basement with air plumbed up to the garage.  Everyone should own an air compressor. - I have conduit running from attic to basement for future wiring additions - hard wired cat6 runs from each room to the basement - exterior trim is Azek (actually a knockoff brand) and siding is Hardiboard so maintenance will be minimal. - I pre-wired for wall mounted flat panel TVs. - Basement has extra ceiling height for a future family room. - Cat6 has been run for security cameras which will be installed later. - The house meets all energy star criteria and is insulated such that a 27k BTU furnace is plenty for 3000 sq ft.  The previous house was 2000 sq ft and needed a 90k BTU furnace. The heating system includes an "ERV" which is a heat exchanger and pulls in fresh air. - The main beam is steel to minimize columns in the basement.  - The range hood vents to the outside instead of recirculating through a charcoal filter. - The sink in the kitchen is an oversized, single bowl sink.  I don't understand why many contractors put double bowl sinks in kitchens when everyone has a dishwasher. - The garage floor has an epoxy coating so oil, etc won't stain the floor.
