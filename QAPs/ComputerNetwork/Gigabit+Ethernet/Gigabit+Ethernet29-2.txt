★What are the best recommended research topics on databases according to edge technologies and recent research trends?I recently started to work in a databases to produce a paper and I thought it was a good idea to run a personal survey/research about what topics in the databases area can be potentially successful to research according to recent investigations worldwide, edge technologies and general demand.
Databases  in the modern world are required mainly to computerize data to get rid  of paper/files clutter. They are required in almost every enterprise  section of today like banks, hospitals, post offices, fast food  restaurants, travel agencies and you name it. An all-time popular  research on database systems in any enterprises require the raw data to  be stored in the back-end and connect it with an interface (front-end)  hiding the back-end but extract required info at the back-end from the  interface. The interface can be designed using C#, php/javascript or ASP.NET and  the back-end using mysql/sql server. The interface has to be as  user-friendly as possible and several guidelines for it can be googled  on the net. Another popular research in database area is to data mine  (find patterns in) data in large databases or even data warehouses for  analysis of the data, for example, in a supermarket database system,  data mining can help to find patterns such as, if last year's overall  profits were better than the year before and what actions to take for  the current year. In order to data mine, there are several algorithms  available which you code in a suitable programming language and apply it  to the backend data to get results (patterns in data), which can then  be analyzed as required.
