â˜…What are some FPGA projects ideas of moderate difficulty? Preferably in the field of networks, communication and network security.
- (deep) packet inspection - packet generators - firewall - tcp or udp offloading engines - protocols decoding and parsing (financial ones are popular) Basically developing small network stack inside FPGA. Once you have it there are many applications that will benefit from being ported from software to hardware domain. Once accomplished the next step would be PCIe and kernel drivers which really open doors towards HPC and hardware-software co-design. For instance imagine network card that allows to decode/decompressed >10M messages a second, filter necessary ones, does simple calculations and distributes results among different CPUs and caches (balancing) in order to avoid latencies involved with cache-coherency (memory fencing).
