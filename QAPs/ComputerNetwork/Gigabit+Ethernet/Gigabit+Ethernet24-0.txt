In addition to these excellent answers, linear algebra is crucial to: Audio, video and image compression, including MP3, JPEG/JPEG-2000 and MPEG video or VP8 Modulation and coding, including convolutional codes and, e.g., EV-DO, Wi-Fi, Gigabit Ethernet, QAM, HDTV and the Global Positioning System Signal processing, including the Fast Fourier Transform and autotune! "I'm on a Boat" would not have been possible without linear algebra. Colorimetry Statistics and machine learning, including something as far afield as automated trading in the financial markets
