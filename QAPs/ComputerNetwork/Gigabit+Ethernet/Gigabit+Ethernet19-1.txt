â˜…I have 2 laptops with gigabit ethernet connected to 2 adjacent ports in an office. One of the laptops seems to be limited to 10Mbit speeds. What is the best way to troubleshoot or isolate the 10Mbit link?
First thing to do is swap cable between laptops. If that still gives you 10Mbps try swapping the outlets on the wall. I wouldn't use the option of the extra switch, especially if you have an IT crew in the workspace, because the ports are probably configured for just one MAC address and if you plug a switch you'll get more than one MAC (one for each laptop) and the port will likely be blocked.
