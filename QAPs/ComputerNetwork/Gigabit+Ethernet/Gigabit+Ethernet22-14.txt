â˜…What do engineers change in their houses that other people would not think of?Similar to Dilbert's Ultimate House, though it may be extreme. http://www.hwd3d.com/news/dilber...
I have the Two small tanks on my terrace, which are used to drain the Rain water in rainy season, what i did is using some cotton cloth plugs, blocked the way of water down my terrace, and now i can stop almost 700 liters of fresh rain water from going into Drainage. This quantity of water is sufficient for an Indian Family of four members for 1-2 days. After one Hour of good rain, the tanks get full and then I run the water to my regular water storage under gravity. This method has helped my family a lot after the droughts (We get very less rains), and we save hundreds of Rupees that I used to spend on purchasing water from private water suppliers at least during rainy season. Running this method costs me nothing, just a little cleaning of the terrace before it rains, and a rubber water pipe to flow the water under gravity. This method is very useful in areas of India, where people strive for water even during rains. NOTE: This water cannot be used for Drinking and Cooking purposes, but it's useful in Cleaning, Washing, etc tasks. Here is a picture of what it actually looks: Precautions: 1. Never keep the water Open for more than two days, If you are nor sure whether the stored water will come in use in next few days, Let it go in the drainage. 2. Try cleaning terrace frequently during rainy season, so that the water you get will be dirt free.
