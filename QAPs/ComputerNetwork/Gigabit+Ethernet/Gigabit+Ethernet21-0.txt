â˜…I'm looking for a USB 3.0 Hub (at least 3 ports) which also has an SDXC card reader and a Gigabit Ethernet adaptor. An optional external power supply would be a plus. Where can I find this?
I can't find any that's all-in-one like you're probably hoping, but how about these combined: Anker 3 port USB3.0 huh with Ethernet: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product... Anker Card Reader: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product... Satechi 3 port hub with SD card reader: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product... The first and the last one daisy chained would give you 5 usable ports, an Ethernet port, and a SD card reader. Disclosure: The links provided are Amazon referral links and a get a tiny kick back if you choose to purchase through those (same cost to you regardless); if you wish not to use those links, the text provided on front should be plenty to find the products I'm mentioning.
