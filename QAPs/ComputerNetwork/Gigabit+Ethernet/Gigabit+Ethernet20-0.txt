★If I want to provide gigabit Ethernet connection to 1000 users, is it better to use a single business class router which is expanded via Ethernet switches or Is it better to use multiple routers?
I would not generally put 1000 stations in a single broadcast domain, so in this scenario I would definitely be looking at having some sort of internal layer 3 switching both to control the spread of broadcast traffic and for isolability and manageability generally within the network.  For 1000 stations, a single layer 3 switch (or switch stack, since you probably want some degree of redundancy; could be a chassis switch with redundant supervisor blades) is sufficient as there is probably no reason to deploy a complicated or dynamic routing infrastructure for such a small network.  This core switching infrastructure would then be connected to the Internet via one or more gateway firewalls/routers depending on how much bandwidth and redundancy you need. There's too many unspecifieds in this hypothetical to make more than vague and broad statements, and the foregoing might well go out the window entirely if (for example) some users have unusual bandwidth or latency requirements (to name just one of many possible special considerations).
