â˜…Why aren't the 13" and 15" MacBook Pro and MacBook Air being shipped with a gigabit Ethernet adapter?
With 802.11G (54Mbps), 802.11N (150/300) and 802.11A/C, why bother with cables on a portable machine? The only time I use the ethernet cable on my pre-retina MBP is when I'm at work, doing my big-data coding (and just to be nice to my colleagues and don't screw the WiFi) or if I'm too lazy to start the VPN software. Even when I only had 802.11G at home, the only time I felt it wasn't enough was when Time Machine started doing huge backups (e.g. XCode app updated) over WiFi into the Mac mini's aggregated hard disks. If you really need ethernet, there are Thunderbolt and USB adapters.
