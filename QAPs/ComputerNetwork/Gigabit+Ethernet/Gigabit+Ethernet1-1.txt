â˜…What is the best gigabit ethernet switch?
Whats the best car? Whats the best Holiday? Asking what is the best switch is a difficult question, with different people having different criteria. The online magazine "Network Computing" recently posed this question (see Picking The Right Switch: A Buyer's Decision Tree - Network Computing), and several criteria were mentioned Routing Requirements Port speed and Types Performance Requirements Environmental's and Physical Support Manageability Finally, I would personally add cost. What can you get for the budget you're willing to spend? On a personal note; I would be looking for a switch that provided 'Light' Layer three capability, ability to stack, 10GbE uplinks, wirespeed, shallow with low power draw, Lifetime warranty, simple easy management.
