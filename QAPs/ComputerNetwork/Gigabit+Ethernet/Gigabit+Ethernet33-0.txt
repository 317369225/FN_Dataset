â˜…Is a plugged-in internet connection faster than a WiFi internet connection?
Yes, its half duplex. A wired connection is full duplex. Two way communication at wire speed at the same time. Both sides can talk and listen at the same time Wireless connections are half duplex. Alternating one way communication at wireless speed. You talk, I listen; I talk, you listen. However, that may change. http://sing.stanford.edu/fulldup...
