â˜…Should I buy the new 13.3" MacBook Air w/ 128 GB for $1299 or a regular MacBook for $999?I'm replacing my laptop/primary computer and was going to go with the MacBook. With the new MacBook Air, is it worth the upspend?
i support the MACBOOK PRO. It has many advantages also it can be more reliable and durable than air.Air is meant for pure browsing, mail and photos. Using a PRO you can do more than that.My only advice is dont go for anything more than 15.5" it will not be portable.
