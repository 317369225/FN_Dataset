â˜…Is there a portable thunderbolt to gigabit ethernet adaptor suitable for use with a MacBook Air?Yes, I know about the 27" LCD/LED monitor. That's not portable. Looking for a dongle that goes in a laptop bag. Universal Serial Bus (USB)-based Ethernet just sucks.
Unfortunately I'm not aware of anything on the market like this yet. Thunderbolt peripherals are extremely scarce and mostly limited to external disk drives today (late 2011).
