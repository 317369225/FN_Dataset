â˜…Why does Bill C-51, the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act, now before the Parliament of Canada, not also strengthen and better finance judicial oversight in the Office of the Commissioner of Communications Security Establishment Canada?Or does it?
Because that would add accountability, ethics and morals. This bill is meant to quash political , economic and environmental dissent. I feel as if terrorism is only 10% of the reasoning behind this bill. The rest is all about getting rid of those who oppose this government.
