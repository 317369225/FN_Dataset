★Are Viber calls encrypted?
As you can read in "Viber communication security": For Viber we can conclude it uses some kind of encryption but what kind of encryption is unclear. We have found some exploits as could be read in chapter 3.4. We can at least conclude that messages are not send in plaintext over the internet. However the Viber database is still unencrypted and easy accessible as could be read in chapter 3.1. We are confident we could have found more if we had more time for reverse engineering Viber, what we have found concerning this can be read in chapters 3.2 & 3.3. But for now we have to conclude that ‘the scrambled is still scrambled’. More in: https://www.os3.nl/2011-2012/stu...
