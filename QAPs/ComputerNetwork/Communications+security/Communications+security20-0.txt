★What kind of technology a hotel is supposed to have in terms of security, communication and relaxation?
I'm a perpetual hotel guest; I have never "run" an hotel.  I am also an old man.  That's perspective for my one word answer to all questions that begin "What technology should a hotel..."   My answer is "transparent".    I'm reasonably tech-savvy and deal with tech extensively in my job both directly and as a traveler reliant on technology for communications and connectivity, security and storage/information portability.    For me, that's enough.  I don't care to be surrounded by it in my hotel/home.  I know it needs to be there, but don't make it a necessary part of my life.    That said, I'll take a kiosk over a marginally trained front desk person, especially if it reduces my wait time.  And I do want Wi-Fi access from time to time, even if it is slow or I need to pay for it.  Hotel business centers (computer, scanner, printer) are fine; bonus if they also have a shredder.    But as a guest, what the hotel needs/uses shouldn't be part of my life.    One footnote: The facial recognition technology and social network scanning that hotels use to recognize and profile me are offensive and absolutely ensure I will not return to a hotel.
