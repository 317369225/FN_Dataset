★World War II: How did the Germans not know that the British cracked Enigma?
The short answer is that it was a combination of 3 things: The British had totally co-opted the German spy rings operating within the UK.  Literally every agent the Germans had in the UK was actually a double agent. See Double-Cross System: "After the war it was discovered that all the agents Germany sent to Britain had given themselves up or had been captured with the possible exception of one who committed suicide" (emphasis mine) The British carefully rationed how often they would use the information, and disguised both the source and their actions, to not tip their hand. Even the word 'ULTRA' was itself disguised, the decrypts were said to come from a source code-named 'BONIFACE', "implying that it was acquired from a well placed agent in Berlin" (see Ultra). Additionally, they used the 'Double-Cross' system referenced above to feed the Germans disinformation that the British had invented a next-generation sonar system. The Bletchley workers kept their lips zipped tightly shut, for 30 years - Churchill called them " the geese that laid the golden eggs and never cackled". So far as is known, there was only one attempt by Bletchley employees to leak information, and that one succeeded -- but it was to the Russians (see John Cairncross), and was of 'Tunny' decrypts, not Enigma. (Digression: The recent movie The Imitation Game (2014) has it that Cairncross' leaking (a) was of Enigma (b) was discovered by Turing,  and (c) was itself a double-cross operation run by the British. None of this is true. Cairncross was not discovered as a spy until 1951, "after MI5 found papers in Guy Burgess's flat with a handwritten note from him, after Burgess's flight to Moscow").
