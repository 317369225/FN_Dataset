â˜…World War II: How did the Germans not know that the British cracked Enigma?
Other answers to this question have not highlighted the "cover story" tactic to a sufficient degree. Enigma derived information was almost never used unless there was a plausible alternative source to which the Germans could ascribe the accurate allied intelligence. Otherwise I agree with the other posts.
