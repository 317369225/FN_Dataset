★In the public key cryptography, what is the number of keys required for secure communication between n parties ?Please give specific answers, Expertise needed!
As others have correctly said, you nee one long term key per party. That is, each of the n parties will have their one public/private key pair. This is one of the major reasons why public key encryption is so valuable. Without public keys, you would need n(n-1)/2 keys. ## Wrinkles ### Keys for CAs If you wish to include a separate certification authority (some entity that does some sort of identity check on the n parties, and signs each of their keys), then you will need a key for the certification authority. ### Short term keys The actual communication between any pair of parties will be encrypted  with a "session" key. These are short term keys that are  randomly generated as needed. The software takes care of all of this and these keys don't need to be retained or managed.
