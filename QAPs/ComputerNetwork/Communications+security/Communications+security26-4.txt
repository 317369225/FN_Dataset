â˜…What specialities within Electrical engineering have the most future growth potential?
We are living in a time where ALL areas of electrical & computer engineering are seeing massive growth; and will continue to do so for at least the next 20 years. You get to choose! If you like multiple specialities, try looking at the industry you might want to work in. Also, have you looked at alternative energy in depth? I am told it is more of a mechanical/chemical engineering play than anything else.
