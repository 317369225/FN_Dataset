â˜…What specialities within Electrical engineering have the most future growth potential?
Here are some special applications of electrical engineering that are likely to grow quickly and find applications in the renewable energy industry. Low-power wireless communication systems for sensors (Internet of Things). MEMS design and manufacturing process for sensors and power generation (nano-scale energy harvesting). Printed and plastic-substrate electronics for low-cost mass produced devices, like photovoltaic panels. Solid-state power electronics for smart-grid and distributed energy storage. There are also other areas that will continue to have a high demand for electrical engineering talent. Embedded device development for mobile applications. RF/analog and microwave engineering for communications systems and GPS. ASIC design (VHDL/Verilog). Semiconductor fabrication process. Mixed-signal circuit design (board and IC). We will also see new technologies make their way from the quantum physics world into the realm of practical electrical design.
