★World War II: How did the Germans not know that the British cracked Enigma?
To add to Ken Fishkin's excellent answer, the Enigma cypher was not being used properly in the field.    The operators were supposed to use a new 3 letter key each day.   These were to be chosen randomly.    Operators often used simply 'AAA' or 'ZZZ'. Every now and then, an operator was ordered to transmit garbage text in order to confound code breakers.    At least one operator simply transmitted "LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL....". This actually gave away a lot of information to crackers. German culture is known for its bureaucratic formality, so many communications began with the same heading addressing the commanding officer. Certain messages were sent, identically, through both enigma and other less sophisticated cyphers.   All of these errors opened the door a bit wider to cracking the code. Had Enigma been used properly throughout the war, it probably never would have been cracked.   The Germans thought it was being used properly.   Hence their confidence in it. (I often refer to this as a perfect example of : it's not enough to give orders, one must tell the person why they must do it that way.   Had these operators been told, "Do it this way or else the Allies might crack the code and it'll be your fault.   Have fun explaining that to Hitler.", I doubt these errors would have occurred.)
