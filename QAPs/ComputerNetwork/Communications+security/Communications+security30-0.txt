â˜…How secure is quantum communication?
The point here is that you can't listen to quantum channel undetected, and you have only one shot at decoding it. With classic channel what you can do is just cut it, copy the signal, and send it back to the wire. You can play with this signal as long as you want, you can also keep listening and accumulating data forever. With quantum channel, you can not copy the signal. When you intercept it, you destroy it and the communicating parties will immediately know that there is a hack going on. Since breaking the quantum code is not easy and would require lots of sample data, when these guys stop communicating immediately, you are stuck with one short piece of encoded message. And you've got only one shot at probing it, since quantum measurements are destructive. Very frustrating experience in comparison with classic communication hacking...
