â˜…What were the reasons for the failure of American intelligence at Pearl Harbor?How could American intelligence not be able to detect such a massive Japanese flotilla coming towards Pearl Harbor? How were the Japanese able to fool one of the world's military powers and launch a surprise attack?
There was an awareness of an impending attack by US naval intelligence. Code breakers did not know the location of the attack nor the exact date. The Philippines were thought to be the most likely target. How could they sneak up on Hawaii? In 1941 there were no satellites, Aircraft ranges were limited, and Radar was in its infancy. The ocean is incredibly vast, so once a ship, or even a fleet of ships leave sight of land, they pretty much disappeared. In those days it was kind of easy to sneak around at sea. Even submarine patrols stuck to known shipping lanes and choke points because it was really hard to find a ship on the open ocean.
