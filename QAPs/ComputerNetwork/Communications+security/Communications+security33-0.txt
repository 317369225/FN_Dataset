★Does Canada have a spy agency?CIA, MI-6, MOSSAD, FSB may get all the attention on TV, but does Canada have an intelligence agency?
The CSIS (Canadian Secret Intelligence Service) <non sequitur - I love that my Canadians put secret in the title : ) > http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/ Historically it was a branch of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (sort of a nation wide "State Police")  in 1984 (which is a great year to start)  it was decided we should have a separate agency. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can... "CSIS was created on June 21, 1984 by an Act of Parliament passed as a consequence of the McDonald Commission." "CSIS is neither a police agency nor is it a part of the military. As an intelligence agency, the primary role of CSIS is not law enforcement. Investigation of criminal activity is left to the RCMP and local (provincial, regional or city) police agencies. CSIS, like counterparts such as the United Kingdom Security Service (MI5) and the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), is a civilian agency."
