â˜…Why do we say that optical communication is more secure than copper?
The security is meant as interference resistance. In optical fibres signals are transmitted as light signal inside a greatly protected by multiple layers being core, cladding, buffer,etc. Not only this protection reduces the chances of data corruption but also the fact that unlike other signals, in fiber optics, signal is in the form of light and thus other electrical disturbances outside the fiber cannot effect the light beam inside. Whereas in normal copper conductors, the electromagnetic interference (EMI) is there which can induce some voltage and hence current in the wires thus corrupting the signal. To prevent this various electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) techniques are used like grounding or shielding, but both signal being electrical in nature is difficult to completely eradicate such interferences.
