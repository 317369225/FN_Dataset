â˜…If one were to create a secret society nationwide in the post-Snowden era, how would one achieve successful and secure communications and activities?consider the breadth of surveillance you would be working against: CCTV, Satellite, PRISM, drone, COINTELPRO shills, Mind Control, RFID, remote on/off mic+camera, GPS, see-through walls.
The same way that secret societies operate now and that they have almost always operated: Create small cell-like structures with only one person in each structure knowing others outside of their cell. Communicating almost exclusively in person and eschewing carrying or using electronic devices. Constantly maintaining high levels of group and communications security. Constantly employing counter-surveillance techniques against possible infiltrators. Keeping your core group small and carefully vetting any new members. Making new members prove their loyalty before they are excepted into the inner circle. Most of these types of groups will operate below the collective law enforcement and intelligence agency radars and will difficult if not impossible to penetrate.
