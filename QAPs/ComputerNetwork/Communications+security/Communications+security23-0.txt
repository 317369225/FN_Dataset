★I´m building a enterprise application and I need to create a secure communication between android and a server. What is the most secure way to do End-to-End communication? Should I use HTTPS or VPN?There are better options?
I would recommend deciding this on the basis of device type: Will the android devices be corporate devices (i.e the company is buying these devices for employees to use internally)? Or are these devices personal devices (BYOD)? Corporate - I would recommend using VPN. Personal - I would recommend using HTTPS For corporate devices, enterprises generally will have a MDM (Mobile Device Management) solution in house which would enroll devices. Generally as part of enrollment process a certificate is also installed on these devices. This certificate is then used for VPN connection setup. You can use HTTPS on top of VPN if you want to add an additional layer of security. If these devices are personal devices then using HTTPS is a good option for securing communication. 1 way SSL would be a better option to secure access since provisioning of individual device certificates may be a costly and troublesome affair.
