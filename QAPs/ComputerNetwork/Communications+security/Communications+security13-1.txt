So, Shamir's secret sharing might be useful for a construction like this. So, Shamir secret sharing use the fact that for a polynomial of degree , we can use sampling of , points to reconstruct the polynomial. So, for instance, say that we have a secret given by a private EC key, which can be encoded as an integer, call this . Then choose integer coefficients randomly such that we have the polynomial . Then we choose sample points of this equation to share with everybody, which, since this is a univariate equation, is concretely , such that is a solution. Using this with a public/private key scheme, it would be simple to use Shamir secret sharing to obscure the secret (the secret/private key) among a group of people. More over, if we have a polynomial of degree , from the people, we only need people to determine the secret, however, everyone has a unique secret sample. How effective this is, especially toward the application you want, I don't know. However, it does allow a secret to be shared  in maybe a useful way.
