★What is the most  private and secure way to communicate nowadays if there is any?How can you avoid electronic and physical surveillance?
Sure the best way to stay secure on the Internet is to not use it. But we can't live like that, we should fight for the Internet and our human rights to be upheld when we use it. A good first step would be getting some browser encryption software and a secure email address.
