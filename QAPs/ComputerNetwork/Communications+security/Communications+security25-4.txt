★World War II: How did the Germans not know that the British cracked Enigma?
I’d say the largest contributor to this was a spy called Garbo whom the Germans knew as Arabe and real name was Joan Pujol Garcia. This guy was immense, he remains the only documented spy who chose to be a spy of his own free will. To explain, he started spying on the Germans without instruction from any country, he started spreading misinformation just because he didn’t like the Germans. He then went to the British and asked could he become a spy, they initially rejected him but when he singlehandedly managed to stop the bombardment of Gibraltar for a day he was then brought under the British wing. Following that he set up a fake network of non-existent spies, all paid for by Hitler, who sent reams of fake info back to the Germans which was used as a smokescreen to hide the fact the enigma code had been cracked. He even informed the Germans that the D-day landings were a diversion to the real landings further up the French coast. He mixed up all the fake information fed to the Germans with some real information to give his reports credence. Genius. He is also the only person to have received the Iron Cross from Hitler for services to the Germans (which were all fake) and an OBE from the Queen, presented by Prince Phillip, for services to the British.
