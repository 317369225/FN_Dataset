â˜…What encryption method is used to secure communication between key fob and car?
I believe it sends out a unique identifier code for your car (programmed at a dealer) and random code. Sorry I can't find an actual authoritative source that describes how this works. But here's a rundown of what I learned before. (An implementation may differ between car models/manufactures) Here's some "simple" ideal situation. When you sync (for example when you insert your key to your car) your key fob with your car, it agrees with certain seed (let's call it S) It also pre-calculates some pseudo random number. (In case you are not familiar with a pseudo random number, it's basically the statistical random number. It generates the same sequence of numbers if the seed is common -- it's hard to predict the number if you don't know the seed, but if you know, it's very easy to derive one.) When you press your key fob, it calculates and send out first of pseudo random number derived from the seed. If the car "hears" it then it'll unlock for you. So what happens if you happened to press the key fob, say, in a restaurant and the car didn't hear that? Well, the your car pre-calculated some set of pseudo random number -- so it is also made to react to one of those codes. So if your key fobs happen to generate a pseudo random number, let's say 5th down in the list, your car will still unlock the door for you. Now, of course, if you keep pressing the button so many times while your car can't hear that, then eventually your car won't recognize code generated by your key fob. In this case, you will have to manually unlock the door, which at this time, will re-sync your car with sync with your key fob again.
