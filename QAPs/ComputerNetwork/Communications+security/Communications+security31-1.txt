★What were the reasons for the failure of American intelligence at Pearl Harbor?How could American intelligence not be able to detect such a massive Japanese flotilla coming towards Pearl Harbor? How were the Japanese able to fool one of the world's military powers and launch a surprise attack?
All the answers are correct and detailed specifically about the lack of intelligence (Steve Lynch) But for me the bottom line was it wasn't war yet It may be difficult to remember that in the 30s especially the late 30s, a lot of United States of America was very isolationist and how it wanted to deal with the world Yes it was concerned about Japan went so far as oil embargoes But the  United States was not on a war footing, it did not have a national war attitude, and there was  very little reason to believe that Hawaii was in any danger All of which meant that even if there was good intelligence, or some conspiratorially suggest, Roosevelt and senior officers knew there would be some kind of plan Getting over the inertia of isolation and certainly not wanting to get involved in a major war, made them reluctant to believe that there would be any attack As evidence, worth noting that the Air Force officer in charge placed the planes together to avoid sabotage, which made a very poor decision in terms of an aerial attack
