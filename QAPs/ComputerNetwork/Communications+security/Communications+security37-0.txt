â˜…What are some good IT security resources on Near Field Communications (NFC)?Particularly with using NFC for payments applications, what are the risks and best practice security measures? Links to good free publications and research papers appreciated for my Instapaper list for this Winter, books on Kindle also good.
The security of NFC payments will rely on the security of the underlying platforms it uses: the existing contactless payment standards, as defined by the Visa/Mastercard/Amex/Discover, the EMV, the Global Platform and the Java Card specifications and best practices. The payment processors and payment card issuers perform their own risk management. Good starting point on the security and risk management of contactless payments: http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/workshops... Many details of the technical specifications are publicly available: http://www.emvco.com/ http://www.globalplatform.org/ http://www.oracle.com/technetwor...
