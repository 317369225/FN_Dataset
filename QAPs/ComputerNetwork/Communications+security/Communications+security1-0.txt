★Diplomacy and Diplomats: Can a Head of State just call another directly? How are calling parties verified? How is communication secured?How many steps and intermediary are involved in call? Do all/some heads have directline to each other? How is it verified that person on both end is genuine?
In the pre-cellphone era, the White House switchboard was notorious for its ability to quickly find anyone the President wanted to talk to. They rousted  people from dinner parties, sports events, illicit assignations, you name it. Today most people, including world leaders, have secure cellphones, which either they or their body men carry. Either the White House switchboard or the State Department will have all those numbers for countries with which the US has diplomatic relations, and are no more than one degree of separation from the others. I would add that it's not as if they are calling each other all the time. Most calls are going to be scheduled in advance through staff and probably won't be one-on-one.
