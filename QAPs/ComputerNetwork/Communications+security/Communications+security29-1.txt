★What is the most  private and secure way to communicate nowadays if there is any?How can you avoid electronic and physical surveillance?
Face to face in a remote location, with all electronics turned off and batteries removed, and left in another room. If you have the resources, construct a Faraday cage and have several noisy fans blowing. At a distance, via text, use openPGP to encrypt text for email, or the OTR pidgin plugin for IM conversations. For the above recommendation, run them in a dedicated VM, preferably of a different operating system. Once the communication is finished, delete the VM and zero it out (overwrite the disk locations with zeroes several times). Ask your partner to do the same. Alternatively, run the VM from an encrypted TrueCrypt drive, then delete the drive and forget the key.
