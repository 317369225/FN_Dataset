★World War II: How did the Germans not know that the British cracked Enigma?
Many excellent answers, but one that seems to have been missed is that the Bletchley code breakers were a very mixed lot of weird people Hitler made a point of getting rid of weird people, so his own code breakers  were not of the same mix and quality as the allies Hitler did not believe in using German women on war work The Bletchley Park project had around 8000 women working on it It also had a many German Jews   working as interpreters Hitler apparantly had seven separate code breaking units, and these were actually rivals, so not efficient The Germans did in fact crack British codes, but Hitler didn't commonly act on advice, and his staff were wary of giving him bad news anyway The German mindset of belief in machines was part of the problem Because they listed and marked everything the Russians were able to calculate how many tanks the Germans had by noting the serial numbers on the tanks they destroyed Regarding codes, Konrad Zuse designed a computer that wuld have been better than the Enigma machine. The Germans had better machines than the Allies but did not use them to the best effect The Germans also used radar for attack rather than defence as the British did. This was because at the early stages of the war Germany had no reason to assume it would be bombed. They did use defensive radar bombing started So though their radar was as good or better than the British, it did not serve the same purpose inittially, and they actually stopped bombing radar stations and switched to bombing London. One of the big mistakes of Hitler The allies used deception on many levels, actually creating the illusion of a fake Suez canal at one time. Building fake waterpipes in the desert to fool Rommel that the british were going to attack from a different standpoint Building a complete fake army and putting Patton in charge prior to D-day Having a dead man deliver fake documents about the invasion of Sicily Not all these tricks fooled the Germans. There is a story that dummy aircraft on British airfields in the early part of the war were easily identified and the Germans jokingly dropped wooden fake bombs on them
