â˜…In the public key cryptography, what is the number of keys required for secure communication between n parties ?Please give specific answers, Expertise needed!
each party will need: their own private and public key pair (2 keys) and 1 other party public key per other party. So 2 (public + private key pair) + (n-1) other parties (here its assumed that you are included in the number n parties). For a grand total of n+1 keys required for n parties (where you are part of the n parties). As seen from the one party view (the total amount of keys needing to be generated is 2*n [one public/private key pair per party]) If it is you + n other parties, the number is n+2. relevant link Symmetric Encryption vs Public Key Encryption *edited for readability + link
