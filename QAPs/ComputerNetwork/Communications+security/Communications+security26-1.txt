â˜…What specialities within Electrical engineering have the most future growth potential?
Power Engineering is extremely in-demand. A lot of the older, wise engineers are retiring from the industry and the power grid is running on seriously out-dated hardware that can only be improved upon. There will be lots of opportunity to "make a difference" and do work that is important and relevant on a global scale. And, with this important fact, you will always be needed and well-compensated.
