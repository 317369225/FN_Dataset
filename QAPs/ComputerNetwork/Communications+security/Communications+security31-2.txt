â˜…What were the reasons for the failure of American intelligence at Pearl Harbor?How could American intelligence not be able to detect such a massive Japanese flotilla coming towards Pearl Harbor? How were the Japanese able to fool one of the world's military powers and launch a surprise attack?
The US did not have an intelligence agency at the time of Pearl Harbor. There was no agency to coordinate the very primitive efforts of the State Department with the various military branches. The OSS, CIA, and NSA were yet to be. The British Intelligence service had worldwide experience in code-breaking, counter-intelligence, dirty tricks, deception, disinformation, and just killing people who got in their way. The Americans did not have the legal basis or know-how or coordination to do this. They learned it from the British. If you take the existing US intelligence agencies, not 1 millionth of that existed in 1941. The information available to a civilian today is greater than what the US President knew in 1941.There were no satellites, spy-planes, Google Earth. Not even good telephone service world-wide. I think Tora-Tora is the most realistic depiction. There were no professional intelligence officers working around the clock. You had to get the fragmented messages to high officials who were playing golf.
