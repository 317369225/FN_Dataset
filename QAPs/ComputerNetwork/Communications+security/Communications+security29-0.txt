★What is the most  private and secure way to communicate nowadays if there is any?How can you avoid electronic and physical surveillance?
In my past experience, the most secure forms of communication were: A letter sent through the US mail. An overnight package with an a.m. delivery from either FedEx or UPS. The a.m. delivery is important as it gives anyone attempting to open the package very limited time to do as such. A call made from one previously unused cell phone to another previously unused cell phone.
