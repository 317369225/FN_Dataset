â˜…Does Canada have a spy agency?CIA, MI-6, MOSSAD, FSB may get all the attention on TV, but does Canada have an intelligence agency?
There are two primary civilian agencies. CSIS is the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. Their roles and responsibilities are similar to the CIA but they do run operations on Canadian soil. CSIS was formed because of a series of illegal activities perpetrated by the RCMP. See the McDonald Commission report for more info on that. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McD... The CSE is the Canadan Security Establishment which operates in a similar way to the NSA. They are more involved in corporate communications security than the NSA is.
