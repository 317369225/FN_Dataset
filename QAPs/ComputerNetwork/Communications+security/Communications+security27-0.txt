★What and how does one prepare notes from the editorials of The Hindu for the CSE?
Just jot down keywords and phrases and throw away the newspaper. Write the summary in your own words. The 4 D’s: Don’t copy, cut & paste articles. This will makes notes large & cumbersome. Don’t subscribe to any other general newspapers. Don’t subscribe to any other financial newspapers. Don’t make huge notes, just take note of major key-phrases, words, facts and articles. Editorials: Use the bookmarking tool of your internet browser to bookmark the articles you find important. Focus on three major regions, which will come across on left & center of page. If not sure where they are, just read all & pay attention to those that contain; 1. Mixture of optimism & pessimism 2. Constructive Criticism. 3. Redressal mechanism. Leave out comment section but look out for any keywords in editorial. If any are found being used widely, pay attention to that article. Watch this video by me to get a more precise idea: Pay attention to keywords. This includes India development like electoral reforms, demographic dividends, judicial reforms, poverty, corruption, governance, trade, transport, communication, security, environment & ecology like global warming, climate change, biodiversity, pollution. Geography keywords include any recent disaster, tsunami, monsoon, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, drought etc. Analysis of new schemes & policies of government e.g bills, projects.
