★Is there any deterrent measures against cellular communication sniffing to secure your phone conversations and data?
I'm not sure I can think of anything realistic. Cellphone communications are encrypted with pretty decent crypto so your average eavesdroper won't be able to listen in. But by law, all cellular comunications (voice and data) are logged and can be intercepted: the capability is always there and the opertor or any authorised agency can definitely listen Maybe an app would help, but I don't know how much you'd trust it.  It would too easy for that app to be fake, or for the smartphone to send a cleartext copy too. The only thing that seems secure is to encrypt your message offline (on a trusted, air-walled computer) and then manually copy type the encrypted text into an email or SMS and send it. Then do the same at the other end in reverse. That is going to be pretty slow & laborious
