★Diplomacy and Diplomats: Can a Head of State just call another directly? How are calling parties verified? How is communication secured?How many steps and intermediary are involved in call? Do all/some heads have directline to each other? How is it verified that person on both end is genuine?
Yes, from the U.S. perspective. The State Department Operations Center (Ops Center) has the capability to reach out to basically any Head of State, as well as other relevant officials like Foreign Ministers, Defense Ministers, leaders of important NGOs and international organizations, Permanent Representatives to IOs, etc.  I cannot go into details about how the system works, other than that it is located in a SCIF and allows for secure communications.  There is an excellent documentary on the Ops Center available online (I think on Netflix?) that shows some of how the system works. More typically, such a call is arranged with both nation's protocol offices, so that it doesn't just come out of the blue. Since typically you're going to want other people than just the HoS present for the call (subject matter experts, possibly translators, intelligence officials, etc.) these things very rarely happen on a spur of the moment basis.
