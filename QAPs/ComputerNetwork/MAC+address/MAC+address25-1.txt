★What are Apple's plan's regarding MAC Address broadcasting?Today, most smart-phones ping for wi-fi hotspots as part of their location fix process. In doing so, their MAC address becomes public and retailers / hotspot providers can use this to ID a device and redirect the browser. Is it true that Apple is trying to obscure the MAC address broadcast for privacy reasons?
I don't see how they can. Broadcasting MAC addresses is fundamental to MAC learning and peer discovery. It is not possible to eliminate broadcast and have ethernet work. Discovering/attaching to a WAP is not a function of ping (which is a layer 3 application). It is a function of Ethernet (layer 2), and that is started with a broadcast ether-type on the LAN (wired or wireless). And in order to switch an Ethernet frame, you need a MAC address.    Embed Quote
