★How come the MAC address of my NIC is NULL (all zeros)?
It is not usual for the NIC to show all zeroes in MAC. It seems that there are some driver issues, and hence, I would suggest you to look into that first. MAC spoofing is a completely different aspect. If the main hardware itself malfunctions, spoofing is useless.    Embed Quote
