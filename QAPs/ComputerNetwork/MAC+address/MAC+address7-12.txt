★Why is there a MAC address and an IP address?
I love to answer in layman so I'll go in that way. MAC Address is your identity (like DNA or Social Security Number). It is permanent or hardwired into device. While IP Address is similar to your residential Address, it will change with your network. Now if you are asking why there is IP Address. Like if you want to recieve letters or parcels or anything else you must have some address so that things get delivered to correct place. Similar is the case of IP Address. If you want the data to be delivered to you properly you need IP address. To make you understand the need of MAC Address I need to go somewhat technical. Suppose you shifted to  a different building. You need a room to shift to new building. A Room will be assigned to you and entry will go into manager's book listing your ID and your Room No. Now you can recieve anything to your new address. Similar is the MAC Address. If you join a network, an IP Address (Room No.) is assigned to you and the IP Address Assigner (Manager) or DHCP Server adds an entry of your MAC Address and corresponding IP Address to its table of connected devices. After you got your identity you can easily receive any data. I hope that clears the air.    Embed Quote
