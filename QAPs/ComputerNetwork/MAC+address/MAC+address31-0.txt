★Can a stolen router be traced from its MAC address?We have a problem in an NGO where some body has stolen the router from the administration office.
Generally not.  The MAC address is the "Media Access Control" address, which is only used and visible on the local medium (Ethernet, WiFi, etc).  You can't really talk about "THE" MAC address of a router, since each independent layer 2 interface will it's own unique MAC address. In general, each interface has a unique MAC address.  If this is a consumer router, there are typically 3 MAC addresses: The LAN, the WAN and the Wireless (The 4 ports of the LAN are a switch tied to the "LAN" side of the router) If the thief uses IPv6 without privacy addressing enabled, the MAC address will be embedded in the IPv6 address using this technique: IPv6 Interface Identifiers and Physical Address Mapping.  You can traceroute to the WAN address of the device and work with the ISP if it spoke IPv6 AND they didn't pick a different address (which is really the more typical way IPv6 routers are deployed) If you know the wireless MAC address, you can presumably drive around and look for the beacons from that SSID.  You would have to have some idea where the router got to in order for that tactic to be useful.  Any WiFi scanner should show the MAC address of the wireless router broadcasting an SSID. But for the most part, you're just out of luck.    Embed Quote
