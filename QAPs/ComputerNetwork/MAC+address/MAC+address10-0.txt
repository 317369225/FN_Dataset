★What can I learn about a device from its MAC address alone?
Possibly the manufacturer of the computer system, if the Ethernet or Wi-Fi (really, any 802.3 device) interface is built-in to the motherboard (i.e. not an add-in PCI Express card), and if the Operating System software didn't change the MAC Address either because the administrator wanted to, or because some protocols (e.g. Novell Netware, based in the Xerox Network System (XNS) protocol suite) require that. Absent all of that, Ethernet MAC Address Organizationally unique identifier (OUI) are assigned by the IEEE as part of the management of 802.3.    Embed Quote
