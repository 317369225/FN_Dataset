★Why is the IP address used for routing of packets and not MAC addresses?MAC addresses are abundant and unique for every device.
You need it because, without IP addressing its very difficult to manage large networks. Its not possible to create a logical sub-segment just using MAC address. Creating Logical substructure in the network is easier using IP address. IP addressing also helps in reducing the size of routing tables, otherwise routers have to maintain an entry for every possible mac address! Beyond this, in user prespective its much easier to remember and administer IP address than a MAC address. We can assign IP addresss with same subnet mask to machines with similar purpose on the other hand MAC addresses are unique to hardware and cannot be changed.    Embed Quote
