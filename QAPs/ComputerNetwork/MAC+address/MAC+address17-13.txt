★When a MAC address itself is unique, why do we still need an IP address to uniquely identify a system on a network?
MAC is L2, IP is L3.  You must have a unique address for both in the domain for both.  MAC doesn't need to be globally unique, just un-repeated for a single collision domain.  There have been manufacturers who were too cheap to buy enough MACs, and did MAC re-use.  The expected that the chance two cards would end up on the same network would be so small such that they'd get away with it.  However, they assumed "random" and two identical MACs in order were disproportionately likely to end up at the same place (somebody buying 2+ at the same time), so there were MAC collisions.  MAC must be unique in the collision domain (the local network).  IP must be unique in the universe (of addressable objects).  You don't need an IP if you aren't going WAN. NetBEUI/NetBIOS would be good enough if you weren't leaving your LAN.  So no, you don't need an IP to address a computer on a network.  But over the Internet, you need to know two things, where you are going, and how to get there.  The IP gives you both. Though, as a user, you only know the IP, as your ISP handles the where.  MACs are distributed (relatively, as we learned above) randomly.  That would make routing to them on diverse networks impossible.  But IPs are hierarchical, sort of.  So the IP will, along with a routing table, not only tell you where you are going, but how to get there.  If you want to use you MAC, you can.  But you'll be using it in IPv6, where there are enough bits to do that.  Then you can call the first part the "network prefix" and the last part the MAC, and together, they will identify the device uniquely with MAC, and the network uniquely to get your data there.    Embed Quote
