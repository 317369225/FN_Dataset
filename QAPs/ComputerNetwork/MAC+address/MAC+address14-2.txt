★(If) IP is an unique address of a host, then why is MAC address required?When IP can uniquely identify a host on a network, isn't then the MAC address redundant and an overhead?
I would love to answer this question, Not all IP addresses are unique for a host. In-order to understand this clearly, I will have to explain a little about IP addressing version 4. There are two groups for IP addresses: 1. Public IP addresses which are unique. We need to purchase this type of IP address from Regional Internet Registry (RIR). ISPs purchase there IPs from RIR and they sell it to organisations. 2. Private IP addresses which can be used by anyone inside the local network.     private addresses does not need to be purchased. The IP address present in your phone,laptop or Ipad is all a private ip address configured by the ISP through DHCP. Your packet will not travel in the Internet (Public network) if it has a private IP address. So, what actually happens once the packet reaches your ISP, they convert it into Public IP address using the concept of Network Address translation (NAT). Its another big concept which is one of my fav topics.    Now coming to MAC (Media Access Control) address. its true that MAC is unique for a host, its burnt on the Hardware part called NIC. Why do we need MAC ? MAC is layer 2 address. IP address are systematic where as MAC addresses are random for computer present in a local network. IP address helps in routing the packet in the networks and when the packet reached the switch, it uses the MAC address to identify to which port should it forward the packet. There by correctly delivering the packet to its destination. There are many more technicalities involved with the value of (src and dest) MAC address.    Embed Quote
