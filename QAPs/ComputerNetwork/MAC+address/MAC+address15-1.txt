★What is the difference between an IP address, Mac address and gateway address?
Ip Address An Ip address or Internet Protocol adress is the address assigned to your mobile,printer or computer by the network that uses Internet protocol for communication . Your IP can change with the change in network.IP addresses are divided into classes . A,B,C,D,E mostly we use class B and D If you want to find your IP address open command prompt windows->type cmd or windows->run->cmd and enter ipconfig on windows or ifconfig in our linux or mac terminal  you will find your IP4 and IP6 address . class ​ Mac address is your machine address . This address will never change . It is the unique machine address given to your device . Your device will have communication with the local area network or any network using this address . Once you use the network your mac adress is tored in the network table so that network does not have to search your mac address again and again and shortest path towards it will be stored in routing table . That's why never feel that no one willl come to know if you use your neighbours wifi, remeber that router stores everything,  it's a smart and intelligent gateway Gatway address is the address from which packets will be sent to your network.Your device will have a communication with network and network will communicate with its own gateway address .All packets will be sent and received through this gateway. Routers can act as a gateway or simple switches i.e non intelligent device can also act as a gateway .    Embed Quote
