★What is a MAC address?
MAC or Media/Medium Access Control is a unique number assigned to every electronic devices that can communicate amongst each other. MAC works in the Link Layer of the Seven Layer OSI-ISO Model. It is made up of 48-bit Hexadecimal number that is globally unique unlike the IP Address. . Companies usually "buy" a set of MAC Addresses which are later used in their products, this helps in avoiding duplicate MAC Address and keeps it unique. In order to effectively communicate between any two arbitrary devices, both MAC and IP Address are required to pin-point the exact location of that device. Consider that IP Address is like your name - which is not unique (we usually come to know while creating email account right?) and the MAC address is like your postal address. So, if I want to send you a letter, along with your full name, I'll need your postal address in order to send you a letter.    Embed Quote
