★Do Bluetooth devices have a persistent  ID (like a MAC address)?If they do - would it be possible to use it to build systems to track people's attendance, say, at work, or at school, using their mobile phone's Bluetooth? And would this be possible without those people choosing to pair their device? If the above is possible, does it present a privacy risk?
They do have a hardware id that you can find while performing an inquiry with another Bluetooth device.  However, the ID can only be found if the device you are searching for is set to "discoverable."  And if devices are left in discoverable mode, it does present a security risk. You might recall that Paris Hilton had all her phone's pictures and contacts stolen a few years ago. To do what you are alluding to, you would need to pair the device once.  Once you have the ID, you can search for the presence of the device, by it's ID. My company does some stuff like this if you want to check out an example of what's possible (http://www.oldersibling.com)    Embed Quote
