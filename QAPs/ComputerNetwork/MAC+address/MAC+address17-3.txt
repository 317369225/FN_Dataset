★When a MAC address itself is unique, why do we still need an IP address to uniquely identify a system on a network?
Some networks don't use MAC addresses, at least not in the 48 bit format that you may be used to.  Mobile phones, for example, have a 15 decimal digit IMEI (International Mobile Station Equipment Identity).  The data networking equipment for cellular networks is designed to use the IMEI the same way an Ethernet or WiFi network uses a MAC.  A phone with WiFi capability will have both an IMEI and a MAC, but it can only use the IMEI for cellular data networking, and the MAC for WiFi networking. Imagine if we were to get rid of IP addresses. In order for an Ethernet device to address packets to a phone, it would have to be able to find out the phone's IMEI and set it as the address in a packet.  That means that a useful name service replacement for DNS would have to be able to answer requests by sending back data in either MAC or IMEI format, and that all sending and receiving devices between our Ethernet device and the phone would have to be able to handle addresses in packets using either format. All the routers would have to be able to understand and figure out what to do with addresses in either format - which would be highly problematic given that neither MAC nor IMEI provides any guidance as to where and in what network the device is connected to.  And, of course, there would be more than just these two address formats to handle, too, in worldwide networking. The point is that IP is the lingua franca. Every network type takes responsibility for managing routing of IPs internally to a router that is able to resolve that IP to a phyiscal address - whether it's MAC, IMEI, or something else. Those physical addresses never have to be known to any other network, and that is a huge advantage.    Embed Quote
