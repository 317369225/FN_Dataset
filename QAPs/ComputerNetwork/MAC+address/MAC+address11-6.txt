★Why are MAC addresses unique when they are supposed to be used within a LAN? Are MAC addresses transmitted across the Internet also?
MAC address are supposed to be unique because it helps in identifying the device within and outside the LAN. Whenever a switch broadcasts packets to all the ports of the switch, the packet reaches the destination port based on the MAC address only (Address Resolution Protocol). So MAC address should be unique. MAC addresses are transmitted over the internet also for the same reason only. The TCP/IP protocol is encapsulated within the Ethernet protocol containing the MAC address. The ISPs hardware will strip out the Ethernet protocol when it has done with it. The modem will also strip the Ethernet protocol from incoming packets before sending it to the router. The Router will then apply NAT re-encapsulate it sends it to the switch sends it to the necessary device. All a MAC address does is identify a particular network device, in the case of an ISP, your modem. They are unique because if you had two NICs in the same network with the same MAC address it you would have severe problems. People have enough problems with duplicate IP addresses on a network. Imagine the problems with duplicate MAC addresses as well.    Embed Quote
