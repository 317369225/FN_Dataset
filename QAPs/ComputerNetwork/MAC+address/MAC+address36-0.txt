★How can I get ipv6 neighbour mac address using netlink?netlink socket
If I'm interpreting your question correctly, I believe you are looking for rtnetlink. http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pa... From the man page... rtnetlink, NETLINK_ROUTE - Linux IPv4 routing socket Rtnetlink allows the kernel's routing tables to be read and altered.  It is used within the kernel to communicate between various subsystems, though this usage is not documented here, and for communication with user-space programs. Network routes, IP addresses, link parameters, neighbor setups, queueing disciplines, traffic classes and packet classifiers may all be controlled through NETLINK_ROUTE sockets.  It is based on net link messages.    Embed Quote
