★Why is there a MAC address and an IP address?
Suppose From a subnet used by some people someone send some abusing messages to  someone. Its difficult to track him as in a Subnet Everyone will have same IP. Thier MAC Address comes into picture, As it is Unique.(MAC Address is more reliable way of finding the sender & receiver) If you just bought Your Laptop(or moved to some new place) and connected it to some network. How do you think you will get a IP address to your Laptop. During that time MAC address comes into picture. DHCP servers use the MAC address to identify your device(Laptop) and give some IP address. Suppose your IP Address is hijacked by some person, still he will be blocked because he will not have your MAC address. If you are using Intranet(LAN) in your collage,How do you think the speed is high because Switches and Hubs uses MAC address. PS:Without IP address there is no concept of Networking.      But, Without MAC address their is no concept of Uniqueness.    Embed Quote
