★What's is the difference between port number and Mac address?
A MAC address is like the the "Social Security Number" (if you live in the US) or an ID number for a human being, except that this applies worldwide. No TWO MAC Addresses should be the same in the entire world. The use of it is basically to address where information comes from and goes to on networks, something like an IP address, but at a different communication layer. A port number is used at a higher layer of communication, primarily to differentiate between the "Types" of communication that is happening. For example, you open a web browser, and have skype running at the same time; http web browsing starts a "session" to the server's Port no. 80, while skype will start a different "session" towards skype's servers with a different destination port number. Each different application or program you are concurrently running will have a different source and destination port from your computer/device to the servers on the internet hosting each service. If you want to find out more information it's recommended you read up on the 7 OSI layers and Data Communications =)    Embed Quote
