★How long until we run out of MAC addresses?
I'm less sanguine than other answers here. First, the OUI space is definitely finite and is effectively doomed. While some OUIs could be recycled, this can only be done at non-zero risk. Second, the MAC address space is being abused by virtualization. Every time someone creates a VM, it consumes a MAC address. The software is reasonably clever about creating a non-conflicting address, but over time, this is going to create problems. VM companies are going to need to consume vast swaths of MAC address space by periodically changing their OUI. I do expect that we'll see a gradual transition to EUI-64, but that's years off for now.    Embed Quote
