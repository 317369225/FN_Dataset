★When a MAC address itself is unique, why do we still need an IP address to uniquely identify a system on a network?
One thing that hasn't been mentioned explicitly before is that the Internet Protocol can be transported over a variety of media, using different technologies. A MAC address is usually used on media, which are shared by a number of devices, like the Ethernet based equipment nearly everybody uses nowadays, which uses the 6-byte MAC addresses. I worked for a company in the '90s, where we had a Telebit Netblazer router with a number of modems attached to telephone lines. The traveling salesmen had a modem attached to their PC. When they dialled into the office using the telephone network, their PC and the router used PPP or SLIP to transport the IP packets. PPP is a Point-to-Point connection without a MAC address. Our ISP connection used the same technology, we would dial into our ISP using a modem and PPP. I ported an IP over X.25 protocol stack to SCO Unix a number of years back. X.25 is a public packet switching network; over one line you can have multiple data streams. For IP over X.25 you would configure an X.25 address (simplified: a telephone number) for an IP network or sub-net or for a specific IP address. If data was sent to an IP address that was reachable over X.25, the router would establish a connection to that destination and then send the IP packets on that connection.    Embed Quote
