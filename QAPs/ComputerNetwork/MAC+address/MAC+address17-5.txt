★When a MAC address itself is unique, why do we still need an IP address to uniquely identify a system on a network?
An alternate analogy would be as follows:  A MAC Address is like a car's VIN (Vehicle Identification Number).  It does uniquely point to a vehicle on the road, pretty much around the world.  However, each state has their own License Plate Issuing policy.  The State License Plate is like IP Addressing schemes.  If all cars are sold only in one state, there is no need for two different schemes, VIN vs. License Plate.  But, because, the vehicle moves across states, and could carry multiple license plates (i.e., authorized by two different states), it is better to leave out the VIN Number out of the game.   Similar to this, the top reasons that I could think of as to why you would need IP address schemes in addition to  the MAC Address Schemes: 1. A single machine could participate in multiple networks (say for example, Home private Network, Home connected Internet, and Work Network through VPN).  Each require different routing and privileges. 2. Private Networks vs. Public networks: With the addition of IP Address Scheme, one could never expose a MAC address to the world, yet be able to connect to the Internet, through NATs etc. 3. Security: And therefore, from #2, a MAC address, which is how two networked computers talk to each other, would never be exposed to outside world in any form, yet be able to do network transactions. 4. And of course few more, such as management, portability etc.    Embed Quote
