★Can a stolen router be traced from its MAC address?We have a problem in an NGO where some body has stolen the router from the administration office.
I'm assuming this is a WiFi Router and you know the MAC address. The real world answer is - forget about the router and move on. The geeky way to do this which would take someone skilled to implement this is - 1) Drive around with a wireless sniffer installed on a laptop near the house of any one you suspect has stolen the Router. You'd be able to capture logs of all Wifi transactions. You can search through these logs to see if the MAC address shows up in any of the logs. 2) Do a look up on services like Skyhook and Google which let you detect your location given a list of MAC IDs you see around you. You may have to search for some code to do this or write your own code. The other issue with this is that these companies get this data by driving a car around to collect data just like I suggest you do in point 1. This is obviously happening infrequently and it might be months before the new location shows up on these services.    Embed Quote
