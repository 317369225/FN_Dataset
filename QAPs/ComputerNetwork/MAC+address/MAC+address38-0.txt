★How do I programatically change a MAC address or send Ethernet dataframes with a different source MAC address?
Assuming Windows, it's a function of your network card driver.  I've had some that allow you to put in the MAC, right on the Controller Properties page, Advanced tab.  Others don't allow that.  Times I've needed that function, and didn't have it, I tracked down alternate drivers.  Programs that set the MAC often come with "special" drivers.  Promiscuous mode is not included in all drivers, and other features.  The easiest way would be to look up your networking card chipset and "change MAC" and see the results.  The results are dependent on the specific network card. This applies to wired Ethernet and wireless Ethernet.    Embed Quote
