★Why is there a MAC address and an IP address?
Some may say that the MAC address (in an Ethernet interface) and the IP address exist or co-exist because of historic reasons. MAC is the hardware address, is the ID of the Ethernet board. It is wise to mention that this used to be unique per manufacturer and per board...it is not necessarily that case nowadays, specially because of virtual MAC addresses (eg in Linux and in Virtual Machine environments). The IP address also identifies a hardware port in the network, but bear in mind that IP address is unique and belongs to the TCP/IP suite of protocols. Let me give you a SIMPLIFIED example, which I think will serve well why we need and there are those two address present in a network architecture. Again, this is a VERY Simplified example: Now, take TCP/IP address out of the picture and instead install another network protocol...for the sake of this example say X.25...  then you would NOT have the IP address,  but instead would have a NUA (network user address), which would look like 0208057040540  (I put this number as an example, but it actually represents or used to represent a very specific host).   So, now we have the MAC address still there, but there is no IP address, but a NUA.    Now take X.25 and install, lets say a Novel network  or  a legacy IBM type of architecture, all  based on the Ethernet LAN hardware,   but the software layer and the actual software addressing is much different now. Hope this answers  your question.    Embed Quote
