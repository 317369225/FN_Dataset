★Why is the IP address used for routing of packets and not MAC addresses?MAC addresses are abundant and unique for every device.
Because MAC addresses are historically designed to be flat but IP addresses have structure. That is, IP addresses are assigned in blocks and because of that you can wild-card forwarding rules. For example, if I know all 1.1.0.0 - 1.1.255.255 are in your network attached to port 1 of my router, I can simply install only one rule that says forward all packets to 1.1.*.* to port 1: 1
 (dst_ip & 0xFFFF0000) = 1.1.0.0 ==> forward to port 1. On the other hand, MAC addresses are mostly assigned by manufacturers. If I buy 10 servers from different manufacturers (or even the same manufacturer) I'll get random mac addresses and for each of them I need a separate route entry: 1

 dst_mac = 10:10:10:10:10:10 ==> forward to port 1 dst_mac = 20:20:20:20:20:20 ==> forward to port 1 .... dst_mac = F0:F0:F0:F0:F0:F0 ==> forward to port 1 This won't scale! just imagine the routing table size of a backbone router that uses flat addressing. NOTE 1: The same happens with IP if you cannot wild card addresses. (This happens in today's Internet when they advertise routes for a single ip address) NOTE 2: Nothing prevents you from using MAC addresses for routing in your own network. PortLand for example uses pseudo structural MAC addresses for routing inside a large-scale data center: http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~vahdat/p...    Embed Quote
