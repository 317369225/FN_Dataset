★What is difference between IPv4, IPv6, and MAC address of a device?
A MAC address is a 48-bit number burned into ROM on the device that should provide a globally unique identifier.  In extreme circumstances, it can be overridden, but this is rare.  This provides interface identification within the L2 (originally Ethernet) network. An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number that is either statically configured or learned via protocols such as DHCP or PPP.  It provides both a handle for routing and an identifier for L3 and higher. An IPv6 address is a 128-bit number, similar to the IPv4 address, but with a few more bits, most of which will never be used properly.    Embed Quote
