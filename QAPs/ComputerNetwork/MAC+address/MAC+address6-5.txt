★What's is the difference between port number and Mac address?
They are two very different things. The port number is used by you host operating system to identify the application using the connection and mainly used in the Transport Layer. It is logical and has no real physical implementation. There are a few port numbers reserved that are used by applications globally to communicate. For example port 80 is used by the servers to take in requests for HTTP pages. You browser ( for simplicity lets talk of one tab only ) can initiate this connection from any random but unreserved port to the server ( lets say 43142 ). Now when your computer makes the request, it tells the server ( located using IP address ) to transfer it to port 80. The server knows the user is requesting a HTTP page and responds accordingly. Now when it responds, it tell the packet to deliver at the requested host IP and specific port that requested it ( 43142 ). This way when your OS receives it, it knows which program ( browser/tab ) needs the data. The MAC address is the address of your hardware (network interface like wlan, Ethernet). This is assigned by the hardware manufacturer and stored on the hardware in the ROM. This address is used by the Network layer which is responsible for transferring packets from one node to another. All the routing and forwarding magic happens here. It is possible to spoof the MAC address.    Embed Quote
