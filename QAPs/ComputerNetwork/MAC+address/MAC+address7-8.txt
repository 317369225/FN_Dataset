★Why is there a MAC address and an IP address?
IP address is a logical address to distinguish each device on a network . It works in layer 3 (network layer) while mac is physical address of nic working in layer 2(Data link layer) of osi model. we have these reasons to use ip addresses over mac address- 1.IP address have classes mac doesn't.(not easy to divide a block in case of mac address) 2.There are pools of private ip addresses while it has nothing to do with mac addresses.(will be difficult to share internet connection with different departments in an organisation in case of mac address as it is not easy to divide the network into sub-networks , even problems will be faced in broadcasting a message) 3.if a device is replaced with another one we have to make changes into the configuration of the routers(if routers were too working on mac layer 2).    Embed Quote
