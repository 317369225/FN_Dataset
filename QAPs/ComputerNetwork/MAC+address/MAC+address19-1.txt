★Computer Hacking: Is it possible to change MAC address?If yes then how?
Yes that is very much possible and widely used for hacking purposes. I used to do it in college to hide my identity in case caught was lucky enough to be never caught. MAC spoofing is a technique for changing a factory-assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device. The MAC address is hard-coded on a network interface controller (NIC) and cannot be changed. However, there tools such as SMAC which can make an operating system believe that the NIC has the MAC address of a user's choosing. The process of masking a MAC address is known as MAC spoofing. Essentially, Mac spoofing entails changing a computer's identity, for good or for bad reasons, and it is relatively easy. You can find many good tutorial on net .
