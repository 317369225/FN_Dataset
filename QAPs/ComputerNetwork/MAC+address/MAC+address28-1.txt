★How can networks be protected against MAC address spoofing?This is a follow up to Anonymous' answer to What is the easiest way to gain access to Wi-Fi at Stanford for an extended period? In a network in which a user's MAC address is used as a factor in identification, how can impersonation be prevented?
IEEE 802.1x is probably your best peace of mind. It is relatively widely supported: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEE... Port security helps, but does not go quite as far. Static ARP entries don't help you if the attacker spoofs a MAC to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. Physical security is always the best security.    Embed Quote
