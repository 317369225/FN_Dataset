★Which is the best way to sync a Mac's address book with Google Apps Contacts?Many times, just synching with Mobile Me + Gmail (or Google Apps) creates quite a few of conflicts and or duplicates which escalate and grow. I've tried Sync Man, but it really removes quite a bit of information from the contact, and didn't keep some of the rich data that is in a vCard.
connex.io (I am a Co-Founder) has both support for Apple Address Book (through a plugin) and Google Contacts. Simply add both to your account and we will take care of the rest: Make all your contacts available on both ends and we even enrich your contacts with more info if you wish us to do so (based on your Social Network connections).    Embed Quote
