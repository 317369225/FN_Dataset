★Why are MAC addresses unique when they are supposed to be used within a LAN? Are MAC addresses transmitted across the Internet also?
Technically speaking, a same MAC address can be used in two different LAN with out any problem. However, the real problem comes when you connect both the devices with the same MAC in the same LAN. For this reason, vendors do not manufacture devices with same MAC address. How MAC addresses are unique ? MAC address is a 48-bit ID in the following format - hh:hh:hh:hh:hh:hh. Each "h" corresponds to a single "hexadecimal" number . One single digit hexadecimal number can be denoted using 4 bits. Thus, 12(number of "h"s) x 4 bits = 48 bits. This MAC address has got two parts - first three octets "hh:hh:hh":hh:hh:hh denote OUI - Organizationally unique identifier. And the last three octets denote "vendor specific ID". The OUI is unique for a vendor. For example, Cisco has "00-08-2F", Dell has "C8-1F-66" . When a vendor manufactures a device, he can only write his OUI in the device ROM memory. That is, Cisco cannot manufacture a device with MAC address having first three octet as "C8-1F-66".  To avoid the problem stated in first paragraph, vendors also make sure that the last three octets are unique across the devices that they manufacture. In this way, no two devices will be manufactured with same MAC address. Coming to the second part of your question - No !! MAC addresses of the end hosts communicating will not be transmitted across Internet. Communication across the end hosts is done using IP address.    Embed Quote
