★Why is there a MAC address and an IP address?
IP address is a network layer address. MAC address is the link layer address. The Internet is a network of networks. Each network could be following different link layer technologies, E.g. Ethernet, token ring, IEEE 802.11 or WiFI. And each will have different addressing mechanisms. Hence, in order to have an internetwork like the Internet where system A in an Ethernet can talk with system B in a different, distant token ring network, we need a common standard method of addressing and that is provided by the Internet Protocol. When a packet leaves from system A and needs to reach system B, the IP datagram would have system B's IP address, but the final Ethernet packet would have the MAC address of the nearest gateway on the same Ethernet. From there on, the IP datagram would get routed from network to network each time being encapsulated in that data link layer network's packet and MAC addressing.    Embed Quote
