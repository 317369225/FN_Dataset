★How do you change  your Network port's mac address using MAC address changer?This is a follow up to an answer on What's a good way to get started using Tor?
You generally don't need any third party tools to change your MAC address, and I'd be dubious of malware in any such tools. On Linux you can use ifconfig to change your MAC, you can schedule the command in rc.local to run on startup: ifconfig eth0 hw\ ether\ 00:11:22:33:44:55 On Windows systems it's generally under adapter properties for the NIC. The property name is also up to the driver, but the name is usually pretty obvious, i.e.  "Physical Address," "MAC Address," etc.    Embed Quote
