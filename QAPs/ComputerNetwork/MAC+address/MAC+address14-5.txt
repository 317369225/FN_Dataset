★(If) IP is an unique address of a host, then why is MAC address required?When IP can uniquely identify a host on a network, isn't then the MAC address redundant and an overhead?
understanding of network , subnetwork ,and division of the network cannot be done with mac address(48bit). It is the identification number of NIC. so mac address alone cannot be used as an entity in transmitting the data over the internet. As every company has its own representation of that number....hence new addressing system has designed By IANA known as ip address. Sometime 2 or more mac address define for the same system for fault torence. Also Ip address given by ISPs are dynamic in nature,so it would possible a state of having multiple mac address and multiple IP address of the same system.    Embed Quote
