★Why is there a MAC address and an IP address?
If we take the analogy of humans then we can say that MAC address is your name ( with the additional proviso that it is unique in the world ) whereas IP address is your residential address. You can have different addresses at different times but your name would always be the same. In a more technical viewpoint, MAC address is a  48 bit number which is embedded into your hardware device. Each interface, whether it is your Ethernet card or WiFi Card, that connects your device to the internet, will have a unique and fixed MAC address. IP address on the other hand is the address where your device is located in the network. IPv4 addresses are 32 bit long. It is used to route data to your device. It can be static for a device, i.e., every time your device connects to the network from the same connection, it will have the same IP address, or it can also be dynamically allocated using protocols such as DHCP. Another distinction between the two is, MAC address works at the link layer whereas IP address works at the network layer.    Embed Quote
