★When a MAC address itself is unique, why do we still need an IP address to uniquely identify a system on a network?
MAC addresses are organized based on a manufacturer code plus a number assigned from that space, effectively random. It contains NO information about where the system is, and how it is connected to the Internet. That makes it impossible to build a routing table other than a complete map that lists EVERY single MAC address ever seen. This is the equivalent of a completely flat, bridged network. From harsh experience, flat networks break down under the load of broadcast traffic somewhere under about 100,000 systems, even if you manage them carefully. That would constrain the growth of the Internet to where we were somewhere in the late '80s.    Embed Quote
