★When a MAC address itself is unique, why do we still need an IP address to uniquely identify a system on a network?
The same way as country name is unique, but just knowing country name is not enough. You still need a valid address to reach a person. Now, taking into account this analogy, consider you know MAC address (that is unique for each Network Interface Card), but you have no idea where that MAC address is present. The system might be in USA, Brazil, India, China or anywhere else. IP address can help you to reach that particular NIC as you can tell by seeing the IP address where a client is connected from.    Embed Quote
