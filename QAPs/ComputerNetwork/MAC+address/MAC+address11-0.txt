★Why are MAC addresses unique when they are supposed to be used within a LAN? Are MAC addresses transmitted across the Internet also?
MAC addresses were created to have a unique identifier for each network interface.  This is most important in your local network, but it is also important in any connections to external servers where two or more people from your local network may connect at the same time. Each network packet carries the MAC address as well as the IP address.  Many if not most facilities use Network Address Translation to create an internal network infrastructure that cannot be reached from the outside without specific intervention by the network administrators.  This makes a simple cheap kind of firewall keeping all outsiders out except for communications initiated from inside of the NAT address space.   Outside agents only see the external address and can only connect to the ports exposed by the Network Admin that connect to specifically hardened machines that are intended to extend a specific service to that port. However, this means that every computer inside of that network seems to be coming from the same address to any external server.  Chaos, if there wasn't a way to sort out who is who.   So, servers and security portals and pretty much every service is MAC address aware.  This becomes a substitute for IP address when handling requests and forming sessions.  And, in this way, a single server can have as many interactions with a single IP address as is necessary as long as each source has a unique MAC address. All MAC addresses are not unique in that applications such as Parallels allow you to assign a MAC address to a specific interface, but they are intended to be.  A duplicate MAC address in your network would cause a number of problems just like a duplicate IP address does.
