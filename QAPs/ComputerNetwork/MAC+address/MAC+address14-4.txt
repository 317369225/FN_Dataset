★(If) IP is an unique address of a host, then why is MAC address required?When IP can uniquely identify a host on a network, isn't then the MAC address redundant and an overhead?
Mac adress works at datalink layer and a device gets identified with the help of mac in LAN and even some devices such as hub and switch work with Mac address in layer2 of OSI model . Locally in Lan ur identified by mac with help of switch,hub and globally across subnet ur identified and routed according to ip address .When u receive packet from outside world both router and switch are involved and transmission between ip to mac done by arp protocol .Mac is a hardware address relating to device and ip is logical address.    Embed Quote
