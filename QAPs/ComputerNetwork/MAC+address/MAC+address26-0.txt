★How long until we run out of MAC addresses?
IEEE is well aware of the prospect of address exhaustion, and has written guidelines on EUI-48 and guidelines on CID and OUI allocation to ensure careful stewardship of the scarce and dwindling resource.  The target lifetime in 1980 was 100 years for the EUI-48 MAC address space but some predict it could be exhausted as soon as 2038.  See: We Could Run Out Of MAC Addresses In 25 Years. Unlike IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, the MAC addresses are not all seen at the same time in the same domain, so duplicate addresses go unnoticed unless they are on the same layer 2 network.  Further, one bit (half the address space) is dedicated to locally administered addresses, so the MAC equivalent of RFC1918 addresses can be deployed readily in an exhaustion scenario. There is also EUI-64, but FDDI is the only medium I have ever seen that used that format natively.    Embed Quote
