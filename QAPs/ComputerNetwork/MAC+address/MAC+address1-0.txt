★Will MAC Addresses ever be exhausted?
MAC address exhaustion is unlikely to ever be a problem. In the short term, 281 trillion addresses, even with a low fill rate, are a lot to work with. Even at 10% fill, that is 4k devices per person alive. In the long term, if we arrive at a situation where all of the shirt buttons of the average Indian peasant are individually networked, MAC address shortage is easily addressed: MAC addresses only need to be unique locally, on a given LAN, and they don't need any particular structure. At the point when we are out of three-bytes prefixes to assign or recycle, we switch to the following algorithm: Every device generates a random MAC on boot. Every device, when it detects MAC collision, switches to a randomly generated MAC. Note that the collision will hardly ever happen, since the average number of devices on a LAN needed for a collision is 2^24, or nearly 17 million (cf What is the birthday problem?). Having 17 million hosts on the same broadcast domain is a bad idea, since Address Resolution Protocol traffic will be too high.    Embed Quote
