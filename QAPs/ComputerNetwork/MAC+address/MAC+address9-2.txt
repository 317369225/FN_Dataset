★What replacement for UDID are iOS developers using—mac address, OpenUDID?As some time from now Apple might disable UDID usage in a future version of iOS (currently iOS 5.1), what are you guys using right now to prepare for that?
UDID is an old topic, but somewhat revived again with the recent IDFA-related rejections (more here Apple’s Latest Crackdown: Apps Pulling The Advertising Identifier, But Not Showing Ads, Are Being Rejected From App Store). And so, just like in the old days with OpenUDID, here is OpenIDFA (techcrunch also has a story on that: OpenIDFA, A Solution To IDFA-Related App Store Rejections, Debuts). What do you guys think?    Embed Quote
