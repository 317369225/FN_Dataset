★What is the difference between an IP address, Mac address and gateway address?
IP Address - This is your address to the world. Every connection to the Internet gets a unique address. this is like the address on your house. 123 Main St is unique. That's how they can deliver your mail to you. MAC address is a bit different. Every network device has a unique address assigned to it regardless if it's on the Internet or not. Your hardware manufacturer builds it into the device for reasons that I care not to get into. however I will point out that changing IP addresses DOES NOT MAKE YOU ANONYMOUS on the net because they can still grab your MAC if you don't spoof it. The DEFAULT GATEWAY address is the IP address of the computer/device that is between your computer and the Internet. At home, this is the IP address of your router (most likely 192.168.0.1). At work this is probably a computer setup to monitor/log your Internet activity and also defend against attacks.    Embed Quote
