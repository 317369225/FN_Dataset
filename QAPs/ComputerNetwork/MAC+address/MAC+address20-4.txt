★Which is the best way to sync a Mac's address book with Google Apps Contacts?Many times, just synching with Mobile Me + Gmail (or Google Apps) creates quite a few of conflicts and or duplicates which escalate and grow. I've tried Sync Man, but it really removes quite a bit of information from the contact, and didn't keep some of the rich data that is in a vCard.
Without question, having researched this extensively, the most foolproof method is Plaxo. I've been using it for 8 months to sync Google Apps for Bus, Outlook (7 and XP), iPhone and iPad on 9 computers/devices. Be prepared to pay about $60 per year for Syncing, plus more if you want a form of autoupdating peoples info called Personal Assistant    Embed Quote
