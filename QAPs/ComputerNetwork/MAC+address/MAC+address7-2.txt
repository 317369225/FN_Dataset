★Why is there a MAC address and an IP address?
Note: I am trying to give a generic example here because I am pretty sure many people have explained the technicalities in their answers. Let's say you are having trouble with your car and you wan't to send a mechanic to your address to inspect it and fix it or tow it. You give him your residence address. The mechanic finds his way to your residence using the address you gave him and finds 2 cars parked there. He calls you up and asks which car is it that you want him to fix and you give him the license plate. Analogy: Your residence address - This maybe a local public or private IP address (you have NAT like stuff to resolve the issues between public and private addresses). But, the mechanic wouldn't be able to reach the right location if you directly give him the car's license plate without the address of the location. Your car's license plate info - This would be your MAC address. The mechanic wouldn't be able to identify the unique car he has to fix among the many at a given location without it. Hope it helps!    Embed Quote
