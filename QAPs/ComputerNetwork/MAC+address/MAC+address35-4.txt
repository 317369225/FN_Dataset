★Why is the IP address used for routing of packets and not MAC addresses?MAC addresses are abundant and unique for every device.
1>IP is completely Logical thing wherein MAC is Physical. Now purpose of routing is to find out the Logical address of a device and once the Logical address is found then final data transmission happens on MAC. 2> IP address doesn't travels with you while MAC address does.
