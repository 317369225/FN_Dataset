★How long until we run out of MAC addresses?
I'm not that concerned about MAC address exhaustion.  There are still big chunks of the OUI space allocated to business that are no longer in the business of manufacturing Ethernet devices, or who do so at a volume far lower than the amount of OUI space allocated to them reasonably necessitates.  Eventually IEEE will have to start withdrawing some of these allocations. The fact that MAC addresses only need to be unique within the single broadcast domain in which they operate means that even if two devices have the same MAC (and I'd be quite unsurprised to learn at least one manufacturer has produced more than one device with the same MAC, even if only by mistake), for a conflict to occur, both of them would have to be live at the same time in the same broadcast domain.  The odds on that are pretty long, and in the unlikely case it arises in most cases the administrator can just override the hardware MAC with a locally assigned one, so this is really a much smaller problem than it may seem to be.    Embed Quote
