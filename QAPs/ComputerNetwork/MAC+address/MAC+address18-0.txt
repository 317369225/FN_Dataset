★How to find a persons MAC Address?
Lots of approaches depending on your network situation: If you are running a DHCP server, the DHCP request came in with the requestor's MAC address.  You just need to take note of it. If you have a MAC learning switch (following 802.1d), it is in your bridge table as soon as the 'person' connected (or passed a frame through). arp -a (in linux) or arp /a (in windows) will tell you the MACs of devices you have had an IP routed relationship with - so long as you are both on the same LAN ifconfig (in linux) or ipconfig (in windows) will tell you the MACs of the interfaces you have on your machine Flip the device over and lots of times it is written on the back / bottom near the NIC.    Embed Quote
