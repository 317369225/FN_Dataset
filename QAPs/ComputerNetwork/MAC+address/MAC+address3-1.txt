★Is a MAC address conflict possible?If so, what are the possible problems it brings and the solution?
It is possible. You can force it to occur on certain hardware which allows you to change the MAC address via software. The problems it causes depend on the hardware you are dealing with. A switch may get confused when it can't decide which port to send traffic down (It may send it down both, or just one... depends on the implementation) Wireless equipment would treat packets coming in as if they came from the same source. The solution is to not purposefully duplicate MAC addresses. If you encounter a situation where a manufacturer actually provisioned the same MAC address on two pieces of hardware, I would consult with the manufacturer on their error and get a replacement part.    Embed Quote
