★When a MAC address itself is unique, why do we still need an IP address to uniquely identify a system on a network?
IP address is used to bring sanity, a method in madness to the whole world where the MAC addresses are distributed world wide in almost a random way. It is well known that any system will work efficiently  if there is order. IP addressing brings this order and makes the system so efficient. If only MAC addresses are used, each router will have to hold billions of these addresses in their database for the look up.    Embed Quote
