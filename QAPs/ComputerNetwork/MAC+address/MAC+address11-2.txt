★Why are MAC addresses unique when they are supposed to be used within a LAN? Are MAC addresses transmitted across the Internet also?
Lets take an analogy , your house is the network , and you are one member of house (member of that network).Now whenever the post arrives at the house , how would it come to know to whom the post was supposed to be delivered to you ?? , its your name which helps in your identification in the house (Here It is the MAC address). Therefore , Yes the MAC addresses are need to be unique within the LAN and also they are transmitted across the internet too !! Hope It Helps !! :)    Embed Quote
