★How does Google keep its geolocation database updated with new MAC addresses?Previously Google used its fleet of Street View cars to gather locations of WiFi access points. However, according to their press release of May last year all WiFi equipment has been removed from these cars. Yet the updates continue. How?
We no longer collect any WiFi information through our Street View driving, but we do populate our location database through client software. For example, if a GPS-enabled mobile phone using Google's location services obtains a GPS fix, those precise GPS coordinates may be sent to Google's servers along with any WiFi and cellular data observed by the phone. Linking WiFi or cellular data with an accurate GPS reading helps us improve the accuracy of our location services, adapt to network changes (such as new cellular towers or relocated WiFi access points) and provide a better experience to people using our services. Client location-sharing is opt-in. Google provides users with notice and control over collection of location, sharing of location and use of location.    Embed Quote
