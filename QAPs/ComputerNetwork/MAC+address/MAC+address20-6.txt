★Which is the best way to sync a Mac's address book with Google Apps Contacts?Many times, just synching with Mobile Me + Gmail (or Google Apps) creates quite a few of conflicts and or duplicates which escalate and grow. I've tried Sync Man, but it really removes quite a bit of information from the contact, and didn't keep some of the rich data that is in a vCard.
I'm now trying Spanning Sync http://spanningsync.com/ It seems to work better than Sync Man, but leaves many blank entries.. just deduped by contacts and seeing if it makes a difference.    Embed Quote
