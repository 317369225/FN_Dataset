★How does Starbucks Wi-Fi grab my MAC address?When you log in to Wi-Fi at Starbucks, after accepting their terms, your browser is redirected to a page like http://starbucks.yahoo.com/?MacAddr=00:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx&... I wasn't prompted to run any Java applets or anything that should have that level of access to my system. How is this done using web technologies (HTML5, JavaScript, etc)?
Their wi-fi router knows your MAC address and assigns you an IP. The router is also responsible for redirecting you to the Starbucks site, and in the process of doing so, it adds your MAC address in the query string of the redirect.    Embed Quote
