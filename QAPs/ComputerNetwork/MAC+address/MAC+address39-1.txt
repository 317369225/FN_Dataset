★What does it mean if an endpoint on Wireshark has a MAC address prefix ExtremeN which only communicates with another MAC address prefix Extreme-EDP?I understand ExtremeNetworks makes networking equipment and EDP is a protocol. I just don't understand how a "protocol" could have a mac address?
EDP is how Extreme devices discover each other on the network, among other things.   It's not that the EDP protocol itself has a MAC address, but rather that the protocol, which works at layer 2, will communicate from MAC to MAC.  In addition, it will often carry MAC addresses as part of the communication payload.
