★When a MAC address itself is unique, why do we still need an IP address to uniquely identify a system on a network?
One might argue that the Internet could be designed to revolve around  MAC address. Why wasn't it done so? Since  MAC address of every computer is unique, it makes sense that one might  be able to send a packet to the desired computer with its unique MAC  address as destination address. Why wasn't it designed that way? In  other words, why was there a need for another address. Other answers seem to have not pointed out why we need IP addressing in the first place( except, I think, Tony Li's answer). The below reasoning might make it more clear to you. With just MAC addresses, one can not logically group a set of computers. Is multicast or broadcast communication possible with just MAC addresses? No. With  IP addresses I can send a multicast message to all addresses with  beginning with ,say, 10.124.56. Cannot do this with just MAC addresses. In other words, MAC addresses do not allow logical grouping of devices. Therefore, a need for a different addressing. With  only MAC addresses, a router will need to have entries for every MAC.  There could be tens of thousands of devices. With logical grouping of  computers, a router can reduce the number of entries in its routing  table. This is not possible with just MAC. (As rightly pointed out by Tony Li) With  this reasoning, it might make sense to think of why IP addresses are  called 'logical addresses' and MAC addresses are called 'Physical  addresses'. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
