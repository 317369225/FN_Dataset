★Which is the best way to sync a Mac's address book with Google Apps Contacts?Many times, just synching with Mobile Me + Gmail (or Google Apps) creates quite a few of conflicts and or duplicates which escalate and grow. I've tried Sync Man, but it really removes quite a bit of information from the contact, and didn't keep some of the rich data that is in a vCard.
The problem with duplicates is often syncing with two different services (iCloud + Google Sync + Soocial + Plaxo etc) or an import/export that goes wrong ie importing tons of duplicates. The hard-earned advice I have is to create one master address book by importing everything there, deduping it (if on google contacts use the "merge" function, or scrubbly), temporarily deleting the other address books (desktop/mobile) and then using a single sync platform and syncing everywhere.  My personal choice is google sync.  Watch out when you're setting up a new device, especially an iPhone as they will often ask you if you want to use a sync service ie iCloud and if you click yes, you could be creating another conflict/loop which can lead to duplicates or worse. I've laid out my hard earned-advice here and how I cleaned up all the contacts on my iPhone, and I must say it was the best 30 minutes I've ever spent productivity, tech-wise!    Embed Quote
