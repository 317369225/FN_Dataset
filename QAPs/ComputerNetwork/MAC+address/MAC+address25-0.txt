★What are Apple's plan's regarding MAC Address broadcasting?Today, most smart-phones ping for wi-fi hotspots as part of their location fix process. In doing so, their MAC address becomes public and retailers / hotspot providers can use this to ID a device and redirect the browser. Is it true that Apple is trying to obscure the MAC address broadcast for privacy reasons?
Apple (company) is very unlikely to stop transmitting MAC Addresses in Wi-Fi or Ethernet because they're required for those Local Area Networks to work (operate) ... at all. See also Address Resolution Protocol. If you want privacy while using someone else's Wi-Fi Access Points, use an encrypted VPN to a network you trust (either your own, or a trustworthy ISP).    Embed Quote
