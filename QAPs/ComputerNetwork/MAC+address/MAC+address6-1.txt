★What's is the difference between port number and Mac address?
MAC address is a way of identifying a host from all others on internet. It is specific to the network adaptor that you have. Each adaptor has a unique MAC address. Suppose some host sends a message to host B. In its way to host B, the message came to host C. Host C checks if the message destination and its own MAC address are same. If they are same, since MAC addresses are unique, C knows that the message is directed to it and accepts the message. If addresses are not same, C doesn't accept the message. Port numbers come in to the scene after the message is accepted. Suppose, the message, somehow reached B. Also suppose that a browser, a Skype video call and SSH login session are going on in B. Now, B must have some mechanism to know where to direct the message to. This problem is solved by port numbers. Each process that requests network access is assigned a port number and all messages that are directed to that port (message also contain the information about the port number they are directed to) are handled to the corresponding process. So basically port numbers and MAC address are completely different things.    Embed Quote
