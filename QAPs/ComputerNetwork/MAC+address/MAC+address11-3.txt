★Why are MAC addresses unique when they are supposed to be used within a LAN? Are MAC addresses transmitted across the Internet also?
MAC Address has to be unique  because the network card can be present in any network or the device can be mobile. Why mac can't be allotted dynamically using some protocol like DHCP for IP? Its not possible because response from centralized leasee can't be routed to the requesting device without having any param to identify it. MAC address is the parameter right now. Either if every network admin takes the responsibility to assign a free mac to a device which connects to their network or network device manufacturers agree to give unique mac addresses, this identification will be a problem. The first solution will be a nightmare to any person. So second solution is picked    Embed Quote
