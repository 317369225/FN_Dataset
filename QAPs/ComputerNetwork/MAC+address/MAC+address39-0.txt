★What does it mean if an endpoint on Wireshark has a MAC address prefix ExtremeN which only communicates with another MAC address prefix Extreme-EDP?I understand ExtremeNetworks makes networking equipment and EDP is a protocol. I just don't understand how a "protocol" could have a mac address?
A typical trace from EDP - The Wireshark Wiki shows a destination address of 00:e0:2b:00:00:00.  This is clearly not a real address; it seems to be some form of multicast masquerading as a unicast. I found a presentation on the protocol at http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/... Referencing The Delay Tolerant Networking Endpoint Discovery Protocol    Embed Quote
