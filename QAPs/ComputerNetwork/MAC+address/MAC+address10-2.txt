★What can I learn about a device from its MAC address alone?
You forgot a very important thing, Geolocation. Yes, if we are talking about a device such as a wireless router or even your Iphone/android device, it is possible that your device's geolocation can be traced. This is mainly because Google street view cars and even Apple sends over your device's information to their servers which includes your device's mac address and Yes, your lat and lon. It is possible to use their API and extract the geolocation information that you want. Samy kamkar gave an awesome presentation on how to do this at Defcon 18 A link to his page can be found here mapping MAC addresses - samy kamkar If you are looking to trace your Apple device, check this out mapping cell phones - samy kamkar Not only Google and Apple, but there are many other companies that collect this information via wardriving and hence can later be taken advantage of extract this information. A  lot of third party tools have also come out after this talk like this feature in Shodan http://www.shodanhq.com/research... Ofcourse, Google responded ... http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_... It just changed their api so that a user will now have to provide a nearby mac address also along with his own mac address which reduces privacy concerns. But then again, Google isn't the only collecting this information, Microsoft, apple and a lot of other companies also collect this information. Overall, if you live in a well known place like Chicago, NYC etc where there are a lot of third-party companies doing wardriving,  it won't be tough to trace your mac address back to your geolocation. It would however be tough to trace down your mac address if you are sitting in a remote location in Africa. I hope this makes sense ! PS: You can always spoof your MAC address !    Embed Quote
