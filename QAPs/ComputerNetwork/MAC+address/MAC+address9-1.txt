★What replacement for UDID are iOS developers using—mac address, OpenUDID?As some time from now Apple might disable UDID usage in a future version of iOS (currently iOS 5.1), what are you guys using right now to prepare for that?
iOS provides CFUUID(https://developer.apple.com/libr...) which seems like a natural replacement. I would also seriously consider if the app has a real need for a client generated UUID. Many of the examples of UDID use I see seem inappropriate; using a device identifier as a session id, assuming device identifiers identify users, and so on.    Embed Quote
