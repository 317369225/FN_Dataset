★How long until we run out of MAC addresses?
A MAC address is usually expressed as 6 8-bit(48 bits) hexadecimal integers. This is a total of 48 bits, or 281,474,976,710,656 (281.5 trillion) distinct values. The first 24 bits usually pertain to the manufacturer. So that means that 16.7 million manufactuers could each produce 16.7 million devices. Even if Intel (or another large company) used up it's 16.7 million MACs, they could just get another 16.7 million I'm sure. Also MAC address can be recycled and changed in software, so there is no risk of running out of addresses, like there is with IPv4 addresses. MAC addresses do not need to be globally unique, just unique within a layer-2 address space, such as a single network. Considering the way IOT/IOE is purposing , every device might be connected with the internet and may/mayn't need mac address. In that case may be another 20 years or so . But since we are living in a smart world , people already have started thinking about it and there is a IETF draft on this draft-ieee-rac-oui-restructuring-00 - OUI Registry Restructuring    Embed Quote
