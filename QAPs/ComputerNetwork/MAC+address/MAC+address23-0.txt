★Can my Internet history be searched through its MAC address?
In general, no.  One of the early criticisms of IPv6 is that it embedded your MAC address in your device's IP address, thereby imprinting your unique identity in the logs of sites you visited. This issue was addressed with RFC 4941 privacy addressing, which randomizes and periodically changes your IPv6 address. As part of Google's Street View Mapping, Google collected the wireless MAC addresses of Access Points.  At BlackHat 2010, Sammy Kamkar showed how to take the that wireless MAC address and geolocation information and correlate it to a global IP address: http://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-... The MAC address of your endpoint is generally exposed only on the local link upon which it communicates, so unless there is some layer crossing exploit, it is hard to track.    Embed Quote
