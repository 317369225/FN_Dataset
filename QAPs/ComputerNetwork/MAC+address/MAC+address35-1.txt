★Why is the IP address used for routing of packets and not MAC addresses?MAC addresses are abundant and unique for every device.
Two basic reasons.  1) MAC address space is flat.. and flat routing tables would not scale for a world with 2^64 hosts. 2) MAC addresses are meant for Local Area and medium access resolution. Reusing them for routing would require the change of the *entire* world's software/network stack.    Embed Quote
