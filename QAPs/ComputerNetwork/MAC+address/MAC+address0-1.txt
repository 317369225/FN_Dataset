★What is a MAC address?
It is a number (or better: a sequence of numbers)  that identifies a physical device in a network. It works in the two lower layers of the OSI model (which are the Data Link Layer and the Physical Layer). It is meant to be unique in a (sub)network. MAC stands for Media Access Control, so it has to do with the devices' access to the transmission medium (that can be wire, radio waves, optical fiber, etc). To finish, one can make an analogy with the IP Address: it identifies a unique device in a network. The difference is that it operates in a more hardware-oriented level. Extra: the first 6 digits of a MAC  address usually have a special meaning: they may indicate the device's manufacturer; see a list of them: http://standards-oui.ieee.org/ou...    Embed Quote
