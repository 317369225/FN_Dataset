★When a MAC address itself is unique, why do we still need an IP address to uniquely identify a system on a network?
Because politics. You can't arbitrate, we live in an organized society. Internet Addresses (IP) are rented in large consecutive blocks to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. Just like domain names (.com), you have to buy them in bulk from ICANN if you're a domain name provider and have acquired the rights sell them. That's what godaddy does. edit because I was asked for arguments: If they had written the IP protocol differently, to prepend the MAC with a routing hint (16/24 bit IP), there would be feasible user arbitration, and every datacenter would need 1 IP. They decided to keep full control because politics.    Embed Quote
