★(If) IP is an unique address of a host, then why is MAC address required?When IP can uniquely identify a host on a network, isn't then the MAC address redundant and an overhead?
Long time back i asked the same question in Wikipedia support forum, i asked the question the other way around.., hope it helps ! Why Mac Address alone is not Sufficient ? why do we need IP Address ? As Mac Address is 48 bits why it can alone be used to address the internet , why we need IP ?     To make routing tractable. MAC addresses are assigned by equipment manufacturers and thenceforth remain static. The process of selling and distributing equipment essentially shuffles all the equipment around, so there's no pattern to them. The IP devices in your home, or in your street, have an essentially random salad of MAC addresses. Now when you send a packet out, it goes to your ISP's router. If routing was done by randomly-distributed MACs, each router in the world would need a comprehensive list of every IP enabled device, in order to know where to send the packet. Its routing table would look like this:         80:00:00:00:01 send_to_entanet         80:00:00:00:02 send_to_google         80:00:00:00:03 send_to_level3         80:00:00:00:04 send_to_bt         80:00:00:00:05 send_to_google         80:00:00:00:06 send_to_bt         80:00:00:00:07 send_to_cableandwireless     That whole table would be vast, with hundreds of millions of entries. And every time a dynamic node (a cellphone or a laptop, say) moved, you'd have to update every router in the world with the routing information. The internet would be clogged with vast updates for these massive routing tables. So that's not what is done - instead IPs are assigned, and those IPs are strongly correlated with the network toplogy. So a routing table can consist of ranges, and you can do all the work with a few tens or hundreds of entries. Such a table looks like:         71.30.0.0-71.33.255.255 send_to_entanet         71.34.0.0-71.40.255.255 send_to_level3     with each entry covering thousands, sometimes millions of addresses. Your scheme works fine on very small networks (indeed, that's how ethernet switches decide where to send packets on their local VLAN) but it doesn't scale [Edit : Courtesy : Anonymous ]    Embed Quote
