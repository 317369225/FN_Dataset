★What is your earliest memory of using the world wide web?
In the very early 1990s, I was actively using Gopher, and setting up Gopher servers.  In the fall of 1993, while visiting a girlfriend at the University of Iowa, I went to a lab in the university library - I think it was called the "Information Arcade" - that had NeXT workstations running Mosaic, and saw the web for the first time.  I didn't have any computer of my own at the time that was capable of running a graphical web browser, so for a few years, I had to make do with Lynx at home.  I created my first web pages in the fall of 1994.    Embed Quote
