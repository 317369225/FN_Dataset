★World Wide Web: How much does it cost to set up a very small home business website?
I depends who you ask, generally, you could easily do something with $1000 with semi professional, or you could do it cheaper if you have luck with one of these guys http://www.jobsfor10.com/user/ma... which have good feedback, or just to get it started (some of them are really talented) The other thing you could ocnsider is the "doing it yourself" WIX.com style. Let me know if I could elaborate some more.    Embed Quote
