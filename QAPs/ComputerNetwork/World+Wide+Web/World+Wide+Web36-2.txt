★What was the need to create the World Wide Web?I read somewhere that it was created for war or something. And I don't think that at that time there was any idea or need to create e-mails, or gain knowledge or see the latest technologies.
If they didn't created, where can you ask your doubts? If they didn't created WWW, where can you gain this much of knowledge for free? If they didn't, how can you find all the latest trends and technologies up to date? WWW is developed in order to connect the world! Lot of needs are satisfied due to WWW.. Ask google to know more..    Embed Quote
