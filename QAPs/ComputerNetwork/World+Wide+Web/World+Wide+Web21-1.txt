★World Wide Web: How much does it cost to set up a very small home business website?
Probably not as much as you think. If you buy your web hosting through HostMonster.com, you can pay as little as $5.95 per month (if you sign up for an entire year). I personally use HostMonster, and I've had very few issues with them. There are obviously a lot of web hosting companies (and they all probably have similar deals to this one), but this is the example I am most familiar with. The $5.95/month will cover both the domain name and the hosting. So, you would get your domain (example.com) along with the hosting (where you store your files) for the lifetime of your account. If you plan on selling items on your website, you may want to consider adding SSL support to your account. This will come at an extra price, but will provide reassurance to your customers that their transactions will be relatively safe.    Embed Quote
