★What is the difference between the Internet and the Web?
Yes, Internet is a global system of interconnected networks, where each network consist of nodes. A node can be computer, laptop, server, router, hub etc. Internet is an excellent system for transfer of information in fast, accurate, efficient and cheap manner. For this purpose Internet has many tools at it's disposal which we call protocols. Initially there was ftp used for receiving the data at the computers. Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 build prototypes of the Web technologies and called it "WWW" i.e. World Wide Web. WWW is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet. So surfing the internet become more easy and user friendly. You can access the information just by clicking it, instead of copying the url and getting to that website or using ftp to download the other file. WWW saved the day. The World Web is based on these technologies: HTML - Hypertext Markup Language HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Web servers and Web browsersInternet is a backbone which serves many purpose. WWW uses Internet for its proper functioning. Internet uses protocols like tcp/ip, dns servers, routing, telnet and other protocols so that you can see the WWW pages.    Embed Quote
