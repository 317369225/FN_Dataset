★World Wide Web: How much does it cost to set up a very small home business website?
The answer is probably free - about $300 per year. Both ends of the spectrum have their merits. I've used 'off the shelf' packages likes Weebly.com and while they do a job and appear to have flexibility the site nearly always ends up looking not quite right and a little 'home made'. Depending on your IT skills my recommendation is the following (and this is one of the cheapest routes). 1. Spend 3 hours learning about self hosted Wordpress platforms. 2. Use GoDaddy.com to register your site and host your wordpress website (GoDaddy have the most user friendly interface of all domain registrars) 3. Go to either Themeforest or Elegantthemes to choose a design for your site 4. Get writing! The cost to do this yourself will be $39 for the themes (one off), about $60 for GoDaddy to host the site per year compared with about $250 for an off the shelf annual fee. Alternatively login to Guru.com or Odesk and find a freelancers to do this for a fee - probably about $200 one off fee. If you have a very small business with no ecommerce (I..e shop to sell products) requirement I would recommend Tumblr as not only is it free, but it can host your own domain name and looks very professional. As a small business the most important aspect of your website should be to keep it up to date via blogging and Tumblr/wordpress are excellent platforms to use to do this. Lastly, just figure out what the site is for and then make a choice of what to do. If you need an ecommerce store don't be too cheap as it will look cheap and you won't sell anything. The beauty of the web is you can have a shopwindow that makes you look much bigger than you actually are.    Embed Quote
