★Will the world-wide-web every become a fad or perhaps will the traffic on the web drop?The number of new websites is dropping.  Fewer people are getting new domain names and hosting less and less.  main-qimg-5f83fe8b95ae0c158c50d1a51368d3a7 Is a chart showing the decline in interest in web hosting from google.  Perhaps the internet has reached it's end.
The graph don't represent anything. It purely logical for 'new' domain name to slow down due to the limited number of business out there. Not every business needs a website to operate and with social media offering business pages to allow them to connet to potential new clients virtually for free why would they go to the expence of operating a website.    Embed Quote
