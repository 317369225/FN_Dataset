★Why is the term "world wide web" no longer used?
To help your understanding of the internet, in the 1990s and early 2000's, or more specifically the Web 1.0 days, the internet was a different place. It's not the same as it was now. In the Web 1.0 days, we had no social networking, Yahoo! was the number 1 website, and we had MSN Encarta instead of Wikipedia. The whole basis of the internet was to create portals, like MSN and Yahoo!, and I don't mean blogs. To put it short, in the Web 1.0 days, we spent a lot of time clicking hyperlinks, going from site to site, page to page. (Two Yahoo/MSN sites count as two sites.) Nowadays in the Web 2.0 days, we spent our internet experience in mostly the same sites every day. Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Wikipedia. People don't surf the internet anymore. The world wide web basically means websites linked together by hyperlinks, and the way the internet is going, that isn't happening so much anymore.   In the Web 2.0 days, the internet is about user generated content, social networking, and web applications.   Websites are now being treat as their own environment, instead of being a part of the environment. To explain what I mean by environment, you might as well get the websites most internet users go on, and use IE9 to pin them to the taskbar, and treat them as applications. Why use Internet Explorer to surf the internet, if you have pinned websites on the taskbar? Websites are being treat as their own seperate entities especially on smartphones, where you open up "applications", that might as well be websites.   Most people who surf the internet are not computer literate. They access very few websites. Ask them how their internet usage has compared from how it is now, to how it was in the 1990s.   Here's an article you would like to read. www.wired.com/magazine/2010/08/ff_webrip/all/1    Embed Quote
