★What if the internet was never developed into the World Wide Web, and consequently the technology was never spread to the masses?Imagine history progressed from the early 1990's without the internet. What would be different?
The World Wide Web is just one application of the internet. Even without the World Wide Web, email, and then email with attachments, would have spread the technology to the masses. Had there been no internet at all, we would have invented something else in the time between then and now to fill the same needs.    Embed Quote
