★What was the greater creation: .com or the world wide web?
The www came before .com. .com is just commercialization of the net. But while www came first, and even though it is the foundation, commercialization had all of the power to evolve and grow it. So .com is my answer. But only in the light of the net being what it is today.    Embed Quote
