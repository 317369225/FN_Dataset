★Why is the term "world wide web" no longer used?
One thing I recently experienced, which has indicated for me, and let me know if I'm missing something, but the so called world wide web, isn't really world wide.  Sure the internet is everywhere, relatively, however, if you live in california and you have an account with a USA company (could be google) and you go to another country and try to get to your account, it is quite possible you won't be able to get there.  If the company has another basis in the UK, your URL/domain entry will be forwarded to the UK site -- and they don't know you.  So it seems that all of this time everyone has been drinking the Kool Aid of the WWW., it has never actually been so.  I believe the World Wide Web was the vision... but we're just not there, yet.    Embed Quote
