★Why isn't Tim Berners-Lee as rich as Bill Gates for inventing the World Wide Web?I mean come on! This is a platform that billion-dollar companies like Google and Facebook operate in.
He was working at CERN, a publicly-funded institution, so neither he nor CERN could patent or profit from it directly. Others tried, by selling the browser, like Netscape, but Bill Gates put the kibosh on that by giving away Internet Explorer.  Actually, paying you to use it with incentives like free entry in a lottery with each download.   That killed the market for browsers that you pay for.    Plus Netscape shot themselves in the head and foot several times by making bad business and technical decisions, time and again.    Embed Quote
