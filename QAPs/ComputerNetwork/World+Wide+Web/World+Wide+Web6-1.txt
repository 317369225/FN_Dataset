★Can you explain the difference between the Internet and World Wide Web?
The Internet is a network of interconnected computers.  Many different kinds of data are available for transfer over this network.  This includes data used for Skype voice over ip calls, peer-to-peer file sharing, and web pages. In contrast, the World Wide Web represents that portion of data available via the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and is intended to be rendered by web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Chrome.  The web in the name refers to the hyperlinks between pages connecting them together much like a haphazard spider's web. Because most people's only use of the internet is via their web browser, their perception of the two is one in the same.  The best way to separate the two concepts is to consider the World Wide Web as a large part, but not the entirety, of the the data that available on the the entire Internet.    Embed Quote
