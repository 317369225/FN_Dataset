★Can you explain the difference between the Internet and World Wide Web?
Look at it this way: if the Internet was Minneapolis, then the World Wide Web would be the Mall of America. The Mall itself is so huge and has so many things in it, but its not all there is in Minneapolis. There's the Sculpture garden, museums, and so much more. Similarly, you can browse web pages, download movies, listen to songs and so much more on the World Wide Web. But the Internet itself consists of a bunch of connected computers which contain all the content you see via the World Wide Web. Instant messaging, skyping and similar applications also happen over the internet, but are not part of the World Wide Web.    Embed Quote
