★Is the whole world wide web vulnerable to viruses if all hackers want it to be down?If in case all hackers' group engage, how many days would it take to almost nail the world wide web?
Everything is vulnerable all you need is to find that flaw. Yes! WWW is damn vulnerable but only if you create sucha virus that can break its security. Like 'I Love You' virus. Or Botnets (Zeus Botnets considered one of the most effective yet). If large organization like Anonymous, Lulz Sec etc combine together they can take down entire WWW in a day.    Embed Quote
