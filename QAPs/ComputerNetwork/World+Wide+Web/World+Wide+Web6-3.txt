★Can you explain the difference between the Internet and World Wide Web?
To simplify it, imagine all the hardware stuff is the Internet - cables, WiFi devices, routers, servers etc. This hardware should be interconnected to one large network. And the Web is something that is accessible thanks to all the connected hardware. It is similar to hardware and software on your computer. Hardware is all the physical stuff you can touch and software is all the virtual stuff you can run thanks to hardware. Similarly the Web is not the only service accessible over the Internet as windows is not the only operation system you can run on your computer. For example if you use torrents (I know you don't because it's bad and your computer will burn in hell in agony for eternity, but for this example assume you do), you download movie over the Internet, but you don't use the Web. You are simply just using another (torrent) service that is accessible thanks to Internet infrastructure. If there is any question just drop it in comments and I will try to answer it as simply as possible.    Embed Quote
