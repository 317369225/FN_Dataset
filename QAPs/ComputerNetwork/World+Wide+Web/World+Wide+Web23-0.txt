★What is the difference between the Internet and the Web?
The Internet predecessor ARPANET was envisioned for military purposes to create a network that is robust even in times of nuclear war. It's the result of a US Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) project and several people. The system to interconnect computers led to the later development of the Internet. The Internet is todays underlying infrastructure for the world-wide web. The WWW as intended by its inventor Tim Berners-Lee, who worked at that time for the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland, was his solution to let researchers all around the globe share their many documents and their broad knowledge via hyperlinks and hypertext easier over the Internet. He saw the potential and gave his invention away for free. The web as early envisioned by Tim Berners-Lee was a Read/Write Web, where everyone (similar to Quora/Wikipedia) can edit every hypertext document directly via web browser. The WWW is developed and standardized today by the W3C organization.    Embed Quote
