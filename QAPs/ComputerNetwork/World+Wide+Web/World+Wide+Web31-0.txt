★Are the World Wide Web and the Internet different? How?Who invented them?
The Internet is a system of  networks all over the globe, that are interconnected with each other. World Wide Web is one of the many services that operate over the  Internet, it is not the Net, though many use the terms interchangeably.  The Web is primarily a collection of text documents and other resources, that are connected using hyperlinks, URLs. These documents or resources usually lie on a web server and are accessed using web browsers as the client. While the Internet had it's origins in the ARPANET project, at UCLA, what we call as the World Wide Web, was the result of a proposal by Tim Berners Lee, at CERN, when he proposed using hypertext, to link and access information, as a web of nodes, which the user can browse.    Embed Quote
