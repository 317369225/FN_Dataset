★World Wide Web: What's the most important suffix to buy for a website domain?
.com is almost always the best, but if you can't get it, try being creative, for instance deli.cio.us OR about.me. The reason .com is most important is that most popular sites have .com TLDs, so users have come to expect that as pretty much the only possible suffix. I have been asked this a couple of times by my non-geek friends and family members: Why do I have to type '.com' all the time? Isn't that redundant? Same for the 'www' prefix.    Embed Quote
