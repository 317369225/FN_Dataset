★What is the difference between the Internet and the Web?
I like to describe to people that the "Web," as in World Wide Web, is a personality of the Internet. By that I mean a graphical user interface, or in common parlance, a browser-based approach to navigating the Internet. The Web became popular in the mid '90s with the advent of publicly available browsers like Mosaic, and later with Netscape, and Internet Explorer. The Internet, going back to the late '60s, was primarily accessed via command line or "curses" interfaces, available on Unix to the high priesthood who could speak Classical Geek. When you talk to most "users" today, they use the terms interchangeably. This is not strictly correct, but operationally, the majority of users access the Internet only via the Web.    Embed Quote
