★Are people worried about the growth of a closed network like Facebook vs. the open world wide web?
I wouldn't say people love Facebook. The subconscious act of logging in all the time, playing games and checking profiles is often addiction. I have always heard from friends whos spent hours on it, and wonder what they have done at the end of the day. They felt accomplished by the volume of photos viewed, messages replied and random articles read (mostly not helpful) but whether they have truly learnt with time well spent is debatable. I have many friends who saw that and deleted their account and never got back. While these are isolated incidents, it does show 2 sides of the argument for the product. I think the idea of a close versus open platform can be better explained by looking at IOS versus Android. While the former is addictive because people love ease of use, less transitions and variability in user experiences (not to mention blow ups), it often leads to situations where if the close system does not react fast enough to changes in preference and apps, people will get frustrated. We do see that now, for example people don't wish to want to use Itunes when they have less customized, and of course freemium platforms like Spotify for example. Open platforms are ultimately the way to go but will require significant effort to get out of the cycle. Life is ever-changing and an open system where people who discover broken systems will step in to serve the needs will be more helpful in the long run. Lastly, open systems offers variability and forces users to learn more and use more rather than stagnate. For commercial reasons, owners will always pursue a closed system. An open system forces one to constantly innovate and leaves you open to constant threats of new technology and/or substitutes.    Embed Quote
