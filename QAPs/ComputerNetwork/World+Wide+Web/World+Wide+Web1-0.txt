★What is www (world wide web) mean?why we put www on adress bar waht is use of it
Originally the idea was that the subdomain (the www part) indicated that was the web (HTTP) server for that domain.  You would also commonly have ftp.domain to allow people to access your information via that protocol (File Transfer Protocol).  A new subdomain has begun to spring up around the same idea for mobile devices.  You will frequently see mobi.domain or mobile.domain as a way to indicate to mobile users an interface designed for them. The www.domain was a convention back in the early days of the Internet and while we've long since outgrown it "www" is still comfortable for people so it remains.    Embed Quote
