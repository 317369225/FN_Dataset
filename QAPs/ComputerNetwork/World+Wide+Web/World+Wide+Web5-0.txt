★What caused the drastic decline in the size of Indexed World Wide Web during February 2013?
If you read closely, there is a note at the bottom of the site that says.. Note No countings have taken place for the following dates: 7th of July till the 7th of August 2006. 3th of October till the 16th of October 2007 (Only for The Index Web). 19th of January till the 30th of January 2008 (Only for The Dutch Web). 20th of March till the 1th of April 2008. 5th of May till the 14th of May 2010. 3th of April till the 13th of April 2012. 11th of July till the 29th of July 2012. 8th of October till the 12th of October 2012. 10th of May till the 30th of May 2013. 22th of january till the 27th of january 2014. 10th of july till the 17th of september 2014. And there is a dip in the graph approximately 10 - 15 days after counting was stopped. The reason it dips after a delay is unknown, maybe reading a bit more of their source would help.    Embed Quote
