★Why is the term "world wide web" no longer used?
It is still used, just not quite as often. My best guess as to the reason for no longer using the term as such is the general trend towards abbreviations and shorter names, so it's just more common to hear people talk about "the web." Not that I think this is a good thing; it's important to remember the roots of the World Wide Web and what exactly Tim Berners-Lee and those who worked along side him gave us. And with the trend towards calling it simply "the web" I have seen a corresponding trend towards the reliance on non-open technologies such as Flash, which appears to me to be a slap in the face at the concept of the World Wide Web as created by Berners-Lee.    Embed Quote
