★Why aren't ISIS recruiting videos banned on the World Wide Web?
Because as much as we would like sometimes, there is no such thing as the Internet Police. Internet Service Providers and website owners are subject to the laws and jurisdictions of their respective countries, each of which has different codes regarding permissible content, people's responsibility to monitor what goes up, and enforcement of applicable laws. Certainly there will be many, many, many sites that will refuse to host ISIS' propaganda videos, and many jurisdictions where it would be criminal to do so, but there are also plenty of outlets and file sharing sites that are either neutral on the question - without violating their jurisdictional laws - or are dedicated outlets for such propaganda (which might be more of a legal grey area in some places).    Embed Quote
