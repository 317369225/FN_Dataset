★World Wide Web: How much does it cost to set up a very small home business website?
Typically it can cost between $200-$300 per year for a small business website if you use an online site builder.  I can encourage you to try out our platform which allows users to create a website instantly using your Facebook business page. Currently our application is in beta and is still free for ALL users.  When we officially launch we will be charging right around $20/month subscription fee with annual subscription incentives.
