★How is the world wide web transforming people's lives?
I barely have time to read books anymore. All of my reading is done online and my books are collecting dust. I think the internet has allowed people access to an education that was unattainable without the proper location and resources in the past and it has shrunk the world in a way vacation and travel could never do. Of course, the internet is censored in that a person in one part of the world may not access what someone in the other part of the world has access to and vice versa, but, maybe, that will change, someday.
