★Why is the term "world wide web" no longer used?
Google tells me that for the phrase "world wide web" it found 2.4M documents that have changed within the past week. Thus I cannot confirm that the term "world wide web" is no longer used. If you think about jargon and terminology evolution, especially among Web engineers and scientists, then one can boil it down to quantitative linguistics, where the "law of brevity" essentially states that words become shorter if they are used more frequently but a long word will be shortened to a higher extent than an already relatively short one.(from http://www.glottopedia.de/index.... ) The term "world wide web" is just abundant in many fields that people have found it easier to use shorter terms, for example: Web WWW Internet (a holonym, but often treated like a synonym) Dub-dub-dub The effect can also be related to the problem of coding efficiency (Shannon's information theory).
