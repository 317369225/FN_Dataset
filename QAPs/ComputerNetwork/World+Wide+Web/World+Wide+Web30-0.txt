★Is the World Wide Web dying because of the development of mobile apps?
As it's A2A by Gautham Bharathi Very good question here. I do online marketing for IT agency. While having leads i do found that market is turning into mobility a lot compare to web world !! The market of mobile and app development has increased a lot as everyone spends more time on mobile compare to pc and computer !! But web won't die as web will still require and having large volume of audience. Like mobile, Web presence is also necessary after all mobile app development will also done by web apps !! So it won't die but we can see overruling of app compare to web !!    Embed Quote
