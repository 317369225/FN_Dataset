★World Wide Web: How much does it cost to set up a very small home business website?
Google Apps for Business is likely one of the cheapest as there have a free version with up to 50 accounts, including a page-building tool along with email, etc. http://www.google.com/apps/intl/... http://netfirms.com is one of the cheapest domain registrars, currently at 7.99 USD/year. If you want a domain name with an international extension, http://101domain.com has a good variety of options. http://wordpress.com has domain name mapping premium feature, currently $12/year (http://en.support.wordpress.com/...) and a no-ads upgrade for $20/year (http://en.support.wordpress.com/...). This is likely the best approach for a small business who does not want to learn the intricacies of dealing with a host and setting up their own installation of Wordpress. For more security there is http://wpengine.com at $50/month. If the small business wants an ecommerce site, then http://shoply.com has a free and premium ($20/mo) options and shopify.com has various paid options starting at $29/mo.. Between the very simple Google Apps for Business page-builder, the various Theme options in Wordpress, and the various Theme options in Shoply, a designer is not needed to build a small business website.    Embed Quote
