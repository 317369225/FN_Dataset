★How much is the World Wide Web worth?
To me, the world wide web is like a humongous library that people around the globe has access to. Hence, the worth very much depends on what the people are actually contributing to this global network of information and whether people could actually sift out the information they need from the huge mess of information. Just think how a world without the Google search engine would be.    Embed Quote
