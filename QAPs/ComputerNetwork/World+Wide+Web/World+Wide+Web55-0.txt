★Are people worried about the growth of a closed network like Facebook vs. the open world wide web?
Are people worried?  Yes, some are. In time though we'll see whether it is sustainable for Facebook to remain closed.  You only have to look back a few years to see that portals only remain portals for a period of time.  Think of Compuserve, AOL, MSN, Yahoo! - OK - they were not necessarily closed, but they aimed to bring the web to you rather and have you start there as your home page. The difference is though that Facebook has realised that this is the way of the world and so rather than keep people on Facebook, they're finding ways of taking Facebook to the web.  It's a platform not a website and as long as they continue this strategy they will (in my opinion) keep the worriers at bay.    Embed Quote
