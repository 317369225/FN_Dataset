★World Wide Web: How much does it cost to set up a very small home business website?
You can get a working beautiful website for as low as 100USD per year. Its so simple. Get a domain from Dynadot , hosting from arvixe. Use wordpress as a CMS and you can get a theme for free. But a premium theme might cost one time 45USD. If you have problems setting up your website you can hire someone to do it for you. It would probably cost you 50USD extra if you hire a Pakistani , Indian etc for setting up the website. If you are looking for the training on that particular CMS, there are countless free videos online on how to use wordpress. So here is estimate of costs. Domain (Dynadot ) : 10USD  per year Hosting ( Arvixe ) : 50-60USD per year WordPress CMS: Free of cost Theme : Free ( Or 45USD if you are looking for a premium one ) So basic costs are just around 60-70USD per year for a website which you can update whenever you want. But for sure, if you are looking for a unique and much better looking website then it would cost you much extra. For designing and developing an awesome website on wordpress I charge 500-1000USD ( With free hosting and domain for one year as optional ) . But unique design worth it, if you have budget for it.    Embed Quote
