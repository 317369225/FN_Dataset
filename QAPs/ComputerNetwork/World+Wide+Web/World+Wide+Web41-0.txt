★World Wide Web: What's the most important suffix to buy for a website domain?
The most important ones are .com .net and then your local country if your outside the US like .co.uk or .fr From a branding perspective you might want to grab a custom short url based on a shortened or acronym of your main brand. These tend to use a 2 letter tld like .cc or .to At BullyingUK we have bullying.co.uk as well as buk.cc for our shorten service.    Embed Quote
