★How does the internet protocol inhibit the world wide web?I saw a talk by Mike Grehan about this, in which he mentioned the hypertext transfer protocol of the internet was actually holding the world wide web back.
If by internet protocol you mean HTTP and not IP, I consent - it has a few serious limitations. That is why suggestions like SPDY have been made (read more about SPDY here:  http://dev.chromium.org/spdy/spd...). A random collection of what bothers me the most about HTTP: Normally only one message is on flight per connection. Unless pipelining it used. But pipelining is scarcely implemented and if it is then mostly very badly. And Pipeling can't circumvent the Head-Of-Line Blocking (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hea...) - real multiplexing would be much better. TCP ist not very well suited for a stateless request/response protocol. Every new connection has an extra roundtrip due to the three-way-handshake, starts with a small congestion window and new connections are initiated quite often. Headers are repetetive and uncompressed Some features lack proper standardisation like the Cookie Header No piggyback mechanism that allows the server to send some resource it knows client will request, like an embeded JavaScript file Digest Access Authentication is quite badly designed and could be much better - and even replace the much slower TLS for some use cases (e.g. for Integrity and against man-in-the-middle attacks) All in all I think that's still quite good for a protocol(-version) that is 13 years old. After all it's partly due to the awesome features of HTTP and it's architectural brillance that the web evolved in the way it did and that HTTP is now becoming a new architectural style - REST. It teached us how scalability works: through caching and request parallelism (load balancing).    Embed Quote
