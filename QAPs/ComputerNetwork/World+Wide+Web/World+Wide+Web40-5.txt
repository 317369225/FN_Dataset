★What if the internet was never developed into the World Wide Web, and consequently the technology was never spread to the masses?Imagine history progressed from the early 1990's without the internet. What would be different?
In my alternate history something happens to prevent the spreading of the World Wide Web. Maybe governments realize the disruptive power that the internet would bring, as evidenced in politics and economics. Perhaps the capability to transfer large quantities of data is unfeasible, so only simple text could be transferred at a very slow pace (rendering it useless for any capacity beyond the simplistic functions of a telegram). Maybe Tim Berners Lee had an epiphany that he could capitalize on his invention, so patented the World Wide Web, but never allowed others to get created with it, so the internet remained in its stone age. The reason for the Internets absence is irrelevant, just try to imagine the trajectory of your life when you first started incorporating it into your life, and how this trajectory might have continued if the internet had not interrupted it.    Embed Quote
