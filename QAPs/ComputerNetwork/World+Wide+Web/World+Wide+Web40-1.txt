★What if the internet was never developed into the World Wide Web, and consequently the technology was never spread to the masses?Imagine history progressed from the early 1990's without the internet. What would be different?
First, if there was no public network, you'd never ask this question since Quora didn't exist... People and businesses would be more local and less connected. There wouldn't have been hard times for some execs at national Post services, Silicon Valley would be famous of its outstanding wine and nothing else, we'd buy everything offline and close to where we live and TV would still rule our lives. People would talk to people in the neighbourhood only and the whole world would be much, much slower.    Embed Quote
