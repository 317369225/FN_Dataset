★Is the World Wide Web dying because of the development of mobile apps?
Never. The first invention always "speaks" ahead of history. I mean internet is the first invention. And that doesn't makes it better too. Before the invention of mobile, we are very familiar with using www ie. Internet. After the invention of mobile, we feel that, informations are in our palms. That also doesn't mean, we are not intended to use www. There are so many website which are not designed with responsive UI to be perfect in the mobile phones. There are so many people, who don't have access to mobile phones, even though we consider that they have access to internet. www never goes out the scope. There are some things which are need to be done only with the help of that. For instance, take an example of filling an application form and submit a resume for a company x. It is easy to do that in www instead of using mobile applications. So i think, both has advantages and disadvantages.    Embed Quote
