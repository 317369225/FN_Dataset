★World Wide Web: How much does it cost to set up a very small home business website?
There are many elements involved in setting up a website. As others have mentioned, you could use a whole host of individual companies/freelancers for all of this. Google Docs is certainly a good call too. It depends how many hours work you want to put into it, how well you want it to do and what your budget is, among other things. The other option is working alongside a business who provide packages for start-up businesses. Social Media is another great tool you can use to make sure people know about your business website. We wrote an article on it the other day, here is a link if anyone would like to read it: http://thecuillincollective.co.u...    Embed Quote
