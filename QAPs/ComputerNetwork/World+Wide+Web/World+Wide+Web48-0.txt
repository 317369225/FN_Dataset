★What will the next 25 years of the World Wide Web look like?
I think it won't be restricted to a screen by that time. The network will have, in my opinion, integrated into our everyday life so well, that we wouldn't be able to do anything significant without it. Education, commerce, science and research – this is the trend in the present decade. But I think that by the end of the next decade, the 'World Wide Web' would be a part of, say, our television, refrigerator, textbooks, novels, examinations, games, music, voting etc. The world, in simpler words, would become a much, much more interconnected, as a result of which, life would become a lot more fast and hectic. I frankly think relationships and face-to-face interaction would suffer immensely. But in reality, nobody can predict the state of the internet in the next 25 years. The best way to predict the future is to build it yourself.    Embed Quote
