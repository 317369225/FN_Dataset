★What was the need to create the World Wide Web?I read somewhere that it was created for war or something. And I don't think that at that time there was any idea or need to create e-mails, or gain knowledge or see the latest technologies.
The Internet Protocol, IP, on which the whole Internet including email and the WWW are based, was indeed created as an experimental battlefield network. The intention was to create a network which had no central node which could be knocked out, a network which could adapt itself as nodes came and went. It was not, at the time, deployed as such. But it turned out to be a good way for sites, such as universities, companies, and government departments working together, to connect computers together without a grand plan, an overarching Big Boss who ran the network. So people could join in to the network without loads of paperwork and approvals - just join to someone who was already on the network. So all the universities joined together so they could use each other's computers, which allowed them to make better use of them for research, Then they wanted to send each other messages, and email was born. To allow researchers to co-ordinate use of their shared computers, and arrange to meet in the bar. Some time later, a guy in CERN wanted to make it easier for himself and his colleagues to publish interim results, drafts of papers (and invitations to meet in the bar). What he invented turned out to be the WWW. So the first impetus did indeed come from war. But peaceful research (and drinks in the bar) pretty soon took over.    Embed Quote
