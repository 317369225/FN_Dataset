★Will the world-wide-web every become a fad or perhaps will the traffic on the web drop?The number of new websites is dropping.  Fewer people are getting new domain names and hosting less and less.  main-qimg-5f83fe8b95ae0c158c50d1a51368d3a7 Is a chart showing the decline in interest in web hosting from google.  Perhaps the internet has reached it's end.
The web will certainly evolve over time, but the potential status of 'fad' for the internet has long since gone away.  The current evolution of web-APIs pointing at end-user mobile apps might falsely lead someone to believe that domains are no longer important, but I would argue that the reduction in interest of web-hosting is due to separate phenomena: 1 - 'Blog' sites like Wordpress, Tumblr, and Medium have long ago reached maturity and removed the need of many 'personal' level users of the internet from getting any hosting. 2 - *aaS offerings often reduce 'web hosting' needs from businesses. 3 - Increased education in technology has lead to an increase in self-hosting 4 - Ubiquitous knowledge of who offers hosting and how results in fewer searches about the term. The web has evolved and continues to be more popular and more useful than ever before ... it's just the methods in which it is useful and the services offered for it have grown beyond simple 'web hosting' searches.    Embed Quote
