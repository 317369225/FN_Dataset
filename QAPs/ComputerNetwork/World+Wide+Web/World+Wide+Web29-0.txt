★When was the World Wide Web first launched?
World Wide Web is an application of the computer network known as the internet. The Internet itself developed out of the ARPANET, the first network in the world to use packet switching instead of circuit switching. The inaugural ARPANET link was established in 1969 between the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist and a CERN employee, wrote a proposal for the application that would eventually become the World Wide Web. His idea was to design a system of nodes which would all be interconnected through a client-server architecture. On 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee published a summary of the project on the newsgroup alt.hypertext. The date also marked the debut of the Web as a publicly available service on the Internet.
