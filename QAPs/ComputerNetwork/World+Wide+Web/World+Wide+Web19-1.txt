★World Wide Web: How has the average page load time changed over time?This is in reference to how increasingly dynamic the web is getting. Presumably an answer to this should be normalized appropriately. Is the "web" getting slower? Is it increasingly so? By how much?
The short answer is that websites are getting slower over time.  Pat Meenan wrote an excellent article about this in the 2010 Performance Advent Calendar:  http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2....  In general websites are becoming heavier and adding more HTTP requests, and doing this faster than browser and networking improvements can keep up.  This doesn't have to be the case, by following best practices for web performance optimization sites can stay ahead of the curve and remain fast even while adding new features.  There has been a big push for this from Google (http://code.google.com/speed/) and Yahoo! (http://developer.yahoo.com/perfo...) among other companies.    Embed Quote
