★World Wide Web: How long does uploaded information stay accessible on-line?
As Joshua wisely points out, with the advent of the internet and ever cheaper, storage/commodity hardware, what is uploaded tends to live forever. Even if an offensive comment or a picture of you on the other end of bong is deleted from your account there is a strong chance that picture has been snagged by other site and re-purposed or still living on the backup disk of a social network. Even deleted tweets live on - some in infamy. Ultimately this begs the question of "whose data is it?" and right now the answer in most cases is - "not yours".    Embed Quote
