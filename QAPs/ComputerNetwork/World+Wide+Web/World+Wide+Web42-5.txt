★Will the world-wide-web every become a fad or perhaps will the traffic on the web drop?The number of new websites is dropping.  Fewer people are getting new domain names and hosting less and less.  main-qimg-5f83fe8b95ae0c158c50d1a51368d3a7 Is a chart showing the decline in interest in web hosting from google.  Perhaps the internet has reached it's end.
Great question. Mobile and tablets are taking over, which means a shift to Android/Apple-friendly pages and apps. I know personally I visit a lot less new-type sites on a laptop or desktop browser now than say 5 years ago. I also use Google Search a lot less.  I think this shift may be common, and  in future, unless heavily developed sites link from reliable sources within the social media framework, their potential to attract people's attention and justify viability will dwindle. Any good company will always have a website for people to reference, but the focus will be on mobile applications. So, yes, I believe a large portion of the world-wide- web will fade out eventually. Five years from now I think one of the most common tech-related sayings will definitely be "There's an App for That!".    Embed Quote
