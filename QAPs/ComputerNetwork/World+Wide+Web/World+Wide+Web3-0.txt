★What will replace the World Wide Web?The web replaced Gopher. What's the next big thing?
Well, I think that as an evolution of former communication methods such as speech, written word, sound, image, television, it has not much to evolve to at all. It will be upgraded though. Aybe there will be something like holographic presence and others, but I think it will all be "powered" by the Internet. The Internet is so universal that it should be able to be the fundament of any other communication system.    Embed Quote
