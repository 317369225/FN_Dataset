★World Wide Web: How long does uploaded information stay accessible on-line?
Somewhere between "a nanosecond" and "forever". There are few guarantees.  It's hard to get a guarantee from a company that a piece of data will genuinely be available forever, especially since "forever" is a mighty long time.  You can pay a company to get a pretty good guarantee that the information will be available for as long as you keep paying for it, though "pretty good" is subject to everything from government warrants to squirrels in transformers, as well as the whims of financiers and banks. It's even harder to guarantee that a piece of information, once made available to the public, will ever truly disappear.  Once somebody puts up a picture of you getting drunk and vomiting over the hotel balcony, it's at least potentially out there forever.  The bits are easy to copy, and no power on earth can prevent the copies from being made.  An extinction-level asteroid impact is your best bet, but it's got side effects. There are too many different kinds of data out there to meaningfully discuss the lifetime of an "average" piece of data.  You can generally assume the worst: something you want to live forever (say, your contributions to Quora) can be taken out by Amazon having a bad day.  And something you wish would dry up and disappear can be assumed to have an infinite lifetime (just ask the Star Wars Kid). If you want it to live forever, multiple backups are your best bet, including both your own physical copy and multiple online servers.  If you want it to go away, your best bet is to hire a company with a serious commitment to your privacy and hope that they never, ever let the information out of their site (or sight).  Ask Sony and their Playstation Network how well that's working out for them.    Embed Quote
