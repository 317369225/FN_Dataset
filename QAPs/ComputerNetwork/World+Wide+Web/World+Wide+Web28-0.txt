★Is the world wide web a form of artificial life?
No.  It fails to meet some of the criteria for defining life.  In particular, the capacity to reproduce, the capacity to move, the capacity to evolve rather than be designed.  It also has no sensoria and thus cannot be self-aware.  That said, the definition of what life consists in is still rather vague, and it is possible that some future version of the Internet (not the WWW, BTW) might someday be considered as alive but also as able to think (and feel).  Viruses are considered alive, though they can be crystallized as can some chemicals.  The reproduction/evolution criterion is pretty important.  It is quite possible that some software programs can  be considered to be alive, but only in the sense that viruses are considered such.
