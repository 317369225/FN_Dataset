★World Wide Web: How long does uploaded information stay accessible on-line?
Contrary to expectations, internet data is proving to have a relatively short life. Millions of web sites have ceased to exist, along with all the data thereupon. More and more close up each day. In a general sense, your data is only live as long as the company which you uploaded it to still exists. If we averaged out the age of internet media companies, I'd be surprised if it was a decade. Even companies that thrive tend to dump data at some point - as an example, Google Video is closing down.....along with all the video which was uploaded there. Over the years I have had many thoughts related to longevity of data and how to guarantee it. It would seem that there are numerous business opportunities within this, but very few are being pursued on a retail basis.    Embed Quote
