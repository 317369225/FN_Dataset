★What is the World Wide Web?
It's the collection of resources available to view on the Internet.  Essentially, everything that starts with www is a multimedia resource which is hosted on a computer/server somewhere which is connected to the Internet (Internet defined as a global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities (thanks Google)).    Embed Quote
