★What will the World Wide Web look like in 10 or 20 years?
I'd say pretty close to what it is today, but stronger (everybody will be on it) and in an efficient way (you won't have a hard time finding a shop with its opening hours posted online, and live). It would look like everything is accessible through stuff like Google Now.    Embed Quote
