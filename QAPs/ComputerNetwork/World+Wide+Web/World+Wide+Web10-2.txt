★What was the greater creation: .com or the world wide web?
World wide Web The web... Like a spider web... Is an interconnected system of computers.. .com on the other hand is just a part of the web. It is the extension given to commercial website... Like .org Stands for non profit organization... .gov stands for  government organization.    Embed Quote
