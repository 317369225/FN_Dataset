★Is the World Wide Web dying because of the development of mobile apps?
I believe the World Wide Web itself will not die. But the content will increasingly become audio and/or video media instead of text. More and more people will begin accessing the web from mobile devices. But the web itself will exist, in fact, expand. The fat client of today (the PC with its own local storage) may become extinct. Clients may become lean and all storage may shift to the cloud. But the web will live on and flourish.    Embed Quote
