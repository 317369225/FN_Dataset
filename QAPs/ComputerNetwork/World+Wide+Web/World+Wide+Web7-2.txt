★What are some alternatives to the World Wide Web?i.e. other TCP/IP applications on the internet besides WWW
There is no alternative to the world wide web, however, it needs to evolve itself to become a real world wide web. One problem with it is that it can be easily interrupted or filtered. Therefore, is not a real web. A real web can transfer the information through another node once one is corrupted. For that the alternative technology is to develop all internet user hardware to become escapable to connect to one another directly and conduct as a node.    Embed Quote
