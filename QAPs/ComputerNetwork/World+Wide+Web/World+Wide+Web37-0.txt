★World Wide Web: Why are there static and a dynamic IP addresses?Can someone explain why there needs to have both kind of addresses in the design of the internet?
Static IP addresses are used for computers on the Internet that need a permanent IP address and handle requests for services. Web servers would be a common example. While their addresses can change, and be updated through the DNS (Domain Name System), these are infrequent. Dynamic IP addresses are used for systems like devices on broadband or mobile networks that don't need to serve connections. They can be pooled together by network infrastructure, so that a large number of broadband customers can share a fewer number of IP addresses.    Embed Quote
