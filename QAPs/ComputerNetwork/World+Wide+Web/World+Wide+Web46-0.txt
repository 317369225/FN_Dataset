★What is your earliest memory of using the world wide web?
I was probably the first people in the world to download the web.  At the time I was at MIT in the summer after graduation, and I had this habit of downloading software from USENET and compiling it.  I found a post in alt.hypertext which talked about the WWW, so I downloaded the software, and after a half day of trying to get it to compile, I got it running, and I started writing some simple HTML using the console browser.  It was on a Vaxstation VS2 in the basement of MIT that was part of Project Athena.. There was an editor that I tried to get to work, but it was for NEXT machines.  Also I do remember some people who had some proprietary system called (hytime?) that were sure that the system would go nowhere. At the time I was doing a summer job to develop educational courseware, and I saw the web as being able to better teach math and physics, and I was seeing it as a unix version of hypercard.  The odd thing is that while the web has developed a lot, that the visualization systems that I wanted to write haven't been more developed than what was available in 1991, so in many respects, what I'm doing now is to finish up the software that I was writing in 1991.    Embed Quote
