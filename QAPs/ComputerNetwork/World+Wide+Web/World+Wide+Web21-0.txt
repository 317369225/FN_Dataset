★World Wide Web: How much does it cost to set up a very small home business website?
You can set up a business website for free at WordPress.com.  100% DIY takes more time, but it's also the most affordable.  It's a good place to start for business owner and a great way to learn the basics of what makes a good website. For a low end web designer using a template you're looking at between $300 and $1,000 not including any support or maintenance.  I typically don't recommend web designers for new and growing businesses because needs change frequently, the costs add up, and your flexibility is limited by your pocket book. It's better to just put in the time to learn the basics yourself and go with a solution that takes care of the technical, time consuming stuff but lets you make minor updates on your own to keep costs low. Just Add Content offers free web design and includes hosting, CDN, security, etc. and you retain the power to manage  your own website.  This is my company and it's built exclusively for small businesses.    Embed Quote
