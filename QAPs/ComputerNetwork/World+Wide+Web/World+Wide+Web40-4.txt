★What if the internet was never developed into the World Wide Web, and consequently the technology was never spread to the masses?Imagine history progressed from the early 1990's without the internet. What would be different?
There would be no online shopping, no email, no social media and people would have much less access to information and entertainment than they have now.    Embed Quote
