★What is www (world wide web) mean?why we put www on adress bar waht is use of it
WWW, in simple terms, can be thought as a universe comprising of knowledge, an entity (or user) that shares that knowledge and an entity that consumes that knowledge. Many people confuse it with internet itself. WWW is rather an application of internet, whose main purpose is to share information.    Embed Quote
