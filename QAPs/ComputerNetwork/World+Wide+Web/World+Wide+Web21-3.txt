★World Wide Web: How much does it cost to set up a very small home business website?
Purchasing a domain name and hosting is quite cheap, the most expensive part is determining your needs, writing content, designing, and coding the pages. Hiring a freelancer or design student is likely to set you back anywhere from $500 - $5,000 depending on their experience, skillset, and the scope of the project. Agencies cost significantly more.

If you're technical and patient you could set it up yourself, otherwise you could hire someone from oDesk.com or your local community college to install it and populate it with the content you provide. E-commerce is significantly more expensive and challenging in most cases.    Embed Quote
