★How rich is the creator of the World Wide Web?
Define 'rich' . Tim Berners Lee created the WWW so that he and other scientists could easily share information. He didn't patent it or monetise it any way. I've no idea how much money he has and I don't care but because of his generosity of spirit and I'm pretty sure he's rich in many other ways that aren't quantifiable. The internet as we know it wouldn't exist if a person  came up with the WWW  and had tried to make a fortune out if it.    Embed Quote
