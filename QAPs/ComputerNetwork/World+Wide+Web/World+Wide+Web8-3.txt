★Why isn't Tim Berners-Lee as rich as Bill Gates for inventing the World Wide Web?I mean come on! This is a platform that billion-dollar companies like Google and Facebook operate in.
Billionaires are people good at making money. Inventors are good at making things. Rarely do the two overlap (Edison, arguably, was pretty good at both, though he too was less of an inventor than a businessman). There were lots of cars before Henry Ford. There were personal computers before the Apple, MP3 players before the iPod, touch-screen smart phones before the iPhone, tablets before the iPad. Steve Jobs is the one who got rich, not because he or his company created anything innovative, but because they made people want to buy them.    Embed Quote
