â˜…What is a good intranet system for a nonprofit?We are a small-medium nonprofit with 9 offices across the country, and we are looking for an easy-to-use and affordable site/service on which we can share necessary documents, news, and other info.
I think that based on your requirements you are not talking about a front end CMS but a collaboration platform rather then CMS. I suggest you look at solutions like Confluence and other collaboration solutions. If you are not in need for high security i would go with something like Google Apps as Casilda suggested. CMS can be anything but go open source only if you plan to have a strong development team or a good partner.
