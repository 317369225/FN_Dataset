â˜…What is a good intranet system for a nonprofit?We are a small-medium nonprofit with 9 offices across the country, and we are looking for an easy-to-use and affordable site/service on which we can share necessary documents, news, and other info.
The Social Intranet space is massive and there are many great options out there. However, I can't help but add Stream Workspace to your list of possible options for non-profits. Key Benefits/Stream's Value Add:1) Visual UX (actually 'see' content, P2P and organization wide) 2) Intuitive, User-centered Experience (promotes actual usage) 3) Realtime Aggregation of Content with 'Streams' 4) Powerful Search (indexing content within numerous document types) 5) On-prem, Web 'Connectors' (Dropbox, Box, OneDrive, Google Drive),or a hybrid model 6) Workspaces (secure, role based spaces for teams to post & collaborate) 7) Integrations (Active Directory, OneLogin, SharePoint, Oracle, SAP) 8) Price: (25 users is $75/mo.) 9) Up and running in less than a day (with cloud based option) Full disclosure: Stream Workspace is my start-up that has evolved from providing enterprise intranet/CMS/technical support services for more than 350+ organizations around the world. Sign up or request a no-obligation run through and I'll personally administer to folks from Quora! Would love to learn more about how we could assist your non-profit! :)
