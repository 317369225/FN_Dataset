★How does your company share key info with all their employees?  intranet?  email?  online tool like yammer or chatter?please include any detail about how big your company is...lot easier problem when you are just 5 folks
Our company has 33 franchised locations around the company. We share info using Yammer between franchisees and offer advice, tips and engage with the franchisees as corporate employees as well (appx 50% adoption). We also have an internal network and scheduling system where we post announcements, files, articles, etc. Email (and gchat) still plays a big role and we use ZenDesk as an internal help desk. BackPack and the rest of the 37 signals suite play a big part of our communications between corporate staff. Our franchisees have also started using highrise to manage sales prospects and be able to share and review with our National Sales Coach. For announcements during our annual convention we used a free group texting service (www.groupflier.com) to communicate with the franchisees and corporate staff. Don't forget about other text messages, phone calls and conference calls! Its not as crazy as it sounds, but we are always working to streamline communication. Each tool has to serve the correct purpose in order to avoid mayhem and damaging lapses in communication.
