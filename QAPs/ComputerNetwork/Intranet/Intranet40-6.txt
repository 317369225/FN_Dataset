★How does your company share key info with all their employees?  intranet?  email?  online tool like yammer or chatter?please include any detail about how big your company is...lot easier problem when you are just 5 folks
Unfortunately, my Fortune 100 company fits perfectly in the old joke: "You know you work in corporate America when... You get your company news from the Wall Street Journal". They have tried several copies of social tools, but you have to go through legal disclaimers and policies when you sign on. Internal email and intranet RSS feeds are the only reliable sources. I'm glad to see other large corporations being more open minded.
