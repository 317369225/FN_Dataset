â˜…Which is best for a corporate intranet, WordPress, MediaWiki, or Open Atrium?
I don't know Open Atrium. MediaWiki and WordPress are both good, but they address different needs. If you are regularly publishing news updates in the style of a blog, and they are edited by one communications person or a small group of people, the you should go for blogging software, of which WordPress is the most popular one. If you want organizational documentation that can be edited by a lot of people, then you should go for a wiki, and MediaWiki is a very popular wiki package. If you need both, then install both. The Wikimedia Foundation, which maintains the Wikipedia servers and develops MediaWiki, uses MediaWiki for Wikipedia (duh), for MediaWiki's own website mediawiki.org, and for its private intranet, and it uses WordPress for the public Wikimedia blog.
