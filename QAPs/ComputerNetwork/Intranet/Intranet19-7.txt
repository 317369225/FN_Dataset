★Will enterprise social networks replace intranets?
Social Networks is a mode of communication & don't think will replace intranet instead would compliment the same by bringing in Intranet inside enterprise social networks... No enterprise social network (ESN) will succeed within an enterprise as a standalone or silo-ed application..  They should have the ability to integrate with existing business systems or offer apps out-of-box with the ESN..
