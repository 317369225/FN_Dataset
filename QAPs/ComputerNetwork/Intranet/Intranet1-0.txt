â˜…Is social media killing the intranet?As firewalls get penetrated by the growth of mobiles and handheld devices, and employees connect with each other on networks like Facebook, should companies start looking at social media networks (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter / Yammer) seriously as internal or employee communication channels? More effective than an Intranet?
There are many other parts of an intranet that social media cannot affect. For example, I know one company that has a useful organizational navigator that let's you see who works for who, and that is available only through the intranet. But you are more right when it comes to networking because many people connect with their colleagues through external networks rather than internal ones. It's not hard to see why. It isn't easy to develop an internal system that can compete with the latest iteration of the major social brands. I believe that companies are coming to accept this and while they keep their intranets they are keeping an open mind towards using external channels also for internal communication.
