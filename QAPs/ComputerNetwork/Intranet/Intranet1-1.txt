â˜…Is social media killing the intranet?As firewalls get penetrated by the growth of mobiles and handheld devices, and employees connect with each other on networks like Facebook, should companies start looking at social media networks (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter / Yammer) seriously as internal or employee communication channels? More effective than an Intranet?
Social Media is not killing the Intranet it is creating opportunities to connect with employees at an intimate level. Social Media is forcing organizations to rethink how they communicate with employees. Today's knowledge workers are so much more than the title on their business cards. They are skilled, experienced and well versed in many of the tools available to them in their personal lives. It is for this reason I've created an Intranet that incorporates many social media tools available to them through Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube. Our Intranet is a custom solution which was built within our firewalls to enable our corporate communications team to connect with all 66,000 employees either through blogs, work groups (Fan pages), targeting messaging and videos. Since Nov 2009 we have seen a 40% increase in usage of our Intranet due to the implementation of social media.
