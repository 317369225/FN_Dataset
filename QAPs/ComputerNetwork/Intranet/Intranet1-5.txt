★Is social media killing the intranet?As firewalls get penetrated by the growth of mobiles and handheld devices, and employees connect with each other on networks like Facebook, should companies start looking at social media networks (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter / Yammer) seriously as internal or employee communication channels? More effective than an Intranet?
I just think it is a really exciting time in this space.  As more and more platforms embrace information management, processes, connection / sharing / communication and even custom apps the intranet is basically the digital workplace - for all types of users.
