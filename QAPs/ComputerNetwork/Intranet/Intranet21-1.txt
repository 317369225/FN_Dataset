★What is the best tool to create a company intranet?
There is no "best tool to create a company Intranet", really.  But there might be a "best tool to create an Intranet for your company, given it's current size, resources, strategy, etc". As it happens, there are a LOT of possible choices to use for this.  You can do something as simple as a self-hosted Apache httpd server and having people scp files to /var/www/html, or something as complex as a full-blown CMS coupled with Wikis, blogs, an Enterprise Social Network, and a Document Management System. It really depends on your needs and constraints. That said, if you happen to be interested in learning more about what a state of the art Enterprise Social Network (really, an "Enterprise Knowledge Network") can do for your organization, give me a buzz.  My company specializes in helping firms improve knowledge sharing, knowledge transfer and collaboration using an Intranet that's infused with capabilities built on semantic web technologies, machine learning, and enterprise social techiques.
