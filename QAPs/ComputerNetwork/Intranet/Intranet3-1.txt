★What are Sharepoint alternatives for a company-wide intranet?In a ~500-1000 person company, what alternatives are there for a  document, file repository-style intranet portal? Bonus points if there is room and potential for other elements of the information workplace (such as collaboration, social, content management) down the road.
I think the term "intranet" is tired and dated. Most intranets have been slow, painful behemoths (ahem... SharePoint). And today, people also work continuously across company lines (ie not "intra"). The trend recently has been replacing the file part of an "intranet" with something modern like Dropbox or Box, and replacing the discussions part with something modern like Yammer, or (more private, for smaller groups) our tool, Unison.
