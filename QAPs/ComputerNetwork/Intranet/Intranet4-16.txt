â˜…What is the best Intranet platform for a midsize company?Love the google docs functionality but their sites functionality for top down navigation and rich controlled sharing is pretty thin. Sharepoint makes my brain hurt every time I look at it... What are people using for a company bigger than a startup (so need more than just docs) and smaller than a full size corp?
You could find HyperOffice a very good fit. It literally takes minutes to set up intranet workspaces where you can add collaboration tools of choice (document collaboration, calendars, forums, wikis, project management, surveys etc.). The intranet publisher lets you drag and drop elements to design and customize intranet pages super easily. http://www.hyperoffice.com/intra...
