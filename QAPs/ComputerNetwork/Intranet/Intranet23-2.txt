â˜…Community Management: Is there a self serve, inexpensive, solution like Jive's Social Intranet?
Yammer is a free service, but if you have large files it won't be ideal. You might want to try looking into Buddy Press, a free community system built on the open source WordPress content management system. Between buddy press and Ning, most other options are quite expensive. If you are looking to just have a central calendar, ability to share/assign tasks, upload basic word docs/office docs, and have an alert system try using Kona. Caveat, it's in a beta form, and I work for the company that released it; however, I am just a user of that product.
