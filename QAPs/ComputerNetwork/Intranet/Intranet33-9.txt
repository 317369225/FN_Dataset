â˜…What is important to consider when designing an intranet for a large company?I am helping my company audit our internal web site so we can have a more efficient system. I would like to know what other companies are doing that works.
Our application (Bloomfire.com) powers knowledge-sharing at thousands of teams and functions as a pseudo-Intranet at some organizations. Our customers love us for the approach we take, which is somewhat inspired by Apple: Simplicity. The intranet idea isn't working too well if it only accommodates the tech-savvy teammates and turns off the tech-averse teammates. A lot of the value of intranets come from network effects; in other words, an intranet is richer if hundreds are sharing knowledge rather than just a dozen. Mobile. Trends indicate that more people will be accessing the web from mobile devices than PCs in the next few years. That's a big deal. Do your company systems support that?
