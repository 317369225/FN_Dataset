★What is a good intranet system for a nonprofit?We are a small-medium nonprofit with 9 offices across the country, and we are looking for an easy-to-use and affordable site/service on which we can share necessary documents, news, and other info.
I'm biased of course, but why not to try Bitrix24 (http://www.bitrix24.com), one of the most fully-packed collaboration platforms. This is  a private social network with 35+ business tools (real-time forum  called  Activity Stream, instant messenger with chats  and  video-conferencing, CRM, tasks,  calendar, workflow, HR  module, etc).  It's free for up to 12 users, and is available in cloud or as self-hosted solution. Mobile Apps for Apple  & Android are also Free. In case if you decide to go with paid license - we offer special discounts for non-profits (http://www.bitrix24.com/prices/special-offers.php)
