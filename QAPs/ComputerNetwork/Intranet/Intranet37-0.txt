â˜…Would an intranet search tool benefit your company? How?I'm interested in knowing how much of a need intranet search is to various types of companies, what kind of use cases they have, and if any existing search tools are being used within those companies. Would help if you give some context on the industry your company is in and the size of the company.
Well said, Timo! I might add that folks *often* think of eDiscovery as an 'enterprise search' problem, and often (try to) solve it with the same tools. I might also consider 'Faceted Search' as a capability rather than a type of search. People have come to expect facets navigation with search of all of the other types you've mentioned, but we may well just have to agree to differ on that point!
