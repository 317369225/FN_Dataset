â˜…How can enterprises create an activity stream (like Facebook and Twitter) in their SharePoint intranet?
We are about to ship this: www.facepoint.net, which is a direct answer to you question. It's Facebook skin with SharePoint muscle! UPDATE: we've just launched the product at www.gobeezy.com. Enjoy! The story A year ago we saw how succesfull Yammer was becoming and thought... there should be a very simple way to have something like this running inside SharePoint (not just integrated with). Plus... working together with MS Office for document management, with MS Outlook for events and contacts, and with MS Lync for communications. The whole product is just magic for the Enterprise 2.0!
