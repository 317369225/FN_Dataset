★What are Sharepoint alternatives for a company-wide intranet?In a ~500-1000 person company, what alternatives are there for a  document, file repository-style intranet portal? Bonus points if there is room and potential for other elements of the information workplace (such as collaboration, social, content management) down the road.
I'd take a look at Jive software.  They offer both hosted and on-premise models, and I really like their solution.  While focused on Enterprise collaboration/Web 2.0 tools, I have seen the software used as a full blown replacement for a traditional company intranet (we dubbed it the "social intranet" at my prior company).  If you register at the Jive website, you can pull down a free copy of a Gartner Magic Quadrant report which shows many of the other market leaders in this space for comparison http://www.jivesoftware.com/reso...  , since you indicate an interest in some of these features for the future.
