â˜…Which plugins should I use to build an Intranet in WordPress?
I have to say I disagree with Aaron and agree with John. I've used WordPress to develop two intranets. One was a quick and simple project for a small community organisation which only needed to use the default commenting built into WordPress in order to be abel to gather other peoples' views on specific items. The other uses BuddyPress as it includes functionality for events, user management and notifications that the client needs. There is a myth that WordPress is not secure but this dates back to some time ago - WordPress has now had a lot of security enhancements added to it. If it wasn't secure, it wouldn't be used by CNN and 10 Downing Street. And there are tweaks you can make to the 'out of the box' install to make it more secure. Depending on how your intranet is hosted, security may be a function of your hosting setup anyway (particularly if it is hosted on internal servers rather than on the web).
