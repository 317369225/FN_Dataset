â˜…Is social media killing the intranet?As firewalls get penetrated by the growth of mobiles and handheld devices, and employees connect with each other on networks like Facebook, should companies start looking at social media networks (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter / Yammer) seriously as internal or employee communication channels? More effective than an Intranet?
While its important to have employees engage to drive interactions on social media, it can't however replace the intranet. Think of company sensitive files/docs being exchanged and getting stored on other networks. Plus outage? Internal networks prove to be more robust! Also, one's accessible over the intranet while at work or when they choose to be contacted. On a social network, its assumed that you're available at any time round the clock! Social media networks should be a part of the companies engagement policy for internal and external customers. But these cannot be more effective than the legacy intranet.
