â˜…What intranet does Apple use?The market for intranet isn't very diverse. Most are way to complicated, both for administrators and end-users. I doubt Apple would settle with Sharepoint or the likes of it. Does anyone know what they actually use?
Most of the "intranet" use cases - secure sharing of files and other network resources with your workgroup - are handled by Mac OS X Server instances, with accounts and privileges handled org wide by OpenDirectory (which replaced the NeXT-derived NetInfo network user auth infrastructure in Mac OS X some versions ago). You will also find the usual number of bespoke web interfaces respective vendors provide to manage various enterprise activities (HR, Inventory, etc,).
