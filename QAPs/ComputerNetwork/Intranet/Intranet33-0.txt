★What is important to consider when designing an intranet for a large company?I am helping my company audit our internal web site so we can have a more efficient system. I would like to know what other companies are doing that works.
When designing an intranet for a large company you need: Muscle.  This means you need the ability to say no and actually have a leg to stand on.  This might mean you have ability to control firewall rules which govern access or DNS for internal hostnames or redirects or an actual policy statement given by your CIO.  (Or all of the above!) Standards.  This means all your intranet sites have a similar look and feel, they all point back to the same masthead / banner or navigation and they all obey your intranet search requirements.  Anything else your technical wizards feel is necessary to have efficiency from internal site to site.  For instance you might consider an internal enterprise authorization service so your users don't need 30 passwords for various web servers. Process.  When your various internal web servers pop up from various business units, you need to have a process in place to catch those events early on and wrap a review into the loop.  Make sure that your various site owners comply to the standards you have set up.  When they do not.. this is when you use your muscle.  Either you deny a firewall rule, deny a DNS request or redirect or you escalate to senior management.  Good luck!
