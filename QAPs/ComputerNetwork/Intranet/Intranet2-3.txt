★Intranets: Is Yammer useful in the workplace?
We use Yammer and it's been useful in connecting with other people from across the globe. We use it for finding contacts, support, and it also acts as  the occasional water cooler for company employees. I'm actually finding it more useful than Twitter, for example, because of the high signal to noise ratio as most of the topics discussed are relevant to the community.
