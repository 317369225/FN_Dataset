â˜…Community Management: Is there a self serve, inexpensive, solution like Jive's Social Intranet?
It depends on what you mean by "inexpensive" and what you mean by "like Jive". There are a lot of options that might work as a Social Intranet (depending on your exact needs) with a large variation in pricing and in functionality. On the "high end" (comparable to Jive's full functionality) you have platforms like our Communifire, which compared to Jive, is inexpensive but is not dirt cheap. With support factored in (there are no implementation fees, you can sign up on the website and be up and running in minutes) here is our SAAS pricing (we have self-host pricing too): [1] 10 users: $88 / month 20 users: $138 / month 50 users: $238 / month 100 users: $499 / month 100+ (unlimited): $14,000 / year As already indicated, Yammer has a free version and as such is worth checking out if your needs match their functionality focus. To create your own look and feel you'll want the "Enterprise" version at $3/user/mo. Looks like they are touting Sharepoint integration for knowledge base (unsurprising given it's a Microsoft company now). [2] Socialcast is free for up to 50 users, jumps up to $500 / month up to 100 users and then is $5/user/month after that [3]. So for smaller implementations it may be compelling, except I'm not sure from their webpage what they are using to build the knowledge base mentioned in the question details and I'm not sure what sort of support they offer for free. If you're building your knowledge base through files and microblogs, judging from their website KineticGlue looks like a decent option. They do have a free version but it is limited to 5 groups, doesn't include support, custom look and feel or enterprise level security. So you're better off going with their $2/user plan, which looks pretty good if you don't have a really large community. [4] Those are the ones I could think of in the "inexpensive" category. I obviously don't have any direct experience with any of these except our own but at least there are some names to look at depending on your exact needs. Also, many companies will provide additional discounts if the "non-profits" you are working with are charities ... so be sure to ask about that.
