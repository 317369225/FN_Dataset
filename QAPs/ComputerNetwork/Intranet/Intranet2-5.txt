â˜…Intranets: Is Yammer useful in the workplace?
the thing about yammer is that while it allows for spontaneous and open communication, it doesn't make any of it actionable. its not really helpful for new people joining - it doesn't orient them to the right people - and it doesn't create any common ground for the organization as a whole. I work for Jostle which makes a very simple intranet that has both social and structured communications. the combination seems to work very well - our customers have median engagement rates of 85%.
