â˜…What is a good intranet system for a nonprofit?We are a small-medium nonprofit with 9 offices across the country, and we are looking for an easy-to-use and affordable site/service on which we can share necessary documents, news, and other info.
I think Papyrs might be a good fit for your small-medium non profit. They have a really nice and simple way to set up an intranet. Drag and drop features that anybody in a company understands. No technical skills required. Which I think it's key if you want users to adopt it. See there profile here: Vendor Scanner: Papyrs (Stunf) - Social Enterprise Times
