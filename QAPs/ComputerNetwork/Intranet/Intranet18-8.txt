★What comes next in enterprise social networks and Intranets?Products like Yammer and Salesforce Chatter are still in their infancy. What will come next? What are the issues the existing problems do not solve well?
I think by next year or so organizations would start evaluating NoSQL, adopting it as the database tier in their interactive web applications. It would help in improving real time engagement analytics (and hence performance) and big data processing on a much larger scale.   Another big development to be witnessed would be in immersive 3D environments and game play- becoming more closely interwoven, providing enormous possibilities for engaging employees in ways that maximize employee participation, collaboration and communication. Some of the enterprise gamification platforms like eMee (Gamification, Loyalty Programs and User Engagement for Enterprises, ITES/BPM, e-Commerce, Learning)  have already reported very interesting pilot projects and applications in this area.
