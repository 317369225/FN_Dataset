★Community Management: Is there a self serve, inexpensive, solution like Jive's Social Intranet?
Have you seen our Hoop.la platform?  It can be locked down as an intranet, and incorporates lots of the community features needed by non-profits and small businesses.  I usually don't just come in and plug, but was invited to answer, so here I am!  I hope you find a solution that suits you!
