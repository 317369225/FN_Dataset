â˜…What is the best Intranet platform for a midsize company?Love the google docs functionality but their sites functionality for top down navigation and rich controlled sharing is pretty thin. Sharepoint makes my brain hurt every time I look at it... What are people using for a company bigger than a startup (so need more than just docs) and smaller than a full size corp?
Our company is ~400 employees and we use Jive as the primary environment and interface. We connected it to Sharepoint for document management but increasingly just use Jive. It has worked well for us as the de facto intranet.
