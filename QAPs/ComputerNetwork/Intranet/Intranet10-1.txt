â˜…What is the best Search Engine for a private intranet?Something like Google Search would be ideal - but our website content is all locked down (password controlled), only authenticated users can access the content. The ASP code is on a Microsoft Server.
If you want the full Google experience for your intranet, you can go with a Google Search Appliance: http://www.google.com/enterprise... I'm not sure what the pricing terms are for them, though.
