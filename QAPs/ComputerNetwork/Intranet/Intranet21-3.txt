â˜…What is the best tool to create a company intranet?
There are a LOT of companies out there that offer SaaS intranet solutions for a small cost, which will save you time, headaches and might be a lot more developed and user friendly that what you would create (since they have teams of people who have been working on the software for years). Most of them also offer free trials so you can even test if their solution works for you. Disclaimer, I work for one of them: Igloo Software. But feel free to search for competitors online and make your own decision. A bit about Igloo: - extremely customizable (will look and feel like your company) - very social (newsfeed, @mentions of other users, great people directory, ...) - advanced file sharing/storing capabilities: you can drag and drop files, reorganize folders, add read-tracking, check previous versions, assign a task to a document, etc. - dedicated team/department spaces And of course, since it's in the cloud (and it's responsive), users can access it from their mobile phone, even when away from the office.
