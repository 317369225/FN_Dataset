â˜…Should organizations consider using Facebook as a corporate intranet?I'm curious to hear opinions as to whether companies should consider using Facebook as a corporate Intranet. Pros/Cons?
if the conditions are right.. strong leadership, encryption of sensitive data, tight organization or translation of social tools into enterprise functions.. then yes. take the extra step and develop a few datastores via social graph calls and you'll have your sophistication and eat it too.
