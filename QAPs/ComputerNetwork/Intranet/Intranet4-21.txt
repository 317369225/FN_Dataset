â˜…What is the best Intranet platform for a midsize company?Love the google docs functionality but their sites functionality for top down navigation and rich controlled sharing is pretty thin. Sharepoint makes my brain hurt every time I look at it... What are people using for a company bigger than a startup (so need more than just docs) and smaller than a full size corp?
Try http://www.oogwave.com used by hundred of companies as an online intranet as file sharing and communication platform. Better managed than Google drive and simpler than SharePoint, built for small businesses.
