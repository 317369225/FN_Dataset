YouTube is worth a thousand words here. If anyone is interested in seeing 3-5 min. overview videos of how the following companies have fundamentally changed the way their employees connect, share, learn and ultimately make better and faster decisions you can find several that I posted here - https://community.jivesoftware.c... : Including: Toshiba - sales enablement (they won an industry award for it actuallyhttps://community.jivesoftware.c...) Life Technologies - 10,000+ employees (pharma) all using it daily. I just spoke with their point person the other day, fantastic corporate communications use case and results being seen. Cerner - thousands of users again (healthcare), this one is particularly interesting how they're leveraging one giant community with private areas where employee, partners, and customers are all collaborating. United Business Media - thousands of employees across the globe (100+ countries I believe) and they run many different publications in all those countries. EMC - true leaders who recognized the power of social software. The point person there for both internal use as well as external, Jamie Pappas, outlines their use case fantastically in a recent blog post https://community.jivesoftware.c... (look down at the comment section where she goes into more details around running their annual innovation conference in their community).
