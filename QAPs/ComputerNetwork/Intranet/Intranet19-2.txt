★Will enterprise social networks replace intranets?
Absolutely - I've seen the change in our organisation.  Our collaborative platform, JAM, is set up for teams within the organisation to share, feedback and collaborate across the whole organisation.  It's a brilliant way a working and allows for interaction - not just one way communication.  Took a while to adopt but now it's become a natural way of working for most employees.
