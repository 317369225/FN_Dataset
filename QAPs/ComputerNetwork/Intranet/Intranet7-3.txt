â˜…What is a good intranet system for a nonprofit?We are a small-medium nonprofit with 9 offices across the country, and we are looking for an easy-to-use and affordable site/service on which we can share necessary documents, news, and other info.
I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned SharePoint online. It's free for non-profits along with the other parts of Office365 (email, OneDrive, Yammer (social network)) etc. It may be too much for very small NGO's, though it is usable out of the box. It does full document management. New features like Video management are excellent for Non-Profits. Furthermore it comes with Office Online and is deeply integrated into Microsoft Office (which most charities can get cheaply or free from Microsoft). You can get a free trial on the signup page.
