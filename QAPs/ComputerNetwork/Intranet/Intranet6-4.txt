★What is the best social intranet software available?
Igloo Software is one of the best social intranet software available. It's easier to know more about a stranger on Facebook or Quora than the colleagues you work with everyday. We typically work in isolation and the knowledge that we possess is trapped in our minds, laptop and inbox. Igloo helps tear down the walls that prevent people from connecting and communicating with each other. Whether the obstacles are organizational or geographic, Igloo helps create a more open and connected business by giving all members a voice. Create connections and message colleagues, share your thoughts in a blog or forum, comment and rate content – your influence is no longer dictated by your place in the hierarchy but rather by the value of your contributions. You will have greater control over the way you work and access knowledge. Anyone in a community can set up and manage group spaces and exchange information across multiple channels, including blogs, wikis, discussion forums, calendars and documents. And users can connect with community members outside of their social graph, build meaningful relationships through rich user profiles and improve the distribution of knowledge through social sharing and tagging. Page and navigation manipulation is done using a drop-and-drop interface, no coding required. It's actually really incredible. Some of Igloo's largest customers have 100,000+ members, so you can really understand the power of the solution. If you are not convinced yet, they offer a free trial.
