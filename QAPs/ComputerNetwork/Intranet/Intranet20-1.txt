â˜…What is best of Wiki or SharePoint for an intranet, and why?
I have created many specialized MediaWiki sites, but I find that there is just enough additional hassle in creating and curating content with it that it deters prospective authors. It's still a good tool -- duh, Wikipedia -- but it might not see the adoption that you'd like. Also, some new wiki-like initiatives seek to incorporate semantic web capabilities that may be valuable to you. Sharepoint has wiki-like capabilities that might be sufficient. Try them out for a few bucks at Office365. Sharepoint (and other full-fledged enterprise content management systems) will solve more problems than the one you pose. It will also demand more of an organization to deploy the solutions. .
