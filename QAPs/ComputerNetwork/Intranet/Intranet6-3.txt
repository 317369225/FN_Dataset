â˜…What is the best social intranet software available?
Igloo Software (Igloo is an intranet you'll actually like) is a SharePoint alternative with lots of apps out of the box to collaborate, communicate and share resources. Blogs, Microblogs, calendars, wikis, forums, tasks, and file & folders. It's incredibly flexible, with a drag-and-drop interface to modify your navigation as well as page layouts. It's built for the non-technical user, and people are loving it!!
