â˜…What Intranet is the best?
I agree with Lindsay. Papyrs might be one of the best intranet solution providers at the moment. They have a really nice and simple way to set up an intranet. Drag and drop features that anybody in a company understands. No technical skills required. Which I think it's key if you want users to adopt it.
