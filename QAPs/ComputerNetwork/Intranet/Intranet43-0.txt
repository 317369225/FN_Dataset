â˜…Which one is better for a social intranet for a company: Slack or Flowdock?Slack has a good package but Flowdock has tagging. So which one should it be then?
At AppGyver we are using Flowdock with 20 people. We've been trying to use Slack, but: Flowdock has threads that help a lot when your team grows / people start using Flowdock more. Also notifications/integrations are nicely separated from chat, but you can easily start a focused discussion about them (bring those in chat, kinda). Tags are a bit messy to use, we don't really use them because search works good enough (although you can not do a search across different channels/flows). Slack looks 10-20x better. It actually looks so good that many of my design-oriented friends don't even see what they are missing in features.
