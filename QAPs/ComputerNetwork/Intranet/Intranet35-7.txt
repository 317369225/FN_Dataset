â˜…What is the best wiki engine for small business intranet documentation?
Our application (http://www.bloomfire.com/wiki/) powers thousands of teams and is geared for small businesses. I talk to a lot of our small business customers, and they almost always express the same desires: Don't want to hassle with expensive IT consultants for installation, set-up and maintenance. Just wants to plug-and-play. Wants fair pricing, not enterprise products that cost a bazillion dollars. Wants something easy to use, because they don't have time to train themselves and their team on a new system. Wants everything on their iPhone, because they're glued to it. So we built that. I can set you up with a free trial if you'd like.
