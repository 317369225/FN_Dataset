â˜…Will enterprise social networks replace intranets?
Some points like ESNs are mode of communication, or others where the pace of adoption of ESNs have been talked about, i have a few points to make. First, different products have different status on what exactly they do and communication is one of them, not the only. Second, Speed of adoption, no doubt, is a debatable phenomenon as various research houses have different things to say. Refer to Gartner Says 80 Percent of Social Business Efforts Will Not Achieve Intended Benefits Through 2015 Deloitte Technology, Media & Telecommunications and Mckinsey The social economy: Unlocking value and productivity through social technologies. I opine that they are not different products fundamentally. ESNs are just the evolved intranets with more social features with gamification for more engagement. All these reports have one common thing to talk about. Slower or speedier, ESNs will become the platform for business process integration. Culture will play a crucial role in adoption rate as some are averse to change while others are change pro and believe better flow of ideas and information are key to higher productivity. Its not about replacement, its about changes that are taking place in intranets for better. They are not getting replaced, they are getting refaced. Just an opinion
