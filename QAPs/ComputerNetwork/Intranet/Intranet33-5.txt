â˜…What is important to consider when designing an intranet for a large company?I am helping my company audit our internal web site so we can have a more efficient system. I would like to know what other companies are doing that works.
I'd expand Andy's item #1. He says muscle, but I'd go a step farther and say you have to have that muscle in the form of an engaged and involved executive sponsor who's an active champion for the design/redesign project. That will bring the other more tangible muscle required.
