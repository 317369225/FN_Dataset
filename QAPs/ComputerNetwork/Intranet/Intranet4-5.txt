★What is the best Intranet platform for a midsize company?Love the google docs functionality but their sites functionality for top down navigation and rich controlled sharing is pretty thin. Sharepoint makes my brain hurt every time I look at it... What are people using for a company bigger than a startup (so need more than just docs) and smaller than a full size corp?
I love all of these self-promotional answers from every vendor in this space.  OK, we sell products in this space as well, just to get that out of the way. Now, the honest answer:  Nobody knows, and there's no way to say without a lot more information.  You need to do a thorough assessment of what problem(s) you're trying to solve, look at what behaviour you want to encourage or facilitate, examine your organizational culture, and think about how you want your intranet to contribute to your competitive advantage, before you can even start to think about deciding what product(s) to use.  Are you trying to implement Peter Senge's "Learning Organization" approach?  Are you doing a full-on Knowledge Management initiative with benchmarking, importing best practices, etc?  Are you looking to emphasize competitive intelligence, or build a "technology radar" or just help people share documents?  What systems are already in place, and how will your intranet integrate with those systems?  Start answering these questions and you'll be a lot closer to being able to elicit a meaningful answer to your question. All of that said, feel free to peruse our website at http://www.fogbeam.com or read up on our blog at http://fogbeam.blogspot.com and see if you think we might be able to help you.  Feel free to ping me here on Quora or via email if I can be of any further assistance.
