★Which plugins should I use to build an Intranet in WordPress?
You may want to reconsider your CMS options.  Wordpress is great for some things, but it is not ultra secure, and does a poor job dealing with media like documents and pictures.  Rights management is not easy either. http://www.alfresco.com/products... Alfresco is an open source, but proven platform if you want sharepoint like features without the overhead.  This system can be used in conjunction with Wordpress so you can keep some of the front facing UI and features.  Millions of other options exist in the CRM world and you can make WP into almost anything you want it to, but you may wish you hadn't.
