★How can enterprises create an activity stream (like Facebook and Twitter) in their SharePoint intranet?
I would begin by adding that SharePoint Server 2010 already has an activity stream associated with user profiles though I find the interface clumsy. It helps if you break down what an activity stream means in terms of the enterprise and in terms of SharePoint. The default activity and probably the first priority of any activity stream is to aggregate the status (micro-blogging) of individual users. On Facebook and Twitter aggregation is scoped to the user's friends and following. In SharePoint, this kind of makes sense if you think of colleagues as friends; however, what probably makes more sense is keeping status in the context of your site collections. That is team and project site members can post status messages to one another. You can create this capability with a simple web part, some JavaScript, and a list to store the status messages. Other things that might be useful to know are when things change within the context of the team or project space such as document uploads, list mods, that kind of stuff. For that you need to tie into SharePoint's event handlers. You can trap these events and trigger status messages to be logged to the same list where you stored the status messages above. Or, as others mentioned, you can just buy this capability off the shelf. Let me know if you want a demo of our product, Social Teams for SharePoint. It’s compatible with on-premise SharePoint as well as Office 365 and other cloud hosters.
