â˜…Is social media killing the intranet?As firewalls get penetrated by the growth of mobiles and handheld devices, and employees connect with each other on networks like Facebook, should companies start looking at social media networks (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter / Yammer) seriously as internal or employee communication channels? More effective than an Intranet?
It depends a great deal on what platform you are using for your social media layer. A wiki can't replace a traditional intranet; a wiki plus an active and curated Yammer community might be able to. Jive can stand alone as intranet plus social. So, I don't think intranets will be officially toast until the social tools out there get more sophisticated and more robust. Every mid-to-large-sized organization still needs a policy/company news channel, and most do not have a social layer that can fulfill that need....yet. Times are changing, though.
