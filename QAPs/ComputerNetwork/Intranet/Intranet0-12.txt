★What Intranet is the best?
A custom WordPress intranet is by far the best value for your intranet project.  This is open source, reliable software hosted on your secure server, not someone else's.  WP's many 3rd party plugins offer power for your intranet, like calendars, activity feeds, document versioning, employee directories, search and more.  I've used WordPress to develop intranets for companies with 500 employees, and integrated their internal systems such as Active Directory with LDAP.  WordPress offers mobile ready themes for the enterprise that will work on smartphones, tablets and have proven streamlined UIs. Hosted solutions such as InternetDashboard, or SharePoint will cost you thousands more in licensing fees, training and support.  WordPress support is freely available online and scripts are well optimized by the open source community.
