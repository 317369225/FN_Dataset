â˜…Is Confluence a good cms for a corporate intranet?Or is it better as an add-on as a wiki? It seems the plug-ins for Confluence are not that easy to integrate.
I'd second Ellens enthusiastic support of Confluence for enterprise intranet needs, since I've used it in this pattern myself as well and also for a range of different clients. It rates very well in this pattern - if you need external independent verification, take a look at how it compares in the RealStory Groups evaluation of Enterprise Collaboration platforms at http://www.realstorygroup.com/Re... Bear in mind that when approaching it as an intranet, you will need to carefully think about content lifecycle considerations and tailor a content approval approach as well as an archiving approach to reflect the need for active content curation. I use AdHoc Workflows and the Archiving AddOns in combination to help achieve this. Also consider carefully the overall Information Architecture patterns you want to adopt and consider using third party theming products if you want it to have a more universal intranet look and feel than it comes out of the box. I routinely use and recommend RefinedWiki as a theming AddOn, think it makes a great starting point for many businesses with a well considered design approach. There are other approaches to skinning and theming that can also be used, comes down to flavour of choice and the level of in-house design staff you have. Bear in mind also that Confluence is a regularly upgraded product, so there is a relatively high version turnover rate, which can make things pretty busy if you're using a whole bunch of AddOns - the increased complexity of using lots of AddOns can make things very busy in terms of staying at current release increment. Something to factor into your resource planning, or consider using third party services from Atlassian Experts to help you achieve.
