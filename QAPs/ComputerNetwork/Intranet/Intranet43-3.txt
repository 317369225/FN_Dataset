â˜…Which one is better for a social intranet for a company: Slack or Flowdock?Slack has a good package but Flowdock has tagging. So which one should it be then?
messaging and streams are good, but you also need to be able to tell everyone about something (employee communications) and organize a team and its work. For that you need something that allows you to make info not just visible and searchable via tags, but also actionable. Generally that means you need to be able to take more free form stuff and graduate it to something more organized. You'll also want to be able to create some kind of common info view for teams to work on - in a team project environment, you want to be certain that you can let a team of people look at exactly the same cluster of info - whether its docs, comments, etc. This is getting a bit rambly, but if you want to be able to communicate, collaborate, and connect in novel/social ways, you need something a big more comprehensive. I've worked at Jostle for about a year now (Intranet Software for Employee Communication) and i'm constantly blown away by how much our customers love us. Its pretty nice.
