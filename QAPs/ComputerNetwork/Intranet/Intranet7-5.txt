★What is a good intranet system for a nonprofit?We are a small-medium nonprofit with 9 offices across the country, and we are looking for an easy-to-use and affordable site/service on which we can share necessary documents, news, and other info.
I have implemented Google Apps paired with the Content Management System that our public facing website was already using. Moving e-mail and calendar sharing from Microsoft Exchange has saved us money in servers and support which we have used to develop ad-hoc HR applications for our intranet. It saves us time because with the API content from people's personal calendars, and those shared accross the organization goes straight into the site for everyone to see.  Google Apps are incredibly easy and cheap to roll out and we are very happy with the move. If you don't have an existing CMS, I know you can try using Google Sites.
