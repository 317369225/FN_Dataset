â˜…Should organizations consider using Facebook as a corporate intranet?I'm curious to hear opinions as to whether companies should consider using Facebook as a corporate Intranet. Pros/Cons?
FB is where the users are. That's the only pro I can see at the moment. Facebook is simply too personal and centered around personal activities. Some of the functionality can be re-created using other tools to that you get the Facebook 'feel' in your intranet making it easier to link it to your core business processes. You should not underestimate the internal needs which are driven by the www - after all that's were it all starts. Think about the ascent of Google. Today it's hard to imagine a proper intranet without a proper search. Another important thing to mention here is that C-level execs are very likely to say Facebook = Waste of time. In the corporate context Facebook has become a new F-word when it comes to internal use. An important thing to keep in mind before asking for an intranet which is more 'like Facebook' :-)
