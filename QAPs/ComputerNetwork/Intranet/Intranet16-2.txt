★How is Jive's social intranet priced?I'm looking for more than the publicly available statement that it's priced by volume.  Approximate rates, tiers, etc.
Expensive. Jostle - check it out http://www.jostle.me - A simple, elegant, turnkey employee engagement intranet software. A new kind of intranet.   Jostle’s approach is different. Employee participation is work-relevant. It is easy to share news, align teams, recognize contributions and invite participation.   Our employee engagement rates are consistently 5X higher than both traditional employee portals and social intranets.
