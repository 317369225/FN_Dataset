★Which is the best intranet solution Cloud Computing and open source?I'm interested in a Intranet 2.0 solution. Collaboration and discuss with created groups, content managment, etc.
I'll 2nd Benny's suggestion, I am running 2 OA intranets right now.  Also try Mavenlink.com if you want a hosted solution.  One caution/suggestion: I have tried to use intranets a number of times over the years and IME unless the corporate culture PUSHES people HARD to use it, they won't.  Email is horrible but they understand it and are used to it.  So have a training and incentive program in place if you want a return on your resource investment.
