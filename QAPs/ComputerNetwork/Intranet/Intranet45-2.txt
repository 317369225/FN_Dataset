â˜…If a company starts using an enterprise-level social business suite (think Jive or Chatter), what happens to the intranet?Does the intranet get phased out? If not, what does the intranet do that the SBS doesn't or can't do? How do you make both useful?
I think the answer to these questions should be answered by each organization before they start to use social computing tools. Companies vary - one organization's intranet is different and is used differently from the next. Success of such tools and how they will integrate with existing work practices, IT infrastructure, and organizational culture will vary. Some cases are easier to predict; e.g., document-centric intranets can be augmented by community and discussion tools without significant functional duplication. So much can depend on what employees do/don't want and will/won't use that it may be worth doing internal analysis of existing systems use, as well as user studies such as focus groups, surveys, and internal pilot studies before committing to a "full-blown" social platform.
