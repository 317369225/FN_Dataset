★What are Sharepoint alternatives for a company-wide intranet?In a ~500-1000 person company, what alternatives are there for a  document, file repository-style intranet portal? Bonus points if there is room and potential for other elements of the information workplace (such as collaboration, social, content management) down the road.
There are a few. But there is one that surprised me. It's call Papyrs. They have a really nice and simple way to set up an intranet. Drag and drop features that anybody in a company understands. No technical skills required. Which I think it's key if you want users to adopt it. See there profile here: Vendor Scanner: Papyrs (Stunf) - Social Enterprise Times
