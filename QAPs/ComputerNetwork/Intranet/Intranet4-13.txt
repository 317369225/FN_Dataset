â˜…What is the best Intranet platform for a midsize company?Love the google docs functionality but their sites functionality for top down navigation and rich controlled sharing is pretty thin. Sharepoint makes my brain hurt every time I look at it... What are people using for a company bigger than a startup (so need more than just docs) and smaller than a full size corp?
I'd suggest you to pay your attention on Joomla. It's very functional, it has lots of additional components, extensions to increase you site functionality. All in all it's easy to work with, so it would be a really good choice. See what can be created with Joomla here: Portfolio - Joomla! Projects
