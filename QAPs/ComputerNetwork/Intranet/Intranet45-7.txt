â˜…If a company starts using an enterprise-level social business suite (think Jive or Chatter), what happens to the intranet?Does the intranet get phased out? If not, what does the intranet do that the SBS doesn't or can't do? How do you make both useful?
These are two different approaches to structuring the "collaboration" or information solution in your company. It could be structured around intranet spaces, or activity streams. Activity streams are somewhat porous, and make it easy to collaborate across departments and hierarchy, but are somewhat harder to apply policy controls to. The "intranet" approach is the tried and tested approach, while activity streams are not as yet proven in businesses.
