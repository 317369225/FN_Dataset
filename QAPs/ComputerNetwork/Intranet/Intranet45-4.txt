â˜…If a company starts using an enterprise-level social business suite (think Jive or Chatter), what happens to the intranet?Does the intranet get phased out? If not, what does the intranet do that the SBS doesn't or can't do? How do you make both useful?
I see a social business suite as being a glue for all types of information in an organization. They connect people and information to make knowledge current and available when and where needed. As Chris McGrath has put it and organization needs Content, Communication, Collaboration , Activity and Culture. I see different products taking different approaches - some just provide activity streams and others provide adapters for integrations with Enterprise systems. Whichever way one looks at it, the Social Business apps will be the window to other applications inside a business. The window through which people will consume information. This in essence means that the new intranet will be the Social Business Suites. More importantly, they bring the missing element in the existing systems - the human behavior that is much needed for information to flow seamlessly across the organization barriers. This really is the virtue of social networks - create relevance through connections.
