★What are the best practices to launch a social intranet?I would like to know what are the most important things we should consider when launching a new social intranet.
I think we should start by putting aside words like "social" since they mean different things to different people.  In my experience, clients want to have a good employee directory.  Who do I call to get this done?  Forms are important also to save time on collecting data.  A calendar of events and maybe a news feed to share comments centrally.  Maybe a poll to get staff feedback. Start with the basics and don't go feature crazy.  These 4 or 5 items above are usually more than enough for staff to digest. Don't throw too much at your employees using buzzwords... Social this, wiki that and so on... Focus on what staff want and what they will actually use. Less is more and simple is best.  Also, show them what other staff are using and clicking on.  This will demonstrate that others are using an intranet, so they should too.
