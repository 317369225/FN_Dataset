â˜…Should organizations consider using Facebook as a corporate intranet?I'm curious to hear opinions as to whether companies should consider using Facebook as a corporate Intranet. Pros/Cons?
No, because Facebook doesn't support real business processes. There are way better systems out there that focus on doing tasks and business processes. People don't go to work to get social, they go to work.. to work. Being social is a nice and important add-on, but it's never the main reason.
