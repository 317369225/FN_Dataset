â˜…What is the best Intranet platform for a midsize company?Love the google docs functionality but their sites functionality for top down navigation and rich controlled sharing is pretty thin. Sharepoint makes my brain hurt every time I look at it... What are people using for a company bigger than a startup (so need more than just docs) and smaller than a full size corp?
You should consider Igloo (an intranet you'll actually like). It's a social collaboration platform that offers a wide range of features (blogs, wikis, social newsfeeds, document management, file sharing, calendars, etc.) and can be very easily configured and reorganized to FIT your company: - Work in teams rather than departments? Dedicated team spaces - Need project management features? Tasks, calendars, and the likes - Want to foster a company culture? Social newsfeeds with comments and likes + a great company directory with full employee profiles. Not to mention it integrates well with Google Docs so you won't have to switch everything. Not sure if that's what you need? That's fine - Try it for free for as long as you want.
