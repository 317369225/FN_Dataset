★What comes next in enterprise social networks and Intranets?Products like Yammer and Salesforce Chatter are still in their infancy. What will come next? What are the issues the existing problems do not solve well?
The following could be extensions of what these products could add on.  I wouldn't call them 'visionary' or 'The Future', nevertheless: 1) Social media with context:  I think stand alone enterprise social networks are hard to sustain.  Its hard to quantify and qualify what a person is doing there and how it contributes to the business.  So, social media should be more embedded and social business networks should happen more in the context of a business situation.  2) Predictive Analytics:  A lot could be deciphered from an active enterprise social network.  Questions such as will my project run on time?  What is the likelihood of this prospect converting?  can be answered through some sort of data crunching & sentiment analysis of all the informal information/ data floating in an enterprise social network. Consider the value of doing this in a support forum or an external facing customer/ prospect forum (a marketplace).    Many vendors are trying to do something here, but I think we are yet to see solid proofs. 3) Insight into employees: An enterprise social network can provide great insight about a company's talent:  Who are the key employees?  Who are the leaders? Who are the influencers, high-networked employees?  Experts in a particular topic, overall employee sentiment, satisfaction levels are some areas where a social network can provide quick insight (which a typical HCM system will find hard to provide).
