★What is a good intranet system for a nonprofit?We are a small-medium nonprofit with 9 offices across the country, and we are looking for an easy-to-use and affordable site/service on which we can share necessary documents, news, and other info.
I'd highly suggest WordPress for your intranet.  Development costs will be far less than other solutions (given it's open source, and allows a wide array of plugins for social networking, polls, ecommerce etc). I developed an intranet for a company of 500 employees, and even integrated it into their Active Directory in house database.  We were able to build employee bios, image galleries and a number of calendar functions for events.  It is very versatile, and is the easiest to learn content management system available, especially for new employees (lots of free tutorials on Google etc for them as well).  There are also many options to manage staff permissions/roles/users to edit/update content.
