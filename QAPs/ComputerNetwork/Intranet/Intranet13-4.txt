★What companies are successfully using WordPress for their intranet?WordPress is a powerful, extensible CMS. I'm looking for success stories from companies using WordPress to power their intranet.
We have had several people move off of other Intranet products and onto Page on http://www.silk.co.  Imagine if each record in an intranet behaved like a page on a database. That's what Silk does so you can build collections of members, services, and any other information and organize them and reorganize them in different views (list, grid, map). You can also upload a CSV and convert it into an Intranet in minutes. Best of all...it's free!
