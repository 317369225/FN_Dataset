★What is the best way to organize the content on your intranet?I've seen topical intranets, role base intranets, conversational intranets, and organizational intranets (e.g. by the company's organizational hierarchy).  Which approaches do people find most useful? easiest to manage over time?
All great answers and advice here. We built all this into Jostle - check it out http://www.jostle.me - A simple, elegant, turnkey employee engagement intranet software. A new kind of intranet.   Jostle’s approach is different. Employee participation is work-relevant. It is easy to share news, align teams, recognize contributions and invite participation.   Our employee engagement rates are consistently 5X higher than both traditional employee portals and social intranets.
