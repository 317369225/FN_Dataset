★What are Sharepoint alternatives for a company-wide intranet?In a ~500-1000 person company, what alternatives are there for a  document, file repository-style intranet portal? Bonus points if there is room and potential for other elements of the information workplace (such as collaboration, social, content management) down the road.
From my experience in the Australian market there is SharePoint, Intranet Dashboard, Confluence and Claromentis. There are lots of others, but these are just some I know if.
