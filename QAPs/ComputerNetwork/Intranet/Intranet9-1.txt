★Why is Google's intranet system named Moma?
Circa 2006, I was curious about this and did some digging inside the company. There was an internal page that explained that the specific etymology is unknown but is not related to the Museum of Modern Art. The story it said is that the intranet is sort of the home for employees and the place to go home to. It's like your "mother" -- aka momma.  Then shortened to 'moma' so it was unique.
