â˜…What is a good intranet system for a nonprofit?We are a small-medium nonprofit with 9 offices across the country, and we are looking for an easy-to-use and affordable site/service on which we can share necessary documents, news, and other info.
Have you considered Igloo ? It's subscription based - which means you will never have to worry about hosting, server space, updates, and the likes. It offers file sharing, social newsfeeds so everyone can have a voice, corporate blogs for sharing what's happening, wikis for policies, shared calendars (for teams, or departments, or even the whole company), and a great people directory so you can easily find the person or skills you are looking for. Plus, it looks amazing because it's easily customizable - so it will look and feel like your non profit. They also offer a free trial version - to test it out - and have large discounts for non profit.
