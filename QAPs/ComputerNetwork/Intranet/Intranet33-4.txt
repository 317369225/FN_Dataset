â˜…What is important to consider when designing an intranet for a large company?I am helping my company audit our internal web site so we can have a more efficient system. I would like to know what other companies are doing that works.
One of our clients, Spencer Mains from Giant Agency, was kind enough to present his 12 steps to a successful intranet launch at one of our events. Here is the video: Giant's Race to the Starting Line with Spencer Mains - it's quite long but very educational. If you are in the market for an intranet platform for a large company, I would recommend checking out Igloo, an intranet you'll actually like. We even offer a free trial so you can test the solution and see if you like it.
