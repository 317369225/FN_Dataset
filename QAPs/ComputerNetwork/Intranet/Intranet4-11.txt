â˜…What is the best Intranet platform for a midsize company?Love the google docs functionality but their sites functionality for top down navigation and rich controlled sharing is pretty thin. Sharepoint makes my brain hurt every time I look at it... What are people using for a company bigger than a startup (so need more than just docs) and smaller than a full size corp?
We are company of 1000+ employees with offices worldwide. We transitioned our intranet to a social platform called Socialtext. Not only does it offer a place to house content/documents, but it also has valuable 'social' features that allow employees to have online conversations and create blogs. Socialtext also allows admins to create multiple, customized dashboards (intranet home pages) for various employee groups. From there, employees can also further customize their dashboards with widgets (similar to iGoogle functionality). We also leverage the mobile version of this platform, so employees can stay connected on-the-go. It's helping us break down silos, keep our employees better informed, reduce inefficient communications, and offer new ways of educating our employees. http://www.socialtext.com
