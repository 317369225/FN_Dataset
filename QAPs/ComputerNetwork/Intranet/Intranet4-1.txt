★What is the best Intranet platform for a midsize company?Love the google docs functionality but their sites functionality for top down navigation and rich controlled sharing is pretty thin. Sharepoint makes my brain hurt every time I look at it... What are people using for a company bigger than a startup (so need more than just docs) and smaller than a full size corp?
If you decide to go with a Social Business platform (and it sounds like you may already be familiar with the benefits of such) you have many options to choose from, most offering roughly the same set of features and value proposition. If you're looking just at current feature set you could probably set up a dart board with all the different options and see which one you hit (maybe take the first one you hit twice to make it more fun?). Our product, Communifire [1] would be on the dart board. One of the ways we set ourselves apart from the others however is the relationship we establish with our customers. We are fanatical about our support of our customers and offer an unprecedented voice to the customer in the future product development in order to make sure that it not only meets the needs today but evolves in a direction that is consistent with their changing needs. Oh, and we're also much more reasonably priced than the others mentioned above.  [1] www.axerosolutions.com
