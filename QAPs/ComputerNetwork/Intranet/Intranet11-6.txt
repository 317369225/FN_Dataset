â˜…Should an Intranet have a name or identity?
I agree with the answers above - we always encourage clients to give the intranet a name. We had a client a couple of years ago that generated 283 suggested names from their employees ( 93 individuas participated ) - that was a record for us. We posted a selection of names also with accompanying logos that we provided for the projects here http://www.claromentis.com/blog/...
