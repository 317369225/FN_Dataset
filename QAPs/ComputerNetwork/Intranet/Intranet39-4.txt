â˜…What are the top intranet solutions for a small professional services company?
Have you considered Igloo (an intranet you'll actually like)? 1) 100% cloud and responsive so it works well with iPhones, iPads and most devices 2) Easy drag-and-drop widgets and WYSIWYG editor - if you know how to use Quora, you will know how to use Igloo. 3) Nice search and tag capabilities - even filters to choose which tag to filter by. Search will also tell you which type of items it returns (blog post, wiki article, document, video, user, etc.) . 4) Unfortunately, this is not an option yet but within the company, we use forums, blogs and wikis for information that needs to be searchable (policies, SOP, manuals, etc.) 5) We have likes and comments, and you can choose to automatically offer "points" to users for engaging with content (gamification). 6) Built in stats - for free. We are nice like that. 7) We have a desktop version of our product, as well as the usual version. We also have a Free Trial that you can use for as long as you want, just to make sure we fit your needs. When you are ready to upgrade, we will just switch you (and all your documents and configuration) over to the paying version.
