â˜…Should organizations consider using Facebook as a corporate intranet?I'm curious to hear opinions as to whether companies should consider using Facebook as a corporate Intranet. Pros/Cons?
I would not recommend using Facebook as the platform for your intranet. However, I do think you should create a Facebook group page for current employees and populate it with social community building efforts to encourage more engagement from your employees.
