★How is Jive's social intranet priced?I'm looking for more than the publicly available statement that it's priced by volume.  Approximate rates, tiers, etc.
I don't know if it is still accurate but on 20 July 2011 Christopher Morace (Jive SVP of Products) explained Jive pricing perhaps as well as you're likely to find until you talk to the company directly about your specific situation: http://www.quora.com/Jive-Softwa.... Jive's pricing is as follows: Employee Engage Platform (used within a company for collaboration) is priced per user/year.  It can by delivered on premise/private cloud or as a service from the cloud. Customer Engage Platform (used to engage with customers) is priced in pageview tranche and is also an annual subscription. This is done so that customers only pay for what they are using. There is an entry point for low traffic sites and then it scales up to accommodate some of the most highly trafficked public sites in the world. The engage platform gives access to Jive's app market so that a variety of solutions can be automatically integrated into Jive. Currently all of these come with a 1 month free trial and then are charged per user/month.  Examples of vendors creating Jive apps are solutions like Spigit (Innovation), SalesCrunch (Sales Enablement & Prospecting), CrowdFactory (Social Campaigns), Tungle (Calendaring), Gliffy (Visualization App), Box (Enterprise Content Accessibility), Salesforce (Collaborative Selling)...you get the idea. New ones are being added weekly. I think the first one (Employee Engage Platform) is what Christopher references as starting at $12/user/month. It is unclear where it goes after starting there however. Apparently there are implementation costs on top of that that vary greatly depending on your circumstances. My guess is that this pricing and the implementation costs have prompted questions such as: What alternatives are there to Jive Software for creating an internal social network? Who are Jive's competitors?
