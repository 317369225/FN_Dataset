★Is social media killing the intranet?As firewalls get penetrated by the growth of mobiles and handheld devices, and employees connect with each other on networks like Facebook, should companies start looking at social media networks (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter / Yammer) seriously as internal or employee communication channels? More effective than an Intranet?
Social media has changed the routing through an intranet. While exploring an intranet was first alot of clicking and hoping you could find the right information, you are now guided by fellow employees. Also information specially selected for you is pushed towards you.   A document stays a document and organisation rules stay organisation rules, but the handling of content is more flexible and targeted than ever.
