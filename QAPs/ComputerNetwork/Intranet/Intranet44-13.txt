â˜…What is the most all-inclusive internally-focused social media/intranet/collaboration and knowledge management platform on the market today?
What you have mentioned is a very wide array of tools. Most of what you've mentioned are richly featured products, and have the potential to meet most of what you need to do. The challenges are almost always in adoption, so the right question to ask is, which of the tools is the right fit for your company culture and would lead to effortless (well, almost) adoption. A tool like Campfire is very different in character from, say, MediaWiki or SocialText. I also think that the email piece of the KM puzzle is left unsolved by most tools. Saying that the email problem should no longer come up as you now have a KM tool to do all your Knowledge intensive conversation is a bad argument. Do look at our product http://grexit.com which is the simplest way ever to make sure knowledge does not die in email inboxes.
