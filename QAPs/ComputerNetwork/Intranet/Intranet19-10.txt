â˜…Will enterprise social networks replace intranets?
It is changing! Intranets are productivity drainer and lack any motivation to share knowledge over that platform. Combining the two is best way forward.

By that I mean, socializing within the business premise and bringing your knowledge from social networks to business is great way to collaborate, share and discover knowledge.
