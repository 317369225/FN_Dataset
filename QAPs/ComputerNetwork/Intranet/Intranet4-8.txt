â˜…What is the best Intranet platform for a midsize company?Love the google docs functionality but their sites functionality for top down navigation and rich controlled sharing is pretty thin. Sharepoint makes my brain hurt every time I look at it... What are people using for a company bigger than a startup (so need more than just docs) and smaller than a full size corp?
I would say, even with its warts, Google Apps is a great solution. Two killer features set it apart: Baked in collaboration features - all Apps products have really well-thought through, scalable, baked-in collaboration. In this age of the 'collaborative enteprise', this is indispensable. Search - as every employee of any large enterprise knows, a document management system/intranet without good search is useless. Google knows how to do Search.
