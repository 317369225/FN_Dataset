Have you considered using Basecamp? It seems that Basecamp allows for what you are seeking (they have an app available for the iPhone) and they are browser-based, so they have a mobile web interface as well as the desktop version. You are able to share multiple types of documents via drag-and-drop and you can see documents by user as well as by project. There is a discussion feature and much more available for users (like labeling, email notifications, templates, et cetera).
