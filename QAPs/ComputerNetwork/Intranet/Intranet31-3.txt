★What is the purpose of having a company intranet, and what should be posted on it?Should it be for top down communication? A notice board? Inter-company communication? A recipe sharing hub? An idea portal? All of the above? What's the point of it and how should it be used to optimal effect?
Intranet should logically serve only two purpose. 1. Free flow communication both ways. Just top to down will be broadcasting! 2. Knowledge management. A central place to store all related knowledge, files, notes making it easy for people to self discover, improve, contribute and help spread ideas, approach, success and failure lessons. Rest all other features are extension. To start try to fulfill only the above  purpose, and then as it grows and build, add other functionality and options. One of the better way to get success with your intranet initiative.
