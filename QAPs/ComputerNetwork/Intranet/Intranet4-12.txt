★What is the best Intranet platform for a midsize company?Love the google docs functionality but their sites functionality for top down navigation and rich controlled sharing is pretty thin. Sharepoint makes my brain hurt every time I look at it... What are people using for a company bigger than a startup (so need more than just docs) and smaller than a full size corp?
All of the above suggestions are good.  I work for Interact Intranet and we see lots of mid-sized companies struggle with the vast potential of a SharePoint implementation.  If you're looking for a single system that provides easy to use and intelligent document management, collaboration tools and work flows from a company that lives and breathes intranet then we might just be able to help... http://www.interact-intranet.com
