â˜…What comes next in enterprise social networks and Intranets?Products like Yammer and Salesforce Chatter are still in their infancy. What will come next? What are the issues the existing problems do not solve well?
I would still like to see an end to e-mail. I see this system as a productivity drain and not conducive to the new age of business. We are now witnessing a reduction on internal e-mails due to better online collaboration and intranets. The next step is to reduce external e-mails through an extranet infrastructure that allows outside parties to play nice within a corporate infrastructure. The other big change will be access. We're seeing BYOD in full swing now. The next step is bring your own computer. Once that happens the heavy security walls that IT have been placing for many years will be forced to change to be more accepting of alternative access points (phones, tablets, macs).
