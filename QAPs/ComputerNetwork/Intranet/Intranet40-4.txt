★How does your company share key info with all their employees?  intranet?  email?  online tool like yammer or chatter?please include any detail about how big your company is...lot easier problem when you are just 5 folks
At Infowelders we use Chatter from Salesforce for internal bulletins, news, content sharing, and collaboration on deals, projects, and everything in between.  We have 10 employees, 3 remote.  It's been marketed as "Facebook for the enterprise", but it's more Twitter than Facebook in my opinion. Chatter is beneficial regardless of whether you are a Salesforce customer or not.  We are a Salesforce customer and partner, and we use Salesforce for marketing, sales, project management, PTO, expenses, and more, so having Chatter seamlessly integrated into the context we are used to working in makes it much more valuable and easy to adopt.  Not only can we share general business information via Chatter, we can also collaborate on specific records and allow that conversation to be transparent to anyone who is following a specific user or record.  Salesforce has also given all customers an additional 5000 Chatter-only licenses to every customer for free to invite other employees to the conversation who are not Salesforce users. If you are not a Salesforce customer, you can still get pretty much all of the features of Chatter, just in a non-Salesforce Chatter-only environment.  Details on the top 10 uses can be found here: https://www.chatter.com/why/.  Some of the key features are: User feeds Sharing files Mentions Topics Search-enabled Private and public groups Mobile and desktop apps Chatter is not only for small businesses.  One of the many big reference companies Salesforce has is Dell, who is also a Salesforce customer.  Salesforce also has several customer case studies posted here: http://www.salesforce.com/chatte...
