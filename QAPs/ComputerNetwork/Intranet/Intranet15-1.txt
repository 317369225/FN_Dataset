★Is Confluence a good cms for a corporate intranet?Or is it better as an add-on as a wiki? It seems the plug-ins for Confluence are not that easy to integrate.
Confluence is one of, if not THE, most sophisticated wikis and Intranet platforms on the market. It is also a flexible "application deployment platform" - meaning many of the plugins are "applications" deployed or integrated with the wiki, and by bringing the data and the applications together on a single central platform - it is a VERY powerful productivity system. It is not really a structure CMS or DMS in the strict records management sense of the words, but by integrating one of those for your raw file management  - like Alfresco of SharePoint, you can get that very needed yet very different purposed functionality still from a single system. One access, many many many many functions. Endless really. Not sure where you heard that plugins for Confluence are hard to integrate. Sure, some require configurations (such as additional licenses if commercial, or server addresses if networked to other systems, etc.), but still - that is not difficult. Plugin management is through a single admin management portal. In sum - and CERTAINLY a short list - with Confluence you get: Ad hoc unstructured content development - for project management, planning, spec development, even party planning - easy, for whatever you need. Structured content support through embed and edit connectors supporting MS Office, Google Docs, DropBox, and more to come! Native integrations with structured content and task management - systems like JIRA or TaskDock. What more do you want from an Intranet?
