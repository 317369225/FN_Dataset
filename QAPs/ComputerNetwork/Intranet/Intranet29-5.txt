â˜…What are the best practices to launch a social intranet?I would like to know what are the most important things we should consider when launching a new social intranet.
Focus on the actual business needs. It is too easy to turn on features with modern CMSs but without employees knowing the actual purpose of the tools they will quickly drop in use. Speak to your employees (interviews, surveys, focus groups) and find out what they actually need to conduct their business. Not all companies are ready for collaboration sites (Team Sites) or are comfortable with commenting. If your organization has no exposure at the moment to these tools, it may be best to start slow and ensure that employees are given lots of notice to what the new site will do and what the purpose of these changes are.
