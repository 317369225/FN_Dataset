â˜…Which is best for a corporate intranet, WordPress, MediaWiki, or Open Atrium?
Have you considered Igloo, an intranet you'll actually like ? Their intranets come pre-packaged with all the features you would want or need: file sharing, folders, dedicated team spaces, blog, wikis, forums, etc. It's also social and lets you tie together documents with the people who created them, the employees who are currently working on them and the person who would need them, through tasks, comments, social newsfeed and direct messages. But, best of all, they have a free trial which means you can decide for yourself if this is the right platform for you without having to spend a lot of time or money on it.
