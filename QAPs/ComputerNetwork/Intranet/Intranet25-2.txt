★Should organizations consider using Facebook as a corporate intranet?I'm curious to hear opinions as to whether companies should consider using Facebook as a corporate Intranet. Pros/Cons?
That would be a huge mistake.  There are so many stories out right now about employers and potential employers snooping through Facebook profiles for dirt.  Also, I am not sure what type of services you are expecting out of facebook for business use.  An intranet page is for too complex to run on this platform
