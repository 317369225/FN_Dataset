â˜…Will enterprise social networks replace intranets?
I think it is absolutely inevitable that intranets will become social networks. But different companies will take different approaches, and at different speeds. Some will throw out their intranet and replace it with a new social network. Others will gradually add more social features to their existing intranet, or wait for their vendor to do the same. But in 5-10 years, any intranet that doesn't have strong social features will be considered prehistoric. Which is the right approach to take? I think that very much depends on how happy you are with your existing intranet. If it's working well, you are more likely to socially-enable it gradually. If it's not working for you, you are more likely to replace it sooner.
