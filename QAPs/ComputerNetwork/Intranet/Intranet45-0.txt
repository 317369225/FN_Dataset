â˜…If a company starts using an enterprise-level social business suite (think Jive or Chatter), what happens to the intranet?Does the intranet get phased out? If not, what does the intranet do that the SBS doesn't or can't do? How do you make both useful?
James Robertson, perhaps the world's foremost authority on intranets, says that intranets have 5 purposes: Content (e.g. policy documents) Communication (e.g. corporate news) Activity (e.g. expense form) Collaboration (e.g. project wiki) Culture (e.g. noon hour jogging club)The marketing around social business suites is focused on the last two: Collaboration and Culture. So on whether or not the intranet can disappear or not, I think the question is: Can your social business suite support Content, Communication and Activity?
