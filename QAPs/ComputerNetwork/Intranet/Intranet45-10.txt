â˜…If a company starts using an enterprise-level social business suite (think Jive or Chatter), what happens to the intranet?Does the intranet get phased out? If not, what does the intranet do that the SBS doesn't or can't do? How do you make both useful?
My view is that it will make the intranets richer if a social layer is added on top of it, enterprise intranets are pretty much static in their nature with content creators, approval processes etc but with always an outdated content/information. The real time activity streams would definitely bring value if considered while building any intranet portals. Just that enterprises are not ready to allow free form of information exchange or post what ever comes to your mind kind of thinking.
