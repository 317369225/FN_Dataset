★What is the best Search Engine for a private intranet?Something like Google Search would be ideal - but our website content is all locked down (password controlled), only authenticated users can access the content. The ASP code is on a Microsoft Server.
In addition to FAST and the Google Search Appliance, you might consider Autonomy (http://www.autonomy.com/index.en... - recently acquired by HP) and Endeca (http://www.endeca.com/en/home.html). Both provide enterprise search. I don't have any experience to say which is best, although I know that enterprise search can be very challenging. You're essentially building  a little search engine in your own walled-off intranet with the added complexity of permissions (who should have access to Accounting's spreadsheets?) and without the benefit of hyperlink data to help with ranking.
