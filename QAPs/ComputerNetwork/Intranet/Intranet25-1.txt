â˜…Should organizations consider using Facebook as a corporate intranet?I'm curious to hear opinions as to whether companies should consider using Facebook as a corporate Intranet. Pros/Cons?
No, as a company i would like to being able to control my data, with Facebook you don't really control your own data and also not the data of your employees. This is the reason we are setting up government owned social intranet with Elgg in the Netherlands, almost same functionalities (although less sophisticated) and we control the data and all other aspects of the intranet.
