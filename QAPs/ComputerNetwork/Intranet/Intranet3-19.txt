★What are Sharepoint alternatives for a company-wide intranet?In a ~500-1000 person company, what alternatives are there for a  document, file repository-style intranet portal? Bonus points if there is room and potential for other elements of the information workplace (such as collaboration, social, content management) down the road.
I talk to a lot of SharePoint users at conferences. Their #1 complaint? "SharePoint's clunky and not too easy to use." Some of them have adopted alternatives like Bloomfire.com, which are ridiculously easy to use: http://www.bloomfire.com/intranet/ The secret sauce with these modern alternatives is Apple-inspired design. Software should be a joy to use, not something you fight with. Clunky systems tend to turn off users. Not a good sign when you're trying to share knowledge with everyone, not just with the tech-savvy people. Systems shouldn't turn off the tech-averse.
