★What is the difference between Ethernet and Intranet?
It's a lot like the differences between kittens, potatoes and purple. Entirely independent concept with very minimal overlap with minor exception that both kittens and potatoes can in some circumstances be purple. Ethernet has a reasonably specific meaning.  It's a set of hardware and protocol specifications for creating a local area network.  That puts it at layer one and two. An Intranet is essentially a private region of the internet.  Using any of a variety of techniques a business (typically) will wall off one or more subnetwork.  Its protocols are the same as the internet in general, in some cases with more permissive security under the assumption that internal users are trustworthy.  Conceptually an Intranet is a layer 3/4 construct. So what is the difference, well... they are almost entirely different.  The intersection between them is that an Intranet is almost certainly using Ethernet at the physical and data link layers.
