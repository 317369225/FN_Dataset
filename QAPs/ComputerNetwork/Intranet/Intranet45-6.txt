â˜…If a company starts using an enterprise-level social business suite (think Jive or Chatter), what happens to the intranet?Does the intranet get phased out? If not, what does the intranet do that the SBS doesn't or can't do? How do you make both useful?
In my organization, we have a home grown solution for micro-blogging and we use SharePoint for other community/team sites. I don't see how in our organization the Intranet can get phased out because you will always want a place where policies and procedures as well as other regulated content (as in the case with my organization) needs to be stored. There is just some content you need to have stored someplace like an Intranet.
