★Should an Intranet have a name or identity?
aside from making an intranet seem part of the company, a name isn't necessary. But people like to pin names on things, hence the need to call it something and give it an identity. Providing it helps users do their jobs better, then whether it has a name is irrelevant. More time should be spent making sure it does what it's supposed to do than wondering what to call it. If stuck - then …intranet… usually works.
