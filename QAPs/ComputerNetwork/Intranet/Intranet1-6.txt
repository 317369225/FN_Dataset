â˜…Is social media killing the intranet?As firewalls get penetrated by the growth of mobiles and handheld devices, and employees connect with each other on networks like Facebook, should companies start looking at social media networks (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter / Yammer) seriously as internal or employee communication channels? More effective than an Intranet?
Hmm.. not yet! Social media and intranets are still obviously different. Intranets are for detailed information, documentation and company specific apps, Social media makes connecting and communicating more possible then ever. An intranet with social media integration is best of both worlds, at this moment in time. We seem to have a similar setup as Brian and it works for us right now. However i believe internal communication tools like intranets and social media, when you use it that way, are still mainly for internal 'communication'. And in order to get people to use it, connect, interact etc. I believe only a strong activation strategy works. So don't focus on the tools. Simply use what works for your company. But focus on the people, help them out!
