â˜…What comes next in enterprise social networks and Intranets?Products like Yammer and Salesforce Chatter are still in their infancy. What will come next? What are the issues the existing problems do not solve well?
We wrote in detail about the future of social tools in enterprise collaboration environments in this issue of the Tech Forecast: http://www.pwc.com/us/en/technol... You can download the full issue in PDF, or read each individual article in HTML. The most advanced tools we profiled pointed toward being embedded with the workflow, rather than just functioning as standalone social networking platforms. One of the tools enabled semantic search and retrieval and was based on semantic web standards. If you think about it, a lot of the value in social networking has to do with enabling relevant feedback-response loops and an interactive linked data environment. Enabling that kind of environment helps reduce information overload and increase information relevance. There's a short animation we posted at the site above that explains how social networking can enrich the overall information environment. Most enterprise social collaboration tools focus primarily on the human interface rather than a linked data machine interface. But the ones with the best human interfaces are the most popular. IMHO, the enterprises getting the most bang for their buck in social networking focus on the data layer in addition to the human interface--i.e., they help machines help us find what we're looking for.
