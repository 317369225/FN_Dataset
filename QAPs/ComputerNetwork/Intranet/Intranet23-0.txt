â˜…Community Management: Is there a self serve, inexpensive, solution like Jive's Social Intranet?
eXo Platform (Open Source Enterprise Social Platform and Enterprise Portal | eXo) is an open source alternative to Jive. It's a social collaboration platform that is highly extensible and based on open standards. With eXo you can not only build an enterprise social network, but you can also build a website, a social intranet or a community website.
