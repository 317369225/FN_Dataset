★What is the best way to build company intranet?
The simple answer:  bitnami. Head over to bitnami.org and check out their list of stacks.  They provide downloads that do pretty much all of the heavy lifting involved in trying out lots of different software including several CMS and wikis.  I was tasked with choosing software to build my company intranet last year and this enabled me to test out some of the best and brightest software out there in a very short period of time.  It's especially convenient if you already have a vmware server ready to roll because all of their stacks can be downloaded as vmware appliances.
