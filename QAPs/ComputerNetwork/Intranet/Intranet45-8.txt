★If a company starts using an enterprise-level social business suite (think Jive or Chatter), what happens to the intranet?Does the intranet get phased out? If not, what does the intranet do that the SBS doesn't or can't do? How do you make both useful?
Quoting Toby Ward at CMSWire, this is what Intranets looked like earlier - http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enter... Version 1.0: Welcome page (a welcome message and a phone number) Version 1.1: Bulletin board (simple communications) Version 1.2: Corporate newsletter (structured news & limited document management) Version 1.3: Help Desk (simple transactions like the employee directory) Version 1.4: Corporate Store (more complex transactions such as e-HR and self-service) Version 1.5: The Portal (authorization, authentication, application & database integration) Social Collaboration Tools like Qontext (www.qontext.com) can be considered as Intranet 2.0.  We have designed Qontext to heighten employee engagement and achieve results through enhanced participation, self-expression, collective intelligence, and conversations. Qontext: Structures information according to how people use it (and not according to the organization chart) Follows a role-based personalization approach that brings the information in the portal to users (than force users to navigate maze-like spaces to locate information) So, to answer your question - the intranet hasn't gone away, it is present, merely in a new form, if you use tools like Qontext.
