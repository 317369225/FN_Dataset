â˜…What is the purpose of having a company intranet, and what should be posted on it?Should it be for top down communication? A notice board? Inter-company communication? A recipe sharing hub? An idea portal? All of the above? What's the point of it and how should it be used to optimal effect?
The main point of intranets (or portals, enterprise social platforms, give the thing a name) is task completion for the individual and business goals completion for the organisation. Where both items meet there is a sweet spot. Top down communication is not something that is on the task completion list of individuals (at least given the standard good-news-show type of top down messaging). Preferable an intranet should serve the individual interests and from there move towards the business goals. If is doesn't serve the task completion aspect or if the intranet doesn't solve the issues individuals are facing better than other tools or platforms, it won't be used. So the purpose as for everything within a company is to contribute to the business goals. If doesn't contribute directly or indirectly it is waste.
