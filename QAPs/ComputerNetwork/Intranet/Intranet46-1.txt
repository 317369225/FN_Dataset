â˜…How often should you consider an intranet re-design?
the only time you should consider an intranet redesign is when the current one no longer does its job. Any cosmetic changes are simply that - cosmetic. Intanets should be functional and meet users needs - anything more and you're wasting time and resources. Fulfill users needs - not stakeholders desires.
