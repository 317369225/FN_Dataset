â˜…What is the best Intranet platform for a midsize company?Love the google docs functionality but their sites functionality for top down navigation and rich controlled sharing is pretty thin. Sharepoint makes my brain hurt every time I look at it... What are people using for a company bigger than a startup (so need more than just docs) and smaller than a full size corp?
I think Papyrs might be one of the best intranet solutions for midsize companies.. They have a really nice and simple way to set up an intranet. Drag and drop features that anybody in a company understands. No technical skills required. Which I think it's key if you want users to adopt it.
