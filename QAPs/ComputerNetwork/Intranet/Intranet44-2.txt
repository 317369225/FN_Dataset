â˜…What is the most all-inclusive internally-focused social media/intranet/collaboration and knowledge management platform on the market today?
Okay, I agree with nearly everything Gil Yehuda said. I'm also going to work from the same assumption - that you are not starting with tools and instead have begun by working with future users of the intra-thingy, determining needs, aligning with the overall business goals of the organization, etc. etc. If not...backtrack. Starting this process by choosing a platform is like building a car and beginning with the upholstery. That said, I think those of us who work in this field sometimes make it seem like it's impossible to make good decisions when you do get to the tools stage - the vendors have such different approaches, the strategic purpose is so pivotal, yadda yadda yadda. So here's my two cents: I am an unashamed Jive fan (and I don't work for Jive.) Jive has much of what you're looking for...I think more than any of the other platforms on your list with which I've had direct experience. I'm a huge fan of MediaWiki, too, but it isn't anything near a complete solution to your list of needs. As Gil points out, your list of possible vendors is all over the map and some offer more than others. Their prices vary considerably, too. So, I'd suggest you go back and prioritize your needs. Think about must-haves versus want-to-haves. Figure out how many tools you can REALISTICALLY and SUCCESSFULLY manage and integrate into your organization's work flow. That should help you narrow that vendor list down considerably. Then reach out to the salespeople and let them make their best pitch. My final word of advice: even the 'best of breed' solution is worthless if people don't use it. The hard work of enterprise social networks begins after the launch. I'd spend at least as much time planning for how you're going to integrate the platform into the way work gets done at your company as in choosing the tools.
