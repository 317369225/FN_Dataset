â˜…What is best of Wiki or SharePoint for an intranet, and why?
The main problem companies find with adoption is with siloed apps. Meaning you have one app for wikis, SharePoint for document storage and maybe sites, Ideas with another app, Instant messaging in another.. What works best is when there is a daily draw and desire to go onto the Intranet. Stand-alone apps just don't have that draw as you only go to them when you need them. When you have a suite of apps like MangoApps for instance, my colleagues and customers are logged in every day, all day and participate in discussions, message each other, assign tasks, update wikis... all from one place. In the cloud or on-premise, MangoApps delivers. http://www.mangospring.com/prici...
