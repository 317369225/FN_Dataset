★What is the purpose of having a company intranet, and what should be posted on it?Should it be for top down communication? A notice board? Inter-company communication? A recipe sharing hub? An idea portal? All of the above? What's the point of it and how should it be used to optimal effect?
From a compliance and HR perspective, intranets can be a useful way to make policies and applications easily accessible to a large and widely dispersed employee base.   It also can increase operational efficiency by allowing employees to do certain tasks self-service rather than email or call HR or legal to handle -- standard NDAs, vacation requests, etc. Top down communications are important on occasion and an intranet is often a good way to storage it so that people can go and read it if they deleted the email blast that went out from management. I have been at companies that had an intranet and then a company that had an intranet and an enterprise social network.  I viewed the latter as something entirely different and I did not have a lot of success using it.
