★How can enterprises create an activity stream (like Facebook and Twitter) in their SharePoint intranet?
In addition to SharePoint's native activity feed, you can also integrate Qontext into SharePoint (www.qontext.com/sharepoint) to take advantage of an activity stream that can also  notify you of activities going on in the rest of the apps that you use (e.g. CRM, ERP). Qontext allows you to collaborate around documents stored within SharePoint, and a has a host of other features (e.g. wikis, blogs, discussions, polls etc.)  that get added regularly by our team. You can request a demo here - (www.qontext.com/demo) and we'll be happy to help.
