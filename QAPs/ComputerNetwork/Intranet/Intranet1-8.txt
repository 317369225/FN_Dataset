â˜…Is social media killing the intranet?As firewalls get penetrated by the growth of mobiles and handheld devices, and employees connect with each other on networks like Facebook, should companies start looking at social media networks (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter / Yammer) seriously as internal or employee communication channels? More effective than an Intranet?
Work is a balance between exploration and discovery, organization and execution. While social communications are fantastic at enabling awareness, exploration and discovery - the more creative and learning elements of work - they do little to enable the organization and execution that enable us to get things done. So - social media is exactly half an intranet. This is what is so special about our product - http://jostle.me - it solve both halves with equal usability.
