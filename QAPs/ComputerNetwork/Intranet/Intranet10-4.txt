â˜…What is the best Search Engine for a private intranet?Something like Google Search would be ideal - but our website content is all locked down (password controlled), only authenticated users can access the content. The ASP code is on a Microsoft Server.
If "Google Search" is your ideal then Google Search Appliance is your best bet. It can be configured to work with Active Directory so that even your "locked down" assets can be indexed (using a supplied account of course). When serving results for a "secured search", it takes into consideration the Access Control List (ACL) of the resource and only displays it in the results page if your account has access to it. We've successfully configured the GSA to index Sharepoint Sites, Windows fileshares, IIS sites and most of them have restricted access. In all cases, the GSA served results more relevant compare to what Sharepoint returned.
