★What is the most all-inclusive internally-focused social media/intranet/collaboration and knowledge management platform on the market today?
Hmm, interesting problem.  I don't think there's one out of the box solution that will tackle all of those things.  Sounds like you'll need to Frankenstein services together to address all of your issues.  One thing you should take into consideration is adoption rate. At my current job, I found that as a company, we have certain processes.  Then each group has their own processes.  Then each individual has their own process.  We had some failed attempts of getting mass adoption of "X" tool/service because people ended up falling back to what they're familiar with.
