★Intranets: What alternatives to Yammer are easily white labeled or better branded?
When you're so specific about using Yammer, you'd be better off using it, even if you find it lacking in some areas.  Because, I'm sure that you'd find something amiss in the alternatives as well.  This dissatisfaction will be only augmented by the fact that you're so convinced about Yammer's features and their usefulness that you don't want anything plus. You could perhaps talk to Yammer reps to see if there's something that you can do beyond what you currently see.   Perhaps this is not the exact answer that you're looking for, but in my experience, this is a more practical approach that'll save you precious time searching for new alternatives. On a side note, I work for KineticGlue www.kineticglue.com, an enterprise social collaboration platform.  But yes, we have project and document management capabilities built-in!
