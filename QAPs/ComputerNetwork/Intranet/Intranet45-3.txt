★If a company starts using an enterprise-level social business suite (think Jive or Chatter), what happens to the intranet?Does the intranet get phased out? If not, what does the intranet do that the SBS doesn't or can't do? How do you make both useful?
That depends on what you mean by "Intranet."  A SBS suite doesn't necessarily compete with any existing Intranet elements, but is ideally - as Srinivas Seshadri said - glue that connects all the existing bits of content and knowledge in the organization. That is the approach we're taking at Fogbeam Labs.  Our Social Knowledge Management products are all about integration and generally serve as complements to existing components, rather than replacements for them. Edit:  It's also important to consider what an Intranet is.  The word "Intranet" is short for "Intra-network".. think about it.  In some senses, everything running on your network is your Intranet; but by historical usage "Intranet" has generally been considered (by many) to refer mainly to http based applications.  But, at any rate, if you take Intranet to mean "any and all http based sources of content / information / knowledge that are running on my local network," you can see that the Intranet isn't exactly one discrete "thing" that comes and goes, lives and dies.  Especially in larger organizations, where the Intranet might include multiple wikis, blog servers, CMSs, forums, dashboards, etc.   The richness of the "stuff" that can compose an Intranet is exactly why we feel that an SBS / SKM suite is "glue" that binds things together and provides contextual browsing, search, routing / notifications, activity streams, etc. in a way that unites - rather than replaces - existing Intranet elements.
