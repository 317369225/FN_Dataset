★Creating an intranet visual design in SharePoint?I'm writing an an article on creating a visual design for SharePoint-based intranets. I've already got a pile of good screenshot examples. What I'm looking for are quotes that I can use in the article, giving insight/tips/tricks/options for creating a good visual design in SharePoint. (All answers used will be fully credited, please include a URL if you'd like me to also use that.)
"Any design application on top of Sharepoint is just lipstick on the pig." ~ Dave Humphrey Jostle - check it out http://www.jostle.me - A simple, elegant, turnkey employee engagement intranet software. A new kind of intranet.   Jostle’s approach is different. Employee participation is work-relevant. It is easy to share news, align teams, recognize contributions and invite participation.   Our employee engagement rates are consistently 5X higher than both traditional employee portals and social intranets.
