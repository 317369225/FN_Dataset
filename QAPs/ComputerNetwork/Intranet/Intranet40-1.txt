★How does your company share key info with all their employees?  intranet?  email?  online tool like yammer or chatter?please include any detail about how big your company is...lot easier problem when you are just 5 folks
We're still primarily email-based, but we're slowly moving forward... We use an open-source discussion forum system (PHPbb) for some discussion forums, but we're moving those to Jive Software.  We also set up an internal YouTube work-alike - it's open source software as well.  We record a lot of videos for training sessions, demos, sales presentations, even speeches/presentations from our annual sales conference. Functional groups (HR, legal, etc.) have more or less static pages on a Wiki-based intranet.  Again, we're planning on converting these all over to Jive. We also use instant messaging and Skype for quick, one-off communication. Lastly, we're experimenting with Yammer but also trying other alternatives like Chatter, an open source platform called Status.net, and the microblogging features built into the latest version (4.5) of Jive Software.
