â˜…Is social media killing the intranet?As firewalls get penetrated by the growth of mobiles and handheld devices, and employees connect with each other on networks like Facebook, should companies start looking at social media networks (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter / Yammer) seriously as internal or employee communication channels? More effective than an Intranet?
No I don't think so: it's making us rethink the intranet. The intranet should have been a social platform from the start but it wasn't. It's one of the reasons the intranet was generally seen as non-relevant by employees. I see social media as a layer on top or around the traditional intranet.
