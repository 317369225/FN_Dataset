★Which plugins should I use to build an Intranet in WordPress?
I'm a big fan of using WordPress for intranet development. I've developed an all in one intranet plugin for WordPress at http://www.simpleintranet.org.  It includes basic security/login to protect content, an activity feed ala Facebook, a souped up Employee Directory with extended user/company information. an employee search function, events listings and calendar as well as forms for HR etc..  Could save you a lot of time getting up and running.  I also can recommend (and own) various corporate template themes for businesses.
