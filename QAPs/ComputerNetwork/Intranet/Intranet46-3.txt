★How often should you consider an intranet re-design?
It all depends on how well it’s working. If it’s working efficiently and as it should then a redesign won’t be necessary, however the odds are that there will  be a few little details that you feel can work better. You should think  about looking to redesign if this is the case. I agree with Adam that you should probably map out all the potential enhancements and  then prioritise them. Consultancy can help, see - http://www.claromentis.com/globa... - for a typical example of what’s on offer. Basically, as long as you are happy with the intranet systems in place there’s no special reason to redesign – however, if you get a consultant they might  be able to suggest how to improve areas you want to redesign, as well as suggest areas you might not have thought of.
