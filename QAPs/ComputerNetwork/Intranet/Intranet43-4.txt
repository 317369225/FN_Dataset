â˜…Which one is better for a social intranet for a company: Slack or Flowdock?Slack has a good package but Flowdock has tagging. So which one should it be then?
Having tried flowdock and regularly using Slack, I would say neither. Slack is great at having immediate conversations with immediate solutions. But ff you sleep on a problem, then picking up the thread later is a massive pain. Flowdock in my limited experience solves threading and recall, but does not offer the multitude of integrations or the granular updates. You might be interested in trying out trackmemo.io, where we try to marry granularity of updates in Slack with tagging/threading of flowdock. [disclaimer: I am a co-founder]
