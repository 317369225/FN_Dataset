â˜…Is social media killing the intranet?As firewalls get penetrated by the growth of mobiles and handheld devices, and employees connect with each other on networks like Facebook, should companies start looking at social media networks (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter / Yammer) seriously as internal or employee communication channels? More effective than an Intranet?
Well, if you take a very narrow definition of an intranet, then yes. But an intranet is simply an internal facing portal, which is a collection of information and tools. Social media certainly adds to the intranet, but is certainly not a replacement.
