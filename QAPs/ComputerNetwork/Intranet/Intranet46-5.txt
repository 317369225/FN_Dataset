★How often should you consider an intranet re-design?
One other aspect to consider, especially with the recent intranet technology leaps and broad trends in the marketplace - social, BYODs etc- is whether you need a refresh simply because the external world has moved further on, and your existing intranet needs to catch up. For example when a company recognizes that more interaction, sharing and corporate social networking - see for example  http://www.claromentis.com/featu... -  can add value, and the existing system is still more of an intranet 1.0 because that was all that was available a few years ago - that might in itself dictate the need for a design refresh. So sometimes external technology evolution drives the need for an intranet refresh, rather than internal dissatisfaction with the existing system.
