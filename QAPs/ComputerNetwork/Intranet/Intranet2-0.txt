â˜…Intranets: Is Yammer useful in the workplace?
We use Yammer at Warner Bros. Records a lot in my department with Gabble. We have three groups: one private for just my department, one called Worklog and one called Readlist. Worklog is where you document when you work on a website. Because a lot of the work we do is database resident (read, not versioned) we have a format with hashtags for the domain so we can pull RSS feeds into a separate tool from that. Readlist is for posting articles, etc that people should take a look at. In general, once Yammer became more endemic to our work, its become essential, especially given that we're geographically distributed (4 offices)
