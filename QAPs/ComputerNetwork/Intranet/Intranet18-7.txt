â˜…What comes next in enterprise social networks and Intranets?Products like Yammer and Salesforce Chatter are still in their infancy. What will come next? What are the issues the existing problems do not solve well?
Although some businesses offer a shadow of this functionality currently, I am anxiously waiting the day that users can have truly one-on-one conversations with sales and support representatives via social media or chat. Waiting in a phone queue for 45 mins will hopefully become a thing of the past. Telus, for example, has begun a new trend by offering support over Twitter.
