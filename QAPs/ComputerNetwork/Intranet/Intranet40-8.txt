I work for a company that helps businesses share content no matter their size. The application we sell is called Mobile Briefcase, Mobile Briefcase App - Home Page This is a great team sharing app that allows you to share various file types in real time. Control what users view what files. Files can be viewed wherever you are no matter what your internet connection is. The app self organizes itself and is simple and easy to use. We work with companies looking to better organize their customers files or feel more secure about files they are sharing.
