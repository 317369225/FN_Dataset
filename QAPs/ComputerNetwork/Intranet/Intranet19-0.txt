â˜…Will enterprise social networks replace intranets?
100%, sure-shot, and without a shade of doubt - YES! Sooner rather than later, organisational leadership will realize that draconian intranets are more of a money+productivity drain than anything else, whereas ESN's simply deliver way more value both in terms of cost as well as employee efficiency (not to mention delivery speed / go-to-market and ease of multi-disciplinary collaboration) Disclosure: We customize & integrate ESN's for a living so I'm speaking from direct experience here.
