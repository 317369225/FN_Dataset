â˜…Which plugins should I use to build an Intranet in WordPress?
To follow up on John Bunka's fine and detailed answer. Kudos John. 1) I personally can't see a platform for anything peer to peer (as opposed to traditional top down pushing of info) without BuddyPress. In fact, I'd say you kinda have to start there and then build / look out from that starting point. 1.5) BuddyPress is a great product, but don't expect the boat load of plugins that you find with traditional WP. Yes, there are some great BP plugins. However, it's more about quality than quantity. 2) A BP + P2 (theme) "hybrid" might be interesting. It's something I've been considering but haven't had the time to experiment with. You might want to consider a custom BP activity for anything that passes through P2. That is, as far as I know (for example) a blog comment is not a BP activity / notification. Maybe you'd want it to be? 3) fwiw, I wanted to like CollabPress but it still feels like its a release or two away from winning my love. That said, I look at around 6 or so WP PM plugins and felt the same about all of them. That is, looks like it's time for some home grown customizations. --- And now please pardon the #ShamelessSelfPromotion. Here are a couple classes that I put together for working with BuddyPress => WPezClasses/class-wp-ezclasses-buddypress-editability-visibility-1 - This adds "Editability" to Visibility. That is, you can can BP profile fields that are displayed on a person's profile but maintained / updated by someone else (e.g., HR). => WPezClasses/class-wp-ezclasses-buddypress-relocate-bp-legacy-templates-1 - This just makes it ez to setup a plugin with all the BP legacy templates. In other words, if your theme isn't built for BP, BP will add the necessary templates. This makes is ez to manage them from a plugin and not part of the theme, so it's easier to switch themes, ideally. Note: This are not yet fully tested so please keep that in mind. If you have an input and/or feedback please let me know and I'll see what I can do.
