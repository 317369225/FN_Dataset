â˜…Why is Google's intranet system named Moma?
Google offices named things like meeting rooms after local landmarks. (Well, Mountain View ran out of that pretty fast and used world locations.) I had always remembered that the intranet system followed this convention, and was named after the Museum of Modern Art, which exists in several cities happily. Even as I write this, I can't say for sure that's the true origin, but it's certainly my impression.
