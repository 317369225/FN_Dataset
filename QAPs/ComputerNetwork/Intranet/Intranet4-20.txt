â˜…What is the best Intranet platform for a midsize company?Love the google docs functionality but their sites functionality for top down navigation and rich controlled sharing is pretty thin. Sharepoint makes my brain hurt every time I look at it... What are people using for a company bigger than a startup (so need more than just docs) and smaller than a full size corp?
Team-based solutions (as opposed to solutions rolled out across the entire company) might be a better fit. That way, teams can cherry-pick what they need to get the job done. Considering current mobile trends, I'd argue that a solution embracing smartphones & tablets will help teams be more productive. Try Bloomfire: http://www.bloomfire.com/intranet/ The bonus with team-based solutions is that they're designed to be launched immediately, without the need to wrangle with your IT department.
