★How does your company share key info with all their employees?  intranet?  email?  online tool like yammer or chatter?please include any detail about how big your company is...lot easier problem when you are just 5 folks
We use Rypple to communicate key information, public recognition, private coaching notes between managers and direct reports, and anonymous feedback at our company.  Now this comes with a sense of bias as I work for Rypple, but that being said communication has so many additional benefits beyond just collaborating with colleagues.  Rypple is social software designed around coaching, feedback, and recognition. Promoting the key social interactions which are already taking place in the workplace isn't rocket science.  People like getting recognized for the work they do, employees are asking for more feedback these days, and by making 1:1 interactions in the workplace more meaningful, people get more done. When you add social goals, coaching and personal development, and feedback to the mix, you now not only are sharing key communication for the company, but you begin to help people develop at work.  People take personal value out of the feedback they receive and make that part of the actions they are held accountable for. Lots of designs are taking a collaborative approach to sharing information, and I'll say they are all built around a good idea.  But if you can make the communication more than just collaboration then you've taken it to the next level.  www.rypple.com/tour Rypple is 30 people strong Located in Toronto, San Francisco, and Atlanta.
