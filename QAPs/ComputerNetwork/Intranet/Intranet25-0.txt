★Should organizations consider using Facebook as a corporate intranet?I'm curious to hear opinions as to whether companies should consider using Facebook as a corporate Intranet. Pros/Cons?
Until facebook comes up with a better way to separate personal and professional profiles within the site, I don't think companies should consider using it as a corporate intranet.  Facebook is intensely social and predominantly very personal - the photos and information that is shared on the channel is often inappropriate for work (for most people).  LinkedIn would be a better platform to consider using as this is designed as a professional network, rather than personal.
