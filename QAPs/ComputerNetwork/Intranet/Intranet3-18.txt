★What are Sharepoint alternatives for a company-wide intranet?In a ~500-1000 person company, what alternatives are there for a  document, file repository-style intranet portal? Bonus points if there is room and potential for other elements of the information workplace (such as collaboration, social, content management) down the road.
We get many clients coming over from Sharepoint and going to a WordPress open source solution using our Simple Intranet Wordpress plugin.  17% of all websites now run on WordPress, and it is quite easy to use. We have an add-on called Simple Files which looks and acts like DropBox, but can be self-hosted... it's very popular.  Other items like an employee directory with photos, a Facebook-like Activity Feed, forms and an event calendar are popular as well.  And the best part, although it is an install-yourself solution, it's only a one-time fee vs per user or higher monthly fees.
