â˜…How often should you consider an intranet re-design?
Good intranets continuously evolve. Plan around cycles of 3 months or so to keep drip-feeding updates. In practice more substantial overhauls happen about every 3 years, usually triggered by technology upgrades, corporate rebrands or re-structures. I agree with Phil that the driver for this should be external. However, it is also true that as the web evolves, employees have expectations of what a contemporary intranet should do and look like, a dated design sends out a message that the company is behind the times and doesn't invest in employees, much like shabby office decor.
