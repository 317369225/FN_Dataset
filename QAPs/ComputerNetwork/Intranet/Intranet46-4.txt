â˜…How often should you consider an intranet re-design?
As a short-term strategy, I would recommend mapping out all of the improvements, design changes and enhancements you can make and then scope them into six month intervals. Always work the low-hanging fruit first and prioritize the ones that will take more effort. The number of improvements one can make to their intranet will always exceed the time and the resources you have available. But mapping it out like this will not only give you a project plan to work on. It will also give you a longer term road-map that you can communicate to execs if necessary.
