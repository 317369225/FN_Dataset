★What is the most all-inclusive internally-focused social media/intranet/collaboration and knowledge management platform on the market today?
There is no good answer for this question as is. However the friendly salesperson representing each of the companies you list will gladly explain why their solution fits the bill. And they'd be right, and slightly wrong too. These are all good tools for something, but maybe not for you -- it depends on you. Imagine you were asking what the best shoe is. Someone will say -- don't you think the best shoe is the one that fits you and makes you feel good -- maybe solves your unique foot needs? There is no best-of-breed shoe. How about asking what is the best ball to use if you want to play sports? It kinda depends on what sport you are looking to play. There is no best of breed knowledge management, I mean, enterprise 2.0, I mean intranet collaboration, whatever, tool.  Read this for more: http://www.gilyehuda.com/2009/11... The tools you list range considerably. You might have the need to customize a solution, some tools allow for that more than others.  You might have unique deployment needs, or you might already have tools that solve parts of your problem that you need to integrate with. My recommendation -- get the advice of a well-respected expert in the field who can help you narrow your options and chart a course to success. You probably have lots of plans in place (since you'd never start off with tools selection anyway), so those plans should help guide you to limit this list even more.
