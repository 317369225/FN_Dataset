â˜…Should organizations consider using Facebook as a corporate intranet?I'm curious to hear opinions as to whether companies should consider using Facebook as a corporate Intranet. Pros/Cons?
FB is a public domain network making content more social. Not the ideal solution for corporate, but an ideal for communities. Only private clouds or networks will ensure data security, user policies and other checks for business.
