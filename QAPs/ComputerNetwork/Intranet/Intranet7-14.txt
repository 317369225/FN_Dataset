★What is a good intranet system for a nonprofit?We are a small-medium nonprofit with 9 offices across the country, and we are looking for an easy-to-use and affordable site/service on which we can share necessary documents, news, and other info.
I'd actually recommend http://www.silk.co. We use it ourselves internally. Several NGOs are using Silk right now as an intranet. It's free. You can start it quickly by uploading a CSV file and then add things like YouTube videos, twitter, feeds, document uploads or more. You can also tag people and departments and services so  you can build custom views. It automatically maps your offices from a column with location data on the CSV file. Here's a tutorial specifically on creating a knowledgebase.  https://www.silk.co/help/tutoria... It's a pretty sweet tool (I work there and love it for that).
