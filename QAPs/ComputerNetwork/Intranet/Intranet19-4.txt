â˜…Will enterprise social networks replace intranets?
I agree it is inevitable, however it will take longer than one might think. I suspect the vast majority of companies are still very wary about broadcasting the thoughts of every employee & for most executives this is a huge culture change & one that is not top of many peoples agenda. There are huge benefits for organisations that can increase the speed of knowledge flow & improve organisational agility, however we are still in the early adopters stage. The biggest challenge organisations will face will be illustrating success using social tools. Like many CRM implementations will fail because there will be an expectation that if you buy the software, switch it on & people will automaically come & collaborate. However after centurys of competition dominating business collaboration will not come easy to many.
