â˜…Should organizations consider using Facebook as a corporate intranet?I'm curious to hear opinions as to whether companies should consider using Facebook as a corporate Intranet. Pros/Cons?
Ask yourself the question what do you want your intranet to achieve? It should do many things equally. One of which is enabling effective, or simple, collaboration which at the heart of the matter is about finding people - easily. Most intranets don't do this very well, if at all. Facebook does collaboration between consenting individuals extremely well. Control your data, enable your employees to add whatever they feel will make them rise to the top of the 'friends/experts' lists and ensure they can control aspects of that data and let users decide if it works. But no don't use Facebook. Use one of the many other software solutions available that enables people to talk to other people in the same organisation.
