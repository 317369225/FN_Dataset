â˜…Which plugins should I use to build an Intranet in WordPress?
There are a couple of ways to create a WordPress Intranet and the suggestions below can all be mixed and matched as needed. Also all of them are free! Suggested plugins & themes for a WordPress intranet would be: Intranet Plugins: CollabPress - This plugin should take care of most of your needs. Project management, calendar, logs, tasks, notifications, users (uses the wp user functions) and task tracking software for WordPress Absolute Privacy - Forces users to login to your site and afterward they will be able to see everything. Membership - Same as above but has more options to what is publicly available and what is not. CustomPress - Could definitely be used for the employee directory and for posting different bits of content to certain areas as well. Stout Google Calendar - I would use google calendar for events, it can be synced to your existing calendar system (most likely) and then you can embed it into a page or sidebar Force Login Except Special IP Range - Basically does what the name says, it forces all anonymous users to login except the user connects from special IPv4 ranges or a specific IPv4 address. Other Plugins to consider: Wp-Polls - Various team members can vote for different items within the intranet BuddyPress - BuddyPress is typically used to create social networks but with the various plugins (300+) it is very well suited for an intranet environment. Plugins worth mentioning: Group Documents, Wiki Components, Profile, Forums, Tags, Chat, Membership, Courseware, etc. Themes: P2 - P2 is a free WordPress theme that allows you to post updates from the front page of your blog. Users have the ability to embed images, audio files and videos all from a Twitter-like update box. GTD Templatic - GTD Templatic is based on the P2 and it makes it even easier for a team to collaborate privately, sharing files and content.
