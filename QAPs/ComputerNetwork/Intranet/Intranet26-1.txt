â˜…Which is best for a corporate intranet, WordPress, MediaWiki, or Open Atrium?
Open Atrium is a packaging of Drupal-based modules. It's a decent starter option and highly extensible with numerous open source modules available. There are also existing frameworks which can get you started quickly on your own design. WordPress is easy to set up quickly and get to grips with. The DCMS uses it and the theme has recently been released on Github. MediaWiki will need some work to tailor to the needs of people, but if you can sell the idea of hosting intranet content on a wiki, there is a lot of potential to tap into the audience to maintain the content. Whatever option you choose, you will benefit from beginning with small experiments to learn more about your environment. Work to meet the needs of different groups of people and you will create buy-in as you go as well as attracting feedback for the next stage. As ever, the answer must result from the situation you're facing: it depends.
