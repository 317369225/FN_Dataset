Try HyperOffice. One of the oldest companies to be positioned as a "sharepoint alternative". You get document management, intranet workspaces, project management, forums, workflows etc. Meets the collaboration needs you may have going forward. Also priced low and is a lot easier to use than SharePoint. http://www.hyperoffice.com/share...
