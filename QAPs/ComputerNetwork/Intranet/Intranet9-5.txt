â˜…Why is Google's intranet system named Moma?
There is no definitive answer, just a bunch of competing stories that are all equally not-quite-believable. Sean tells one of them, but then, for the Bay Area museum the correct name is SFMOMA. The story that I heard is that Larry and/or Sergey wanted a short hostname that could be typed quickly, with each letter on alternating hands. This led them to "mama". But then not wanting to go all Oedipus with server naming, someone thought to change the first vowel and came up with "moma". I have no idea if there is even the slightest shred of truth to this story.
