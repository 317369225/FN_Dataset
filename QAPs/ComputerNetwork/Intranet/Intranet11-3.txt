â˜…Should an Intranet have a name or identity?
Branding your intranet is great for creating a personality for the site as long as the brand is meaningful and in line with your company's goals. If you haven't branded your site yet, a great way to engage your employees is to hold a contest and let the community provide suggestions and vote on a name.
