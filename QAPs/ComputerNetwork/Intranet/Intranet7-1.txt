â˜…What is a good intranet system for a nonprofit?We are a small-medium nonprofit with 9 offices across the country, and we are looking for an easy-to-use and affordable site/service on which we can share necessary documents, news, and other info.
I work for Podio which has an intranet pack that is very easy to set up and adjust to your needs. You can check out the intranet pack here: https://podio.com/store/pack/360... Podio has an activity stream and a structure that makes is easy to collaborate around items, documents and share general updates with the rest of your organization.
