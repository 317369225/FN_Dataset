★Is social media killing the intranet?As firewalls get penetrated by the growth of mobiles and handheld devices, and employees connect with each other on networks like Facebook, should companies start looking at social media networks (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter / Yammer) seriously as internal or employee communication channels? More effective than an Intranet?
We don't think so.  We don't consider social media to be a fad, but an opportunity for brands to build a relationship with consumers.  We see all different age groups, and all different nationalities using a variety of social platforms. We have become more connected with the world through social media. The internet has assisted in this, giving us the ability to receive information and communicate instantly.  It is not killing the internet, but giving the internet a different purpose for users of all ages, all nationalities, and of all job descriptions.
