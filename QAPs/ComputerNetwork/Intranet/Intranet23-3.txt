★Community Management: Is there a self serve, inexpensive, solution like Jive's Social Intranet?
Igloo Software (Igloo is an intranet you'll actually like)  has lots of apps out of the box to  collaborate, communicate and share resources. Blogs, Microblogs,  calendars, wikis, forums, tasks, and file & folders. It's incredibly  flexible, with a drag-and-drop interface to modify your navigation as  well as page layouts. It's built for the non-technical user, and people  are loving it!!
