★What are Sharepoint alternatives for a company-wide intranet?In a ~500-1000 person company, what alternatives are there for a  document, file repository-style intranet portal? Bonus points if there is room and potential for other elements of the information workplace (such as collaboration, social, content management) down the road.
If you have the time, skills and dedication you can create a great intranet out of anything. Neilson Norman Group's 2015 best intranet winners spent an average of 17 months and 19 people to do this. Jostle is entirely turnkey and gorgeously designed to bring people in and keep them there - we have a median engagement rate amongst our customers of 85% (except over the xmas holiday, where we can see a dip). I strongly encourage you to check out this stunning, simple, powerful intranet that can be deployed in a week. www.jostle.me/product.
