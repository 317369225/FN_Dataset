â˜…Would an intranet search tool benefit your company? How?I'm interested in knowing how much of a need intranet search is to various types of companies, what kind of use cases they have, and if any existing search tools are being used within those companies. Would help if you give some context on the industry your company is in and the size of the company.
I think it depends on size of the company. As the company gets bigger , the complexity of search needs and resources available to make that happen increases.There are quite a few enterprise products that solves at least some of the problems in intranet search space. The functionality , reliability , cost and ease of use for such existing products might vary. The question for a new tool would be , how does it make any of these factors better ?
