â˜…What is best of Wiki or SharePoint for an intranet, and why?
If you're looking to share knowledge within your team, Bloomfire.com is custom-built for you. It goes beyond a wiki's typical pile of text by supporting video out of the box, it doesn't require hassling with the IT department like SharePoint does, and it's drop-dead simple to use. I think simplicity is underrated in this category of product and not talked about enough. If leaders truly want the entire team to share knowledge, the leader must provide tools that accommodate not just the tech-savvy teammates, but also the tech-averse teammates.
