★Which is the best intranet solution Cloud Computing and open source?I'm interested in a Intranet 2.0 solution. Collaboration and discuss with created groups, content managment, etc.
Nobody here (myself included) can give a serious answer to this question as posed, because there aren't enough details.  The Exo guys say Exo is  best... are they?  Well they're a competitor for us, so I suppose I'm supposed to argue that "no, they aren't best".  But they might  be.  Or maybe our products are better for you.   Maybe you don't actually need "Enterprise 2.0" at all.  Or maybe you'd be fine with just a basic Mediawiki install.  I don't know, and couldn't know without spending some time talking to your company about what you're trying to accomplish, what behaviours your trying to cultivate and what you do now, among other things. So sure, if you want an open-source solution, look at Exo, look at Elgg, look at EurekaStreams, look at portal server products like JBoss Portal, any one of those might be a fine fit for you.  But do stop and take a quick look at our website - Fogbeam Labs | Fogcutter Enterprise - as well, and our open-source repositories at GitHub:  Fogbeam Labs · GitHub And if you'd like to have an indepth conversation about this, feel free to ping me here on Quora or shoot me an email (prhodes@fogbeam.com)
