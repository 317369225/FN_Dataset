â˜…Should an Intranet have a name or identity?
I believe it is important to have a brand or identity for your intranet. This makes it easier for people to identify with and communicate with each other referring to it. E.g. "You will find that on the Hub." That is in the Bucket" "Put it on the Wall". It also makes it easier to market and promote it's stickiness if you get something that works. It can also help with remembering the address of where to go.
