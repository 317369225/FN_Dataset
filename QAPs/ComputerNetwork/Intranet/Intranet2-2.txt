★Intranets: Is Yammer useful in the workplace?
Yes, but . .   Yes, any IM client inside the organization (or including select suppliers or customers) can be indispensable. But - as with other intranet content, if not curated for quality and appropriateness, some of the users who would benefit most from the dialog simply tune out, leaving too much of the air time to a potentially unrepresentative few. Solutions: curate, rate helpfulness, link to corporate ontology if any and to other content, enliven with case studies or sanctioned messaging, reuse threads.
