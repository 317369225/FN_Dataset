★How does your company share key info with all their employees?  intranet?  email?  online tool like yammer or chatter?please include any detail about how big your company is...lot easier problem when you are just 5 folks
twitter has spoken:  email is #1, yammer/chatter/basecamp follow, then skype.  i bet these are mostly small companies.  really curious about the larger ones.
