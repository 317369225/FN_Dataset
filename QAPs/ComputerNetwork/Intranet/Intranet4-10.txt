â˜…What is the best Intranet platform for a midsize company?Love the google docs functionality but their sites functionality for top down navigation and rich controlled sharing is pretty thin. Sharepoint makes my brain hurt every time I look at it... What are people using for a company bigger than a startup (so need more than just docs) and smaller than a full size corp?
The thing about sharepoint is that you have to have a plan and structure before you implement. I think it is feasible even for small implementations. Alternatively alfresco is a good open source solution. Drupal and Tikiwiki may also be worth looking into. All this if your intranet is the location to create and store documents, websites and workflow.
