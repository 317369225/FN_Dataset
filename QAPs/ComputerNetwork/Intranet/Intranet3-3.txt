★What are Sharepoint alternatives for a company-wide intranet?In a ~500-1000 person company, what alternatives are there for a  document, file repository-style intranet portal? Bonus points if there is room and potential for other elements of the information workplace (such as collaboration, social, content management) down the road.
As Tim mentioned Interact Intranet is an ideal solution for this (www.interact-intranet.com). It's really easy to add/edit content which in turn has a huge impact on adoption within an organisation. At Interact Intranet’s heart is an intelligence store which learns as people use it, improving content visibility, search and collaboration. It also includes many collaborative tools including comment streams, activity streams, @ and # tagging, sharing ideas/links/documents, forums and blogging.
