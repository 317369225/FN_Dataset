★What are Sharepoint alternatives for a company-wide intranet?In a ~500-1000 person company, what alternatives are there for a  document, file repository-style intranet portal? Bonus points if there is room and potential for other elements of the information workplace (such as collaboration, social, content management) down the road.
Igloo Software (www.igloosoftware.com) is a SharePoint alternative. Igloo has robust document management solution (robust access/permissions, version history, activity feeds, commenting, reserving, archiving, tagging, auto-notify, liking, read tracking/receipts, and much more). They recently soft launched their desktop client as well, so people can change/modify docs without having to access the docs via their browser. This is just one of their apps, available out of the box. Igloo also has microblogs, blogs, calendars, wikis, forums, staff directory, tasks and more. You can turn these features on or off with a click. Page and navigation manipulation is done using a drop-and-drop interface, no coding required. It's actually really incredible. Highly brandable, very flexible, scalable, highly secure, mobile optimized, fast to deploy, easy to use and built for the non-technical user. Some of Igloo's largest customers have 100,000+ members, so you can really understand the power of the solution. I recommend signing up for one of their free instant communities and select the Corporate Template, catered towards larger companies like yours. They also offer customized Proof of Concept.
