Disk Utility doesn't resize partition, but instead says "Preparing to Partition" forever. How to fix it?I was creating a partition of size 1 GB from my partition of size 690 GB, and the Disk Utility always shows the "preparing to resize" progress bar, and never actually resizes it. If I am creating partitions of bigger size, they seem to work properly, but I just need a partition of minimum size possible. How can I do it?
Normally Partitioning takes a long time but I think that's not the case with you. This problem usually occurs if you had previously partitioned the hard disk using boot camp or normal partition. Fret not. All you have to do is Shut down. Start up holding down Command âŒ˜ + S. (This will boot you into Single User Mode.) At the prompt, type in the command fsck -fy. When that finishes, type reboot. Try resizing again in Disk Utility. This worked for me, should work for you too. Cheers.
