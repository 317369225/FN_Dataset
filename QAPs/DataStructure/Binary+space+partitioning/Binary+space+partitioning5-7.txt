What are some of the most ingenious algorithms in computer science?added bonus if the algorithm runs in constant time
Fully Homomorphic Encryption.  Public key cryptography allows Alice and Bob to keep out Eve when talking over an insecure channel.  FHE allows Alice to keep out both Eve and Bob!  Using FHE Alice can give Bob encrypted text that he can't decrypt. But he can perform computations on plaintext that produce cyphertext, that Alice can then decrypt. Craig Gentry, in 2009, invented a particularly clever implementation of the concept, described in this recent article[1]. Since his discovery, many schemes have been published that are practical (in terms of efficiency) within certain limits.  FHE can be used to build all sorts of networked applications, electronic cash, digital voting, cloud based computations on encrypted text, etc. Next 10 years will see cool and surprising stuff here.
