What are the 10 must-know algorithms and data structures for a software engineer?
Originally Answered: What are the most common algorithms and data structures to learn for a developer?  Further recommendations?I used to have a professor (Dr. Marvin Solomon at U. Wisconsin, Madison), who said - all problems in computer science can be solved using hashing and indirection. He followed it up by saying that indirection usually leads to a reduction in performance, which can be handled by caching. I think there is a grain of truth in this. I love algorithms, and data structures and have learnt a lot a about a lot of them (I have a Bachelors, Masters, and PhD in CS); but in over 12+ years of real-life programming, I've rarely had to use much other than hashtables, and sorting, and occasionally trees. Maybe once in 2 or 3 years there comes an opportunity to use a fancy data structure/algorithm, but rest of it the time it's just hashing and sorting. (Of course, I am not talking about all the data-structures that I end up using when I'm using some standard library, or some application (like B-Trees used by indexes in a database)).
