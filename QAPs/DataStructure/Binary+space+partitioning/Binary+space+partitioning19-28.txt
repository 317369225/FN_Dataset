How do I start learning or strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?
Originally Answered: How do I understand/learn algorithms?The starting point is to remember that programs are implementations of algorithms. This is why it is important to understand how to design and analyze algorithms â€“ you can never get a good implementation of a poor algorithm. Moreover, it is important to have an understanding of algorithms that is not dependent on a particular programming language, for there may come a time when you will need to or want to turn to some new language for a programming task. There are plenty of resources out there for learning about the design and analysis of algorithms. The Khan Academy has an online course about algorithms that may be a good place for you to start. If you want to read more (and you should!) algorithms for sorting and for searching are good places to start. Frauke Liers from Oldenburg University in Germany has written a relatively short introduction to these topics; the algorithms covered in the text are written in C.
