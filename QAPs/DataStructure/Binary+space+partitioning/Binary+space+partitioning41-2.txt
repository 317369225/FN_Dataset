Statistical Mechanics: What is the "fermion sign problem"?http://physics.aps.org/articles/...
http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/N... This has a good explanation. I add an intuitive explanation - expectation values of fermionic operators can be imagined to take values on a circle, rather than the real line. So they have both a maximum and minimum value. Contrast this with a bosonic operator in which a macroscopic number of particles can occupy the same state - so a bosonic operator has no maximum. Picturing a system of fermions as a whole bunch of interacting beads on little rings, you can guess that the net or average position is very sensitive to each position. Its like stopping the second hand of a clock at random vs stopping a hourglass at random. You can make a decent guess about how much sand is left, but its much harder to guess about where the second hand is if you've left it running for a long time.
