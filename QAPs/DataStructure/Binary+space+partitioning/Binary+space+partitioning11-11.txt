What is your favorite tree?
The camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora). They last for a very long timeï¼ˆsome are more than 1000 years old). And you never know what's living in one of them. There's also something quite magical about silver birch (Betula pendula) forests. There was one near the house where we lived for a few years in England when I was growing up, and I remember wandering around in it pretending to find fairies.
