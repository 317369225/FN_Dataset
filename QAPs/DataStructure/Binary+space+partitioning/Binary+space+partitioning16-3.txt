When should you use the different GCC optimization flags (e.g. -O2)?I am new to code optimization and g++/gcc compiler flags. This question arose when I saw that OpenCV uses the "-O2" optimization instead of "-O3" on 32-bit Linux. What are the pros/cons of each optimization level?
As said, they're the various levels of in-built optimizations one can perform by trading off properties among execution time, code size, memory usage and compile time requirements. Detailed effects of using these flags : Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Relative trade-offs in using these flags : gcc -o / -O option flags
