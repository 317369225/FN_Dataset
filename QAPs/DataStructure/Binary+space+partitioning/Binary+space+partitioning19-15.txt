How do I start learning or strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?
Originally Answered: How do I learn about data structures? Where do I start?I suggest not to focus only on data structures, but on algorithms and programming in general. Pick a language you like or want to learn and get a book on algorithms. If you want to use Java, C, or C++, I suggest a book by Robert Sedgewick. If you use Python Python Mastering Basic Algorithms in the Python Language or any other for the language you enjoy. Most of the algorithm books cover data structures first, because these are at the core of algorithms. You cannot implement a bubble sort if you don't know about arrays or a heap sort if you don't know what a heap is. Data structures and algorithms go hand in hand. Some data structures are better suited for some kinds of algorithms and others are specially created to implement a certain algorithm. Once you understand some basic, commonly used data structures, you can dig deeper and explore some not so popular constructions. But you have to set the foundation first. It's not harder than other subjects, but it's a time consuming and sometimes a frustrating action(studying data structures & algorithms). Maybe some of the things you read  won't make sense the first time you go over it. Read it again. And again. Maybe your code won't do what it is supposed to do or maybe some of the exercises seem too difficult. Remember one thing: don't give up!, no matter how long it takes.  Covering one of these books you will definitely make a better programmer and teach you how to think like a computer scientist.
