What will happen if we use more than 4GB of memory in a 32-bit system?Will the system be able to use more than 4GB? In what condition can a system have more than 4GB of memory?
If the processor MMU (TLBs and caches) supports more than 32-bit physical address, then the physical addresses more than 2^32 can be used for user space applications. Some processors like Freescale e500/e500mc series provide an address space bit which can be used to address more than 4GB address space for a process by creating a new address space (AS=0 is default address space. Create new one with AS=1) and creating a TLB mapping for some that address space. Needless to say AS bit is used in virtual address calculation and also has a presence in TLBs.
