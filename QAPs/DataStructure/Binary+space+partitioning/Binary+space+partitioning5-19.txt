What are some of the most ingenious algorithms in computer science?added bonus if the algorithm runs in constant time
- The beauty of any algorithm lies in the fact of its simplicity and I believe the most ingenious algorithms in computer science are made for prime numbers either it is Sieve of Eratosthenes whose complexity is O(n log log n) and simple enough to make even a 10 year old understand it. This algorithm in which  one of a number of prime number sieves, is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. - Second comes in my list is the algorithms based on the famous Catalan Numbers, the Catalan numbers form a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting problems, often involving recursively defined objects. There are many counting problems in combinatorics whose solution is given by the Catalan numbers.There are many applications of Catalan number in Computer Science algorithms like counting the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched used in compiler for parsing correctly. - number of different ways n + 1 factors can be completely parenthesized  as used in matrix chain multiplication. - Number of monotonic paths along the edges of a grid with n × n square cells, which do not pass above the diagonal as many of the problems asked in online coding competitions are based on this only. I also believe its not one algorithm that decides the whole and sole of everything in computer science the best part is that everything is correlated and Mathematics is the heart of computer science ..
