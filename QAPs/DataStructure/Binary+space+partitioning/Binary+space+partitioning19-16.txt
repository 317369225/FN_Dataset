How do I start learning or strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?
Originally Answered: How do I learn Data Structures and Algorithms?A competitive programmer's perspective. Read the following books: Algorithms by Sedgewick, Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al. Read the TopCoder Algorithm Tutorials. Shout out to Michal Fori≈°ek (misof) and Dima Korolev (DmitryKorolev). Solve the problems in the USACO Training Program Gateway. Solve problems in online judges and compete in programming contests. For data structures in particular, in my experience, Central/East European OIs tend to have the most interesting problems. For algorithms, try to solve problems from a variety of different sources so you can learn to apply as many different kinds of algorithms as possible. Work at your own pace, and ask for help if you get stuck on problems. Ultimately, everyone has their own learning strategies. You'll have to figure out what works for you. The most important thing is to stay motivated and keep working at it.. But if you grow bored of learning algorithms and data structures, go do something else.
