How do I start learning or strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?
Originally Answered: How could I learn algorithms?Hi I think algorithms are very important to the modern day programmer while I appreciate that there are those programmers who question this learning methodology one cannot ignore that this is the trend used by recruiters around the world. This is the method by which one may improve ones own understanding of computer programming. Google engineer Chandler Carruth once stated that all those who think performance engineering is not necessary should perhaps re evaluate their thoughts as inefficient code tends to be detrimental in the long run. Thus the study of data structures and algorithms is very important and I think you are on the right path. There was once a theory that said "we can afford to write slow software because the hardware will catch up" and people made excuses for writing mediocre software, it turns out thats not true, we are really good at writing slow software such that "software is becoming slower than hardware becoming faster" so theres a genuine problem in that regard. I recommend the following, solve the problems therein: Amazon.com: Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis in C++ (9780132847377): Mark A. Weiss: Books Also watch the following to keep yourself motivated: With regards to mathematical and computation analysis I use the following which is my library from my university days and good luck: The Nonlinear Workbook: Chaos, Fractals, Cellular Automata, Genetic Algorithms, Gene Expression Programming, Support Vector Machine, Wavelets, Hidden ... Java and Symbolic C++ Programs (5th Edition): Steeb Willi-Hans: 9789814335782: Amazon.com: Books
