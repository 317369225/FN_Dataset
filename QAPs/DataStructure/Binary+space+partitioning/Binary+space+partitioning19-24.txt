How do I start learning or strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?
Originally Answered: What are the best ways to start learning data structures and algorithms?Theory: Introduction To Algorithms 3rd Edition - This is a bit bulky but has almost everything. You'll need to filter as to what to learn in the beginning. Algorithm Tutorials- Use these topcoder tutorials to learn specific algorithms and their implementation. IOITC 2008 Notes.pdf - These are notes from Indian IOI Training Camp. This has all the algorithms and structures in explained in form of questions. Questions discussed are all either some of the popular classical problems or are taken from some contest like IOI or ZCO. Practice: http://codechef.com: Has problems grouped and sorted according to difficulty. HackerRank: Has problems grouped by topics and sorted by difficulty. topcoder: Good quality problems. Participate in the contests but I would recommend using it for practice after you are fairly versed with simple algorithms. Updated 7 Mar 2014 • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Anonymous
