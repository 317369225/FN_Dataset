As a developer, how much space should I allocate for Linux?I don't have much experience with programming in the Linux environment. But I want to learn development in the Linux environment. I will keep my data in my NTFS partitions. So how much space should I allocate for the / partition and the swap partition?
It depends on what you want to do and what kind of development you want to do. Some development requires surprisingly little. If you are learning python and other things, you might not need a lot of space. With python, you can use things like virtual env to keep everything confined to an environment just for that project. If you do something like kernel development, you might need some more space. It also depends on what you want to do with the windows partition. If you keep it for games, for example, it can take up a lot of space! Perhaps if you developed a heuristic: think about how much space you have historically used for windows. Then, take that number and multiply it by 1.5 and leave that 1.5x for windows, the rest for linux. Then use the linux distro default for swap/space.
