What is your favorite tree?
Ficus Elastica(Indian rubber tree) Native to northeast India and southern Indonesia. What makes this tree unique is that you can actually guide the roots to create natural architecture. The War-Khasis, a tribe in Meghalaya, developed a technique to hone this trees roots to create 'living bridges', more accurately known as the root bridges of Cherrapunji. The roots require 10-15 years to form fully functioning bridges and are surprisingly strong. Some bridges can support 50+ people st a time. And because the roots are constantly growing, they get stronger and sturdier as time passes. Some of these bridges are dated to be older than 500 years.
