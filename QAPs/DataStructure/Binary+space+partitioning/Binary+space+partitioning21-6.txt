Is it true that writing operating system code and kernel code is extremely difficult? If so, how much do those types of programmers make?
Difficult compared to what? I've never written a web browser, and I've never written an Operating System kernel, but from my experience writing lots of other things over the years, I'd really, really, fancy my chances better at writing a kernel. The biggest OS kernel ever made is probably a lot smaller in lines of code than any complete web browser, and it's role is much more clearly defined. So, I've got say 20 years of programming under my belt, never written a kernel, so take my opinion as you will, but if someone said my job depended on writing a web browser or a kernel, I'd answer 'kernel' very quickly indeed. Is it extremely difficult? Yes, I'm sure it is.
