What are some fast similarity search algorithms and data structures for high-dimensional vectors?e.g. applying Jaccard, Cosine or Hamming distance to find similar items on billions of 100-dimensional arrays of integers.
tree based search algorithms and data structures almost can't handle the high-dimensional fast search. Locality Sensitive Hashing is a good solution when we face this problem. There are many implementation of LSH in Github, E2LSH or LSHKIT and others. LSHBOX is implemented by my research team, which supports c++, python and matlab interface. You can use it in your project free. We are working hard for it.
