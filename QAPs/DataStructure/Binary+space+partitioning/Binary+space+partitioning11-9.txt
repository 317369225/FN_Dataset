What is your favorite tree?
The Live Oak or Evergreen Oak It is part of my heritage. It is fun to climb. It stays vibrant all year long and often accommodates Spanish Moss. And you know the Spanish Moss is not even a moss or a lichen, it is an angiosperm in the family Bromeliaceae (the bromeliads). More closely related to a Magnolia or a Pineapple. Theses trees and the hanging Spanish Moss make me think of the Old South, and remind me of where my lovely bride and I had our first honeymoon atÂ  @Grand Hotel, Fairhope, AL.
