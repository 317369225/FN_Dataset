What are some of the most ingenious algorithms in computer science?added bonus if the algorithm runs in constant time
I also like Voronoi Diagrams and the algorithm to construct them. Quoting the abstract of the paper that showed the algorithm for constructing them: A number of seemingly unrelated problems involving the proximity of points in the plane are studied, such as finding a Euclidean minimum spanning tree, the smallest circle enclosing the set, nearest and farthest neighbors, the two closest points, and a proper  straight-line triangulation. For most of the problems considered a lower  bound of is shown. For all of them the best currently-known upper bound is or worse. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a single geometric  structure, called the Voronoi diagram, which can be constructed rapidly  and contains all of the relevant proximity information in only linear  space. The Voronoi diagram is used to obtain algorithms for all of the problems. Essentially, they took several problems for which the best known algorithm took quadratic time and came up with one single tool---the Voronoi Diagram---that improved the running times of all of those problems. Voronoi Diagrams are still one of the most widely used tools in algorithms used both in theory and in practice.
