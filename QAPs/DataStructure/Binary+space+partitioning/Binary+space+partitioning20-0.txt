Disk Utility doesn't resize partition, but instead says "Preparing to Partition" forever. How to fix it?I was creating a partition of size 1 GB from my partition of size 690 GB, and the Disk Utility always shows the "preparing to resize" progress bar, and never actually resizes it. If I am creating partitions of bigger size, they seem to work properly, but I just need a partition of minimum size possible. How can I do it?
Resizing a partition from 690 to 1 is not recommended.  Think about the massive amount of data that will need to get shuffled around on that HFS+ partition.  Extents records, catalog file will likely need to get re-sized, and data living 500gb into the partition will need to get shuffled to within 1GB.  All of the binary will need to get shuffled all over the damn place.   Obviously you need to have less than 1GB of information on the 690 or its going to get whacked. If you want a 1 GB partition resize from 690 to 689 and then make a 1 GB out of the unallocated raw space.
