How does one begin to tackle understanding a large open source code base?Often times I've wanted to dig in behind the scenes of things such as the linux kernel, the JDK, MySQL. What techniques do you use for getting a handle on a large code base ?

Many a times, the codebase for your chosen OpenSource project will not be small, so it would be not very easy to understand the whole code at one go. Still you want to study...go through the documentation first, read the functional-spec for that software, it would give you hints at the modules in which the codebase has been divided, now you would be intelligent enough to identify the links between various modules and correlate them with the codebase. Bug fixing would be easier if you know what all components your project is built from. A bug would in fact, most of the times will relate to one or more components, but not all. So, assuming that you have read the doc thoroughly, and know the interaction between those components, you would easily determine the section of code, the bug falls under.Â  There are other ways as well to identify the section of code (through logs collected, or, special kind of error-messages). Start with minor defects, don't rush to high severity bugs, they can turn discouraging. All the very best!
