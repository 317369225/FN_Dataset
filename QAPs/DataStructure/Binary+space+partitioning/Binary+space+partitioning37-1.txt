How does deleting a file empty space from a storage space?
There is an interesting side to deleting/moving stuff from/within your hard drive. When you a delete a file, it isn’t really erased – it continues existing on your hard drive, even after you empty it from the Recycle Bin. You might have noticed that deleting files are a lot faster than copying it. Also moving files within the hard disk (within a folder or within partitions of same hard disk) are much faster than copying. This is because what you see when you open file explorer (Windows Explorer) is only a "pointer" of everything. It is only a logical picture. To simplify, hard disk management in Windows has basically two parts : pointers & sectors. When you are copying a file (say Doc.txt) into your hard disk the following things happen The binary equivalent of your file is written into a specific Sector in your hard disk. Pointer knows that the file Doc.txt is kept in a certain sector and another indication is added to identify the length/size of the file.When you open Explorer, all you are seeing are these Pointers, an indication of where everything is. Now  when you delete a file, what windows does is, it deletes only the pointer and does not take the pain to delete every last single bit/byte of the file from the actual sector in HDD. This is so because it saves a lot of time. Windows just needs to make the pointer space free. Next time you copy some other file, it will look into the pointer for "supposedly" free space and think that there is nothing in it. This is exactly why certain recovery softwares can recover stuff from the HDD even after they have been deleted. They rely on the actual content on hard disk and not what Pointers say that where stuff is. This is my understanding and I hope I'm being clear. Just google "Why can files be recovered" and you'll get more info.
