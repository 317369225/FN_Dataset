What is your favorite tree?
Albizia saman, commonly known as the Raintree in Singapore. I grew up in its shade. Raintrees are commonly found along Singapore's roads, and they have the prettiest delicate pink flowers: Even their leaves were special: I loved to feel up their velvet undersides. They were with me everywhere I went, an essential part of my childhood. Just gorgeous, useful, and sturdy.
