What will happen if we use more than 4GB of memory in a 32-bit system?Will the system be able to use more than 4GB? In what condition can a system have more than 4GB of memory?
Originally Answered: Why are 32-bit architectures limited to 4 GB of RAM?They aren't.Â  32-bit architectures are not limited to 4GB of physical RAM. The limitation is 32-bits (or 4GB) of VIRTUAL address space in a single process. It is quite possible for a 32-bit processor and operating system to support more than 4GB of PHYSICAL memory. PAE Mode on x86 processors: (Physical Address Extension) is the most common example. So you can have more than 4GB of RAM, you just can't see it all at the same time.
