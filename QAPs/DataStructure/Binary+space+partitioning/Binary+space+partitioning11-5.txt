What is your favorite tree?
The Ombú, an evergreen, native to the pampas grasslands of South America. Ombú trees grow miles apart, and are often the only trees visible for miles across the pampas.  Because the sap is poisonous, the ombú is not grazed by cattle or goats and is immune to locusts and other insect pests.   Traditionally, they served as landmarks and shelter for the gauchos, and are a symbol of the gaucho lifestyle and of Argentina and Uruguay.
