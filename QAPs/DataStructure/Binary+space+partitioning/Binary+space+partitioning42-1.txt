Unix Commands: What are some easy ways to recover files from rm -rf?
You can recover certain files that you know info about their content using GREP. Search google for: undelete grep here is what i found in of the sites: grep -a -B 25 -A 100 'some string in the file' /dev/sda1 > results.txt   Here’s what the command does:   grep searches through a file and prints out all the lines that match  some pattern. Here, the pattern is some string that is known to be in  the deleted file. The more specific this string can be, the better. The  file being searched by grep (/dev/sda1) is the partition of the hard  drive the deleted file used to reside in. The “-a” flag tells grep to  treat the hard drive partition, which is actually a binary file, as  text. Since recovering the entire file would be nice instead of just the lines  that are already known, context control is used. The flags “-B 25 -A  100” tell grep to print out 25 lines before a match and 100 lines after a  match. Be conservative with estimates on these numbers to ensure the  entire file is included (when in doubt, guess bigger numbers). Excess  data is easy to trim out of results, but if you find yourself with a  truncated or incomplete file, you need to do this all over again.  Finally, the ”> results.txt” instructs the computer to store the  output of grep in a file called results.txt.
