What will happen if we use more than 4GB of memory in a 32-bit system?Will the system be able to use more than 4GB? In what condition can a system have more than 4GB of memory?

When we connect few flip-flops the new digital circuit which we obtain is called Register So for example if we connect 8 flip flop we will get a 8 bit register. If we connect 32 flip flops we will get a 32 bit register . The processor consists of multiple registers. Now suppose you have a 4 bit register . Each bit can be either 1 or 0. So there will be 2 states at a single level. Four bits together will have 2x2x2x2=2 4   different states 0000,0001,0010,0011,0100,0101,0110,0111 1000,1001,1010,1011,1100,1101,1110,1111 Similarly 8 bits together will have 2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2=2 8     different states Similarly 32 bits together will have 2 32     different states You can think of memory as a collection many chunks and each chunk store a single byte.Now in order to differentiate among different memory chunks you gave them labels(or address). So if you have 16 Chunks,You can address: First   chunk as   0000 Second  chunk as   0001 Third   Chunk as   0010 ...(continue) Sixteenth Chunk as 1111 A processor access any specific chunk(byte) using a Memory Address Register. So a 4 bit Register can access up-to 16 different Memory locations or chunks or bytes. Similarly a 8 bit register can access up-to 256 or  2 8     bytes. Similarly a 32 bit register can access up to   2 32     bytes or 4GB at max.             [ 1KB=1024 Bytes= 2 10   Bytes         1MB=1024 KB = 2 20   Bytes         1GB=1024 MB= 2 30   Bytes         4GB= 4∗2 30   Bytes = 2 32   Bytes ] So a 32 bit operating Systems which works on 32 bits(at max) in every operation can't access more than 2^32 bytes. Note: Here when we say memory we are talking about Primary memory (RAM). As you already know a computer system can have hard disk storage of even higher size like 250 GB or 1TB. Data is loaded to RAM from Hard Disk. Then From RAM to Cache ,and then From Cache to Processor Registers (The real architecture is more complex) On 32 bit and 64 bit OS In simple terms a 32 bit operating system can work on 32 bits at max in every operation(even if the processor on which it is running have registers of size 64 bits). Similarly a 64 bit operating system can work on 64 bits at max in every operation. Hope this Helps
