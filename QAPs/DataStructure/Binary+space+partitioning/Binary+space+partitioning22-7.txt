What will happen if we use more than 4GB of memory in a 32-bit system?Will the system be able to use more than 4GB? In what condition can a system have more than 4GB of memory?
Originally Answered: Why is it that using a memory of more than 4 GB is useless in a 32-bit operating system?There are actually two limits: one based on the architectecture of the processor and motherboard and another based on the operating system.  With the right processor, chipset and operating system, you could address up to 64G of RAM on a 32-bit system.  However, the 32 bit versions of consumer versions of Windows were limited to 4G or less.
