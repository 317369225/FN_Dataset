What are the algorithms required to solve all problems (using C++) in any competitive coding contest?
Programming Camp Syllabus - Google Docs I find this doc extremely useful. Apart from containing a nearly exhaustive list of topics required for Competitive Programming, it also contains links to tutorials and some suggested problems for each topic. Also,  MAXimal :: algo has tutorials (with implementation) on nearly all important topics. Since the original tutorials are written is Russian, the (google) translated versions sometimes get a bit hard to comprehend. But the code written in these tutorials is nice.
