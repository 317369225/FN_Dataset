What are some of the most ingenious algorithms in computer science?added bonus if the algorithm runs in constant time
It has to be the inverse square root hack. It is used to calculate x −12    , which is a frequently used component in computer games to find the coordinates( unit vector ) of a particular character. It's my most favorite piece of code. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa... Not sure if it qualifies as an algorithm because it's a floating point hack, but you cannot resist saying GOD THAT'S GENIUS! And, oh yeah, its constant time ;) Here's the code: float Q_rsqrt( float number ){ long i; float x2, y; const float threehalfs = 1.5F; x2 = number * 0.5F; y = number; i = * ( long * ) &y; // evil floating point bit level hacking i = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 ); // what the fuck? y = * ( float * ) &i; y = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) ); // 1st iteration// y = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) ); // 2nd iteration, this can be removed return y; } Thanks for the suggested edits, Stephen McInerney.
