How do I start learning or strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?
Originally Answered: How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?Can't beat CLRS for a comprehensive overview/understanding. For a nice motivating way to practice algorithmic application (it's one thing to understand the concept of dynamic programming, and another thing entirely to know when and how to apply it to different scenarios), you might try algorithmic competitions such as USACO and Topcoder. I was much more comfortable with my mental toolkit of algorithms and data structures in high school, when I did those regularly, than now working in software, where architecture is the main focus and only the bare basics of data structures / algorithms are necessary (hash tables, very occasional graph search or basic binary tree).
