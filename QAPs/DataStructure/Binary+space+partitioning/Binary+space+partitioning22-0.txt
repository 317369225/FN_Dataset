What will happen if we use more than 4GB of memory in a 32-bit system?Will the system be able to use more than 4GB? In what condition can a system have more than 4GB of memory?
There are two aspects of your system to consider here: Physical memory and virtual memory. I'll cover both. Physical memory: A 32-bit system generally cannot physically address more than 4GB of RAM (2 32   ). Systems, however, have adopted extensions that allow a 32-bit processor to physically access more than 4GB of RAM. This is generally implemented via page table hacks. The x86 architecture, for example, supports a feature called Physical Address Extension (PAE) that (in its most common form) extends physically-addressable memory to 64GB (2 36   ). PAE is quite common. If your system supports it, you can have more than 4GB of RAM. Otherwise you are stuck at 4GB. Virtual memory: A 32-bit process cannot address more than 4GB of virtual memory absent segmentation or nonlinear address spaces. Given that modern operating systems employ non-segmented, flat address spaces, you are stuck with <=4GB of process address space. Indeed, if you could flat-address n-bits of address space, I'd say you had an n-, not 32-, bit system.
