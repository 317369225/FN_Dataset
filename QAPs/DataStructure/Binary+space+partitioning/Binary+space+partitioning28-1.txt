When swapping is disabled does the kernel do demand paging?Lets say I have a big binary, does disabling swapping force the kernel to bring in the whole binary to memory or paging is still done ? If paging is done, won't it have the same bad effects of swapping and result in unpredictable latency ?
The question defines swapping loosely while talking about reading binaries. Swapping is done to store pages that are not backed by file mappings on disk - like anonymous pages comprising of stack and heap areas of a process. Even when swap space in enabled, file binary data are evicted to their disk images on disk through the page cache and not to the swap partition. When swapping is disabled, the kernel will continue to page file data but cannot page anonymous data because there is no corresponding disk mapping.
