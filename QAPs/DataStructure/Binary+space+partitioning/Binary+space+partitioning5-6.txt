What are some of the most ingenious algorithms in computer science?added bonus if the algorithm runs in constant time
From computational geometry, the dual between Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulation is amazing. Algorithms to compute the Voronoi - such as scanlines - and algorithms to compute the Delaunay - such as divide an conquer of the space - are equivalent yet approach the problem differently. When I learned these algorithms they struck me as a great example of mathematical elegance - the dual - informing elegant algorithms. The result is a graph that both describes adjacent areas of a space and also adjacent obstacles in a space, as well as a transform for a set of points into a tessellation or mesh that's optimal for graphical applications. My runners up of those not mentioned so far: Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) trees, another amazing geometric data structure Huffman encoding Perlin Noise and "the fractal flame" algorithm from Electric Sheep. For texture and visual art, these ideas are very original [1] [1] http://flam3.com/flame.pdf
