As a developer, how much space should I allocate for Linux?I don't have much experience with programming in the Linux environment. But I want to learn development in the Linux environment. I will keep my data in my NTFS partitions. So how much space should I allocate for the / partition and the swap partition?
I allocated only 25Gigs when I installed Linux for the same purpose(I have only 128G SSD). But if you do have more space try and allocate somewhere around 35-50G. Even then if you allocate less for now and expand partitions in future that is also fine.
