How do I start learning or strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?
You can start with the basics on Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks and Trees questions and then Graphs, Dynamic Programming questions. Once you are thorough with these concepts, you can try solving advanced problems. I feel that videos are good way to understand these problems as it takes only a few minutes and we remember concepts better when we actually see them and can visualize them. I found this channel: IDeserve which has good programming problems. The videos are of 4-10 minutes duration in which algorithm is explained with the help of examples and animations. Also, solutions are also provided. Once we are clear with the algorithm, coding becomes very easy. Here is the website link: IDeserve - Unique learning platform to enhance algorithmic skills. Code visualization given here is a very cool feature. Here are the playlists on the above mentioned topics. You can view the videos in this order: Arrays: Linked Lists: Trees: Graph: Dynamic Programming: Other nice resources I found helpful: LeetCode Online Judge GeeksforGeeks | A computer science portal for geeks Hope this helps.
