In simple terms, what is Memcached and what does it do?This is a follow-up question to In simple terms, what is Apache Thrift and what does it do?.
Memcached[1] is a very simple distributed cache solution. It has been initially developed by Brad Fitzpatrick for LiveJournal.com. He wanted to make the unused memory of his servers available for caching purposes. In practice, Memcached is a Unix daemon written in C that exposes a specified amount of memory space as a hash table on the network using a dedicated text or binary protocol. The protocol allows a limited set of operations such as set, get, and delete, and also some more complex atomic operations such as cas (compare and set), incr, decr, and append. The process itself is absolutely unaware of any distribution and partitioning logic, thus making it extremely simple, fast, and robust. All the complexity is actually pushed to the client that is responsible for routing requests to the correct Memcached instance. A very common use of Memcached is to partition data on each instance, without replication. This strategy is valid when the amount of instance N is big as a loss of one instance will involve loss of 1 / N of data, which is acceptable in most cases for caching. In situations where such data loss isn't acceptable, replication is possible as the client can simply send its requests to 2 Memcached instances in parallel. At the time of writing, Memcached is widely used in production in large organizations. Clients are available for all major languages, including C/C++, Java, Python, Ruby, and C#.
