Disk Utility doesn't resize partition, but instead says "Preparing to Partition" forever. How to fix it?I was creating a partition of size 1 GB from my partition of size 690 GB, and the Disk Utility always shows the "preparing to resize" progress bar, and never actually resizes it. If I am creating partitions of bigger size, they seem to work properly, but I just need a partition of minimum size possible. How can I do it?
