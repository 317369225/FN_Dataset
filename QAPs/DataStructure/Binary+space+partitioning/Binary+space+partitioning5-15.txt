What are some of the most ingenious algorithms in computer science?added bonus if the algorithm runs in constant time
My favourite is the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)^1 method. It has revolutionised Bayesian statistics, and I find quite amazing that one can (approximately) sample from virtually any probability distribution using such a simple technique. It has been ranked one of the ten 'best' algorithms of the computer age by the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)^2. By the way, MCMC methods are still a very active area of research. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar... http://www.siam.org/pdf/news/637... Updated 5 Jul 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
