What are some of the most ingenious algorithms in computer science?added bonus if the algorithm runs in constant time
My list: The kernel trick - I find it very elegant: http://ur1.ca/95ui7 Q-Learning for Reinforcement Learning (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-l...) Dynamic Programming (DP) - I know its a vast family of algorithms but I am still occasionally surprised by its applicability The Hilbert Curve - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hil.... Was surprised the first time I came across it - a nice way to preserve neighborhood structure from 2-D to 1-D I have not worked with many local search algorithms but amongst the ones I know - Simulated Annealing (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim...) OPTICS - almost always prefer this overÂ  many other clustering algorithms (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPT...). Reason - identifies the neighborhood structure of data points for multiple parameter values in one go. Binary Decision Diagrams - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin.... Why? Testimony: "one of the only really fundamental data structures that came out in the last twenty-five years" - Donald Knuth ;)
