What are some of the most ingenious algorithms in computer science?added bonus if the algorithm runs in constant time
Brzozowski's Double-Reversal Problem: Minimize a DFA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFA...) Solution: 1. Reverse the DFA (swap start and end states; invert all edges) 2. Determinize the resultant NFA (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pow...), skipping unreachable states 3. Repeat step 1 4. Repeat step 2 ...and you're done. This result is surprising, and the algorithm is utterly unlike any of the dozen other DFA minimization algorithms. See the amusing diagram on page 3 of http://alexandria.tue.nl/extra1/... Although the worst-cast behavior is clearly exponential, it can supposedly perform much better in practice. "Relatively little is known about Brzozowski's algorithm. Theoretically, it could have an exponential runtime - however in practice, it often outperforms Hopcroft. Nobody seems to know why!" (from http://elide.org/libfsm/blog/min...)
