What is your favorite tree?
Olive tree. The olive tree is remarkable as well, with an extraordinary underground root system that can extend over twenty feet, enabling it to draw water from deep within the earth and produce olives continuously for hundreds of years. The olive tree has always been considered a blessed tree by the three great Abrahamic faiths of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Adherents of all three religions have traditionally used its wood to make prayer beads, and there are numerous references to the olive in their sacred texts. Olives are second only to figs in Bergâ€™s table of purifying foods. Unlike other fruits, olives must be treated by human hands in order to become palatable food. The process of curing olives has long been used as a metaphor for the maturing of the human heart. Olive oil is one of the most ancient of all oils and has been used for millennia by all the Mediterranean peoples to light lamps, treat skin, and nourish bodies.
