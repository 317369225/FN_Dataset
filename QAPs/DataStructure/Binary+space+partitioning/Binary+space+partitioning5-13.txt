What are some of the most ingenious algorithms in computer science?added bonus if the algorithm runs in constant time
Four clever algorithms from machine learning/statistics: The ID3 algorithm for building a decision tree. You can build a decision tree very quickly using a "divide and conquer algorithm"Â  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3...) using just entropy. This simple algorithm can extract structure from data. The "kernel trick" that is at the heart of support vector machines. Need to work out a linearly separating plane in a high dimensional space? Sounds expensive and slow! Nope, all you need to do is find an inner product in that space that has the right properties and presto, you can find the plane. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ker...) ISOMAP/Locally linear embedding: Have your data in a high-dimensional space, but really think it's a manifold in that space? With this simple algorithm you can find the mapping pretty easily: http://isomap.stanford.edu/ (This is really a class of algorithms) Expectation-Maximization Algorithms (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exp...). Have some data you're trying to fit with a model, but don't know how? Here's the algorithm: 1. Make your best guess of how the data fits the parameters. 2. Adjust your parameters based on your guess. 3. Repeat until convergence. Amazingly simple, yet very useful.
