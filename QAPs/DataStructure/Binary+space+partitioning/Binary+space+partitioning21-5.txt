Is it true that writing operating system code and kernel code is extremely difficult? If so, how much do those types of programmers make?
It is more difficult.  There are more things to contend with, such as locking and scheduling.  Debugging is harder.  The edit–compile–debug cycle is slower because it includes a reboot.  All in all, it requires a better coder. Updated 10 Jun • View Upvotes
