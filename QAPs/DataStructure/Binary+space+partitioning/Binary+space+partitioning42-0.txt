Unix Commands: What are some easy ways to recover files from rm -rf?
In general, there aren't any easy ways. If you happen to know the inodes of the deleted files (from previously running ls -i) you can re-create them with debugfs if you do it before the space is reused for a new file. If the files were checked into version control, e.g. "svn update" will recreate them. Photorec works fairly well with photos (JPEGs), and other files that have a well-defined header - it can identify file headers on the raw disk, and tell when the file was supposed to end if it was stored in contiguous blocks. It may not work with encrypted containers or binary data. You should unmount the disk partition first, or remount it readonly (mount -o remount,ro /home), and recover files to a second volume, in case the system overwrites deleted data with new files. On RedHat systems, you can identify missing files from installed programs with "rpm -Va", assuming you did not lose the RPM database. You can then re-install damaged packages from binary RPMs or yum repositories; "rpm -qa" will tell you the installed versions.
