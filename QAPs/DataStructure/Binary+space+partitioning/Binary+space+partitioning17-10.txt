What are the 10 must-know algorithms and data structures for a software engineer?
Originally Answered: What are the most common algorithms and data structures to learn for a developer?Â  Further recommendations?This maybe a bit controversial, but I've found having a solid understanding of graphs can help formulate a lot of problems. This includes things like: Network topology Shortest path problem Topological sorting Graphs can be a bit abstract, but it helps to be able to think in that context to formulate problems. With that being said, even perhaps stating the obvious: trees are another form of graph, but it helps to be familiar with the different types of search algorithms like: Breadth-first search Depth-first search If arbitrary search spaces are your fancy: A* search algorithm Even dependencies for a piece of software are just a giant graph.
