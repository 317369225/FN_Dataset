What is your favorite tree?
My favorite tree is the coast redwood (sequoia sempervirens). It is one of three sequoia species and is known to be the tallest tree in the world. The tallest living one on record is 115.55 m or 379.1 ft tall. Redwoods grow in coastal areas along the Pacific Ocean in the west and northwest of the US (mostly in California). Redwood trees have a serene, majestic beauty to them. I've grown up around them my whole life, and I still trek to redwood parks all over northern California to wander through their shaded, dramatic groves.
