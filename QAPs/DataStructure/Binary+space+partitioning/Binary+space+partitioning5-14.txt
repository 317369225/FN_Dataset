What are some of the most ingenious algorithms in computer science?added bonus if the algorithm runs in constant time
I was always struck by the simplicity and effectiveness of k-means clustering. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-m... It is actually one of a family of algorithms that are based on expectation maximization: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exp... Which is a powerful set of tools containing other gems like gaussian mixture models. Continuing on the machine learning trend, kernel methods are simply amazing, and I would highly recommend watching the caltech lectures on SVM's and kernel methods here: Going for more recent developments, random decision forests seem stupidly simple but are actually a very clever and surprizingly effective (and fast) classifier responsible for technologies like the kinect: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ran...
