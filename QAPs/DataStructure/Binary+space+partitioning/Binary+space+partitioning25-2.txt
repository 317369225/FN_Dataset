Is there a way to find the last element of an array without involving a counter, neither explicitly nor implicitly?
Please repeat ten times after me: "In almost every application data is much more often read than written". In many cases data is read more then 100 times for every time it is written. That means there are very few cases where you have to optimise operations that write data. Or put a bit differently an optimisations that will slow down some write operations but speed up read operations will speed up your application.   You can always keep the current size of the array in a variable without counting. After all when you are creating an array you are creating an array of a certain size. So you always know the size of the array without counting. You can also have a pointer to the last element in the array. But if you know the size of the elements in the array (which you would) and the number of elements(which you also do) you can calculate that pointer easily (&array + lenghtOFAnElement * size;). Technically if the array is serialised to a disk it's no longer an array. Unless you create your own file system or the array is never bigger than a single block on the disk (and in that case what would be the point). Also when you put data on any permanent storage runtime is no longer determined by the number of operations but by the amount of IO. Updated 18 Sep • View Upvotes
