What are some of the most ingenious algorithms in computer science?added bonus if the algorithm runs in constant time
The Hungarian Algorithm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hun... always struck me as particularly clever. It's far from obvious when one first sees the assignment problem (at least it wasn't to me) that an optimal solution shouldn't take exponential time. Intuitively, it would seem one has to try and evaluate all the possible combinations. The revelation that there exists an algorithm that only takes low-degree polynomial [ specifically O(N^3) ] time is quite astoundintg. Updated 27 Feb 2012 â€¢ View Upvotes
