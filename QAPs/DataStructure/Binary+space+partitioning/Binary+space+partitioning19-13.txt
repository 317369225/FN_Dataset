How do I start learning or strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?
Originally Answered: How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?The answer depends on how technical you want to get: High Level: search for algorithm visualization sites like Sorting Algorithm Animations or sortvis.org - sorting algorithm visualisation Mid Level: Take Tim Roughgarden's Algorithm courses on Coursera. Do all the homeworks in a language of your choosing. Deeper Mid Level: Read Amazon.com: Introduction to Algorithms (9780262033848): Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein: Books cover to cover Low Level: Pick a language and start implementing algorithms in it. Repeat, and try to do it better the second time. If you can write the code without referring to anything, you have it down. Deeper Low Level: Start searching for Academic papers on optimizations for Algorithms. Many of the core Algorithms we learn in school, have many optimizations applied in production libraries or attempted by academics. One great real world example: Timsort
