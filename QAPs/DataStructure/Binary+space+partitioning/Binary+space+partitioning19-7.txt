How do I start learning or strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?
Originally Answered: Which are some of the must have books for algorithms and data structures?I have a few books that I recommend a lot Algorithms 1) Algorithm Design 1st  Edition by Jon Kleinberg, Eva Tardos - One of the best books for Algorithms and takes a good effort in making you understand the intution  behind the Algorithm, which I have found to like a lot. 2) The Algorithm Design Manual by  Steven S. Skiena - Once you get past Kleinberg, this book will introduce you to a wide range of problems, this book is a example by example book, and hence may need basic level knowledge. Graph Theory I specialized in that, and hence even though you may not need them, suggesting the following. 1) Introduction to Graph Theory 2nd Edition by Douglas B West.  - This is my favorite book, and has almost everything on Graph theory, but lacks a intutional idea. 2) Graph Theory 01 Edition by Harary - A classic book that is easy to read but a lot old by Harary, introduces Graph theory wonderfully. 3) Graph Theory 0004 Edition by  Reinhard Diestel-  Standard text book for Graph theory, and does a good job at that, but personally I like the above two books for different reasons better. References 1)  Introduction to Algorithms 3 Edition - I find this book useful only as a reference, when I need to know stuff, the algorithms and data structures, are presented as is, without any amount of intuition or anything. But if you have a technical doubt in algorithms, chances are that this book will answer it. So please do use this as a reference book. Chances are you will find better text books for each of the topics in CLRS.
