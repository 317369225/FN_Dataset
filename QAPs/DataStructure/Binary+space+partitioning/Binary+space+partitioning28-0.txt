When swapping is disabled does the kernel do demand paging?Lets say I have a big binary, does disabling swapping force the kernel to bring in the whole binary to memory or paging is still done ? If paging is done, won't it have the same bad effects of swapping and result in unpredictable latency ?
Yes, even when swapping is disabled, the kernel will perform demand paging. Moreover, even if swap is disabled, a Linux system will still page clean file data back to the backing files. This is intentional and very, very good for performance. In the rare situations where you need predictable latency, your process should call mlockall(MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE) to pre-fault and lock into RAM all of its pages.
