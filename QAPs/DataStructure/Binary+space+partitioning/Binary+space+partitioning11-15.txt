What is your favorite tree?
Sequoioideae (aka Redwood trees) This subfamily of Cupressacae includes the Sequoia (giant redwood) and Sequioadendron (giant sequoia) genera, which are known as the redwoods of California and to a lesser extent, Oregon. The third genus, Metasequoia (, is native to China and much smaller in size. Sequoiadendron giganteumÂ  ("General Sherman") These pillars of papyrus are dispersed throughout the mountainous regions of California. As a kid and teenager, I never achieved much with the Boy Scouts of America, but on the many summer camps and troop outings I took, I got to observe these magnificent organisms from both a distance and up close. I love everything about California wildlife and reservation so it's natural that our state tree is also my favorite. Seeing these massive trees tower over you still gives me shivers down my spine and even Mr. Fantastic couldn't wrap his arms around one. There are also some really cool facts about the Sequoioidae. The tallest living tree in the world is a Sequoia sempervirens that stands at almost 380 feet, and is called Hyperion. The picture below shows a group of tree climbers descending from the tree, that like the Greek Titan it was named after, towers over mankind. Also for the cheap pop for the Silicon Valley crowd, the Redwood is a big part of Stanford culture as being represented on its school seal and on the logo for the Stanford Cardinal. Sequoioideae are the Gandalf's of the tree phylum,being able to live for thousands of years. And even though this is a useless fact, I give a tip of the hat for the guys behind the nomenclature because 75% of the words in Sequoioideae are vowels! I can appreciate all types of trees, but my favorite is clearly the redwood.
