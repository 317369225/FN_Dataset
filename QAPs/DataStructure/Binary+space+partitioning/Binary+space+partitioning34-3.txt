Can all mathematical functions be fully replicated using a sequence of '+', '-' , 'x', '/' operators (as can y to the power x)?
Taylor series and forier transforms make it possible to break anything down into a combination of arithmetic operations. Some things would be very complicated to do this for, but its possible for any mathematical function. Some things would need to be calculated before using the calculations though. I think 1/(x*ln(x)) would be this way. Its derivative is ln(x) (I'm going to be really embarassed if I'm wrong there, but its been 8 years since I really did much calculus). Since a taylor series expansion requires the derivative to be calculated, this would possibly make it extremely complicated.
