Is it true that writing operating system code and kernel code is extremely difficult? If so, how much do those types of programmers make?
It's not that difficult.  In fact, in the 1970's that was often how you got a Master's degree! Re: debugging, the Multics approach was to write tons of error handling code.  The Unix approach was throw that out and replace it with a generic kernel panic.  Over time this evolved to include some generic debugging info. It's hard to say how much those programmers make as there isn't much demand for them anymore, as there are only a few kernels around at the moment.  And many of the contributors to the Linux kernel haven't been paid for their work at all!  I'm sure the kernel devs at Apple and Microsoft make bank, though.
