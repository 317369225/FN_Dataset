What is your favorite tree?
Sundari Tree (Heritiera littoralis)The Sundarbans are named after these trees abundant in the mangroves. Japanese Cherry (Prunus serrulata)No justifications needed for this one! Native to Japan, Korea and China, it is used for its spring cherry blossom displays and festivals. Silk Cotton Tree (Ceiba pentandra)Growing out of the ruins of the Ta Prohm temple of the Angkor Wat complex, these trees render the place a creepy feel. Sequoia Tree (Sequoia sempervirens)As usual, I saved the best one for the last! Nothing compares the grandeur of these giants of the forests.
