What are some of the most ingenious algorithms in computer science?added bonus if the algorithm runs in constant time
Fast Fourier Transform is certainly the most fascinating algorithm. Union-find is probably the data-structure that is astonishingly simple for the performance it delivers. However my favorite is the naive way (Ford-Fullkerson algorithm) of finding max-flow (or min cut) in graph. It is just a smart backtrack, if you look at it. Scope and applicability of flow algorithms have always fancied me, almost everything worthwhile in this world can be modeled in a flow problem. I just find the mathematical abstraction beautiful. PS : I've been told that after I get reasonably high, I tell people how flow algorithm is the most beautiful thing in this world.
