How does deleting a file empty space from a storage space?
It is certainly a good question but can be framed a bit. Ok so you are asking How does a file get deleted and the space is freed right in mobiles? Well to begin with you need to know what is a file system. To put in simpler words a file system is a software that is responsible for organising and mainitaing your files in the hard disk. Being said that every device that has a feature to save any type of file has a file system.  Desktops,  laptops, mobile phones,  etc. Now computer or any of these digital devices can only understand binary data.  Information is stored as 0s and 1s what ever be your file may be and where is it stored?  It is stored in the hard disk. Now the question is how they are stored?  That's where file systems come into picture.  The hard disk is divided into various blocks of fixed size say 2kb or 4kb.  And a portion of the blocks are allocated for system purpose that is booting and hence the name boot block is given to it.  The rest of the blocks are designated for the users.  Whenever a user creates a file,  based on the size the number of blocks are used accordingly and when the file is deleted the blocks are restored for use in other files. It is the same case with mobiles also.  Today's smartphones also have a file system in them and this is how the basic thing works.
