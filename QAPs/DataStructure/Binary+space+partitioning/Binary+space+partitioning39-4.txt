How does one begin to tackle understanding a large open source code base?Often times I've wanted to dig in behind the scenes of things such as the linux kernel, the JDK, MySQL. What techniques do you use for getting a handle on a large code base ?
To expand on Jim Dennis's answer I found the book "Code Reading : An open source perspective" to be a good starting point for clues to "decode", analyse and understand the code base : http://www.spinellis.gr/codereading Related books to "code reading" : http://speckyboy.com/2012/07/12/... Bug Fixing and Debugging by Gurudutt Mallapur on techtalkies Background information : I normally browse blogs and tutorials, FAQs, internals based on keywords from eyeballing the code or using grep/find to filter out filenames or words in code. These external sources works best for more generic code then say company specific code, though.
