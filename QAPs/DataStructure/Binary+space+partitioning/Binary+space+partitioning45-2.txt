As a developer, how much space should I allocate for Linux?I don't have much experience with programming in the Linux environment. But I want to learn development in the Linux environment. I will keep my data in my NTFS partitions. So how much space should I allocate for the / partition and the swap partition?
I have a 35 Gb / and 5 Mb swap, I have more than enough primary memory (RAM) that I simply don't need to use swap. I only have 6 Gb of RAM in my laptop and I never use more than 4 Gb. For what I do and need, having a big swap becomes useless in my case and with my hardware.
