Is it true that writing operating system code and kernel code is extremely difficult? If so, how much do those types of programmers make?
The answer is completely based off what you are trying to do, where you are testing and the platform that you are writing for. Kernel development does not have to be difficult. I'm a high school student and I wrote my own kernel from scratch 2 weeks ago. It was more fun than difficult. Make things easy on yourself. Use qemu. Qemu can emulate any environment such as i386 and arm. You can run a kernel directly without setting up a boot loader -- as a matter of fact, you can run the binary directly. qemu-system-i386 -kernel $binloc Qemu is really fast so debugging isnt too painful. Just write a simple bash script to both build and run the kernel and enjoy!
