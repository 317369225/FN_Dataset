How have graph processing techniques been applied to games, or how could they be?In particular, what are the potential challenges or advantages in using a binary space partitioning tree?Â  Or more generally, how can game developers use algorithms and computing models developed for big-data graph processing? I'm interested in thoughts from both game developers and those knowledgeable of modern graph processing (as well as the very few who may be versed in both subjects!)
