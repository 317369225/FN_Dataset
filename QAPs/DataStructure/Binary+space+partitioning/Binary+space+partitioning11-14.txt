What is your favorite tree?
The cherry blossom. It is divinely beautiful. I think it symbolises Japan and the purity of its people. This is a cherry blossom by a lake- This seen in the foreground along with Japan's highest mountain Mt Fujiama- And here is a close up of my favourite plant, it's white flowers tinged with pale pink. I live in Calcutta, India, and my favourite tree among those grown in my neighbourhood is the Golden Shower. This plant looks so beautiful in spring that I want to pull over my car just so I can stare it it. This is what it looks like in full bloom- Sometimes its flowers shed and cover the road. Here is a close-up of its flowers- The colour of both these trees cheer me up :) Updated 8 Nov 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
