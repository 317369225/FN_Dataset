How do I start learning or strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?
Originally Answered: How can I gain expert level knowledge of data structures and algorithms in 1 year?Let's do some math. In order to become a real expert, you need to put about 10000 hours of work. But the year contains 365 * 24 = 8760 hours, and you need to sleep sometimes. But don't be upset, because you can settle for the next best thing - you can put away becoming an expert to 2017-2018, but become really good this year. Here's a short list of topic you need to cover in math: Roman Trusov's answer to Which math skills should I learn in order to become a good programmer? All you need is CLRS, math books (you can find very good lists of textbooks here on Quora) and practice. You don't need a strict routine like some kind of pro sportsman, because programming is deadly boring without fun, you need persistence in you practice. Write tons of code every day, the only condition is that the code must be new to you. If your primary goal is excelling in algorithms, then focus on competitive programming: TopCoder Codeforces SPOJ CodeChef HackerRankI don't know about the amount of time you can put in coding every day, but I would suggest that 500 problems in a year will be the necessary minimum for being ready to advance.
