What are some of the most ingenious algorithms in computer science?added bonus if the algorithm runs in constant time
Some of my favourites that I haven't seen listed yet, not strictly in this order: Technically is a data structure, but still, Fibonacci Heap are pretty amazing, at least from a theoretical point of view. The Decrease-Key operation in particular, which also runs in amortized constant time (hey, I think I'm in for that bonus, though!), and is the very reason for this data structure's existence, especially in Dijkstra and Prim's algorithms Kruskal algorithm using Union find data structure for minimum spanning trees Rubin-Karp algorithm for exact string match (simple and yet clever :D) Fast exponentiation both for scalars and matrices (even simpler: don't know if that makes it even clever...)
