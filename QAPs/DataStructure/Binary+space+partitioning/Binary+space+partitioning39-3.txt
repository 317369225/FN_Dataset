How does one begin to tackle understanding a large open source code base?Often times I've wanted to dig in behind the scenes of things such as the linux kernel, the JDK, MySQL. What techniques do you use for getting a handle on a large code base ?
Adding to Waleed's answer, after getting a high level idea of the source layout and call stack, the next best step is to run the respective unit tests in debug mode and step through the statements. This can be an enlightening experience in understanding the runtime behavior of code modules. With a fairly good idea of a module, a logical next step is to write some new unit tests and make them 'green'. If the intent is to then attempt a modification, it helps to read the file's revision history and comments in version control and get a sense of the intent of previous modifications, if any.
