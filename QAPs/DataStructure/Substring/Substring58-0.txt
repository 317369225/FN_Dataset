Given a set of strings (400 or so) what is the best way to generate a regular expression to match a substring of them all. Is there an app for this?
Construct a DFA using the naive approach of constructing the dictionary of all strings you want to match as mentioned in Joshua Inkenbrandt's answer.  Apply DFA minimization.  Convert the DFA into your regular expression engine's notation.  The result will be the regular expression of the minimal DFA (by the Myhill-Nerode theorem) to match any element in your dictionary.  It will accept no more, no less. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFA... I might have misunderstood the question though.  You talk about substrings.  Does that mean the string "Armstrong" should also be accepted by the regular expression?  Or should only the full strings "Armstrong Cable Services - OH" and "Armstrong Cable Services - PA" be accepted?
