Given a string and a substring, return true if the string contains the substring's sequence of characters in order, but not necessarily right next to each other. How would you solve this?
Edited : It is incorrect won't work for all cases Make an array or linked list or a hash table of all the characters of the substring to be found in the given string. Say you use a hash table. 2. Traverse the string just once and mark down the indexes every time a character is found in your hash table. If the entry already exists update thr previous entry with the new one. Whenever a character is found of the substring just traverse the hash table and see if every index against every charcter is in increasing order. 3. Stop if you found all the characters and confirm all the indexes are in increasing order Or when you have traversed the whole string and could not find one. Edited : alternate way is deleted
