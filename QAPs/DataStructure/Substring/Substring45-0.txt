How do I find the longest string (or strings) that is a substring (or are substrings) of two or more strings?
This can be solved in linear time on the length of all strings using a generalized suffix tree. I was starting to write an explanation but there's already an article on Wikipedia about it - Longest common substring problem Basically, we build a suffix tree on the concatenation of the given strings using special terminators (an identifier not in the alphabet) between the strings. Then, we look for the largest path from the root so that the end node contains all special terminators in its children.
