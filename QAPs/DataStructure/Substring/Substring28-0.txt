What searching algorithm does Ctrl+F use to find words and substrings on a webpage?
For exact match, any string mathcing algorithm will do, but the most popular are Boyer-Moore, Knuth-Morris-Pratt and Rabin-Karp. For case insensitive match, you can use a case insensitive comparer instead of the equals operator (e.g., compare tolower(lhs) == toupper(rhs)). For regex, there are several implementatios out there, but take a look at http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/reg...
