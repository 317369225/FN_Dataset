In mathematical proofs, which substring of "if and only if" corresponds to the arrow pointing right?
The arrow pointing left is "if". "I eat toast if it's morning" is the same as "it's morning => I eat toast". The arrow pointing right is "only if", to some extent. "I eat toast only if it's morning" is the same as "it's not morning => I don't eat toast", or through contraposition, "I eat toast => it's morning". Language is messy of course. Saying "I eat toast only if it's morning" kind of implies that you do actually eat toast most mornings. In pure logic, it doesn't.
