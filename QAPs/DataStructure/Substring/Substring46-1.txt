How do I find the substring of length k that is repeated consecutively the most number of times?
Suffix Tree is the way to go , create suffix tree of given string , each node in the suffix tree contains the a suffix of given string , finally find the maximum among all the node at height K (Assuming root starts at 0). e.g. If given string is [math]S ="abcabcabc" [/math ]and if k=3 then abc will be correct the answer. There are multiple way to construct the suffix tree 1. Using Ukkonen's algorithm. 2. Using  Suffix array and LCP (Longest common prefix array ) , I prefer this . Time complexity for build suffix tree is O(nlogn) in worst cases. Finally finding the sub-string of length k will take O(n) time. Updated 83w ago • View Upvotes
