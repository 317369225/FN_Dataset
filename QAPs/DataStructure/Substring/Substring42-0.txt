Is there an algorithm to find the longest common substring between two strings in constant space?
This is usual DP problem, where we usually give compromise space for time. You can get constant space with brute force recursion but then it will be exponential solution. At best you can come up with n^5 algorithm . Find all sub-string of both string and then compare them along with maintain max count and keep updating it. To comp up with recursive refer 1.
