What is the best way to find the longest common palindromic substring between 2 strings?
Using hashing! First calculate prefix hash and suffix hashes and find which substrings are palindromes. If we have already precalculated the hashes of all substrings, then we just have to check if a particular substring with same hash exists in the other substring. Avoiding collisions is easy if you keep the hash modulo two large primes. Also, you can keep the length along with the hashes if you want to be more careful. Complexity worst case around O(N*N*logN), where N is length of strings.
