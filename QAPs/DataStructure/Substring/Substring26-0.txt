Given two Strings S1 and S2. What is the longest Substring that is a Prefix of S1 and suffix of S2?
This can be efficiently done using KMP in O(N). The algorithm is same as pattern matching where S1 is the pattern and S2 is the text. In pattern matching with KMP , we first make a prefix function out of the pattern (here S1) , and then use it to maintain the longest prefix of pattern that is also suffix at any point in S2. Here what we need is the answer at the ending character of S2, that is , the largest prefix of pattern(S1) , that will be also its suffix at this ending character.
