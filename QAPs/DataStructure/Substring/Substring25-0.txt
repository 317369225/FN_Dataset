How do I find the index of a substring in Haskell?
Perhaps you are looking for an implementation of Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm in Haskell?  If so, there's Data.Algorithms.KMP (disclaimer: it exists, but I haven't used it, so I can't vouch for its correctness or efficiency).  KMP finds occurrences of within a large body of text ('the haystack') all occurrences of a particular substring ('the needle') in O(n+m) time (where n and m are the lengths of the two strings).  This is better than the naive O(n^2) time for just checking at each position in the haystack whether the needle occurs there. For more about KMP in Haskell, check out a post from Twan van Laarhoven Knuth-Morris-Pratt in Haskell (again disclaimer: no idea if the code package above uses this implementation technique or some other one.  Still, Twan's blog is good reading).
