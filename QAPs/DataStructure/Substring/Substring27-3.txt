In Python how do I replace a string in text without replacing substrings?
There surely is: do you know something about Regexes in Python? That could help you A LOT even in much harder challenges; otherwise I would just go with this line: tekst1 = tekst.replace_all(' is ',' je ') Simple, yet quite effective :) Hope this helps, let me know if you need anymore support, possibly including some more advanced use of replace (with regexes, indeed) for more specific tasks. Happy coding :)
