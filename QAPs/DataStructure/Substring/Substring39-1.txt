Which hashCode is better for searching a substring in a string when the string length gets really long?
I think first hash code is better than second one because In Second case , result will lie with in [0,786] and string length is very large as mentioned in question so there would be more collisions . But if we talk about first case, value in result will overflow and lie with in the range of result datatype (INT_MIN <= result < INT_MAX) so probability of collision would be less in this case. if datatype of result is 64 bits the probability of collision would go downwards. EDIT: Overall if we look on hash functions mentioned above both are pretty bad because they actually loose the info about string characters when value of hash overflow the type value.
