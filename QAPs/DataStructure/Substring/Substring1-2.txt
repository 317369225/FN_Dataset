Given a string, how do I find the number of distinct substrings of the string?
As far as I know the best algorithm for the solution of this quesiton may use Suffix tree traveling algorithm at present. Suffix tree for the string BANANA. Each substring is terminated with special character $. The six paths from the root to a leaf (shown as boxes) correspond to the six suffixes A$, NA$, ANA$, NANA$,ANANA$ and BANANA$. The numbers in the leaves give the start position of the corresponding suffix. Suffix links drawn dashed. The concept was first introduced as a position tree by Weiner (1973), which Donald Knuth subsequently characterized as "Algorithm of the Year 1973". But first of all you need to build a suffix tree structure. If we don't consider the unique letters, this question can be consider as a typical N-gram problem. So we can to use N-gram algorithm to solve it. Maybe the general solution is using brute force method, but obviously the time complexity is n^2.
