In the extension of the digits of pi, what is the longest ( known and theoretical ) consecutively repeated substring sequence of digits?
Pi is widely believed to be a normal number, which means that theoretically there is no limit to the length of consecutively repeated substrings of digits. However this has not yet been proven. Interestingly, if a number is normal in one integer base, then it is normal in any base. Therefore pi may well contain every finite string of 1's and 0's in it's binary representation. Extrapolating from that, all information in the universe which could be represented by a computer is contained somewhere in pi. That includes every possible video, every post on Quora and even your credit card details! I have no idea what the largest known repeated substring is, but it wouldn't take long to compute. What I do know is that the mischievous physicist Richard Feynman had memorised the digits of pi to a point where there was a sequence of six 9's. He'd then recite the digits of pi that he knew, ending by saying "9,9,9,9,9,9 and so on!"
