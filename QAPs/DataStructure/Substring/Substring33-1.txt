Given a string and a substring, return true if the string contains the substring's sequence of characters in order, but not necessarily right next to each other. How would you solve this?
You can solve this problem in [math]O(m+n)[/math]. The problem can be easily converted to a The Longest-Common-Sub-sequence problem. Consider two string x and y. We can calculate the array c, where [math]c[i][j]Â [/math] means the length of longest common subsequence of [math]x[1..i][/math] and [math]y[1..j][/math]. (start from 1) Then, the answer is c[strlen(x)][strlen(y)]. If the answer is equal to the length of the substring, it's ture for this problems. Otherwise, it's false.
