In MySQL, how do I select rows from a table where the strings in a column each share a substring in common?
The easiest way is to enumerate the strings of interest in another table and do a count(*) group by to capture common items.Â  General string processing in SQL is a huge pain, although I'm sure some SQL weenie could come up with some gross looping thing that would kinda sorta work. If you were doing this "in real life", something like the below approach is probably decent, although the below also isn't very fast and can't be optimized all that well. So, you'd have something like create table menu_items( id int auto_increment,  item_name varchar(50),  primary key (id));insert into menu_items (item_name) values('creme brulee'), ('American hamburger'), (French fries);create table reviews ( rev_id int auto_increment,  recommendation varchar(512),  primary key (rev_id));select m.item_name, count(*)   from menu_items m, reviews r where lower(r.reviews) like            concat('%', lower(m.item_name), '%') group by m.item_name having count(*) > 1; This won't return the first four rows, but it will give you the menu items and their counts.
