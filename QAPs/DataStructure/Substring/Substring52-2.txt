In the extension of the digits of pi, what is the longest ( known and theoretical ) consecutively repeated substring sequence of digits?
I went to the Pi-Search Page and found the longest repeating string (such as 11111) to be 7 or 8 within the first 200 million digits. When I took the log of the place where the string was found, it seems to be that although you have to keep going really, really, really far out (probably trillions and quadrillions of digits), you will eventually find a longer repeating string. For example, the log of the locations for the 8-digit string was about 8, the 7-digit string was about 7, etc. The Pi-Search Page What's weird is that this distribution seems to be independent of the actual string itself, so 1234567... probably also has the same spread across pi. I don't know how one could prove this one way or the other. Maybe proof by contradiction assuming there is a longest string? Maybe a real mathematician (as opposed to a layman like me) can take a stab at it. See also: Probability of Finding Strings In Pi Updated 77w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
