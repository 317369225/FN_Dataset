In MySQL, how do I select rows from a table where the strings in a column each share a substring in common?
What I think would be an ordinary solution would be first, like Greg Kemnitz said, have a menu_items table but with an additional int column num_occurences starting at 0, and second: have a join table menu_items_reviews. third: each time review is added it is checked for menu items from the application logic and the menu items mentioned have the num_occurences increased by 1, and also a row is inserted in the join table. When trying to get the reviews for the items mentioned more than x times, you would do a SELECT (...) FROM menu_items mi JOIN menu_items_reviews mir ON (...) WHERE  mi.num_occurences > x From the menu_items_reviews table results you should be able to navigate easily to the reviews table. Also when deleting reviews make sure the number of occurences in the menu_item is decremented.
