In the KMP algorithm, what is the purpose of finding the longest proper substring?
Purpose of longest common substring or prefix function also known as failure function is to know the amount by which we have to shift when an mismatch of pattern with text occur. Prefix function computes then maximum length proper prefix that is also proper suffix of pattern(make sure u understand prefix and suffix of string before reading this) A string with single character has prefix function value 0(think why?) prefix function value of String a b Value 0 0 i.e if mismatch occur we are allowed to shift only 1 character prefix function value of String a b a b Value 0 0 1 2 i.e if mismatch occur at 4 character b there is no harm on shifting 2 characters
