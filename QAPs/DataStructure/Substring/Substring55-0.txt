Can I make an array for a repeated substring like the description below?
I'd like to think that there is a way to reduce the run time. Using for instance some divide and conquer technique. However there's a lot of questions about this. For instance how do you derive the [0,1,2,3,4,0...] Array? I don't understand the correlation of that with a repeated "abbda". A minor thing: what programming language are you using? I'm guessing C or a derivative; but it's important to specify. Particularly because if I knew what you were doing exactly, I could say its trivial in Haskell. But not but so much in C or Java Lastly what is the application of this? As in what are you going haha. Is it just theoretical?
