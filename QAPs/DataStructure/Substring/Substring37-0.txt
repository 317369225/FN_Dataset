Can a name of a new company contain a substring from another company?
This is not a question of copyright; company names are not "creative works" subject to copyright protection.  Rather, this is a question about trademark or service mark protection. The general legal test for such a registration or use would usually be "reasonable consumer confusion" - if the new name or mark would reasonably interfere with the positioning or marketing of the old name or mark in that it would cause confusion for consumers, it probably would not stand.
