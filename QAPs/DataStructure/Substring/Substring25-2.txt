How do I find the index of a substring in Haskell?
Are you working with Strings or with ByteStrings? If you are using ByteStrings there is findSubstring :: ByteString -> ByteString -> Maybe Int If you are using Strings I shall agree with Arnaud Bailly that you probably do not really want to find that index. Are you "thinking imperative"? Stop doing it. Think what you want to do with that index and then just do it directly. Do not access stuff "by index". In any case if you really want to implement a plain String version of findSubstring it's quite easy: import Data.ListfindSubstring :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> Maybe IntfindSubstring pat str = findIndex (isPrefixOf pat) (tails str)
