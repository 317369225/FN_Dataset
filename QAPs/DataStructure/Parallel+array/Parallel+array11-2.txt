What have been the most interesting papers in computer science for 2011?
My areas of study are rather limited and haphazard, but here are three papers that piqued my interest in 2011: Jessica Davies, et. al: Complexity of and Algorithms for Borda Manipulation (http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.ph...). This paper is fascinating in that it establishes that manipulating elections conducted under the Borda count system is NP-hard, yet also provides approximation methods powerful enough to manipulate the outcome of Borda-count elections in almost every case. Ben Lippmeier and Gabriele Keller: Efficient Parallel Stencil Convolution in Haskell (http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~benl...). Normally, computer vision libraries are written with traditional imperative languages, as speed is the primary concern. This paper shows that with the new Repa parallel arrays library, GHC and LLVM can generate image processing code that's as fast as OpenCV, the industry standard. Virginia Williams: Breaking the Coppersmith-Winograd Barrier (http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~virg...). Though this algorithm is of mostly theoretical use (the Strassen algorithm is still the most practical algorithm for matrix multiplication), it's still interesting to watch as this operation is refined further and further.
