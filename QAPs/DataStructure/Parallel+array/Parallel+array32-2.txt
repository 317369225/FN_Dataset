How do I find out that whether the cache (L1, L2, L3) on my computer is associative (2-way, 4-way, or 8-way) or directly mapped?
First determine the cache size: repeatedly loop, for instance adding two arrays together; you'll see a drop in performance when the amount of data gets more than the cache size. Typically this is 32k or 64k. Then write a bunch of loops [math]y_i=x1_i[/math], [math]y_i=x1_i+x2_i+x3_i[/math] where the arrays add up to the cache size and they are spaced a power of 2 apart. Of course this means that you have to have a number of arrays that is a power of 2. You'll again see a big drop in performance when you exceed the associativity. This story works for L1. The L2 is often shared between code and data, so you can't measure precisely how big it is, and also the interaction with the L1 makes things harder to measure. Updated 63w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
