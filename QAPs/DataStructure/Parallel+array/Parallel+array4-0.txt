What is meant by an array processor and how is it different to other types of parallel processors?
Parallel means simultaneous processing of a task on different set of processor to obtain result in fast manner. This can be achieved by a set of computers connected in a network or processing task on a computer having multiple processors. Later method requires processor to access data from a shared memory ( a shared Last Level Cache(LLC) L2 cache in case of multi-cores for examples). Array processors widely known as Vector processor corresponds to CPU Design in which CPU is implemented with instructions to work upon a one-dimensional arrays of data called as vectors. These designs are typically reffered as SIMD architectures. Thus Vector processor is implementedÂ  by designing ISA of the processor to work on 1-D arrays of vectors.
