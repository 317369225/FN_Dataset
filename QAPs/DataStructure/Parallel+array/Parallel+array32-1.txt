How do I find out that whether the cache (L1, L2, L3) on my computer is associative (2-way, 4-way, or 8-way) or directly mapped?
Assuming you are using Unix/LinuxÂ  family of OS, there are bunch of ways to get the specs of Cache. I am listing out a few of them: Using dmidecode : The man page of dmidecode tells us that dmidecode is a tool for dumping the system's hardware specification's in a human readble format. Use sudo dmidecode -t cache on a standard terminal. Using lshw : similar to the above method, do sudo lshw and grep for cache. Reading the /sys/devices/system/cpu/ directory, Inside this directory is a directory which describes hardware attributes of all cpus on your system, Each of these folders inturn has folders representing caches on that cpu which inturn has the attributes of the cache on that cpu. About the hardware simulators, there are plenty of open source hardware simulators, google for it.
