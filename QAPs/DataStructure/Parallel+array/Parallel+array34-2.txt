What is the fastest algorithm to find the largest number in an unsorted array with multiple processors?
The problem is O(n). The number of processors merely changes the constant on your complexity equation. If the size of the array is relatively small, splitting it into p segments and farming the execution out to p processors could take more time than just performing the same calculation on less than p processors. The actual run time will depend on the size of the array, where it is stored (I.e. I/O time), and the memory and communication topology of your multiprocessor system. Just keep in mind that no matter what these characteristics are, the problem is O(n).
