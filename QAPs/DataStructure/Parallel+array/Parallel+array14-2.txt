What is it like when photovolteic solar power system batteries die?
Brian, Are you certain all the batteries are dead?  Have you tested each battery in each pair individually while under load?  You may be able to remove the worst batteries from the array and prolong the life of the remaining cells a bit longer, albeit with reduced capacity. Judging from the photo, it looks like you have an parallel array of 4 sets of 2 batteries in series, for a nominal output voltage of 24 V.  If you removed the two worst batteries, assuming the remaining batteries are still capable of 8 V each, you could rewire the array in 2 parallel arrays of 3 batteries in series.  That would still give you a nominal 24 V output, and might buy you some more time to replace the batteries. HTH.
