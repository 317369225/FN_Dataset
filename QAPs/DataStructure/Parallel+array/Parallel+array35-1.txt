What is the difference between OpenMP and Open MPI?
OpenMP is a programming platform that allows one to parallelize code over a homogeneous shared memory system (e.g., a multi-core processor).  For instance, one could parallelize a set of operations over a multi-core processor where the cores share memory between each other.  This memory includes cache memory, RAM, hard disk memory, etc., and communication is easy and relatively cheap. Open MPI (based on Message Passing Interface) is also a programming platform, but instead provides one the ability to parallelize code over a (non-)homogenous distributed system (e.g., a supercomputer).  For instance, it's possible to parallelize an entire program over a network of computers, or nodes, which communicate over the same network.  Since these nodes are essentially computers, they have their own memory layout and their own set of cores (see OpenMP description).  Communication between nodes, when compared to shared memory systems, can be difficult and is usually expensive.
