What are some tips for an intermediate level computer programmer to become an expert?
Learn the other programming paradigms. For instance, if all you know is Object-Oriented Programming, then learn Procedural Programming and Functional Programming. If all you know is object-oriented programming, then every problem looks like a good opportunity to create some objects.  It's he Law of the instrument - When you only have a hammer, treat everything as if it is a nail. Learning procedural programming will teach you that there are a ton of times when objects are not really needed at all.  Storing data in parallel arrays, for instance, may be much faster and more economical. Learning functional programming will teach you how to create functions that can be passed to data (opposite of imperative programming) and how this concept can make data programming much more intuitive.  When you know all of the major programming paradigms, then you will start to recognize which tool is best for every job.
