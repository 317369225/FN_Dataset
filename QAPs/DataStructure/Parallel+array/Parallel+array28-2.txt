The Matrix (1999 movie):Â Why didn't the sentient machines in the Matrix simply use cows instead of humans as their energy source?
I'm with Sven Skoog. That's an impressive question for a child his age. Actually it's a perfectly valid question why the Machines didn't turn to any other energy source to power their society when there are plenty available on Earth, with or without the sun involved. I think the Machines did it because they wanted to enslave humanity. It was not good enough that humans were defeated in war, or eradicated off the face of the earth. The Machines wanted humanity under their boot, as they (the Machines) had been before the war. So they came up with a way for humans to do the work of powering their civilization, with the satisfaction that their former masters are now nothing more to them than livestock.
