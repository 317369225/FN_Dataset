Where can I find a programmer willing to teach an 11 year old to make video games?
Quick and simple answer.... "Don't learn to program games...." instead "Learn to program first...." I'm being serious, if you immediately jump into trying to learn just to write games, then you'll only ever learn about things that are applicable to games. While this is not a bad thing, it's certainly not a good thing either. A good developer, knows his/her craft, they know when to optimize, how to optimize, they know when to use a for loop instead of a while loop, or that a state machine construct would be better in a given situation than a parallel task array. Put simply, writing games is about learning just enough code to achieve your end goal, but learning to write code is about learning a craft that can be used in many other ways. When I was young, this was exactly what I did, so I concentrated all my resources on learning how to tweak graphics and sound hardware, how to get the best out of bare knuckle machine code programming, and how to push a machine to it's absolute limits, and despite the fact that I can still do all of that, I sit here mostly writing business applications to earn my money. I don't ever regret learning this stuff, but it took me a lot longer to become a great programmer than most of the other folks around me, I eventually caught up but probably just a little too late. So, the premise is simple, learn your craft first, then specialize in your chosen field.
