Are all O(n) algorithms "Embarrassingly parallel"?
Saying O(n) is to say that this is its sequential complexity, the total work that must be done for an input of size n. To assess its parallelizability you must also specify its idealized parallel complexity, the max of the longest chain of sequential dependencies in the program, called the span. The parallelizability ratio is the ratio of work to span.  If it is large (proportional to the problem size), then parallelism will be effective.  If it is constant, then no amount of parallelism will help.
