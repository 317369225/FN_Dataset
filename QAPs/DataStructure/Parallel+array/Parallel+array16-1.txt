What are the trending research areas in computer networks?
I know of one project developing steerable intelligent antenna arrays, where the array uses phase differences to steer a sharp, strong signal to each user location, tracking those locations in real time.  That multiplies the number of users each antenna can service by some considerable factor.  Antenna real estate is getting scarce, so this has some value. You might consider IPv6 a research project, but it seems to be stalled. There is a lot of work being done on the "web of things", using gigahertz frequencies and near field transmission.  If, for some reason, your toaster wants to talk to your refrigerator, it will be able to do so.  We can only speculate on what it would say.  Mine only says "ding!" As far as computer networks being used for parallel processing, it has been a race between the Cray-type super computers where every component is optimized for ultimate speed vs the massively parallel arrays of microprocessors.  A generalized method to split up an algorithm among many processors is a difficult problem and may not be possible in some cases. Network security is a hot topic, but we can't talk about it. I'm sure some of the Quora members in this field will have more answers
