What have been the most interesting papers in computer science for 2011?
I would recommend papers from Dr. Alan Mislove(http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amis...), related to Online Social Networks. As stated on his personal page: We conducted a large-scale measurement study of the structures of several online social network graphs, i.e., the network graphs formed by users connecting with their friends. We are currently investigating the dynamic evolution of these social network graphs and the ways in which information propagates over them. Some of their interesting papers published in 2011 include: Yabing Liu, Krishna Gummadi, Balanchander Krishnamurthy, and Alan Mislove: Analyzing Facebook privacy settings: User expectations vs. reality, In Proceedings of the 11th ACM/USENIX Internet Measurement Conference (IMC'11), Berlin, Germany, November 2011. Alan Mislove, Sune Lehmann, Yong-Yeol Ahn, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, and J. Niels Rosenquist:ï»¿ Understanding the Demographics of Twitter Users, In Proceedings of the Fifth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM'11), Barcelona, Spain, July 2011.
