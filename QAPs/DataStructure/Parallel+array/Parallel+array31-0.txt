What does the MATLAB parallel computing toolbox do?
Parallel Computing Toolbox: Key Features Parallel for-loops (parfor) for running task-parallel algorithms on multiple processors Support for CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPUs Ability to run twelve workers locally on a multicore desktop (with the latest version of MATLAB) Computer cluster and grid support (with MATLAB Distributed Computing Server) Interactive and batch execution of parallel applications Distributed arrays and single program multiple data (spmd) construct for large dataset handling and data-parallel algorithms Very few modifications required to an existing serial program to convert into a parallel program depending on the application.
