Why would anyone use any version of Fortran after FORTRAN90?
I can think of two major reasons. 1.  Make use of modern programming features. 2.  Use built-in facilities for parallel programming. Modern Features.  Fortran 2003 added many new features, including several major ones.  Here are a few of the more important features. 1.  Interoperability with C.  Using these features, a Fortran program can call a procedure written in any other language provided that its interface can be expressed using an ISO standard C prototype. 2.  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  Fortran 2003 is a fully object-oriented language.  Its OOP features include, but are not limited to:  Encapsulation, Information Hiding, Inheritance, Type-Bound Procedures, Polymorphism, Procedure Pointers, Abstract Data Types, as well as others. 3.  Asynchronous I/O. 4.  User-Defined Derived-Type I/O. 5.  IEEE Floating-Point Exception Handling. 6.  Stream I/O. 7.  Command Line Arguments and Environment Variables. 8.  Parameterized Derived Types. 9.  Removal of Restrictions on Allocatable Arrays. Parallel Programming.  Fortran 2008 has a built-in capability for parallel programming, using Co-Arrays.  This feature provides a very powerful syntax for writing programs that can make use of multiple processors at the same time in a way that is relatively straightforward.  The Co-Array feature has proven to be so important that many vendors of Fortran compilers implemented it before they completed work on some Fortran 2003 features. Hope this helps.
