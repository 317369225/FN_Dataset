How can I learn coding to be an elite programmer with no one to guide me? I have described my present situation in the details.
First be a good algorithm designer. It will make 90% of your job easier. Learn C precisely. It makes other languages easier. Try to write a code for given problem in all possible ways while solving. It makes you explore depth of the language. Do experiments by editing unknown codes. You can get similar codes on web for a designed algorithm in all languages. I wrote an android app ( https://play.google.com/store/ap... ) with out having a great knowledge on Java. It's unbelievable but true I hadn't executed any java code before writing my app. I made that by watching some introductory videos to java and Android. What I had done was break my logic to small small parts , searched in Google for appropriate result and change them according to my need. Editing and examining the code improved my skills in writing code. Tracing and solving the Bugs made me even more perfect. As you would like to join Google try to learn in execution point-of-view. Because developing good algorithm may give you a better code but knowledge on execution will let you design a robust app and that's what Google see for not the no of languages you had learned. Good luck for your career.
