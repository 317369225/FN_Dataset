When will quantum computing support widespread industry work?
Think of quantum computing technology as the opposite of nuclear fusion technology.  One requires extreme cold, the other extreme temperature.  I have watched nuclear fusion for twenty years; it still disappoints.  Quantum computing involves different challenges but IMOH ones just as hard and will take a long time before it can become routine. Further, while a lot of advanced degree physics majors and their professors write learned papers on programming quantum computers, no one has come close to building anything that would run useful versions of their programs. From my experience with computers, which has been over a long history if not extensive, quantum computing will usually be accomplished with a system in the cloud, not on a local computer.  A breakthrough in refrigeration technology could change that, but not likely.  The analogy of highly parallel array scientific computers (Page on cray.com Seymour Cray, a Man Who Changed the World) would suggest that there will be a lot of hype but almost no applications that appeal to home users or even not many working engineers.  A handful of specialists may find it very useful. I write this, not to discourage you but to counter what seems to be great enthusiasm and hope for the promise of quantum computing.  I share that enthusiasm and hope but not the expectation that it will be a major factor in the job market for engineers and programmers.
