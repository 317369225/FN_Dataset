What would an algorithm in the form of a flow chart that inputs the top speeds (in km/hr) of 5000 cars, outputs the fastest speed and the slowest speed and finally outputs the average (mean) speed of all the 5000 cars look like?
It depends, in a language like Python or APL or PL/I or C++ with an STD, which do  parallel array operations, it's just one step:  max( DataArray ), min( DataArray ), avg( DataArray ) or very similar. But I suspect they want yo to grind through then values, something like: Maxi := -999999; Mini := 9999999; Tot := 0; while not eof( input ):     read ( speed )    if speed < Mini:  Mini := speed    if speed > MaxiL  Maxi = speed   Tot := Tot + speed   Count := Count + 1 ... I left out two important bits.   Avg := Tot / Count
