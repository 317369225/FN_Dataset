Can we use MapReduce to parallelize operations done on a row from a matrix (2d array)?
Unless your matrix is incredibly large—far too big to fit on a single machine—map reduce is the wrong tool. Map reduce is designed to scale over many machines, not as a general model of parallelism. In other words, map reduce only makes sense if you need to distribute a problem involving incredible amounts of data over a cluster of machines. For parallelizing a normal matrix operation, you probably want to look at some existing threading system (like OpenMP) and SIMD intrinsics for data parallelism.
