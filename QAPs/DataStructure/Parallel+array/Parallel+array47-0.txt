What are the ways to determine if a very large number is divisible by 7 using parallel threads?
Another approach: Suppose we have an integer x with digits x_0 (least significant) in base b.  First compute the residue of b modulo 7, [math]b^* = b[/math] mod 7.  If [math]b^*[/math] is 0 then the remainder of x mod 7 is [math]x_0[/math] mod 7. Otherwise, compute the sum of every sixth digit for every residue modulo 6, modulo 7.  (i.e. compute [math]r_0 = (x_0 + x_6 + x_{12} + \cdots)[/math] mod 7, [math]r_1 = (x_1 + x_7 + x_{13} + \cdots)[/math] mod 7, [math]\cdots[/math]).  This is a pretty standard reduction to compute in parallel. After that the remainder modulo 7 of x is the constant sized expression [math]\sum_{i=0}^5 (b^*)^i r_i[/math] taken modulo 7.
