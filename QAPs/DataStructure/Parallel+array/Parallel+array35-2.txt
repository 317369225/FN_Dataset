What is the difference between OpenMP and Open MPI?
OpenMP is a language-extension for expressing data-parallel operations (commonly arrays parallelized over loops).  MPI is a library for message-passing between shared-nothing processes. OpenMP is a higher-level of abstraction, since its purpose is to expose the program's concurrency and dataflow to the compiler.  By contrast, MPI concurrency is implicit (all processes are parallel), and the messages establish the dataflow structure of the computation. Although it's common to think of OpenMP as being only about shared memory, there's nothing preventing an OpenMP implementation from using MPI to operate across processes and hosts.  OTOH, the duality of shared memory and message passing means that MPI implementations often take advantage of shared memory for ranks on the same node...
