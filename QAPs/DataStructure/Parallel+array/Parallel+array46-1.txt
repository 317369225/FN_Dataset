Will the first conscious AI be a distributed system or a single processor?
My guess ... is that an AI would best fit a highly parallel architecture. Imagine a large array of individual computing elements - where each element optimises itself to have maximum utility.  And so it self-organises. It appears that brains do something similar. The connection map of cells is not hard-wired in our genes. But rather the cells figure-out their own local connections based on requirement. So I'd expect the best computer architecture to run that would be something like a GPU cluster.   Which would allow billions of "relatively dumb" code fragments to run at high speed in parallel.
