How can I learn coding to be an elite programmer with no one to guide me? I have described my present situation in the details.
Being an elite programmer and getting a job at Google are not the same thing. The people who are making a difference at Google are not the people who intended to get a job at Google, rather they are the people who wanted to work on something they were passionate about. Reading books with no clue of how you will be using the knowledge might not be the best use of your time. If you want to build a career as an engineer, find something that consumes you and work on it. Google is a company. Companies come and go. Engineering doesn't. My advice would be; on the short run find a GSoC project on which you can spend endless hours. The open-source community will guide you what to read and what to do. :) The truth of technology companies is they need you more than you need them. So, stop chasing them and find yourself.
