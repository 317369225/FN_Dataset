How do I find out that whether the cache (L1, L2, L3) on my computer is associative (2-way, 4-way, or 8-way) or directly mapped?
You will not find direct mapped caches anymore for L1, L2, and L3 caches. Their hit rates are lower than their set associative counterparts and there are other constraints, such as allowing parallel tag/data array accesses along with virtual to physical address translation, that put requirements on the set associativity of the cache memory. You can find information about your cache using the CPUID instruction in software (coupled with the Intel manuals to interpret the data you receive), assuming that you have an Intel or AMD chip. I think CPU-Z might give you that information as well, but I've always taken a software approach to answering that question. Maybe someone else can elaborate further. Cachegrind, a tool from valgrind, allows for simulation of various cache configurations. I have also developed software that performs cache simulation, and depending on your situation, may be willing to license it for your use.
