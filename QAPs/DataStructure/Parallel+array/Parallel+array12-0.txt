How should I plan to cover major topics like trees, LL, DP and array on http://geeksforgeeks.org in the next two months in parallel with my summer internship?
Yes it is quite possible, you write down 5 problems when you go to office( in your free time of course )work out a solution for them and think, don't code at all even to verify, don't look at answers. go home eat dinner and code if (you can make it)   Good else  Lookup for the solution, and always look for the O(n) solution/O(n2) in case of DP. by this method you practice the most important part of problem solving i.e in which direction you should think when you look at a problem. On weekends use Hackerrank- If you are average, Top Coder and SPOJ if you are good/great. and 5*40=200 problems leaving apart sat and sun. i thinks that's pretty good. GoodLuck :)
