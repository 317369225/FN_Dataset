Will the first conscious AI be a distributed system or a single processor?
While I fully expect there will be conscious AI at some point in the next 50 or so years, the likelihood of the initial version running on a single (or multicore) process of current design seems extremely remote. For the first part, I'm a reductivist that sees nothing but chemical processes in the brain and nervous system that, after enough study, we'll be able emulate correctly, and 50 years is a long time given the rate of progress over the last century in medical and electronic sciences. For the second part, the network of neural connections is what can fairly be called "embarrassingly parallel", once you know how to wire it and what all the operations are.  Given that parallelism, and the number of "compute elements" in play, it's seems very unlikely a single threaded solution would be the first viable approach.   Eventually, it might be possible to transform the parallel approach into a small set of state machines that could run on a limited number of cpus, but it would be much slower as it grinds through transitions serially.    While it's plausible quantum computation might change the tradeoffs, or we get some other radical architectural change (silicon made with billions of "neurons" on chip instead of cores), that seems more speculative.
