Will the first conscious AI be a distributed system or a single processor?
I'm going to go far afield and predict that the first AI with serious consciousness will be implemented in something quite different from current technology. It will likely be an organo-carbon nanotube hybrid that is partly grown and partly assembled. My guess is that we will grow an organic scaffold capable of accepting attached processing units at a molecular level. It will have a modular architecture and one supporting communications networks through the brain.  Yes, brain. Because that is what it will be in effect. We are going to jump from the current idea of computers to something new.  It likely will not execute perfect algorithms but instead operate on a new principle that is somewhat probabilistic instead of rigorously deterministic. Thus is because the complexity of the real world does not allow for handling all problems with the tools of rigid logic. Why? Because in the real world, not all outcomes are predictable or even certain. The human mind does not operate with absolute certainty and it cannot, and there is no reason to believe we can come up with a perfect silicon machine capable of handling the world. We know that a machine capable of handling the world to  practical level can exist, because it does exist. It's called a human brain. Its architecture starts out governed by DNA and then it grows and develops a bit beyond that. An organo-synthetic hybrid will be able to overcome the limitations of rigid silicon and neural nets built within fixed machines. So, the answer is: closer to distributed system but not a distributed system as we are currently accustomed to thinking of one. Present technology engineers are guilty of a failure to think far enough beyond comfortable paradigms. Check back with me in 25 years and we'll see.
