When will quantum computing support widespread industry work?
There isn't even a slight indication that it's doable or useful for any general use.  A few companies have been able at great bother and expense to form a superposition of a few quits and get inconsistent and inscrutable results. Not exactly what you can see ever using to balance a checkbook.    I would not factor quantum computing into any life decisions, either way.
