The Matrix (1999 movie): Why didn't the sentient machines in the Matrix simply use cows instead of humans as their energy source?
Very impressive question for an eleven-year-old.  I'd be proud.  =) Though I agree with Robert -- it's almost certainly a writing artifice -- you *could* travel down a line of argument about neuron density.  Humans are very nearly the most 'space-efficient' (brain-size per body mass and # of neurons per body mass) creature on the planet, and certainly the most 'space-efficient' being with high(er) reasoning capacity. Maybe make it into a (fun) learning exercise?  Consult The 4 Biggest Myths About the Human Brain and (jointly) look at the size of whale-brains and elephant-brains, but then marvel at the density of 80,000+ human-brain neurons, and *then* do some math to see if there's a more space-efficient animal.  (Hint:  try mice and/or birds.)  As a post-script:  consider whether human birth (1-2 offspring per mating, 3 if you push the limits to dangerous extremes) is the most effective method of "making new batteries."  The aforementioned mice have litters of six to eight.
