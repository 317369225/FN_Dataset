Why is modern Fortran cool?
To me Fortran is cool because it is easy to learn, hard to make grave errors with, and for numerical computation there is no faster running language, maybe equally fast on a good day.  F77 was a pain to code because the code had to fall within certain column regions.  Now any column from 1 to 132 is fair game for anything.  I don't understand why people still use F77 when F90 is available and so much easier to write.  Compared with other serious programming languages, Fortran is a bit more removed from the hardware so there is less to learn and less to break.  It can read data in, do math, and write data out and that is about it.  The software I use every day at work (Nastran) is written in Fortran.  I personally write Fortran code to automate engineering calculations. You will probably think 'modern' Fortran is cool because it has built-in features for parallel processing.  Co-arrays are the big one.  They make writing parallel processing code almost trivial.  The Intel compiler, and probably others, has an auto-parallelization feature so you don't need to even know how to code parallel programs, it does everything for you.  This is why it is so popular for high performance computing.  The people writing that code are mathematicians of sorts, not computer scientists.  They want a language that runs very fast but is easy to use for what they want it to do. I will leave you with a quote:  “A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant” -Alan Perlis
