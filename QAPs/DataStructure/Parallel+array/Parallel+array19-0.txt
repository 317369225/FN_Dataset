What would an algorithm in the form of a flow chart that inputs the top speeds (in km/hr) of 5000 cars, outputs the fastest speed and the slowest speed and finally outputs the average (mean) speed of all the 5000 cars look like?
A flow chart? Really? I can't remember the last time I saw a flow chart. The main thing you should take away from this exercise is that you do not need, or want, to store the dataset. All of the statistics you are expected to calculate for this data set can be calculated iteratively as the data is read in, and so you only need to retain each data point long enough to update the intermediate statistics necessary (min, max, sum, and count) to compute the desired output statistics. Many neophyte programmers will naively read the dataset into an array, then iterate over it three times, once to find the min, once to find the max, and once to find the average. This is slower (albeit only by a constant) than iterating over the data once and updating all the statistics in parallel, but more importantly is O(n) in space instead of O(1). When n is only 5000, this doesn't really matter much, but it sure as hell does when n is 500 million.
