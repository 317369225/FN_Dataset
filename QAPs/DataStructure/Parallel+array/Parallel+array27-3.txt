What is the use of restrict keyword in C99?
This keyword attempts to remove the bad side-effects of aliasing pointers. When we declare a pointer as restrict, we tell the compiler that only this can be used to access the objects it points to. However we can still derive pointers to other memory blocks. Suppose we say int *restrict a;a = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);*a = 10;    // Makes first element of array 10*(a + 1) = 20;   //This is Allowed by restrictint *test;test = a;*test = 20;   // Changing the first value using test is not allowed !!free(a); Restrict Keyword is very helpful is preventing unwanted aliasing. It also helps in generating faster and more optimised machine level codes. This is because sometime, the program has to reload the value pointed to by a pointer. However with restrict the compiler will know the there is no aliasing so no need to reload.
