Why is modern Fortran cool?
Fortran 90 was the second programming language I learned, the first was Pascal. I don't think it's cool, and neither did I really learn to program a computer from learning Fortran. Looking at Fortran 66 (aka FORTRAN IV) and Fortran 77, I can certainly see that Fortran 90 was a huge improvement. But the later editions of Fortran? Fortran 2003 has the ISO C bindings, and Fortran 2008 has the ISO environment. Those are 'cool', in the sence that Fortran can finally be combined with C or other languages in a portable way: No more Cray pointers, g77/f2c ABI and other non-standard nastyness. But the other features of later Fortran editions? I have not heard anyone say they think OOP in Fortran is cool. Those who need OOP should really use the opportunity to learn some new skills instead, like Python, Java or (heaven forbid) C++.
