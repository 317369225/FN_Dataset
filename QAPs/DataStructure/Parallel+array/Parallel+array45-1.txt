Parallel Computing:Â What is the difference between SIMD and MIMD?
SIMD and MIMD are two types of parallel computing architectures. Simple Instruction Multiple Data In SIMD processor, we have a global controller unit with many processors and all the processor does the same thing. Like in the case of vector addition, all the processor are assigned a data to add and all of them will be doing the addition operations. Thus, SIMD is used in the situations when a lot of computations are required with all the processors doing the same job. Furthermore, since SIMD is simple to design and is less expensive and faster. Being synchronous, programming in SIMD architecture is comparatively easier. Multiple Instruction Multiple Data SIMD is limited to only few applications. In the cases like where we don't have identical but many independent tasks then we use MIMD architecture. Here, each processor is assigned an independent controller and each processors will be doing an independent task. Like one processor many be doing the addition, another multiplication and so on. MIMD operations may or may not be synchronized. However, because of the complexity MIMD processors tend to be expensive. Nonetheless it can solve the complex problemm.
