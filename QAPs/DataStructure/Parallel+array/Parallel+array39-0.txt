★★★★★I'm not sure how much sense there is in reviewing a start-up that was acquired nearly two years ago? But since I have to give a rating, and I was VP-Marketing it is obviously 5 stars :) It is hardly a movie or a consumer purchase: the only "reviewers" who mattered were the ones who bought the company (or who had the opportunity and passed). fwiw I think we had a  really good DSP architecture, based on massively parallel hetergenous array of simple processors. You could model it as CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) or BSP (Bulk Synchronous Parallel). This was a very good fit to "hard wireless". It also had a really excellent toolchain. We had a strong presence in WiMAX, then did a good job in creating the market for small cells & femtocells, but that market was slow to take off and we were overtaken by Broadcom & Qualcomm. Picochip was acquired January 2011 by Mindspeed. Not the best exit ever, but not embarrassing. In November 2013 Mindspeed announced it was being acquired by M/A-Com;  the wireless business unit (essentially Picochip) was sold to Intel. I wasn't A2A but since someone (or some bot) raised the "question" then I could hardly ignore it. Updated 109w ago • View Upvotes
