What is the fastest algorithm to find the largest number in an unsorted array with multiple processors?
The problem to be solved is not limited to just microprocessors, it also involves multi-core across multi-processors; to that end I'd lik to recommend taking a look at "aligned access sort":Â  "Aligned-Access sort (AA-sort). The AA-sort is suitable for exploiting both the SIMD instructions and thread-level parallelism available on today's multi-core processors. The AA-sort does not involve any unaligned memory accesses that attenuate the benefit of SIMD instructions, and hence it " http://researcher.watson.ibm.com...
