What is it like when photovolteic solar power system batteries die?
As they die the early symptoms: How can you tell when your solar panel batteries are dead? It feels disconcerting. These batteries have been my connection to literal enlightenment. I will return to the dark ages of the Bosque lifestyle, hopefully only for a brief period.. Right now as a I write this my batteries show a voltage of 8.8 the lowest number I have seen it! They are not supposed to go below 12.0 volts!  I have babied them for years, but this is the falling off the cliff battery death that happens. Each night the number has fallen lower. And it is suddenly very cloudy too. And I am trying to run an electric brooder for four chicks. they are happy... I think they are old enough for it to go off and I can make them a fire in any case. Then I will need to buy new batteries. They are expensive and I seem to have trouble finding a place to buy new ones. I have visited many LTH battery places and no one is willing to order me them. I am amazed there is enough power to be running my internet dish and this laptop and expect the system to die completely any minute. 8.2 volts now. Bye for now? (Flickering and loss appears to start at 10.7 volts) I might be offline for a while until I can get new batteries. I am not sure if I can run a generator My batteries. RIP. Toxic square demons of stored light. I will make you into a sculpture called Dead Solar Batteries. Others will learn of your good and evil! Thanks you for your enabling my consumption and comfort. Losing conection. Lights flickering... At least I have a nice rabbit curry with mango chutney on top. Bring on the darkness! Updated 132w ago • View Upvotes
