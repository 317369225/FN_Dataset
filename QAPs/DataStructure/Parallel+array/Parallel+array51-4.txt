Where can I find a programmer willing to teach an 11 year old to make video games?
Depending where in the world you live, a post to newspaper might work. You could also try posting an ad to outsourcing websites (vworker or odesk, or any other) and find a teacher there. For cheaper/free options, internet is most definitely your friend. I haven't tried Project Spark myself, but if you look for that in Youtube, you can find video tutorials for it. Tutorial websites, videos are usually nicely sequenced learning materials that makes it easy to follow, observe progress of your learning and, of course, learn from other people.
