Where can I find a programmer willing to teach an 11 year old to make video games?
The two best way to learn to make games are (in my opinion) Minecraft modding and Game Maker (or something similar). I started with game maker when I was your age. Admittedly I went too far with it and tried to create a full blown render engine, but it taught me some of the fundamentals. Once you understand basic syntax, I would highly recommend Minecraft modding. As a way to understand object-oriented languages, I think it is unmatched.
