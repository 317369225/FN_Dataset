What is it like when photovolteic solar power system batteries die?
It means you can't use your solar power during hours without direct sun. So, you should still be able to use electricity while sun is hitting your panels. At night, or during lots of overcast, you'll either lose power or need to use a generator or connect to 'the grid' to get electric.
