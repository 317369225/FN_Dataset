High Performance Computing:Â What are the major differences in the classes of problems that can be effectively sped up using GPGPU (eg CUDA), Symmetric Multiprocessing (eg OpenMP), and Message Passing (eg MPI) respectively?
These are not exclusive, often all 3 are used together. It is almost always the case that combining MPI and OpenMP is a bad idea, but people still do it.
