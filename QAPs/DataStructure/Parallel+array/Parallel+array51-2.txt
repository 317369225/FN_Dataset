Where can I find a programmer willing to teach an 11 year old to make video games?
I'm a programmer (well, I was one back before you were born) but I know literally nothing about programming games. No problem, though. I've got some suggestions. Start by installing Scratch. This is a really simple programming language. It's totally free: Scratch - Imagine, Program, Share Let me know when you get that installed. PS are you a Minecrafter?
