Functional Programming: Which of Haskell and OCaml is more practical?
Haskell vs. OCaml - this is the same holy-war theme as the Emacs vs. Vim, Git vs. Mercurial, Google+ vs. Facebook or McDonalds vs. KFC. Both are very good and both are great to deal with a wide range of problems. If you do not know which to choose, Haskell or OCaml, just learn both languages ​​and see which one you prefer. It will not take much time, as it seems, because they are very similar. Incidentally, there are several other similar languages. Perhaps you will enjoy with some of them more than with Haskell and OCaml together. :) Clean (programming language) F Sharp (programming language) Ela, dynamic functional language
