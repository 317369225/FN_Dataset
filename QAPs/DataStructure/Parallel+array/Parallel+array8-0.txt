Object-Oriented Programming:Â Is it possible to learn Java without learning C/C++?
Yes. You don't need to learn neither lower level C nor higher level scripting languages, or even more pure OOP languages, to learn and be good at java. Knowing C and pure OOP would simply make it easier to understand what and why Java does what it does. It explains why Java has OOP Lists and Numbers and Booleans interfaces and object implementations, but in parallel arrays and int and boolean native values. With Java you can go both pure OOP, and high performance like C. But you can still be proeficient in Java even without knowing why the relation to the other languages.
