The Matrix (1999 movie): Why didn't the sentient machines in the Matrix simply use cows instead of humans as their energy source?
Congratulations, your son is smarter than the studio executives in charge of that movie.    The whole 'humans as energy source' concept is a major plot hole from the beginning.  Aside from the fact that other animals are easier to control, the system would inherently consume more energy than it produced.  Apparently, the Wachowski's originally had different ideas about why the machines were enslaving humanity, but the studio thought it was too complicated, and forced them to change it.   In fact, there are fan theories that the whole idea that the Matrix is an energy generator was a lie concocted by the machines to hide their real purpose from the rebels, and there are a bunch of theories about what that purpose is.  In any case, the real world reason is meddling from executives who don't understand science.
