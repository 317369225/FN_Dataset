What are the ways to determine if a very large number is divisible by 7 using parallel threads?
Assume the number [math]N[/math] is stored as an array of digits [math]d_{l-1}, d_{l-2}, \ldots, d_1, d_0[/math] in base [math]b[/math]. The associative operation [math](x, u) \star (y, v) = (xv + y, uv)[/math] recovers the original number as   [math](d_{l-1}, b) \star (d_{l-2}, b) \star \cdots \star (d_1, b) \star (d_0, b)[/math] [math]= (N, b^l)[/math]. Doing every operation modulo [math]7[/math] recovers [math]N \bmod 7[/math] such that each operation takes constant time. You can efficiently parallelize this computation by reordering the operations into a shallow tree using associativity. Updated 129w ago • View Upvotes
