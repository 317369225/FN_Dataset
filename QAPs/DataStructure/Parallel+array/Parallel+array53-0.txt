Why is modern Fortran cool?
Today, I think 'coolness' of any programming language has more to with who is using it and what for. In the days when FORTRAN was developed (before many of us were born), that wasn't the case, there were clear reasons why FORTRAN should be used for certain problems. Some of those still exist, in my opinion (admittedly I am not anywhere near an expert programmer) - namely if you just want to sit down and turn one number or set of numbers into another, it's efficient, quick and easy. There used to be (other) major advantages, such as inherent support for complex numbers - but I'm sure many other languages can do that today. What you're left with are the users. FORTRAN is still a reliable, go-to language for handling difficult scientific problems. It is a staple of theoretical physics laboratories everywhere. I would also bet that if you looked at the code running on the Department of Energy supercomputers (which normally somewhat dominate the Top 500 list: http://www.top500.org/lists/2010/11) a big chunk of it is written in FORTRAN. For some, like me, that kind of computing is cool. For others, building a fancy-shmancy web 2.0 experience is cool. If you find yourself in the first group, FORTRAN is cool, otherwise not so much.
