How can I learn coding to be an elite programmer with no one to guide me? I have described my present situation in the details.
If by "elite" programmer you mean someone who can sleep walk through any kind of code then you better start doing competitive coding online on top coder , CodeChef , SPOJ or hackerrank . Improve your ranking worldwide on these platforms . However , I would suggest that instead of  doing something to get a job a "GOOGLE"  , it would be much better if you do something which you find worthwhile and which inspires you to learn more . If you do what you like , you are bound to shine and then my friend ,the so called "GOOGLE" will come to you . Best of luck . Stay hungry,keep learning .
