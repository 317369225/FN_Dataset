What are some useful but lesser known data structures?Follow-up on http://news.ycombinator.com/item...
This is more a design issue, than yet another ubln data-structure per se.  Common data structures involve "pointer chasing" in their use( linked list),which is  very slow(esp. if the pointed isn't in the cache~ memory layout). Thus replacing a classic linked list with,  say,an unrolled linked list can be a liberating speedup.(esp. when you are done trying parallalization, vectorization ..)
