As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
A few of my must have for making it fun to read and remember: Â  1. Add "practical use" or "Do you know" section with each algorithm especially advanced algorithms highlighting real world use. Obviously which are relevant today. Learning sorting by the way cards are played is good to introduce but definitely not relevant anymore. 2. Functional Programming 3. How to scale up 4. Machine Learning algorithms (basic ones like clustering etc.)
