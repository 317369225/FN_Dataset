Which nearest neighbor search algorithms run in logarithmic time, or which is the fastest NNS algorithm for large 2D data space?Follow up to the question: What are the most popular Nearest Neighbor Search algorithms?
k-d trees ... K-d trees initially require a O(nlogn) pre-processing time. Hence after every query can be answered in O(logn ) time. Follow this link for a good explanation http://andrewd.ces.clemson.edu/c...
