Why didn't the Russian Winter impact the Soviet Union the same way it affected Nazi Germany?
It did. The thing is, it wasn't MIGHTY GENERAL WINTER that stopped the German advance. It was the fact that the Russians did what they always do when invaded. They retreated, burning as they went, bled the enemy the whole way and traded land for time. Eventually the German supply lines (which were still mostly horse drawn, by the way) were stretched so thin that the Germans could no longer adequately supply their army. The German offensive then stalled. The Soviets then sat back and mustered massive reserves to strike the now very haggard Germans. When that strike came in the spring, it was the beginning of the end. The Russians had the initiative and never again lost it. The thing is, severe winters are very much a defining characteristic of Russia. It's not like the Germans were invading Hawaii and got hit by a freak blizzard. Russia is cold in the winter and muddy in the spring, and it's always been that way. The Russians have always traded land for time. The Germans should have been prepared for this, but despite them allegedly being great military strategists, they were not. Updated 63w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
