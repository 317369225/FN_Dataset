What are the algorithms required to solve all problems (using C++) in any competitive coding contest?
If you are a beginner start following this:- Getting started with the sport of competitive programming - Triveni Mahatha You will get overview of most used basic algos.. Then Data Structures and Algorithms here u will find links to various algorithms and as well as problems on them.. if u go through all of this algos and then thoroughly practice problems then u will be able to solve more than 70% problems in coding contest... Rest lies in practice..practice...
