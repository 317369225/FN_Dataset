Are there any algorithms of the order O(sqrt(n))?
A basic algorithm for integer factorization goes through numbers from 2 to sqrt(n) to find the prime factors of n. The Baby-step giant-step algorithm uses a meet in the middle technique to solve the discret logarithm problem. The problem asks, given a, b and n integers, find all x such that a^x = b modulo n Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for searching an unsorted database of n entries in O(sqrt(n)) time. sqrt(n) is the number that minimizes function max(k, n/k) which turns out to be useful in a few algorithms problems. Here's an article I've wrote on this particular idea Coding Contest Byte: The Square Root Trick
