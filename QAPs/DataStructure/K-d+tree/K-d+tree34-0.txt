How many data structures are there?
These are few famous Data Structures used: AVL Tree B-Tree Binary Heap [backed by an array or a tree] Binary Search Tree Compact Suffix Trie [backed by a Patricia Trie] Graph Undirected Directed (Digraph) Hash Array Mapped Trie (HAMT) Hash Map (associative array) Interval Tree KD Tree (k-dimensional tree or k-d tree) List [backed by an array or a linked list] Matrix Patricia Trie Quad-Tree (Point-Region or MX-CIF) Queue [backed by an array or a linked list] Radix Trie (associative array) [backed by a Patricia Trie] Red-Black Tree Segment Tree Skip List Splay Tree Stack [backed by an array or a linked list] Suffix Tree (Ukkonen's algorithm) Suffix Trie [backed by a Trie] Treap Tree Map (associative array) [backed by an AVL Tree] Trie Trie Map (associative array) [backed by a Trie] Source: java-algorithms-implementation - Algorithms and Data Structures implemented in Java - Google Project Hosting
