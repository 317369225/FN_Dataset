What are the 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm problems?
Start with these- Divide and conquer, dynamic programming - It is a must know algorithm as most of problems need it's knowledge (complete knowledge). greedy method, linear programming, Dijkstra's algorithm, Floyd--Warshall algorithm and Either Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm Binary Search and Sorting algorithms, Graphs, Trees, Stack, Queue and Vectors Breadth First Search (BFS) / Depth First Search (DFS). Suffix Array Learn all these from  TopCoder , GeeksForGeeks Or Data Structures and Algorithms Tutorials (they beautifully compiled all the important algorithms from TopCoder and GeeksForGeeks ) Note - You have to learn a lot more than these 10. They may help you but to become efficient , you need a lot more than this. Note - Mathematics is also required so become efficient in maths also. Most Important -  You need passion, perseverance and thirst for knowledge. Updated 16 May • View Upvotes
