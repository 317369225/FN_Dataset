As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
Its time to break the book into two volumes. Basic and advanced(Ideally should end as a book series on algorithms). Basic volume should deal with fundamentals, useful thing very often used. Advanced volume to satisfy the curious. Many people are saying to remove linear programming but it is very often used in practice. Because of two volumes now there is a lot of space to satisfy wider audience.
