How do I map one set of Cartesian coordinates to another set of Cartesian coordinates?
You're not trying to map Cartesian coordinates to another set of coordinates - that's an entirely different problem solved by vector calculus and judicious use of the Jacobian. What you're really looking for is a way to be able to compute proximity to an existing point. The answer is actually rather simple: just compute the distance from the person's location to each of the points in your list. When the distance is less than 10 meters, just update the person's coordinates (or, better yet, update a 'public' set of coordinates, leaving his individual coordinates alone - if the individual coordinates change, you can then update the public coordinates to reflect the new zone he's in). The distance is simply the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in the x and y cpprdinates respectively - what we would call a Euclidean distance, assuming you're dealing with a flat surface. R can do this very efficiently - you may have to try to be clever with SQL. In Practice Typically speaking, this is very reminiscent of a problem called geolocation, where individual coordinates on a map have to be translated into human-readable addresses - in other words, you have to be able to take a pair of abstract coordinates and return a location. Modern geolocation tools and utilities already exist - if that's your plan, I suggest you simply look them up. Google Maps has a very capable API in this regard.
