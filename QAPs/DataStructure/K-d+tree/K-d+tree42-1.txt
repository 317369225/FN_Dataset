How does one determine the number of clusters that are hidden in a given data set?
While Franck Dernoncourt has highlighted something interesting. Andrew Moore had this paper Page on Cmu which uses K means along with BIC. Put simplly, assume you are given data [math]D[/math],model [math]M_{j}[/math] (different models correspond to different [math]K[/math]). Put simply BIC [math]BIC(M_j) = L(D) - \frac{p}{2} log n [/math] where L () is the log-likelihood, p is the number of parameters for model M.Â  However this description is appropriate for small datasets and can be accelerated by using k-d tree. Dan Pelleg has this link here K-means and X-means implementations. I would be quite tempted to see Bayesian nonparametrics with K-means but i am not sure or confident to comment on that.
