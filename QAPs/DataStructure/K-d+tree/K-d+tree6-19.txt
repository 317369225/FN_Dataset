What are the 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm problems?
There are only 16 types of programming contest problems from an analysis conducted by some one from USACO - Dynamic Programming Greedy Complete Search Flood Fill Shortest Path Recursive Search Techniques Minimum Spanning Tree Knapsack Computational Geometry Network Flow Eulerian Path Two-Dimensional Convex Hull BigNums Heuristic Search Approximate Search Ad Hoc Problems The most challenging problems are Combination Problems which involve a loop (combinations, subsets, etc.) around one of the above algorithms - or even a loop of one algorithm with another inside it. These seem extraordinarily tricky to get right, even though conceptually they are ``obvious'' (source: USA Computing Olympiad) Updated 1 Mar 2014 â€¢ View Upvotes
