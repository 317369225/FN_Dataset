As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
Please add detailed treatment on: - cache-oblivious algorithms - avl tree - bloom filters - Cardinality estimation - compression (covering commonly used algorithms like lz77, lz78, burrow-wheeler encoding up to paq etc) - regexp and Context-free grammar - LSM trees - R trees - K-d trees - a lot more detailed treatment on parallel algorithms I don't think anything should be removed, primarily because the field is growing, and book needs to grow to stay relevant.
