What are all the data structures that you have come to know about? Which of these do you use very frequently?Please group them in "Basic" and "Advanced".
I have chosen the data structures based on what I have mostly used for my projects at school and at work. In general most of my projects have been done using the simple data structures, only in few situations have I used the complex ones. Simple Linear: Arrays Linked Lists Stacks Queues Disjoint Set Linked List   Complex Linear: Skip List Unordered Sets – (Hash Based)   Simple Graphical: Trees Tries B-trees Heaps (Binomial, Fibonacci) Binary Search Tree Priority Queues (Implemented using Heaps)          Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree (Red Black Tree) Splay Tree Set/Map (Ordered) – can be implemented with trees   Complex Graphical: Treap (Randomized BST) Bloom Filters Fenwick Tree (Binary Index Tree) Segment Tree K-d tree
