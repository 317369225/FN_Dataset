Does it make sense to use geohashing for implementing KNN using an index in an n-dimensional space?
Answering my own question, that is basically a k-d tree http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K..., a data structure often used to implement indexes for KNN queries. That technique has been used to implement KNN in HBase in systems like http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~dsl/?q=c...
