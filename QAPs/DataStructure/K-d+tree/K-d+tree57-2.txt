What are the things that every Kannadiga should know about his/her state?
The tricolour Indian National Flag is only to be made of khadi or hand-spun cloth. The right to manufacture this flag is held by Karnataka. Currently, the Karnataka Khadi Gramodyoga Samyukta Sangha, Hubli is the only licensed flag manufacturing unit in India. The woven khadi is obtained from two handloom units in Dharwad and Bagalkot districts of North Karnataka. Years before this, the flag was initially manufactured at Garag, a small place in Hubli-Dharwad district. As a Kannadiga and a resident of Dharwad, it gives me immense pride to share this information. I did my engineering in Bagalkot, so both these places have a special value in my life. I am also very much keen on visiting the places where they manufacture the flag in Dharwad.
