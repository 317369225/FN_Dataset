What are the 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm problems?
1 - Dynamic Programming : Most of the topcoder SRM's consists of atleast one DP problem. It is hard to think and easy to implement. 2 - Suffix arrays : You can read about suffix arrays here Suffix Array | Set 1 (Introduction) - GeeksforGeeks 3 - Depth first search : It is used to perform a search on a tree or  a graph. 4 -  Learn to Use Stack , Queue and Vector 5 - Dijkstra's algorithm : It is used to  find the costs of shortest paths from a single vertex to a single destination vertex by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination vertex has been determined. It should be used only for +ve edge weights. 6 - Floyd--Warshall  : It is used for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights. 7 - MinMax Algorithm : Minimax 8 - Segment trees : Algorithm Tutorials 9 - Binary Search : It is a must to know this algorithm . Its used to search for an element in a sorted array / tree in log(n) time. 10 - Divide and Conquer : Divide and conquer algorithms Make sure you know Sorting in n*log(n) .Be good at Math ;) Updated 8 Nov 2014 • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Vijay Kumar
