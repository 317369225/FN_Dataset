What is the coolest data structure?Which one makes you say, "Wow! That's cool!"? What makes it so cool? What are some applications?
Hash tables, may be the single most used data structure in computer science. They are just kick ass. Why cool? Because of the wide variety of problems they find their application in. You write any decent sized computer application and you would find them. They do just one task but do it so perfectly that nothing beats them at that. They are the James bond when it comes to finding stuffs. You have a bunch of stuffs and later you want to find one with a given name, hash tables can give you that in a flash (in O(1) period). Well I really cannot think of any data structure in computer science which does its work in O(1) except for a hash table. They are the fastest of them all (comes at a cost though). One would be surprised to think about how many times we need this functionality. Every entity has some name and we always need to find them every now and then. And here is the cool part, Hash tables are quite simple, very straight forward & to the point dudes, with no hanky-panky. Pretty awesome for something is so powerful. It is very simple to use them and understand how they work but just like any great legend, when you start digging deeper you would be amazed how complicated they can be.   Applications? They find use in pretty much every computer program. In the most common form as caches. Underneath every cache sits the super hero hash table and caches are every where, from the browser to the OS to the CPU to the router, anything and everything has a cache.
