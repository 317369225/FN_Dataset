How can a taxi booking application be developed with simple programming language like c , c++ and data structures. what algorithm should be used?
For an application like this one of the basic use case would be to search cabs near user's location and tell them the approx pickup time. To be able to search nearby cabs efficiently, a typical data structure would be k-d tree. Given a set of N points it will allow you to compute a subset of points near to a given location efficiently. Note that in this case the cab is actually moving. So points are continuously updated. However, if the number of cabs is small we may might as well just do a brute force for all the available nearby cabs. In a very simple version of such app I do not see any other complex data structure. You should be able to use existing maps api for a lot of purpose. You can choose any technology stack as you wish. MEAN Stack is gaining popularity especially if scalability is a requirement. Updated 10 Nov • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Lakshmi Priya
