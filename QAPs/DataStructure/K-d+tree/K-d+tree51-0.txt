How do I find out which vertices form a polygon around a particular point?
If the goal is a rigorous search for the smallest polygon using a "dumb" (as in not aware of the data set properties) algorithm, for each edge you would have to search through your data set (of say n edges) n-1 times (so n-1 nested loops, inside your edge parsing loop, which mean n nested loops) and all the while store the area of the smallest polygon that you have already found. However with imposed restrictions, say you only want to find triangles, your n nested loops will reduce to 2 loops inside your edge parser. Since your data set are line segments and not lines, some or your n line segment combinations will not make a polygon, but you can only know that once your have exhaustively searched your data set. A better way to do this is to deploy a mathematical concept called spatial partitioning, using a structure called k-d tree. Using this you will sort your dataset into a tree structure and during your search, you will have a tree traversal algorithm to look for polygons. This approach will employ the underlying properties of your data set to optimize the search. But it also puts some processing when forming your data set (which you have to do once). Hope this helps.
