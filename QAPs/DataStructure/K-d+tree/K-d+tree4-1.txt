What is the coolest data structure?Which one makes you say, "Wow! That's cool!"? What makes it so cool? What are some applications?
I wonder why no one has not mentioned about Union Find. Its more of an algorithm than a Data Structure, but its worth mentioning .Its O(log(log(n)) time complexity makes it practically constant.
