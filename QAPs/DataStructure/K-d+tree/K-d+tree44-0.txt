What is a way to find a person using machine learning?
" Generally searching on the internet we could get like 100s of results however I want to restrict to 10 best matching" You need to define what is the criteria for best match to proceed with the problem. You do not require a lot of Machine Learning for this, but rather a well defined problem and ability to express it as a mathematical concept (finding the nearest neighbor) . If you are working to optimize the accuracy of results, set up a system to take feedback (and analyze it with regression) , if you are working to optimize retrieval speed look into k-d tree .
