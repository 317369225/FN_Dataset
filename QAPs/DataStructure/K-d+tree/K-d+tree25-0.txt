What is the best data structure to store 3D coordinates?I need that a data structure that would help me to query the coordinates efficiently. I know binary search is possible if I sort the coordinates but is there any other option available?
For 3D coordinates, you can use Octree - Octree. The generalised data structure isÂ  K-D trees - k-d tree. Here, K is the number of dimensions. In this case, K = 3.
