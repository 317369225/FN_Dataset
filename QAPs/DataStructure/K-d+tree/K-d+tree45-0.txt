Which algorithm should I use for searching on the basis of different values?
I concur with Matt Parker that something like k-d trees or R-trees are probably the best approach. Even if your dataset is too large to represent in memory at one time, you can divide it into chunks and process each chunk separately. But it does depend on the nature of the data and of the expected values in your array. It may make sense to preprocess the data using, say, the first array value, and then apply a more general algorithm with the rest of the values. The idea is that you are performing a series of filtering operations, and you want to apply the filters in the most efficient order. Here, efficiency is measured in terms of performance (how fast is the filter?) and selectivity (by what factor does the filter reduce the size of the dataset?). These two measures are sometimes in conflict, so you may need to compromise. In any case, you need to look at the data to decide in which order to deal with the different dimensions of the problem.
