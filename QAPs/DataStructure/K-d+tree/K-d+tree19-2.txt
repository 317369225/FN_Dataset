What is the point of doing machine learning, when you have something so robust as the nearest neighbour algorithm?What better justification/support/evidence can you give about your inference than saying there is(are) a point(s) already in the (indexed)dataset which is really close to your query point.
There's a simple argument that shows that distance based algorithms like k-nn are ineffective in very high dimensional data. Assuming iid features, pairwise distances end up tightly clustered around a mean. I've derived a Hoeffding bound in this blog post: A Comment on Dimension-EstimationÂ  It is trivial to see why this is bad for nearest-neighbor algorithms.
