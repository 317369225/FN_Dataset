What is a kd-tree and what is it used for?
From Wikipedia [1]: A k-d tree (short for k-dimensional tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space. k-d trees are a useful data structure for several applications, such as searches involving a multidimensional search key (e.g. range searches and nearest neighbor searches). k-d trees are a special case of binary space partitioning trees. It can be used for nearest neighbor searches. For example, if you had a list of restaurants on a map, and you wanted to efficiently query this list for the nearest restaurant(s) to a chosen point on the map, you could first build a k-d tree, then use that data structure to help you answer many subsequent such queries efficiently.
