As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
I wanted to echo a lot of the sentiments expressed in the answers (especially Justin Rising), and suggest adding more algorithms that involve probability. Generally, I would love to see Probabilistic data structures (bloom filters, etc.) Monte Carlo / Las Vegas algorithms Approximation algorithms Streaming algorithms.
