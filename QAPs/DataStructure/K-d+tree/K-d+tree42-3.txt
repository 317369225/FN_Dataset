How does one determine the number of clusters that are hidden in a given data set?
If your data is has labels, use the Self-generating prototypes for pattern classification, with a reasonable Rmin and Rmis parameters (generalization factors). With a small change in the output of this algorithm, you have one of the top labeled clustering techniques. Eren Golge, it uses PCA to generate an hyperplan that divide the subclusters, so it is a solution like yours, but more evolved. PS: This technique is very good, but has a very poor performane on unbalanced datasets. So if you are dealing with unbalanced data, try to use some oversampling or (if your data is already large) use the Improved Self-Generating Prototypes Algorithm for Imbalanced Datasets. I wrote this paper a while ago, it is a small variation on SGP that solves this issue. Good luck,
