What is the coolest data structure?Which one makes you say, "Wow! That's cool!"? What makes it so cool? What are some applications?
A number of very, very interesting data structures were initially proposed as solutions to very specific problems. One example is the callwheel, a rather ingenious data structure for managing thousands of timed events. The following is a paper which studies the theoretical properties of the callwheel. http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nahu... The data structure was implemented in BSD as part of a project to improve the performance of the BSD "callout facility". The following is a paper describing the project. http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~varghese...
