Does there exist some kind of formula to calculate the amount of non isomorphic trees (graph theory) you can form with a given order (amount of nodes of the tree)?
Yes, there is. It's not easy, though. First, take the recurrence relation [math]a_0 = 0[/math] [math]\displaystyle a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{k=1}^n \left(\sum_{d | k} d a_d\right) a_{n-k+1}\right).[/math] The number [math]a_n[/math] is the number of non-isomorphic rooted trees on [math]n[/math] vertices. Now, to find the number of non-isomorphic unlabelled trees on [math]n[/math] vertices, first generate the function [math]\displaystyle T(x)=\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i x^i[/math] where [math]a_i[/math] is as in the above recurrence relation, then the number of non-isomorphic unlabelled trees on n vertices is the coefficient of x^n in the series [math]t(x) = 1 + T(x) - \frac{1}{2}\big((T(x))^2 - T(x^2)\big).[/math] The coefficients of [math]T(x)[/math] are sequence A000081 - OEIS, while those of [math]t(x)[/math] are sequence A000055 - OEIS.
