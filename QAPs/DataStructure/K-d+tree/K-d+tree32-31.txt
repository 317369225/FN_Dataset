As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?Please bear in mind that the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition, and so if you suggest a topic to add, please also suggest a topic to remove. I cannot promise that we'll be able to implement all suggestions.
A chapter should be added on concept 'Backtracking and Bound Algorithm', with the following topics stated below- 1)Basic Idea a)The Backtracking Algorithm b)n-Queens (using Backtracking algorithm) c)Graph K-Coloring (using Backtracking algorithm) d)Hamiltonian cycles (using Backtracking algorithm) 2)Branch and Bound algorithm a)Assignment Problem (using Branch and Bound  algorithm) b)Knapsack Problem (using Branch and Bound  algorithm) and many more...... on backtracking
