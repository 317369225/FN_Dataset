What is the coolest data structure?Which one makes you say, "Wow! That's cool!"? What makes it so cool? What are some applications?
Agree with Bloom Filters, Skip Lists, Suffix Trees (though I like Prefix-Suffix graphs better), I'd add Binary Heaps to the list: An efficient structure to support priority queues. Since it's a tree represented as a contiguous array, you can write it to disk and memory-map it back in a snap. Additionally, it supports one of my favorite sort algos : HeapSort.
