How can I compare images of the same origin that were cropped?
This is a well-known problem that fortunately has a solution. Here is the high-level algorithm overview: Take your 100 images (the image database), for each image find the local feature points and calculate descriptors for each point (see SIFT, SURF in wikipedia for more details, for example). Insert each descriptor with associated image information to a k-d tree (or some other datastructure suitable for nearest-neighbors retrieval) . Maybe dimensionality reduction may be required for the high-dimensional descriptors. That will be your index. For a query image, find its feature points, calculate descriptors and look them up in the k-d tree. The found points will lead you to the image candidates. The candidates then should be filtered based on geometric constraints. See more details and references in the following paper: http://www.vision.caltech.edu/ma...
