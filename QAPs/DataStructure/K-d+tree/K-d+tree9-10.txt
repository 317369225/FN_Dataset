What are the algorithms required to solve all problems (using C++) in any competitive coding contest?
Knowing the algorithm and how does it work is not always enough to solve problems requires knowledge of it .. but practicing as much as you can would be better.. Start learning algorithms, implementing them using your preferred language, start solving problems and practice them so that you gain lots of skills which are always needed and important for competitive programming. Also its not something related to programming language .. as long as you know the algorithm and how does it work, you can implement it using any programming language as long as you can program with it.
