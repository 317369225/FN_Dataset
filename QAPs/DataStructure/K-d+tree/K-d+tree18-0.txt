What are all the data structures that you have come to know about? Which of these do you use very frequently?Please group them in "Basic" and "Advanced".
These are the data structures that I use often. I'd add more as I recall them. Number in parenthesis in front of any data structure is proportional to how often I use them. Basic Data Structures: Stacks (5) Queues (5) Intermediate Data Structures: Hash Maps (5) Ordered Sets (3) Hash Sets (5) Binary Search Tree (unbalanced) (2) Tries (3) Heaps (3) Bloom Filters (0) Slightly Advanced Data Structures: Binary Indexed Tree (2) Segment Tree (3) Binary Search Tree (balanced) (3) Disjoint Set Data Structure (2) Sequence Hash [1] (2) Suffix Array (1) Range Minimum Query Data Structure (1) Min Queue/ Max Queue [2] (1) Advanced Data Structures: Link-Cut Tree (0) Suffix Tree (0) 1. It is a non-standard data structure that I call as Sequence Hash, other people might have different names for it. Given a sequence of length L (sequence might be a string or an array or any other type of sequence), it does O(L) preprocess and after that returns a polynomial hash for any consecutive sub-sequence in O(1). Very useful for string matching. You can find my C++ implementation here : http://pastebin.com/jzTyUZmR 2. Min (Max) Queue is a less-known modification of ordinary queue. It supports following operations: Push Back O(1) Pop Front O(1) Maximum(Minimum) value amongst elements currently in queue O(1) You can find my C++ implementation for templatized MinMaxQ here : http://pastebin.com/xqg53N52 Updated 26 Jun 2012 • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Saurav Maheshwary
