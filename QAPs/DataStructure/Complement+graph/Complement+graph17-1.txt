Will Google+ eventually replace Gmail or webmail?I will surely use Google+ more if it allows file sharing.
No. Google+ is a social network, not a communication solution. Social networks are for socializing, email is focused on more productive, more private communication. Now, whether Google will try to completely merge the two is a different story, but I doubt it personally. However, I think they well add aspects of each to each other, as they are redesigning their products for Google+ integration (Gmail already has a new social feature or two and a Google+ theme) and they may decide to bring elements of their hugely popular Gmail to Google+, though that would be far more difficult to pull off effectively.
