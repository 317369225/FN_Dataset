What's the difference between Quora and Formspring.me?
Quora seems to have remained exclusively for expertise; Formspring has (had, getting tired) both teenagers bantering and experts. Quora managed to do that by controlling the access and having topic types that complement the social graph; Formspring has less functionality so can appeal to a broader base.
