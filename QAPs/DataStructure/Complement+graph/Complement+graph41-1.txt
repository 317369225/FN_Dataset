How do I solve this equation? x 3 −⌊x⌋=3 **EDIT: I also employed the same approach as many of the other people who have answered and drew a rough graph and tried some values for floor(x), but what I'm asking is, is there any general method to do this? In this question we got an answer for floor(x)=1 but the trial and error may not be easy each time.
I always think the best way to solve any algebraic problem is to graph it. Deepak Mehta gives an analytical solution. Complementing his answer using some great online graphing calculators (e.g. Desmos Graphing Calculator) out there, it becomes even easier to visualize. Here's x^3 - Here's floor(x) - And here's x^3 - floor(x) - 3 -> And we see that at x = 1.587, we have a winner.
