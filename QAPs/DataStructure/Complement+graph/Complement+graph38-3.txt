What does it mean for a US carrier to be maintaining fleet readiness?E.g. CVN 69 is "under way maintaining fleet readiness in the wake of Hurricane Irene".
The easiest civilian translation of "maintaining fleet readiness" is "underway, but not deployed." This usually involves training, qualification and the like in preparation for a future deployment... or it could mean testing systems after repair/potential damage. Either way, it means that the ship in question will be returning to port sooner rather than later.
