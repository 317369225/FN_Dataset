Which is better for time management: paper planners or electronic planners?
It depends upon the amount of tasks you're handling. I being a freelancer have several projects to handle at one time, so I went for http://www.proofhub.com for project management. It has time tracking feature in which I am able to record time I devote on each project. Thus it enables me to switch between projects easily thus enabling me to optimally utilizing my time.
