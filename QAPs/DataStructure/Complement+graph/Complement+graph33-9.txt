What are some topics/fields in physics that aren't traditionally taught in the undergraduate physics curriculum but are worth learning/really cool?
The suggestions I'm hearing are fantastic. In addition to what has already been suggested, I would go with: 1. Acoustics Acoustics lies in the domain of solid and fluid mechanics, which is why most physicists do not study it. The mathematical formulation of acoustics is quite similar to what is learned in standard electrodynamics and quantum mechanics courses. Tools like partial wave analysis, Fourier transform, representation theory and perturbation theory can be applied to acoustics. The applications are of course quite different: music, seismic imaging, acoustic shielding, filtering, etc. I suspect that physics labs may be a little more fun too and the relationship between theory and experiments may be a bit closer. In some sense, acoustics is like baby EM and QM. 2. Signal processing This is kind of related to acoustics. Detecting and processing signals (acoustic, electromagnetic, imaging) is a challenge in many research projects in astronomy, collider physics, biophysics, microscopy, etc. Despite its importance of applied and fundamental research, physics students are rarely exposed to signal processing. I think that most physics undergraduates can readily appreciate the analogy between the Green's function commonly used in quantum physics and the response function in signal processing.
