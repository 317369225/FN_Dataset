Which is better for time management: paper planners or electronic planners?
Despite using and writing on a number of different techniques, I still prefer a simple paper planner. I still use email address books, cloud options, and the whole host of programs out there but, for me there is a very relaxing peace and quiet to using my day planner without any of the distractions of the computer.
