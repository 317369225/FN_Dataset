Which is better for time management: paper planners or electronic planners?
This is a great question, and I have to agree with a lot of answers here: paper planners make it easy for you to carry around, check, and just...touch. There's something about it--maybe the fact that they're tangible makes it easier to "control" your schedule. At the same time, online planners can give you a range of options: syncing your calendar, adding events, and maybe just making the task of adding tasks much easier. I use a bit of both. It sounds like work for some people (I don't blame them), but I carry around a small notepad with me so I can jot things down during the day. For my online planner (I use Weekplan and for the life of me I can't figure out how to add a link) I just carefully orchestrate all of my tasks and have an organized space and overview of when and how I do things. Ultimately, the most important thing to know is that whether you to choose option A or B or a bit of both, a planner can only work if you check it each and every day. That was my weakness and I forced myself to make it into a habit: I forced myself to check it in the mornings, afternoons, and evenings and over time, I checked it and learned to manage my time better. I hope this helps.
