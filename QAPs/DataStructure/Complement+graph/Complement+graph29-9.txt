Which is better for time management: paper planners or electronic planners?
Essentially, it depends on your choice. Even some very technology-smart people like paper-based diary systems, for they need a bigger view, or don't feel tied in to their plans unless they can grip a paper planner in their hands and I am one of them. I never prefer spending a lot of money on fancy technology. I generally prefer using Outlook but I need a paper planner too for 80% of my planning, so my vote goes to paper planner :)
