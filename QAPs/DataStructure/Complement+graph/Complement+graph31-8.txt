Linguistic Relativity: If language influences thinking, what is the "best" language to complement English?
I would propose the artificial languages, like lojban and toki pona. They tend to be 'smaller' than natural languages, so if you aren´t learning this language to talk to your coworkers or wife, then at least the project of learning lojban or toki pona is small enough that you have a chance of finishing it before you mind wanders. Otherwise, pick a language with other prosaic practical advantages (accessible pop-culture, job opportunities, religious reasons, etc), because a rewiring of your brain won´t happen until you have some level of competency, and that can take years. You will need some serious motivation to execute and finish the project.
