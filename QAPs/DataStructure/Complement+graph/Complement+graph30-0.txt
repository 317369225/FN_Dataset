What would be the best 'Pre-MS in Data Science' work experience/ job for an engineering undergraduate?
Any organization which meets few of the following criteria - High frequency input-only data set (say, OLTP in Banking/e-commerce/trading/weather agencies/ad networks) Use location sensitive data (Your favourite graph problems) Store Social data (Any organization with a good user base using, say Facebook Connect or G+) Have or should have an action timeline to complement business (Who bought what, where, when, shipped to ...) Experience at a simple start-up with small user base of, say 10K users; or a well set Banking/commerce firm, should give you enough starting exposure to decide on your next step.
