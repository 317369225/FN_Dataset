Could anyone have anticipated that John Roberts would be somewhat more centrist than expected?Some conservatives are criticizing the Roberts pick in hindsight, but based on his pre-appointment track record, could anyone have guessed that he'd have turned out this way? Did any conservatives express misgivings at the time?
Arguably, he isn't "more centrist than expected" in any straight political sense.   What he is is a conservative jurist in both senses of that phrase, someone who, entirely reasonably in my opinion, is concerned that the SCOTUS in the post-Bush v. Gore, post-DC v. Heller, post-Citizens United era had come to be seen as just another politically polarized activist branch of government.   That it was no longer trusted by the American people as a neutral arbiter of the law as enacted and enforced by the elected branches.   He has therefore tried to exercise and model judicial restraint and deference in his reasoning in both current major cases: deference to and restraint regarding congressional intent about the statutory language and overall aim of the ACA in King v. Burwell, and deference to and restraint regarding customary and societal precedent in Obergefell v. Hodges.   "Who do we think we are?" he asked in his dissent in that case.  I think the tactics of the reactionary Reaganite New Right over the past 35 years have skewed the popular US perception of "conservative". Could anyone have anticipated that he would demonstrate more professional and institutional loyalty than ideological and essentially tactical loyalty once on the high bench?  I think the old DC adage "where you stand depends on where you sit" could and should have been contemplated more readily regarding the legacy of the Bush administration generally -- many changes with unintentional, or at least uncontrolled, consequences.
