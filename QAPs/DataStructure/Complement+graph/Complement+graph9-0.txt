What are the odds of having 4 friends on my Facebook out of 400 born on the same day as me?Not the same year...
This answer assumes birthdays are uniformly distributed, which is a weak assumption, and I don't have access to good underlying data for the true distribution of birthdays in someone's social graph or even the world at large. I suppose this tends to vary by geography, climate and culture. -- If you mean exactly 4: \mathchoice((((4004\mathchoice))))(1365)4(364365)396≈0.019 Look at the denominator. This is 365400 which is the number of ways in which you can assign birthdays to 400 people, since you have 365 choices for each person (ignore leap years, makes an insignificant difference). Now look at the numerator. You pick 4 people for which you fix the birthdate to the same as yours. This is a two step process - \mathchoice((((4004\mathchoice))))(1)4 and then you give each of the other 396 people 364 choices each for their birthdays, so that its not your birthday - thus 364396 If you mean at least 4, which is more practical and at least as astonishing ∑400i=4\mathchoice((((400i\mathchoice))))(1365)i(364365)400−i≈0.025 Side Note on Double Counting This is really just adding over the probabilities of partitioned cases for people having exactly 4,5,6,etc. friends with birthdays. Note that its tempting to sometimes modify the above answer for exactly four by giving the people not in the chosen four 365 possibilities for their birthday instead of 364 and not having to sum up. This is wrong because it leads to double counting. Say Your friends A,B,C,D were the chosen 4, and then the 365 choices for everyone else ended up giving E the same birthday as you. This is double counted if B,C,D,E were the chosen four, and the 365 choices ended up giving A the desired birthday. Note however that the numerator is just a finite part of a binomial series, so it has a smaller closed form that you can count by complement as well. Updated 28 Mar • View Upvotes
