Linguistic Relativity: If language influences thinking, what is the "best" language to complement English?
I don't know what kind of thinking you are hoping to inspire, but consider German if it's ontology, or music, if you want to inspire non-verbal thought. German has some very deep concepts and distinctions, and seems well-designed for argumentation. I found this learning German, living in Berlin, and reading/writing German. It would not be my first choice in languages for many other things (humor included). You can't go wrong learning music. It's a non-representational kind of "language," if that's even what it is. But it has structure, and an inner sense of beauty that is more than just sound.
