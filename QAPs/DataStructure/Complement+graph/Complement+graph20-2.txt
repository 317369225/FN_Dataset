Why aren't graph databases more popular?Graphs seem like a really natural way to express and query data in many domains.
A few things: The vast majority of database problems aren't "big data" - and they won't be.  They're rather boring "select * from emp" small-office data-management problems that are extremely well-understood and easily addressed by relational databases or even things like Access.  This may seem like a banal and trivial point, but if you're a company trying to sell a graph database, or a consultant trying to specialize in them, it means your market is far smaller than it may seem. Even in "big data", problems that lend themselves well to graph db's are not all that common. In areas where graph db's make sense, they have the same problem as functional languages: they're too "mathy" and different from other data management tools for most data management types to approach easily.  DB people understand relational db's, and better ones understand name-value-pairs, map-reduce, and doc db's nowadays, but graph db's are a little "too weird". So, my guess is they'll find applications in problem domains where they do particularly well, and they'll also find applications in enterprises that can hire the smartest people on the planet and pay them world-class salaries (Wall Street, some tech companies, etc).  But unless there's some dramatic change in how they're packaged, I can't seem them becoming "mainstream".
