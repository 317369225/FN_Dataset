What are some topics/fields in physics that aren't traditionally taught in the undergraduate physics curriculum but are worth learning/really cool?
Theoretical (statistical) and computational biophysics The undergrad curriculum, in addition to teaching basic physics, should be intended at exposing students to all areas of physics. The traditional curriculum I am aware of, is efficient at providing an introduction to almost all areas except for theoretical biophysics. Most of the students get into it through basic and advanced courses on statistical mechanics. The field is interesting and can show a good connect between biology and physics. It also gives a small insight into biological systems and their mechanics. The topic is intense and is food for thought. It can efficiently teach physics skills and its applications into a different field. Indeed, it can give a very likeable introduction to biology for students into core physics.
