Who is Airbnb's biggest competition?Who are Airbnb's largest competitors?
To me, none of Airbnb's existing competitors (HomeAway, VRBO, etc.) in the home vacation rental market even count as competition. These services existed before Airbnb and with superior UX, talent, and funding, Airbnb has been able to race by all of them to essentially define the home vacation rental market. I feel the gap between Airbnb and its currently viewed ‘competition’ is still widening (fast). The biggest competition to face Airbnb has yet to emerge in a significant way but it will be from Booking.com. While Booking.com specializes in hotels - its really in the accommodation market and with several tweaks to its app - it could easily enter the 3 home verticals Airbnb specializes in - ‘Bed’, ‘Room’, or ‘Entire Place’. How Booking.com poses the biggest threat is that it currently boasts superior distribution. Booking currently operates in 221 countries and gets 900k daily room reservations. There is no other platform that comes close. Now imagine Booking expanding its listings to include the home rental market. Users get a marketplace where the full stack of accommodation possibilities are presented in one place and landlords get exposure to a wider audience. At the end of the day - it’ll be distribution who dominates this market - not fees or pricing. If its easier to rent rooms on Booking.com - that’s where landlords will go. In fact, if you travel to Europe - many ‘Entire Place’ listings on Airbnb are often found as ‘Apartments’ on Booking.com. While Booking.com and Airbnb may not be mentioned side by side just yet - I think the battle between the two is just beginning.
