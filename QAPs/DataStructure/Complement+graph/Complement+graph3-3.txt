What is a great way to learn math and computer science concurrently (ideally with one helping another)?
Please see our course Mathematical Experiments in Computer Science: LC It has 5-6 labs focused on the connection between math and CS.Â  They include graph theory, cryptography, fractals and visualization, game theory and AI, compression, and combinatorial card tricks.
