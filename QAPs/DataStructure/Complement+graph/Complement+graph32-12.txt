Who is Airbnb's biggest competition?Who are Airbnb's largest competitors?
To be honest, it likely is a better economy which may change the supply and demand dynamics. By supply, I mean that less people may think about renting out excess cash for space especially if their experience is less than stellar.  Or if their experience is really good they may look to reduce fees by going to Homeaway or Craigslist. By demand, I mean the people may spend more freely on discretionary items.  Especially as they see the additional benefits that a hotel experience provides (easier booking, cancellation policy, full service, more prime location, concierge service, room service, etc).  That said, those that appreciate the local experience that airbnb provides will remain, as will those price sensitive ones that just seek the lowest rate.
