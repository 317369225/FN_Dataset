Why aren't graph databases more popular?Graphs seem like a really natural way to express and query data in many domains.
The answer for this one is easy, adoption! Many CTO can cope with technology, they prefer to camp their self in well proven legacy technology like MSSQL, Oracle or MySQL even if the problems they face is highly graphable. Recently I worked with a CTO on a pure relationship persistence application, when I ask him if he had consider using graph to resolve is queries scalability, he taught I has talking about visual graphic, and even after many demonstrations that Neo4J is a lot better approach for the problem, he decide to go with MSSQL. This kind of narrow minded decisions, favorise the use ofÂ  comfortable technology, even if it do not work. Let face it! some CTO just save their butts, innovations is not a option!
