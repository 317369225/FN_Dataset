Why are you a theist?
I loved the answers written by Gauri Noolkar and Shreyas Banthalpad. My reason of being a theist is similar. I am a theist because I am a Hindu. Had I not been a Hindu, had I been born into Abrahamic faiths, I would have surely been an Atheist with an appreciation for Buddhism and Hinduism! Eastern faiths are fundamentally different from Abrahamic religions. Pasting from a similar answer I wrote as to why am I a Hindu. ~  I  am a theist because I can carve my own path.    I am a theist because I have the liberty to believe in gods or not.   I am a theist because I have the liberty to question.   I am a theist, because Dyana Marga (path of knowledge) also leads to the same goal.    I am a theist because my outer  self makes no difference to my chance at realizing the purpose of my existence. I am a theist because I believe in Karma. I believe I reap what I sow.   I am theist because I believe that we are all souls and our race, nationality, sex or religion makes no difference to that one almighty.     So, like I said, I am a theist because I am a Hindu.
