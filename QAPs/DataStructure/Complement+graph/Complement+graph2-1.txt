How do "I intend on using.." and "I intend to use..." differ?
The meaning is identical. Many verbs select only to infinitive complements (e.g., want to go, hope to go, need to go), some verbs select only participial complements (e.g., enjoy going, miss going, mind going), and some verbs are ambidextrous (e.g., like going/to go, begin going/to go, continue going/to go). In the case of intend, it's far more common to use to infinitive complements (See the graph here of use during the 20th century Google Ngram Viewer)
