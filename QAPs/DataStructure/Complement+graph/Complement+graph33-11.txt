What are some topics/fields in physics that aren't traditionally taught in the undergraduate physics curriculum but are worth learning/really cool?
Fluid Mechanics. Even aside from the fact that fluids are everywhere in the physical world, and a great many research problems require an understanding of it, the tools that you need for Fluid Mechanics reinforce what physics is all about. A good Fluid Mechanics class teaches you: To use dimensional analysis to determine what approximations are relevant in a given situation. For example,  Are you in high Reynold's number or low Reynold's number? Are you still in startup flow, or have the initial pertubations decayed away by now? To pair physical understanding for a situation with all the techniques you learned in a differential equations class to solve very difficult problems.  The Navier-Stokes is one of the most notorious equations out there, and still the non-compressible, Newtonian limit of full fluid mechanics. Non-linear dynamics.  Classical physics is not all known and dead.  There is an amazing amount of challenges when it comes to still trying to understand turbulence, chaos, and non-linear dynamics.
