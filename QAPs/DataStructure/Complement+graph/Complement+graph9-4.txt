What are the odds of having 4 friends on my Facebook out of 400 born on the same day as me?Not the same year...
A computationally less intensive approach than Abhinav's answer could be: Assuming that the average number of friends having a birthday on a day is 400/365. Birthdays are mutually independent events, so I might say they follow a poisson distribution with a mean = 400/365. Hence applying: P(x; μ) = (exp(-μ)) (μ^x) / x! x being the no. of persons having a birthday on a given day = 4 Exactly 4 would be: P(4; 400/365) = 2.009% or approximately 2% At least 4 would be 2.54% Would gladly look out for any solutions that are even simpler to calculate!!
