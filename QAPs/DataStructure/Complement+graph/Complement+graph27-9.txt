Could anyone have anticipated that John Roberts would be somewhat more centrist than expected?Some conservatives are criticizing the Roberts pick in hindsight, but based on his pre-appointment track record, could anyone have guessed that he'd have turned out this way? Did any conservatives express misgivings at the time?
To add to the otherwise excellent answers here, I think the overall conclusion I must reach is that John Roberts is a bit of a strange cat.  He seemed to be willing to defer to the legislative process and the executive branch's interpretation of the Affordable Care Act , a very controversial piece of legislation.  Yet he threw out the heart of the Voting Rights Act , one of the most celebrated civil rights bills in the history of mankind.  He did so despite the fact that VRA renewal passed a couple of years ago by something like a 98-2 margin.  Unlike ACA, he paid no deference to the legislative history and record whatsoever and even ignored the substantial evidence of present discrimination in the covered jurisdictions that was presented at the trial court level.  So he twice upheld a very controversial law against ideological attacks but struck down a almost universally acclaimed law in favor of an even more ideological attack.    I have heard different theories as to his motives but none that fully satisfy me.  The excellent answers here illuminate the situation but my conclusion remains, Roberts is puzzling.
