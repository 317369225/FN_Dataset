How much mathematics does International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) require?
Arithmetics and Geometry  Integers, operations (incl. exponentiation), comparison Basic properties of integers (sign, parity, divisibility) Prime numbers, basic modular arithmetic – addition, subtraction, multiplication Fractions, percentages Line, line segment, angle, triangle, rectangle, square, circle  Point, vector, coordinates in the plane Polygon (vertex, side/edge, simple, convex, inside, area) Euclidean distances Pythagorean theorem Discrete Structures Functions, relations, and sets Functions (surjections, injections, inverses, composition) Relations (reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, equivalence relations, total/linear order relations, lexicographic order) Sets (Venn diagrams, complements, Cartesian products, power sets) Basic logic Propositional logic Logical connectives (incl. their basic properties) Truth tables Predicate logic Universal and existential quantification Modus ponens and modus tollens Normal forms Proof techniques Notions of implication, converse, inverse, contrapositive, negation, and contradiction Direct proofs, proofs by: counterexample, contraposition, contradiction Mathematical induction Strong induction (also known as complete induction) Recursive mathematical definitions (incl. mutually recursive definitions) Basics of counting Counting arguments (sum and product rule, arithmetic and geometric progressions, Fibonacci numbers) Permutations and combinations (basic definitions)  Factorial function, binomial coefficients Inclusion-exclusion principle Pigeonhole principle Pascal’s identity, Binomial theorem Graphs and trees Trees and their basic properties, rooted trees Undirected graphs (degree, path, cycle, connectedness, Euler/Hamilton path/cycle, handshaking lemma) Directed graphs (in-degree, out-degree, directed path/cycle, Euler/Hamilton path/cycle) Spanning trees Traversal strategies ‘Decorated’ graphs with edge/node labels, weights, colors Multigraphs, graphs with self-loops Bipartite graphs Planar graphs, hypergraphs Discrete probability - Applications where everything is finite (and thus arguments about probability can be easily turned into combinatorial arguments) are out of focus, everything more complicated is explicitly excluded.
