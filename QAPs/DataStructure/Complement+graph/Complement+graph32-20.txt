Who is Airbnb's biggest competition?Who are Airbnb's largest competitors?
I live in Austin and the main rental site is Homeaway and it's smaller sites under it's umbrella. Their business model was to buy up smaller vacation home sites and merge it into their interface. They are still different in that Airbnb does more short term rentals for people who would normally use hotels while Homeaway is short term for people looking to vacation. Therefore, the clientele will be different. Homeaway is also a main competitor here in Austin as their corporate office is here. If you ever need to sublet you can check out our site Homads.
