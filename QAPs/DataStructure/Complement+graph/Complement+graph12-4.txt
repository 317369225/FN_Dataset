Why are you a theist?
Personally, I don't like the words theist or atheist because they reflect very biased veiws of understanding. One sect requires you to blindly follow some pre defined practices and the other sect requires you to blindly reject all the spiritual things on the pretext of rationalism. I like to call myself a seeker to be precise. I believe we should not accept some dogmas and practices just because our parents follow it. That is why I followed the inquisitive  path of life. I questioned all practices to know what higher purpose they fulfilled. I still do that today.  Only after researching and questioning your faith can you say that I follow this sect or that sect. I read a lot of books on Hindu philosophy, and was captivated by it because it shows how to lead a well balanced life simultaneously answering questions related to universe and its functioning. I have read about philosophies of other major religions and found a similar answer. Putting this aside, I believe you don't need religion to seek the truth because it is independent of any religion. All religions are but mere paths to the One Truth and hence, even if you don't believe in any religion or sect but you constantly search for the truth and true essence of life, you are the perfect theist.
