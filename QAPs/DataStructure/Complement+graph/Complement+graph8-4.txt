Do red coders and targets read the full question in a SRM?Most of the times the first paragraph of the question are mere stories. I find world class coders solve problems in codeforces and topcoder in one minute or two minutes. I take more than that time just to read the question itself. SoÂ  how do they do . Do they skip first paragraph. or do they have a superfast reading speed alongside superfast thinking skills.
I was red only once and for about a week so I'm not sure if I'm the one who must answer this question, but when I read a problem statement in a SRM I usually skip the first paragraph unless I see it contains bold variable names. I try to read what needs to be done, and I look at the examples so I see if I understood correctly in order to being able to code asap. Then whenever I get stuck thinking or coding I read it carefully again, but in the meanwhile I have more time to think the problem and sometimes I submit very fast and I don't have to read all the problem statement. This has a positive and a negative side. The positive side: I was twice the fastest coder in one problem, once in a 250 and once in a 500, and for an average high-yellow-rated coder like me that's a lot. The negative side: I fail system tests more often than other coders.
