Could anyone have anticipated that John Roberts would be somewhat more centrist than expected?Some conservatives are criticizing the Roberts pick in hindsight, but based on his pre-appointment track record, could anyone have guessed that he'd have turned out this way? Did any conservatives express misgivings at the time?
Roberts came into his confirmation hearings with very little known about how he actually felt about things; how he saw things through a constitutional lens. That's not surprising as anyone with any sort of strong record is going to have a difficult time getting confirmed. If either Party wants a strongly ideological justice to be nominated, that party is going to have to be willing to wage a pretty fierce war and most candidates are going to be shot down prior to confirmation. Only if there are super-majorities in both Houses of Congress and a party member in the White House can a strongly ideological judge reach the Supreme Court. I don't think any question can serve as a clear identifier of "political purity." A smart nominee can always find ways to not say what s/he doesn't want to say.
