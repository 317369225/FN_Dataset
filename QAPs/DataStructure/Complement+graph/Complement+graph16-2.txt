What does AOL get with the about.me acquisition?
Explained in more detail at http://www.drupt.com/?p=56 but for present purposes... a) Obvious: this type of site will become more popular in 2011, as internet users with multiple accounts grow b) Growth of this type of site will be assisted by Flavors.Me, which got nominated for Mashable awards in best new design category. This means that 25 gazillion Mashable fans will probably be checking out this kind of site c) Important Indirect benefit: the speed with which AOL jumped on this acquisition is also sending a message to the M & A community that AOL is trying to shed its image as a slow-moving Washington-based corporation. As Brad Garlinghouse said in the internal email about it, AOL is taking an "offensive" rather than "defensive" strategy (a la Yahoo sunsetting services) during this uncertain economic environment.
