What are the odds of having 4 friends on my Facebook out of 400 born on the same day as me?Not the same year...
At this point, this is a partial answer - but may feed someone else. There is a well known counter-intuitive problem in probability that if you take a set of just 23 people, there is a 50% chance that two of them will have the same birthday. With 57 people, there is a 99% chance. Read here for more details. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/B... The answer depends whether you want to compute the odds of 5 people (including yourself) in the set of 400 having the same birthday, or of 4 people in the set of 400 having a birthday on a given date. Those are two different computations.
