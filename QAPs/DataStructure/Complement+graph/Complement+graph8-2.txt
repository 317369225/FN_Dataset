Do red coders and targets read the full question in a SRM?Most of the times the first paragraph of the question are mere stories. I find world class coders solve problems in codeforces and topcoder in one minute or two minutes. I take more than that time just to read the question itself. So  how do they do . Do they skip first paragraph. or do they have a superfast reading speed alongside superfast thinking skills.
Anecdotally I'll answer yes. I usually have to read the questions twice, actually.  Once to understand the broad idea and again (skimming it this time) to pick out details.  Sometimes if I think I know what is going on in the problem I'll skip down to the constraints and examples.
