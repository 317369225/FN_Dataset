How do I understand bitwise tricks in C++ for competitive programming?
To understand bitwise tricks, you should know how numbers are represented(Binary Numbers) and bit shift operators (Tutorials - Bitwise Operators and Bit Manipulations in C and C++ - Cprogramming.com). Most of the basic bit level tricks are easy to understand. For the more complicated ones, try a few examples on your own and it should be clear. Here are some of the basic bit level tricks: // See if ith bit is set in n (n & (1 << i)) > 0   // Set ith bit of n n |= (1 << i);   // Reset ith bit of n n &= ~(1 << i);   // Flip ith bit of n n ^= (1 << i);   // Get number of ones in n (for gcc) __builtin_popcount(n);   // Get m least significant bits of n n &= (1 << m) - 1;   // Get the least significant set bit n & (-n) Sources for more tricks: A bit of fun: fun with bits Bit Twiddling Hacks
