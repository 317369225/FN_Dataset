What will prevent Quora from experiencing the same less-than-spectacular fate as FriendFeed, as they seem to share some commonalities around origin, demographic of user base and nature of user interaction at this phase?This is a follow-up question to Why did the FriendFeed team fail to build a lasting product / community?. Also a follow-up question to Does anyone still use FriendFeed? Why?
Quora is almost nothing like FriendFeed, as far as I've seen.  Quora is designed to be a resource with conversations around it if needed, whereas FriendFeed was focused on conversations.  Conversations by nature are hard to be useful long-term for users without a purpose (such as becoming a resource for later) and mechanisms/norms to discourage comments that aren't useful for that.
