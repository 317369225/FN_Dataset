If complex numbers are imaginary, then what is their significance in the real world? Why should we study complex numbers?
The terms "real" numbers and "imaginary" numbers are horrible names, and we should really stop using them.  Have you ever seen a 7 walking down the street?  Of course not.  All numbers are "imaginary" in the sense that we made them up. As far as the universe is concerned, "imaginary" numbers are just as REAL as "real" numbers.  Again, let me emphasize that: The universe knows about complex (i.e. imaginary) numbers.  They show up in plenty of real world applications.  Just because they don't show up in every kind of application shouldn't bother us.  If I'm counting my sheep, I might notice that I always have a whole number.  We can't have 1/2 of a sheep.  Does that mean we should get rid of fractions?  Of course not.
