What was the most devastating war in human lives, adjusted for world population?Heard an NPR story the other day. Said that WW2 ranks 9th and WW1 doesn't make the top 10. Any idea what the other top ones are? I would guess Napoleonic Wars or Taiping Rebellion would be up there...
Below is a list of top 20 worst wars and atrocities to complement Christopher Reiss's no.1  The numbers come from Steven Pinker's book “The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined”. According to Pinker's research, violence has declined by dramatic degrees all over the world in many spheres of behavior: genocide, war, human sacrifice, torture, slavery, and the treatment of racial minorities, women, children, and animals.

RSA video lecture Steven Pinker - The Better Angels of our Nature Believe it or not—and I know most people do not—violence has been in decline over long stretches of time, and we may be living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence. The decline of violence, to be sure, has not been steady; it has not brought violence down to zero (to put it mildly); and it is not guaranteed to continue. But I hope to convince you that it's a persistent historical development, visible on scales from millennia to years, from the waging of wars and perpetration of genocides to the spanking of children and the treatment of animals.
