What are some topics/fields in physics that aren't traditionally taught in the undergraduate physics curriculum but are worth learning/really cool?
A course which introduces students to dimensional analysis in greater detail would be very useful, in my opinion. Many of the fundamental physical relations, across different areas in physics, can be obtained (up to numerical factors) using these techniques. Familiarity with the tools of dimensional analysis helps the student build an immediate intuition as to how physical quantities scale as functions of each other. It would also help increase their comfort level in dealing with the several different systems of units that physicists use (e.g., natural units, geometric units, etc.). Dimensional analysis could be taught as part of a course that also covers estimation and order-of-magnitude physics (e.g., PHYS 239: Scaling and Estimation in Physics at UCSD).
