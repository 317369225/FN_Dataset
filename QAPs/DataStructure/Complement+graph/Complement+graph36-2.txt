Will reputation systems replace grades in schools?
I'd have to say that reputation systems have a ways to go in terms of how they are implemented, how effectively they can be validated, and how fair they are before I would suggest replacing grades with them. In the fish-bowl environment that most schools seem to have (from my limited experience) I would also a lot of concerns about how a reputation system would affect the interactions between students, parents, teachers, etc. I'd say there are a lot of deeper questions about what grades are trying to accomplish and their pros or cons. A discussion around that in general would probably benefit from exploring the pros and cons of reputation systems as well.
