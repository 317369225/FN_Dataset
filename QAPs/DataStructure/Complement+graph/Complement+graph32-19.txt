Who is Airbnb's biggest competition?Who are Airbnb's largest competitors?
It depends on the market you are working in. I am based in Hong Kong and have a lot of visitors from China. In China there are local competitors like Tujia.com, but they don't have an English interface yet, and you may need a Chinese cell phone number to register, so I haven't tried them yet. The only alternative I have found which sometimes works is Craigslist. I had some enquiries from booking.com but no bookings. It's important to diversify and not rely on one platform because Airbnb can remove your listings at any time without having to give a reason as recently happened to me. Airbnb can pull the plug on your lettings business at any time, they do not have to give any reason as you will see if you read your terms and conditions carefully.
