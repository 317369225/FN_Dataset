How do I solve this equation? x 3 −⌊x⌋=3 **EDIT: I also employed the same approach as many of the other people who have answered and drew a rough graph and tried some values for floor(x), but what I'm asking is, is there any general method to do this? In this question we got an answer for floor(x)=1 but the trial and error may not be easy each time.
Use Newton raphson method to solve this. Make f(x)=x^3 - [x] - 3. Now by some analysis we now that solution of f(x) can't be integer, Now for x=1 , f(x)=-3          for x=1.5,f(x)=-.625,          for x=2,f(x)=3, so for using Newton raphson we have enough information. so let's start Xn = X(n-1) - f(X(n-1))/f '(X(n-1)).If formula is not clear please go to Wikipedia. Now from previous analysis we know that we can take X0 = 1.5. Put n=1 in the equation, now we have X1 = 1.580( remember differentiation of[x] greatest integer function is Zero ,when x is non-integer.) Similar way for X2=1.587. You can calculate upto 10 iteration for more better answer. This is the answer.
