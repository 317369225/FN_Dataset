How do "I intend on using.." and "I intend to use..." differ?
It's a matter of personal taste. I, for one, sometimes violate grammatical rules in certain social contexts in order to sound less stilted. By the same token, there are certain language usages that just don't feel right to me personally. I can't imagine myself saying "I intend on . . .", but I wouldn't want to make someone feel bad for saying it.
