How should I prepare for the CAT 2016-17 by myself?
Quant-Getting concepts write and practice DI -Immense practice VA-Immense practice LR-Simple tricks and decent practice This is stage 1- can take upto six months or more-once you feel confidence with your practice and fundas start taking mocks and timed sectional tests I screwed my first attempt because I stopped at the above stage scored 88 percenile that year-attempted 48 out ofÂ  60 questions and must have got 10-12 wrong CAT is not a difficult exam, its the exam for those who can strategise the best . Choose the correct question and avoid negative- you are sure to succeed but this comes once you have given a lot of mocks and analysed them.
