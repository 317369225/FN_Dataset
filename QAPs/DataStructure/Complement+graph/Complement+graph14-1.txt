What will prevent Quora from experiencing the same less-than-spectacular fate as FriendFeed, as they seem to share some commonalities around origin, demographic of user base and nature of user interaction at this phase?This is a follow-up question to Why did the FriendFeed team fail to build a lasting product / community?. Also a follow-up question to Does anyone still use FriendFeed? Why?
1. FriendFeed used the aggregation model, which never became mainstream. Quora avoided aggregation altogether. It has kept it simple, stupid. 2. Quora has a 'Not Helpful' way of removing junk comments, keeping overall quality of discourse higher. 3. Unlike FriendFeed, there is no way in Quora for a handful of influencers to dominate the service completely overshadowing others. 4. Quora's People Follow model provides Serendipity, but it is complemented by the Interest Graph based on Following Topics, thus providing Personalization. 5. For Quora, Relevance is the most important guiding principle. When you follow someone whose tech opinions you respect, your feed isnâ€™t unexpectedly filled with their kids pictures voted up by their adoring fans. The Interest Graph overrules the Social Graph, unlike FriendFeed. Pure Signal, No Noise. For more, see my post: http://www.skepticgeek.com/socia...
