Is a comma necessary after the word "titled," as in "The book was titled 'My Hero'."?
No comma needed. However, you might try to find some other way to say it, for example, by incorporating the title into the previous or the following sentence. For example, "The book, My Hero, by a Japanese scientist, tells the story of ...." From a stylistic point of view, it is preferable not to devote an entire sentence just to stating the title of a book, unless this is absolutely unavoidable, or it is done for dramatic effect. I would not follow Dixie Guill Golden's advice: "The book's title is My Hero." This is not a very writerly style of expression, especially the possessive on the inanimate "book" ("book's title"). This sort of construction might be acceptable in ordinary English, but it is not literaryâ€”and certainly not formal English. Also, she is wrong about the sentence being in the passive voice. The sentence has the structure: Subject + Linking Verb + Subjective Complement, where "titled" is the subjective complement. (Compare: "I was surprised"; "She was pleased"; "They were interested"; etc.) As you can see, there is nothing objectionable about "The book was titled ...." It is a perfectly valid English sentence construction. As the following graph shows, its use has risen steadily since 1920, and it in now widely used in written texts (source: Google Ngram Viewer).
