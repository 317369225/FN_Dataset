What book/reference should I use for interview questions on C/C++ (tough ones of the Morgan Stanley type), considering I have an interview scheduled in 10 days?I have good basic knowledge of both the languages.
After flubbing a phone interview with an investment bank, for which I was totally unprepared (hey, I was getting my PhD in physics and didn't know what to expect)... I got this book from the library: Heard on the Street: Quantitative Questions from Wall Street Job Interviews, by Timothy Falcon Crack. Great book for warming up your brain for any kind of technical interview, in my opinion! The book offers a mixture of logic/math problems and quantitative finance questions. I worked through pretty much all of the former category, and ended up finding simpler solutions for a couple of them. (I emailed the author at some point and he agreed with one of my suggestions, if I remember right.)
