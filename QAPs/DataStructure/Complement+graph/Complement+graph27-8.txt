Could anyone have anticipated that John Roberts would be somewhat more centrist than expected?Some conservatives are criticizing the Roberts pick in hindsight, but based on his pre-appointment track record, could anyone have guessed that he'd have turned out this way? Did any conservatives express misgivings at the time?
Whatever their judicial philosophy is going in, it is not necessarily predictable over time once they get their lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land.    I give you Earl Warren.  Eisenhower is reputed to have said that appointing Warren is the biggest mistake he ever made, although in this Wikipedia entry, his biographer could not find evidence of that.   The story goes that Eisenhower believed his second biggest mistake was William J. Brennan, Jr.   But there is no mention of that in the Wikipedia entry.
