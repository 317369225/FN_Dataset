How do I solve this equation? x 3 −⌊x⌋=3 **EDIT: I also employed the same approach as many of the other people who have answered and drew a rough graph and tried some values for floor(x), but what I'm asking is, is there any general method to do this? In this question we got an answer for floor(x)=1 but the trial and error may not be easy each time.
You asked for a general solution, without trial and error. Let's try to work it out. Say we have a general equation of the form x 3 −⌊x⌋=N  Where N is any real number. If N=100  , say, then we of course cannot immediately deduce that ⌊x⌋=1  as in the case N=3  . Now, the function floor(x), which we shall write as ⌊x⌋  , has the property ⌊x⌋≤x<⌊x⌋+1  The given equation x 3 −⌊x⌋=N  May be written as ⌊x⌋−x 3 +N=0  We can write the expression ⌊x⌋−x 3 +N  Inside an inequality: ⌊x⌋−x 3 +N≤x−x 3 +N  <⌊x⌋−x 3 +N+1  We want the left-hand side of the inequality to be zero, and thus the right-hand side should be 1: 0≤x−x 3 +N<1  Solving the expression in the middle for 0 and for 1 is quite trivial, since there is a general formula for any cubic equation. In general you would have 3 complex solutions for each case. If you're lucky, exactly 1 of these solutions would be real. In the example where N=3  , the solution for 1 is approximately x≈1.52  and the solution for 0 is approximately x≈1.67  . Taking the derivative of x−x 3 +N  , we get 1−3x 2   , which for any |x|>1/3  √   is negative. Thus, the function is decreasing, so it is monotonic, and the unique x  that solves the original equation must lie between these two values. In the case of N=3  , since ⌊x⌋=1  for both cases, we can just replace ⌊x⌋  by 1  and solve the equation x 3 =4  , which has only one real solution: x=4  √ 3 ≈1.5874  . In the case ofN=100  , for example, we solve the expression x−x 3 +100  for 1 and 0 and get x≈4.698  and x≈4.713  respectively. The function is, again, decreasing, so we know that 4.698<x<4.713  . Thus we can replace ⌊x⌋  by 4  and solve x 3 =104  , which again has only one real solution: x=104 − − −  √ 3 ≈4.7027  .
