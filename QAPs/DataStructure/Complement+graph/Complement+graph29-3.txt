Which is better for time management: paper planners or electronic planners?
Personally, I prefer paper planners. I love to have all my notes with me and to be independent from hardware, electricity and Internet connection. However, as I work in a big and distributed team, I use an online board for time management. The board I use is called Kanban Tool. It allows me to organize, prioritize and monitor things to do, as well as to share tasks and comments with my team.
