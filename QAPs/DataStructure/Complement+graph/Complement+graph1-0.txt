What's the difference between Quora and Formspring.me?
On Formspring we don't particularly care about the correct answer to a question. We love that services like Quora do care about the correct (or maybe "best," is a better term) answer to a question. Harnessing and cataloging the world's knowledge in a meaningful, useful way is a very complex problem and the solution on Quora is a very elegant one. That said, on Formspring we only care about one response: yours. There is no correct or best response to a question on Formspring. To be completely honest, we don't see Quora as a direct competitor, especially considering our two very different focuses. It's like comparing Foursquare and Instagram. Yes, both are social services, but each are attacking completely different problems.
