What does it mean for a US carrier to be maintaining fleet readiness?E.g. CVN 69 is "under way maintaining fleet readiness in the wake of Hurricane Irene".
This is the only source I know of for current deployments: http://www.globalsecurity.org/mi... I was never in the service but I imagine the best exercise for readiness is ALWAYS at sea in the worse conditions. For any large organization, a plan is truly put to the test only when folks are bumping into each other in the dark, dropping things and shouting over one another.
