What are some topics/fields in physics that aren't traditionally taught in the undergraduate physics curriculum but are worth learning/really cool?
Many of my gripes with the typical undergraduate physics curriculum are related not to the physics courses themselves but rather the lack of supporting courses.  In particular differential geometry (on which both general relativity and quantum field theory are based) and the triumvirate of communication (writing and presentation skills), software development, and statistics (on which most physics careers are based). If, however, we limit ourselves to explicit physics topics then I'd suggest classical field theory.  The field (get it?) encompass fluid dynamics and mechanics of solids, not to mention that quantum field theory is infinitely easier when you actually understand what you're quantizing. Classical Dynamics: A Contemporary Approach: Jorge V. José, Eugene J. Saletan: 9780521636360: Amazon.com: Books and the notes from Ph 136 Applications of Classical Physics provide nice introductions.
