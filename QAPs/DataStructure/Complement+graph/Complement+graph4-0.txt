When do we have a unique min cut in a flow network?
The supplementary question in the details is clearly false. The uniqueness of the maximum flow (in any of the possible interpretations of that term) does not imply the uniqueness of the minimum cut. Consider a flow network that consists of a single path that has multiple consecutive edges, each with the same capacity. For this graph, the maximum flow is clearly unique, but there is one minimum cut for each edge. Given a flow network, the existence of a unique minimum cut can be verified efficiently as follows: Use any algorithm to construct one maximum flow. Now, let A be the set of all vertices reachable from the source via an augmenting path, and let B be the set of all vertices such that you can reach the sink from them via an augmenting path. Clearly, both (A,complement of A) and (complement of B,B) are minimum cuts. There is a unique minimum cut if and only if they are equal. (Comment if I should fill in more details here.)
