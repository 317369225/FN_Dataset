How should I prepare for the CAT 2016-17 by myself?
So let's look at the 3 steps of preparation: Step 1: Get your Basics in Place - You have 420 days to CAT. Use the first 150-180 days to get your basics in place. You need to get your fundas clear across the Board. Read up the concepts, go through solved examples and then start attempting. By the end of the 150th day you should be in a state to attempt Level 1 questions from any topic of any section. Step 2: Practice through Level 2 problems-Now you escalate your practice to the next level. For the next 90 days ensure that you get a strong command over at least 2-3 modules of each section. In QA, concentrate on Algebra, Arithmetic (Ratio, TSD, Perc, Time and Work, P&L) and Numbers. In VRC, concentrate on Verbal Logic (Parajumples, Critical reasoning and Para completion), Grammar and to a certain extent RC (should be able to attempt 2 out of the 4 that are expected). In LRDI, practice, practice and then practice some more. You should be able to attempt at least 5 out of the 8 expected sets. Step 3: Practice through Mocks-This step needs to take place in conjunctions with steps 1 and 2 as well as on it's own- Practice through Mocks. You need to practice through Mocks.Â  Doesn't matter if you have completed step 1 or 2 or both, Mocks need to be taken now. That's the best mode of practice. Try taking them at the same time as the CAT Slots - experiment with both possibilities.
