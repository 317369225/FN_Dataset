Which is better for time management: paper planners or electronic planners?
I use both, but for somewhat different purposes: Moleskine—fast note-taking, idea generation, visual planning (mind maps, graphs, etc.). Evernote—quick notes, snapshots (websites, photos, etc.), but also archiving what had previously been written in paper notebooks. Both have great pros and cons and I found that as long as you clearly the purpose of each tool they can complement each other rather well.
