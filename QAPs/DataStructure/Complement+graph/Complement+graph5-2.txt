What was the most devastating war in human lives, adjusted for world population?Heard an NPR story the other day. Said that WW2 ranks 9th and WW1 doesn't make the top 10. Any idea what the other top ones are? I would guess Napoleonic Wars or Taiping Rebellion would be up there...
I guess, some events are not listed here as there is reliable data. The conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar is probably one of these events.
