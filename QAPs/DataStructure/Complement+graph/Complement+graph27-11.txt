Could anyone have anticipated that John Roberts would be somewhat more centrist than expected?Some conservatives are criticizing the Roberts pick in hindsight, but based on his pre-appointment track record, could anyone have guessed that he'd have turned out this way? Did any conservatives express misgivings at the time?
I don't believe that Chief Justice John Roberts is or will be regarded as a "centrist" except for those on the far right who are disappointed by some of his decisions.  I think the key thing here in evaluating Roberts is to keep in mind that he tends to be a somewhat conservative traditionally (which means he doesn't like the Courts on issues that the Legislature have chosen to act on and superimposing his opinion to say "they got it wrong."  Additionally, he's focused on more than just the case in front of him and his opinion of it--he also has a strong concern for how the court is viewed and it's legacy (and didn't say "his legacy" but the "court's legacy").  For instance, if the court renders a series of pivotal decisions overturning ACA and the Iran Deal and a host of other issues, it's very easy for this Supreme Court to get the rep as a partisan court focused on making legislature from the bench.  Roberts doesn't want majority decisions that get overturned 2 years later when 1 or 2 judges change.  He wants decisions that stand the test of time, that are enduring--that's how you gain the reputation as a powerful and wise court rather than a reactionary or partisan court.
