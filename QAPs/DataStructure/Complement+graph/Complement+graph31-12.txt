Linguistic Relativity: If language influences thinking, what is the "best" language to complement English?
Any language at a level of fluency where you can basically say whatever you want will give you the executive function boost we hear about from studies. I'd say you're best off aiming for something profoundly different from English. Ideally something hegemonic with lots of influence and wide distribution that's given a lot of vocabulary to the world. Quechua, Mayan, Mandarin, Japanese, Arabic, yoruba possibly something else widely used in Africa, Tamil, Farsi, Russian, Hindi/Urdu, German, Spanish or Portuguese or French, or Indonesian/maylay, and possibly Thai, Vietnamese.Â  Some tones, backwards word order, different orthography, Literary culture and as others mention, great media. French, Spanish, Portuguese and German are close to English, but have wide ranging use and a massive amount of media.
