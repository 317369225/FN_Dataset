Will reputation systems replace grades in schools?
School is a very particular context. Any one context is necessarily limited in scope. Grades are already a kind of reputation score based on objective criteria (which may not be valued outside of the school, of course). School grades could be further augmented by capturing additional and explicit qualities: effort/perseverance, emotional intelligence (working in groups), etc. However, it's much more likely that the best reputation scores for any individual are those from a context they have actively chosen for themselves rather than those of a system that has been imposed upon them. Hence online role-playing games may be far more valuable for measuring certain personal qualities as contrasted with measuring mere compliance using a reputation system levered into a school curriculum. Implicit vs Explicit motivation (see Daniel Pink): If it's a voluntary activity, measure it. If it's compulsory, expect meta-gaming at best.
