What are the odds of having 4 friends on my Facebook out of 400 born on the same day as me?Not the same year...
You know, the most amazing thing happened to me tonight. I was coming here, on the way to the lecture, and I came in through the parking lot. And you won't believe what happened. I saw a car with the license plate ARW 357. Can you imagine? Of all the millions of license plates in the state, what was the chance that I would see that particular one tonight? Amazing!-Richard Feynman My answer to your  question depends on why you're asking.  If you pulled this question out of the air as a hypothetical, either for its didactic value or because you wanted to know whether, when you get 400 Facebook friends, you have decent chance of throwing a giant five-way-birthday bash, then you should do the calculations by Dan, Herambh, and Abhinav. On the other hand, if you simply noticed that four of your friends share your birthday and want to know whether this is remarkable, the answer is no.  It is completely mundane, even if the calculated probability is low. The reason is you weren't going in looking specifically for the number of people sharing your birthday.  It was just something that caught your attention as being out of the ordinary, and there are so many conceivable out-of-the-ordinary things that it is virtually certain that at least one of them will occur. What would be remarkable is if you now went and looked on LinkedIn where you have 400 connections with a completely different set of people, and four  of them share your birthday, too.   Then next week you go to a conference on your birthday and they say, "hey, who's birthday is it here?"  and out of the 400 people at the conference, four of them share your birthday.  That would be amazing.
