Is Applied Math 107 (Graph Theory and Combinatorics) worth taking at Harvard?Topics in combinatorial mathematics that find frequent application in computer science, engineering, and general applied mathematics. Specific topics taken from graph theory, enumeration techniques, optimization theory, combinatorial algorithms, and discrete probability
I wholeheartedly recommend it. A few things to consider if you are deciding: Professor Valiant is a legend. He practically invented computational learning theory, and won a Turing Award [1]. Fandom aside, this class isn't on learning theory, but he's a brilliant, thoughtful, and precise lecturer. Attending lectures is a must.Â  For a course listed as "applied math," it's more on the theoretical side. The majority of lectures, problem sets, and exam questions focus on proofs. It's fast-paced but accessible. The syllabus states that "No specific body of knowledge is required, but some mathematical maturity will be assumed." This is true -- you might not want to write your first proof ever in this class -- but I do feel that the work is very doable for a course that is not explicitly an intro to theoretical math. It was my second fully proof-based course, so I found it quite challenging but not overwhelming. If you're a Computer Science concentrator, AM 107 is a great complement to (read: not a replacement for) CS 124. The amount of overlap is minimal, and where it exists, CS 124 focuses on implementation where AM 107 discusses the same algorithm at a more theoretical level. And graph theory & combo have a ton of applications in data structures and networks. The subject matter is just awesome. Overall, I found the material among the most fascinating out of everything I've taken in 7 semesters. Definitely consider this class if you're interested in algorithms/theory. But it's also a great exercise in problem-solving and mathematical thinking, which is valuable for a number of quantitative fields. [1] Leslie Valiant
