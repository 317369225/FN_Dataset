What are some topics/fields in physics that aren't traditionally taught in the undergraduate physics curriculum but are worth learning/really cool?
One subject that I'm eternally grateful was shoehorned into undergraduate physics (as an "experiment" in the second year experimental physics subject at University of Queensland), was applied Fourier transforms. It was there partly to support another experiment on diffraction (illustrating Fourier optics), but Fourier transforms are so fundamental in applied physics that it's come in handy again and again. We had to derive the effects of sampling and windowing in terms of convolutions and then write computer code to implement it.
