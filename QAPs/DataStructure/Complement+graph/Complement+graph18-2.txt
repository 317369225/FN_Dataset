If complex numbers are imaginary, then what is their significance in the real world? Why should we study complex numbers?
First things first, imaginary numbers are as much of a mental construct as real numbers. There is nothing imaginary about them in the literal sense and technically they are as real as real number themselves. The fact is, as reals were defined first, we needed to call their complement as the complement of real in English. Does a number which solves the equation x 2 −1=0  not appear much more rational than a typical 'rational' number? Is there anything that makes you feel negative about −2  ? Then what makes you think that imaginary numbers are imaginary and real numbers aren't? Try thinking about the 2D plane. Can you imagine the X-Y axis? Now we just rename the X axis as the real line and the Y axis as the imaginary line. Very soon, you will realise that this extension has much more application than what you can generally think of. All real numbers are just on the X axis, all Imaginary numbers are on the Y axis and all their linear combinations can now be plotted as points on this graph. Now, any polynomial of degree n  will have exactly n  intersections with 0 and thus exactly n  roots! We gain so many properties that the loss of inequalities seems pretty small .For many mathematicians, this is paradise! They can do so much with this extension that complex analysis is still alive with research giving new meaning to our knowledge of mathematics even today. This single extension of real numbers  has so many applications for engineers  in systems-signals, electrical circuits and so many fields, that learning about it is imperative if you want to become a good engineer or mathematician!
