If complex numbers are imaginary, then what is their significance in the real world? Why should we study complex numbers?
In electrical engineering, we have to deal with a lot of quantities of the form cos(ωt)  (think AC voltage, sound waves, electromagnetic waves, ...). Now, rather than manipulating these cosines all the time, we'd rather have a simpler quantity : e jωt   , which we know is cos(ωt)+jsin(ωt)  . This is the Phasor which has been mentioned in an earlier answer. We can always come back to the cosine quantity by taking the real part of the Phasor. So, in a sense, although we know that the voltage arriving in your living room is best modeled by a cosine, we usually model it with an imaginary exponential. Why? Because the arithmetic of phasors is easier than the arithmetic of cosines. For example, imagine you want to compute the current intensity in a capacitor. The current through the capacitor is proportional to the time derivative of the voltage applied to the capacitor. If this voltage is of the form of a phasor, then its time derivative is simply jωe jωt   . The entire field of signal processing (think audio, video, telecommunications, ...) is based on this formalism.
