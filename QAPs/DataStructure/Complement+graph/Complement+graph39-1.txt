What is the most difficult computer science course at Stanford?
I think Jack's answer is pretty good. I think most people would agree that 140 is the hardest programming/systems course. On the math-y, AI side, I think 228T or 229T would be the hardest courses. They are both more thorough and theoretical follow ups to 228 and 229 respectively. The courses are more geared towards advanced MS or PHD students, unlike 228/229 which are doable, though difficult, as undergrads. On a side note, I personally believe difficulty is pretty dependent on interest in the class and willingness to do work. For example, I felt some of my breadth courses were mentally harder to get through than 228/229, just because it was harder to get myself as excited about them and to spend the necessary time studying the material.
