Who is Airbnb's biggest competition?Who are Airbnb's largest competitors?
Airbnb had no competitor in the USA..but that changes with the arrival of HouseStay (Vacation Rentals, Holiday Homes, Apartments & Rooms for Rent) seems to be the only competitor. I emailed them and heard from cust service that they are in the midst of differentiating themselves and will start marketing towards end of 2014.. My 1 bed listing: Airbnb: Inquiries 18 since Jan 2014 housestay: Inquiries 8 since July 2014..think they launched in July not sure though. I'm also listed on Wimdu and 9flats but not much traction :-(
