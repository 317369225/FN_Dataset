If complex numbers are imaginary, then what is their significance in the real world? Why should we study complex numbers?
Complex numbers are not necessarily imaginary numbers. Imaginary numbers are only a part of complex number formulation. Then again, Imaginary numbers are not imaginary in the literal sense of the word. Check Arijit Layek's answer to Do imaginary numbers actually exist? Finally, even if you are unlikely to encounter complex valued physical quantities like amount of rain or temperature of your warm bath - complex numbers are frequently used in Electrical engineering and other domains, such as theoretical physics. They serve a purpose of broadening our views and provides deeper insight into various analysis. Say, signal analysis for example. Without Fourier Transform and other techniques similar to it, we won't have amazing advancements in this field. From JPEG compression to FFT algorithm - it's all grounded in complex numbers. Analysis using complex number makes it much easier to deal with the problem. It gives the complete picture. So, don't look down upon complex numbers. They might just constitute a big chunk of your graduate studies.
