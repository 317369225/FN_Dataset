Will Google+ eventually replace Gmail or webmail?I will surely use Google+ more if it allows file sharing.
Short answer: Both of them complement each other, the former focuses on collaboration, the later communication. Google+ will complement Gmail or other emails. Google+ is essentially a social network, to connect, interact, discover and explore through your social graph. Email is probably one of the most effective asynchronous communication method: both the sender and recipients do not have to be communicating at the same time. A very powerful and effective communication tool if used correctly. You get to choose who can see what, and when you want to see what messages using filters.
