How do I solve this equation? x 3 −⌊x⌋=3 **EDIT: I also employed the same approach as many of the other people who have answered and drew a rough graph and tried some values for floor(x), but what I'm asking is, is there any general method to do this? In this question we got an answer for floor(x)=1 but the trial and error may not be easy each time.
We have, x 3 −⌊x⌋=3  We know that, x=⌊x⌋+α,0≤α<1  The given equation can be written as, ⇒x 3 −(x−α)=3  ⇒x 3 −x=3−α  Hence, 2<x 3 −x≤3  Further more, for x≥2  we have, x 3 −x=x(x 2 −1)≥2(4−1)=6>3  for, x<−1  we have, x 3 −x=x(x 2 −1)<0<2  for, x=−1  we have x 3 −x=0<2  for, −1<x≤0  we have x 3 −x≤−x<1  for, 0<x≤1  we have x 3 −x<x<x 3 ≤1  So, x  must lie in (1,2)  For 1<x<2  ,     ⌊x⌋=1  , The original equation can be written as, ⇒x 3 −1=3  ⇒x 3 =4  x=4  √ 3   is the solution of the equation.
