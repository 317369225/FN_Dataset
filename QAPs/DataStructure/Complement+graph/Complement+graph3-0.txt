What is a great way to learn math and computer science concurrently (ideally with one helping another)?
Mason Porter already mentioned graph theory, which is an excellent answer. Another area which you may find interesting is computer graphics, especially when dealing with polynomial curves and surfaces. Here's a primer on the subject of Bézier curves: NURBS curves are an algorithmic machine for generating sequences of Bézier curves with nice continuity between them (at least, that's one way of looking at them). Bézier surfaces (and NURBS surfaces) are a relatively straightforward way to extend the idea into two parametric dimensions. 3d computer graphics require a decent amount of linear algebra. In most cases, you'll be converting from one vector space to another. And if you know how to do curves and surfaces, you can convert them from your world space to screen space in order to take a look at them. I'm not much of a mathematician myself; much of the math I know has been learned from working in these two fields. I hope you enjoy them. By the way, the "coding math" podcast, of which my linked video is episode 19, might be fun to look at as well. Here is his YouTube channel: Coding Math
