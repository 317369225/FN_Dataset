What are the odds of having 4 friends on my Facebook out of 400 born on the same day as me?Not the same year...
The probabilities given here fail to take into account that birthdays are not uniformly distributed throughout the year.  Take a look at What is the distribution of birthdays? for an in-depth discussion of this.  Given that so many people share your birthday, I'd guess it's more likely to be one of the high-probability days rather than one of the low-probability days.  You can get the probability for your birthday from the linked sites in that answer.  Let's say that you were born on the most popular day, August 15.  This has a probability of 0.324% (versus the uniform probability of 0.274%).  Substituting this number into the second formula in Abhinav Sharma's answer, there is a 4.25% chance that four other people out of 400 will share this birthday with you.  If you were born on the least popular day (namely, the day after Christmas), then the chance would instead be only 1.52%. Of course this would be most impressive if you were born on February 29, "leap day."  The chances of this happening in that event would be only 0.018%. Note that these figures are for North America -- they'd likely be reversed in the Southern Hemisphere, and pushed towards the uniform figures if your friends came from all parts of the world in equal measures.  Further, the leap year calculation assumes that your friends' birth years are equally distributed, which is unlikely -- if you're still young enough that most of your Facebook friends are from high school or college, at least half would likely have the same birth year as you, which would substantially effect the probability they were born on leap day.
