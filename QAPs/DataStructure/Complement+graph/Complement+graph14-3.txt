What will prevent Quora from experiencing the same less-than-spectacular fate as FriendFeed, as they seem to share some commonalities around origin, demographic of user base and nature of user interaction at this phase?This is a follow-up question to Why did the FriendFeed team fail to build a lasting product / community?. Also a follow-up question to Does anyone still use FriendFeed? Why?
Friendfeed was a personal communication/publishing platform. But if I understand correctly, Quora is far from personal. They're shooting for Wikipedia model. They already have good content to start with, all they need is a good SEO strategy to attract more people, who will in turn add more questions and answers, which will again attract more people, and so on. Of course quality control would be another important factor, of which I am not a big fan at this moment.
