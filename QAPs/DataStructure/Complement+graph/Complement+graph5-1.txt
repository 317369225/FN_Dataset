What was the most devastating war in human lives, adjusted for world population?Heard an NPR story the other day. Said that WW2 ranks 9th and WW1 doesn't make the top 10. Any idea what the other top ones are? I would guess Napoleonic Wars or Taiping Rebellion would be up there...
~ 15% of the world's population died in the An Lushan Rebellion (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_...) in Northern China, 755-763 AD.   About 30 million died out of a world population of 200 million.
