Could anyone have anticipated that John Roberts would be somewhat more centrist than expected?Some conservatives are criticizing the Roberts pick in hindsight, but based on his pre-appointment track record, could anyone have guessed that he'd have turned out this way? Did any conservatives express misgivings at the time?
If you choose someone who really has a true judicial temperament, who appreciates the grave importance of being a Supreme Court Justice, never mind the Chief Justice, it is extremely common to find that the person becomes more centrist on the Court.  People who are too far to the left sometimes make decisions that surprise people and people who are too far to the right frequently make decisions that surprise people.  A certain amount of wisdom affects some people when they become Justices. You never really know what someone will do when he or she becomes a Justice.  Kennedy was supposed to be extremely conservative, and he has become the leader on the Court in favor of gay rights. Chief Justice Roberts is apparently not stuck on politics, but rather, focuses on what he believes to be the correct decision under the law. That is his job. People who expect a Justice of the Supreme Court to use his or her political beliefs to make decisions are misunderstanding the purpose of the Supreme Court. Those who use politics instead of using a proper judicial review of the law, are not being good Justices.
