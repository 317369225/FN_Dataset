I would agree with Hiroshi Aobayashi that Wimdu / Airizu are serious threats for Wimdu. Both are run by the Samwer brothers, who are infamous for (successfully) popular US internet companies. They have both the capital and the expertise necessary to scale quickly, and it is much easier for them to gain a foothold in European markets due to their location and access to European talent. AirBnB have already acknowledged this by sending out an email to their entire user base warning them of 'impostors', and by buying another German clone to establish their presence in Europe.
