What are use cases for Spark vs Hadoop?
Spark is amazing for in-memory and more importantly iterative computing. The key benefit it offers is caching intermediate data in-memory for better access times. Some use cases where Shark outperforms Hadoop 1. Real Time querying of data: Querying in secs rather than minutes using Shark 2. Stream processing: Fraud detection and log processing in live streams for alerts, aggregates and analysis 3. Sensor data processing: Where data is fetched and joined from multiple sources, in-memory dataset  really shine as they are easy and fast to process.        We have dealt with a lot more use cases with several companies using Shark & Spark.
