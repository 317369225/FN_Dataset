What are some topics/fields in physics that aren't traditionally taught in the undergraduate physics curriculum but are worth learning/really cool?
I love Landau and Lifschitz's Theory of Elasticity Theory of Elasticity (Volume 7 of Course of Theoretical Physics): L D Landau, E.M. Lifshitz: It's only 100 pages, but it's gorgeous and you start understanding the terminology of General Relativity better which was also developed after elasticity and was clearly influenced by it.  On a technical level, you get to see weird fourth order differential equations and rank four tensors.  Overall, it's awesome, something that isn't particularly challenging to pick up over a few weeks of concentrated study, but very illuminating.
