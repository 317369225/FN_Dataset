Linguistic Relativity: If language influences thinking, what is the "best" language to complement English?
I think the answer would really depend on what you were trying to gain from the new language. As Katrina points out, there are a number of languages that reflect various abilities developed by the people who speak them as such as particularly efficient counting systems (Mandarin), or color discrimination (Russian). However, most likely when you're looking for a complementary language you don't already know what skills or perspective it is that you're missing in your own language.Â  As a result, I suggest to look for a language as far removed from your own as possible, one that isn't in the same language family, and perhaps one where the culture is even further removed (because that will also be reflected in its language).
