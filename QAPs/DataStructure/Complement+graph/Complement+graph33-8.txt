What are some topics/fields in physics that aren't traditionally taught in the undergraduate physics curriculum but are worth learning/really cool?
A course on Modelling of Physical Systems will be great! We're never taught this in the classroom or even while we are working on our research. However, during grad school we spend most of the time developing a theoretical model of different systems. Hence, as you may be aware,Â  most of the models are fitting models, which are hard to generalize and are too obscure to predict anything new. A google search could not find me a single physics course, but I found this book which shows what I'm looking for. Page on diyhpl.us
