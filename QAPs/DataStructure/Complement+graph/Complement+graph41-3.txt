How do I solve this equation? x 3 −⌊x⌋=3 **EDIT: I also employed the same approach as many of the other people who have answered and drew a rough graph and tried some values for floor(x), but what I'm asking is, is there any general method to do this? In this question we got an answer for floor(x)=1 but the trial and error may not be easy each time.
A little trial and error. x 3 −⌊x⌋=3  rules out values greater than 2. For X = 2, LHS = 5 > RHS. Similarly, values < -1 are ruled out. Hence, the answer lies between 1 and 2. For any 1<x<2  ⌊x⌋=1  Hence, the equation reduces to X 3 =4  giving X=4  √ 3 ≈1.5874
