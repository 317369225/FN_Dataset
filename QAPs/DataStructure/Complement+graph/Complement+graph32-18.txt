Who is Airbnb's biggest competition?Who are Airbnb's largest competitors?
I run a small regional site listing just 25 properties (at Cairns Holiday Homes). We provide the one thing that none of the giants like AirBnB are able to. Customers can contact us by phone. Â  We are the neighbourhood. We have lived here in North Queensland for 30 years. We know our market and we know every property we list. We are growing fast because we provide real service and we are here to sort out any problems when guests arrive. AirBnB have done a fantastic job so far. They have stimulated the market and helped small operators like ourselves. But, as Jose Roberto has pointed out, it will be very hard for them to maintain the service that they started out with and nigh on impossible to deliver the service that is possible for much smaller regional operators to deliver.
