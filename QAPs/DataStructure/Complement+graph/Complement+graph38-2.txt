What does it mean for a US carrier to be maintaining fleet readiness?E.g. CVN 69 is "under way maintaining fleet readiness in the wake of Hurricane Irene".
The meaning of "maintaining fleet readiness" is "underway, but not deployed." It involves training, qualification and the like in preparation for a future deployment or another meaning is repair a system after damage I think that best exercise for them is ALWAYS at sea in the worse conditions. For large organizations, a plan is truly put to the test only when folks are bumping into each other in the dark, dropping things and shouting over one another.
