What are some topics/fields in physics that aren't traditionally taught in the undergraduate physics curriculum but are worth learning/really cool?
Computer Science: data structures & algorithms. You will be working with data (probably a lot of it) and you should be able to know what types of data structures and corresponding algorithms will allow for the most efficient computations. You should also take courses on compilers and OS's, but not necessary. Computational Physics: applying the CS discussed above. Advanced optics and Non-linear dynamics: as mentioned by others. Circuit design, microelectronics, ICs: tons of jobs in this area of semiconductor business.
