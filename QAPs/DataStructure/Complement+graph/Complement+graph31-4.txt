Linguistic Relativity: If language influences thinking, what is the "best" language to complement English?
Benjamin Lee Whorf formulated the idea of linguistic relativity (which the questioner references) with American Indian languages as the prime examples. From Technology Review in 1940: Whorf's best-known example was Hopi, but most Native American languages are quite different from Standard Average European on these counts. These features are common to many Native American languages, and any would be a good complement to English. The choice is likely to depend on availability in your region and other circumstances, so it would be counterproductive to limit to one. Linguistic areas of the Americas has an interesting list of features common to languages in different regions. Updated 20 Nov 2012 â€¢ View Upvotes
