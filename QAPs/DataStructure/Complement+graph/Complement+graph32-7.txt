Who is Airbnb's biggest competition?Who are Airbnb's largest competitors?
Airbnb is heading towards a monopoly in the home-sharing, alternative accommodation market. Airbnb's dominant and expanding role in the sharing economy, vacation rental and alternative accommodation markets means it's likely to target larger markets in the future. Business travel, group travel, conventions, and dare I say, hotels... I'd predict that larger online travel agents (OTAs), such as TripAdvisor/Booking.com/Agoda are likely to be true competitors in the near future.Â  Google and Facebook are competitors while seemingly being in different markets. They compete for eyeballs and access to original content. Airbnb will most likely compete with the larger OTAs for online travelers, best quality listings and overall market share of the online travel market.
