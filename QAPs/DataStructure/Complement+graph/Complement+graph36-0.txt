Will reputation systems replace grades in schools?
I would answer this question from a slightly different angle: I feel that reputation systems, and more precisely something I'm referring to as the reputation graph, could offer a strong complement to, or possibly completely replace (on a long enough time horizon), the signaling component that schools and their various by-products (degrees, GPA, etc.) offer. Some non-trivial percentage of the benefit that going to school provides is a signal to the marketplace that, to quote Stuart Smalley, you're good enough, you're smart enough and doggoneit, people like you. This benefit seems fairly small in the early grades but increases until it's a majority of the benefit, in my opinion, associated with a post-secondary degree. In a pre-Web and social graph-enabled world this probably made sense. How else could we know who was qualified for various jobs and what the "talent hierarchy" was? Obviously, people who got into Stanford were smarter and likely more productive than their community college-going counterparts. However, the world has shifted fairly dramatically in the last several years and now I think there are new ways to tease out who are the most talented and hard-working people that are dramatically more powerful and certainly more efficient than traditional education. I've outlined more of my theory on the reputation graph at the link below. This is all very theoretical at this stage but I think we're in the early innings of a dramatic sea change in education that will be shaped in large part by things like the reputation graph. http://jonbischke.com/2011/01/07...
