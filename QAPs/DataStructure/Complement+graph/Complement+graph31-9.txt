Linguistic Relativity: If language influences thinking, what is the "best" language to complement English?
English is noun-based and many Indigenous languages of North America are verb/relational based.  The way that you think about how to structure a sentence shifts as the emphasis goes from being focused on the discrete, individual object, to the object's relation to other objects. Thus, the way that you think about things shifts from focusing on the properties of the individual object in isolation to focusing on the relationships of the object in the context of the bigger picture. It's very yin and yang when you think about it. It would be sensible to learn the language of the territory which you reside on.  If you are in North America try going to firstvoices.ca and interacting with the map to find the original language spoken where you live.
