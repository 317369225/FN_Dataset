Which is better for time management: paper planners or electronic planners?
I find that sometimes the act of writing down an event helps me remember it better. Especially when it's reoccurring - i.e bills, meetings, or invoicing. Certainly for planning out ideas, projects, or blog posts - I prefer my Moleskine over my iPad any day of the week.
