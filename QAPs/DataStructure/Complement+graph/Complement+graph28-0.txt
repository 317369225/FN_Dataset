Why don't graphing calculators have secant and cosecant buttons?
The buttons on calculator should be for useful functions. Secant and cosecant are rarely used for computation.  When they are needed, one button press on the reciprocal key will give them after pressing the cosine or sine button. Sine, cosine, tangents, and their inverse functions arcsine, arccosine, and arctangent are useful for solving trigonometry problems and other problems in science, so there are buttons for sine, cosine, and tangent.  The inverse functions are accessed via the "inverse" or "second" key.  Although cosine can be found from sine by first computing the complement of the angle, that takes enough keyclicks to justify having a separate key for cosine.
