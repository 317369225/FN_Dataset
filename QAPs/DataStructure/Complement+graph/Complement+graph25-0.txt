What are the salary differences between men and women in Japan?
Men earn approximately 2 times more than women. At least, according to a 2014 study carried out by Huffington Post Japan. This study was based on the National Tax Agency's investigation results of the actual salaries of company workers in 2012, in which the average annual income of men and women combined was 4,080,000 JPY, or 39,984 USD. However, when men and women were calculated separately, men earned an average of 5,020,000 JPY (49,196 USD) while women earned only 2,680,000 JPY (26,264 USD), amounting to a whopping difference of 2,340,000 JPY or 22,932 dollars, which, divided by month, would equal to a difference of 1,911 dollars. Based solely on this data, men earn 1.87 times more than women. Annual Income per Age GroupThe following is a graph comparing the annual income of men and women by age group.  Note the income is shown in units of 10 thousands.  The difference in income becomes increasingly evident from the late 20's.  The income of women stays practically the same and starts to steadily decline at an early stage from the late 30's whereas the men's income continues to rise until the mid 50's, with the ratio being 2.27 times more than women at the very peak.  The continuously low wages of women is considered to be due to factors such as marriage, childbirth, and less opportunities for promotion.   Severe Industries for WomenNext is a graph comparing the annual income of men and women by industry: In every single industry there is a difference of at least 1 million JPY (9,800 USD) or more. The most severe industries for women are food, lodging, manufacturing, and retail, with men earning at least 2.05 times more than women.  The author believes that the fact that these industries generally tend to hire many temporary workers may be contributing to the fact that there are significant differences, supposing that the majority of temps hired are women. On the other hand infrastructure (such as gas, electricity, water), telecommunications, and research/education have the least difference, although even so men are earning at least 1.5 times more. The Past 30 Years in Japan and the U.S.The below graph shows the income trends for men and women from 1978 until 2012, or a total of 34 years.  From 1978 the salaries are consistently increasing, but from 1990 there has not been much drastic change, with a gradual decrease notable from 1997 onward.  The tendency is basically the same for women and men, but appears to be slightly more stable for women. This final graph compares the income of women in Japan and the U.S. based on how many percent of the men's income the women actually earn. The results are based on data from the United States Bureau of Labor.  In 1979 the median salary of women in the U.S. amounted to 62.3% of the salary of men.  While the trend has had it's ups and downs, by 2012 the percentage has reached 80.9%; an increase of 18.6% in a matter of 33 years. On the other hand in Japan the percentage in 1979 was 51.1% and in 2012 was 53.3%, equaling to an mere increase of only 2.2%.    Seems like Japan still has a long ways to go in regards to equal job opportunities and earnings.
