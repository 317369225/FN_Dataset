What does it mean for a US carrier to be maintaining fleet readiness?E.g. CVN 69 is "under way maintaining fleet readiness in the wake of Hurricane Irene".
Nothing much that I could add except that a rested crew is also important to combat readiness.Â  Navy operating tempos can take a heavy toll on marriages and parenting.
