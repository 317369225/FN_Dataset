What are some books which are like "How to lie with statistics", but more rigorous?
The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Tufte is an amazing book about clear communication of statistical information. Picturing the Uncertain World: How to Understand, Communicate, and Control Uncertainty through Graphical Display by Wainer has great examples about some of the most fundamental ideas in statistics and how they connect to visualization.
