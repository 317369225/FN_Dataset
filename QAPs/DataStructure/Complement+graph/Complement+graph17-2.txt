Will Google+ eventually replace Gmail or webmail?I will surely use Google+ more if it allows file sharing.
When it comes to group communication I believe social media already is very similar to webmail. Google+ and Gmail are the best example. In general there's only a difference in UI (user interface) and vocabulary between these two worlds: Send becomes Post, Contacts/Groups become Circles, Reply becomes Comment, Forward becomes Share. Although these are just a few of many features, they are the core features in everyday use. Google+'s UI is not optimal (yet) for 1-on-1 communication (think e-mail amounts). Nevertheless I regularly find myself posting/sharing to just one friend. In most cases I'm achieving the same goal as I would with an e-mail. In some cases it even outclasses the traditional e-mail. In other words, Google+ and Gmail (will) handle the same tasks in different ways. Over time this will create an undesirable, perhaps even confusing redundancy of functionality ("I have sent you an e-mail in private, in reply to that Google+ update you posted"). Why complicate things that are already complicated to the average user? Full integration seems inevitable, in the long run.
