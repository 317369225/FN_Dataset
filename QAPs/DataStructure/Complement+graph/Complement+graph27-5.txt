Could anyone have anticipated that John Roberts would be somewhat more centrist than expected?Some conservatives are criticizing the Roberts pick in hindsight, but based on his pre-appointment track record, could anyone have guessed that he'd have turned out this way? Did any conservatives express misgivings at the time?
Judges are like umpires. Umpires don’t make the rules; they apply them. The role of an umpire and a judge is critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules. But it is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire... I will remember that it’s my job to call balls and strikes and not to pitch or bat. -John Roberts at his confirmation hearing As others have said, Roberts' track record of not leaving an ideological track record up to the point of his confirmation was something that frustrated a lot of people in trying to prove/disprove that George W. Bush had nominated a stealth conservative to the Court. While I think Roberts is less conservative than others in the Court, I'm hesitant to apply the label of "centrist." Only a few years ago, his Court was trumpeted as the most conservative in decades. The conservatism of the Roberts Court also came under fire in popular culture via Boston Legal, per below: This is why I think a lot of people are were stunned by his upholding the ACA at the time, when many observers were expecting a result more in line with his then-established conservative track record. And although the Roberts Court has upheld the ACA and now affirmed the legality of same-sex marriage, keep in mind that most of Roberts' personal voting record has continued to align with conservative justices Samuel Alito and Antonin Scalia. Case in point: Not only did Roberts dissent in the recent same-sex marriage ruling, but also in United States v. Windsor, which gutted the Defense of Marriage Act.
