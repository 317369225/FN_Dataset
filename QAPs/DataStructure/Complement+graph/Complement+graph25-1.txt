What are the salary differences between men and women in Japan?
It would be really hard to know this because, quite simply, there are very few occupations (if any) in Japan that are filled by both men and women, except possibly at the very lowest salary levels. In many years of visiting customers and prospects at large Japanese engineering companies, for example, I've been introduced to hundreds of engineers and managers.   Maybe four or five of those hundreds of engineers were women and NONE of the managers were.
