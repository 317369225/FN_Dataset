Why aren't graph databases more popular?Graphs seem like a really natural way to express and query data in many domains.
I love graph problems and have been thinking about them for a long time. I am comfortable with many implementations old and new. My current favorite is Neo4j. That said I don’t think there are that many true graph problems. Sorry Neo4j, graphs maybe everywhere but I don’t need to model data as a graph very often to solve business problems. Yes I can use something like Neo4j to model hierarchical data (recursive key value pairs) but I have been doing that already in the RDBMS platforms since the 90's. Look at Facebook, not that anyone should emulate them. They might have more graph data not modeled as a graph than anyone to deliver their app.
