What is the expectation of the maximum number of connected vertices in a graph with N vertices and M randomly connected edges?
This question was answered asymptotically by Erdös and Rényi in 1960. I have actually found the paper where their results were first published. It is here: http://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/196.... Let [math]c=\dfrac{N}{M}[/math]. If [math]c > \tfrac{1}{2}[/math], then the size of the largest component of a graph is approximately [math]N\left(1-\dfrac{x(c)}{2c}\right)[/math] where [math]x(c)=\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^{k-1}}{k!} (2ce^{-2c})^k.[/math] If [math]c = \tfrac{1}{2}[/math], then the size of the largest component of a graph is of order [math]N^{2/3}[/math]. If [math]c < \tfrac{1}{2}[/math], then the size of the largest component of a graph is approximately [math]\dfrac{3\ln N}{(1-2c)^2}.[/math] So if [math]\dfrac{N}{M}[/math] is less than [math]\tfrac{1}{2}[/math], the size of the largest component is [math]O(\log N)[/math], if [math]\dfrac{N}{M}[/math] is approximately [math]\tfrac{1}{2}[/math], the size of the largest component is [math]O(N^{2/3})[/math], and if [math]\dfrac{N}{M}[/math] is greater than [math]\tfrac{1}{2}[/math], the size of the largest component is [math]O(N)[/math].
