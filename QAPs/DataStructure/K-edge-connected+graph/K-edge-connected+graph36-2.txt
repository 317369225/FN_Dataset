What is an example of a problem that can be solved with matrices but at first glance does not appear to have any relation to matrices?
Google Search. PageRank is, on its face, a complicated mechanism that defines the centrality (read: ranking in Google Search) of webpages by their weights in a stable distribution over the Markov process of the connectivity graph of the internet. But described more simply: It ranks pages by their weights in the largest-eigenvalue eigenvector of the linear operator corresponding to the matrix that represents, for each pair of pages, whether they are connected by a link. (Well, that's only simple if you have some understanding of linear algebra, I suppose...) In short, Sergei Brin and Larry Page used a freshman-year theorem about matrices (Spectral theorem -- well, linear operators, to be precise...)Â  to create the most successful search engine in the history of the world.
