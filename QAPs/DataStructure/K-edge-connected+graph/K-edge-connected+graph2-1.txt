How would I write a recursive function to count the number of simple, connected graphs with K edges and N distinctly labelled vertices?
Let's denote the function [math]f(N, K)[/math]. Now how does it depend on values of [math]f(\cdot,\cdot)[/math] with smaller arguments? Let's start with a graph of [math]N-1[/math] vertices, [math]K-k[/math] edges. How many ways can you add the [math]N[/math]-th vertex? You'll need to distribute [math]k[/math] edges between vertex [math]N[/math] and existing ones; that's [math]{N-1 \choose k}[/math]. Now you'll need to sum over all possible values of [math]k[/math]. So the formula is [math]f(N, K) = \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} {N-1 \choose k} f(N-1, K-k)[/math] provided [math]K >= N-1[/math], or [math]0[/math] otherwise.
