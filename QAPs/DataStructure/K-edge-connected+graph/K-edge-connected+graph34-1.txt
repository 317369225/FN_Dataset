What are some difficult problems with simple problem statements you have encountered in the field of competitive programming?
A read-only array of length n, with address from 1 to n inclusive, contains entries from the set {1, 2, ..., n-1}. By Dirichlet's Pigeon-Hole Principle there are one or more duplicated entries. Find a linear-time algorithm that prints a duplicated value, using only "constant extra space". (IBM Research | Ponder This | January 2004 Challenge) Given a graph with n nodes and m edges (n <= 100) find out how many different minimum spanning trees it has.
