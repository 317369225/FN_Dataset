What is a "relationship to a relationship" called in graph theory?
Are you looking for something from the theory of hypergraphs? A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph in which an edge can connect any number of vertices. Therefore, while graph edges are pairs of nodes, hyperedges are arbitrary sets of nodes, and can hence contain an arbitrary number of nodes. Formally, [math]H = (X, E)[/math] represents a hypergraph [math]H[/math] where [math]X[/math] is a set of nodes/vertices, and [math]E[/math] is a set of non-empty subsets of [math]X[/math] called hyperedges. In your case, if you are always interested in representing relationships like the one depicted in the image, then, you could potentially model all your data as a [math]k[/math]-uniform hypergraph (a hypergraph all of whose hyperedges have the same cardinality equal to [math]k[/math], with [math]k=3[/math] in your case).
