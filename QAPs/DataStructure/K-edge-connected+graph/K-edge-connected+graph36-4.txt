What is an example of a problem that can be solved with matrices but at first glance does not appear to have any relation to matrices?
Apparently Paul Dirac was very surprised when those little 4x4 matrices were needed in his derivation of the relativistic wave equation [math]\beta[/math] and [math]\alpha_x[/math] are 4x4 matrices here. The Wikipedia entry for the Dirac equation has a good description, and some juicy historical notes.
