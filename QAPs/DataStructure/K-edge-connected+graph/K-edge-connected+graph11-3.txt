Do you have a non-repetitive, exclusive quote list?
Yes and no. My “list” is a file (created on Quark) that currently runs 447 pages. There are many repeats and I refer (and add) to the list almost daily. I’m including copies of the first and second pages (which include quotes that haven’t been moved to their appropriate topics/authors). Thank you Mohan.
