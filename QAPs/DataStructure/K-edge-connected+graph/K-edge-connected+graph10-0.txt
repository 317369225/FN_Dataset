In theoretical computer science, what is considered a sparse graph?
A sparse graph is a connected graph whose number of edges is close to the minimal number of edges. The notion is vague (what does "close to" mean?) but one can make it precise. For instance, as Timothy Johnson writes, we can say that a graph is sparse if it has [math]O(n)[/math] edges where [math]n[/math] is the number of vertices. In the paper Pebble game algorithms and sparse graphs Lee and Streinu define a graph to be [math](k,l)[/math]-sparse if every nonempty subgraph with [math]n[/math] vertices has at most [math] kn âˆ’ l [/math]edges.
