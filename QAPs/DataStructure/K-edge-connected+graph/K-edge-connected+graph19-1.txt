Given a matrix with non-negative real entries, how can you algebraically prove that it has a non-negative eigenvalue?
I'm surprised that this question does not have more answers. I'm even more surprised that it only has one answer, and its proof is not algebraic! I'm going to use algebraic graph theory to prove this. Let us first associate a directed graph with the [math]n\times n[/math] non-negative matrix [math]M[/math].  Specifically, construct the graph on [math]n[/math] vertices such that there is an arrow going from vertex [math]j[/math] to vertex [math]k[/math] if and only if the entry in the [math]j^\textrm{th}[/math] row and [math]k^\textrm{th}[/math] column of [math]M[/math] is nonzero. Such a graph will end up being partitioned into several strongly connected components. A graph component is called strongly connected if, for any two arbitrary vertices [math]v[/math] and [math]w[/math] in the component, there exists a path going from [math]v[/math] to [math]w[/math]. Now the matrix [math]M[/math] is said to be irreducible if its directed graph has only one strongly connected component: itself. Otherwise it is reducible. (There are several algorithms that determine the number of strongly connected components of a directed graph in linear time.) If [math]M[/math] happens to be irreducible, then we may apply the Perron–Frobenius theorem for irreducible matrices to prove the result, namely that there is always a positive real number [math]r[/math] which is an eigenvalue of [math]M[/math]. Moreover, we would also prove (when [math]M[/math] is irreducible) that this eigenvalue is simple and its associated eigenbasis consists of just one eigenvector whose entries are positive real numbers. If [math]M[/math] is reducible, we first convert [math]M[/math] into a similar matrix [math]P^{-1}MP[/math] in upper-triangle block form. The size of each block corresponds to the size of each strongly connected graph component defined above. Moreover, each of these block matrices would either be irreducible matrices or zero matrices (if that particular graph component has no edges). Since the eigenvalues of similar matrices are equal, and the eigenvalues of an upper triangular block matrix is the union of the eigenvalues of each block, we obtain that the largest eigenvalue of [math]M[/math] is the largest of the maximum eigenvalues of each block. By applying the Perron-Frobenius Theorem for each of the irreducible blocks, we infer that each block has a positive real eigenvalue. Thus, unless all the blocks are zero matrices, [math]M[/math] will have a positive real eigenvalue, otherwise it has a zero eigenvalue (which is still non-negative). Note that this eigenvalue might now not be simple and/or its associated eigenvectors might not consist of positive real numbers.
