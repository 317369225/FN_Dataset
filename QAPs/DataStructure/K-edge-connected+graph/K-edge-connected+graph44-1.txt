Can a almost Hamiltonian cycle be a NP-complete problem?
The answer will depend on your definition for "almost Hamiltonian". Timothy Johnson gives a good answer for when we mean that there is a cycle of length n/k. A similar approach can be used if we mean a cycle of length n - k for some fixed constant k. In a different context, I have seen the notion of "Hamiltonian-Critical" to mean "Almost Hamiltonian," where a "Hamiltonian-Critical" graph is one where the graph is not actually contain a Hamiltonian cycle, but the addition of a single extra edge anywhere in the graph results in it containing a cycle. Equivalently, between any two pairs of vertices, there is a Hamiltonian path, but the graph does not contain a cycle would capture the same idea. Using this definition, identifying "Almost Hamiltonian" graphs is definitely NP-hard, but it is not expected to be in NP unless NP=co-NP (the complexity class co-NP is the class of languages such that their complement is in NP, so the language of Graphs *not* containing a Hamiltonian cycle is a language in co-NP). It is widely conjectured that NP and co-NP are not equal. To see why finding a Hamiltonian-Critical graph is in NP only if NP=co-NP, consider the language of graphs *not* containing a Hamiltonian cycle. If there is a certificate verifying Hamiltonian-Critical graphs that verifies in polynomial time (i.e., if Hamiltonian-Criticality is in NP), then starting with a non-Hamiltonian graph, keep adding edges to it until it becomes Hamiltonian-critical. You then can verify that the graph you have is a subgraph of a Hamiltonian-Critical graph in polynomial time.
