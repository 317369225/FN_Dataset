What are the best applications of linearity of expectation?
Let G be a directed graph, initially empty, on n nodes. For each node x, we independently choose a node y uniformly at random from the n nodes of the graph. With probability p, we draw a directed edge from node x to y. Then the probability that there is a cycle in G is p. To prove this, we use strong induction on n. We label the nodes 1...n. When n=1, the probability of a cycle is the probability that node 1 has an edge to itself, which is indeed p. For the inductive step, we consider the set [math]S[/math] of nodes who have an edge coming out them. Let G' be the subgraph of G consisting of the nodes in [math]S[/math] and the edges connecting them, and let [math]k = |S|[/math]. Each node in G' has a probability [math]\frac{k}{n}[/math] of having an out-edge. If [math]k < n[/math], by the inductive hypothesis, G' has a cycle with probability [math]\frac{k}{n}[/math]. If [math]k=n[/math], then the probability of a cycle is [math]\frac{k}{n}=1[/math] (any graph with n nodes and n edges has a cycle) In any case, the probability of a cycle existing is [math]\frac{k}{n}[/math], which is on average (this is where we apply linearity of expectation) [math]\frac{np}{n}=p[/math].
