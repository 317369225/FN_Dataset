What are the best applications of linearity of expectation?
One clean and simple application of the linearity of expectation (and probabilistic method) is in the proof of the following theorem by Szele (1943) : There exists a tournament, [math]T[/math] with [math]n[/math] players and [math]\frac{n!}{2^{n-1}}[/math] hamiltonian paths. It can be proven using a very simple application of the probabilistic method. Proof Take a random tournament [math]T'[/math] where we determine the outcome of each game by a flip of a fair coin (independently). Let the expected number of hamiltonian paths in this tournament be [math]X[/math]. Now for each permutation [math]\sigma[/math] of the vertices (players), define an indicator random variable [math]X_{\sigma}[/math] such that [math]X_{\sigma}=1[/math] if it forms a hamiltonian path and [math]X_{\sigma}=0[/math] otherwise. Note that the probability that a hamiltonian path is formed is simply [math]\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}[/math]. So we can conclude that [math]E[X_{\sigma}]=\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}[/math] Also, [math]X=\sum X_{\sigma}[/math] over all [math]n![/math] permutations. By the linearity of expectation, [math]E[X]=\sum E[X_{\sigma}][/math] So [math]E[X]= \frac{n!}{2^{n-1}}[/math] By the pigeonhole principle, there exists a tournament [math]T[/math] which has at least [math]E[X][/math] hamiltonian paths. And we are done.
