What is an example of a problem that can be solved with matrices but at first glance does not appear to have any relation to matrices?
Space–time block code  Hadamard matrix Hadamard codes were used to encode video data from Mariner 9. A  Hadamard matrix  consists of ones and minus ones in a square array. While dredging up this factoid, I encountered  Space–time block code which is "used wireless communications in a fading environment when using multi-element antennas" "An STBC is usually represented by a matrix. Each row represents a time slot and each column represents one antenna's transmissions over time. "
