Given a connected undirected graph with n nodes, and a rabbit that can jump from any node to another (on each turn) and a dog that can jump k nodes (one after the other) , prove that the dog can catch the rabbit?
First, here is a more formal version of the problem I'm solving: we have an arbitrary connected graph the rabbit and the dog start in arbitrary vertices the rabbit and the dog take alternating turns both the rabbit and the dog can only move along the edges the rabbit can make at most one move per turn the dog can make at most k moves per turn, where k > 1 is a given constant the dog catches the rabbit if they are in the same vertex at any moment in time In this particular setting the dog can easily catch the rabbit. Each time it's the dog's turn, the dog finds one shortest path towards the rabbit and takes k steps along the path (or fewer if it can already capture the rabbit). Hence, each time it's the dog's turn, the distance between the dog and the rabbit decreases by k. Regardless of what the rabbit does during its turn, it can only increase the distance by at most 1. As k > 1, the distance will be decreasing, and therefore it has to reach zero after finitely many iterations.
