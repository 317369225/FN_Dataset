Graph Theory:Â What's the intuition behind a Laplacian matrix?
Here are some things that are accessible from the Laplacian matrix that are not accessible from other matrices: 1) The multiplicity of its zero eigenvalue is equal to the number of components of the graph. Related to this, the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix (which will be zero if and only if the graph is disconnected) is related to the connectivity of the graph - the smaller it is, the less 'connected' the graph is. The exact sense of this connectivity is explained by Fiedler (see Algebraic connectivity.) 2) It provides interlacing properties for edges (as opposed to interlacing properties for vertices for the adjacency matrix [math]A[/math]). Essentially, for [math]A[/math], if a vertex from the graph is deleted, then the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the smaller graph interlace those of [math]A[/math], i.e. if [math]\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\geq\cdots\geq\lambda_n[/math] are the eigenvalues of [math]A[/math] and [math]\mu_1\geq \mu_2\geq\cdots\geq\mu_{n-1}[/math] are the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the vertex-deleted subgraph, then [math]\lambda_1\geq\mu_1\geq\lambda_2\geq\mu_2\geq\cdots\geq\mu_{n-1}\geq\lambda_n[/math]. The same thing holds for the Laplacian matrix, but for edges. If [math]L[/math] is the Laplacian matrix of a graph and [math]L-e[/math] is the Laplacian matrix of the same graph after an edge [math]e[/math] is removed, then the spectra of [math]L[/math] and of [math]L-e[/math] interlace. 3) The Laplacian matrix can be considered to be the Gram matrix of the incidence matrix [math]B[/math] of the graph having an arbitrary orientation. That is, if we assign an arbitrary orientation of the edges of the graph and let [math]B[/math] represent the incidence matrix of this directed graph, then [math]L=B^TB[/math]. Hope that helps.
