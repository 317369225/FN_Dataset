What are some difficult problems with simple problem statements you have encountered in the field of competitive programming?
I have a soft spot for problems where the input is a single integer. Here's one: A store sells identical boxes, and you buy them one at a time. With each box you get a set of 10 stickers: one with each of the digits 0 through 9. Each time you buy a box, you use some of the stickers you have to give it a sequential label: you put the "1" sticker on the first box, "2" on the second box, "1" and "0" on the tenth box, "3" and "3" on the thirty-third box, and so on. Obviously, the stickers you don't use on the box they came with can then be used later on other boxes. What is the first box you will not be able to label? Now suppose you get [math]k[/math] sets of 10 stickers with each box, with [math]2\leq k\leq 15[/math]. How does the answer change then? Is it always a finite number, or can you label boxes forever for some [math]k[/math]? Updated 89w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
