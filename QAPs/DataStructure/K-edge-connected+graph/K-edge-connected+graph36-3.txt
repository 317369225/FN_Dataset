What is an example of a problem that can be solved with matrices but at first glance does not appear to have any relation to matrices?
You mentioned epidemics, so here's an application of matrices to epidemics. One way to view an epidemic is to consider dissemination of information, which can be thought of in the same way as the spread of a disease. Suppose the blue dots in the diagram below represent persons. Two persons are connected by an edge if they know each other. They might be friends on Facebook, say. Now suppose the leftmost person, which we'll call Person 1, wants to advertise his new account on Quora. He or she sends the ad to all of his or her friends. These people, in turn, send this information to their respective friends, and so on. Suppose that each person forwards the information to his or her peers within a second of receiving it. In how many ways would each person receive the news in the [math]t^\textrm{th}[/math] second?   Here we're assuming that the news is sent to everyone, including to the persons that originally forwarded the news. For example, Person 1 will receive his own news four times after two seconds, because the persons he sent it to will send it to him again.   To answer this question, we first model the graph above as an adjacency matrix. I'm going to label the leftmost person as 1, the second leftmost as 2, and so on, so that the rightmost person is labelled 8.   [math]A=\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}[/math]   The [math]k^\textrm{th}[/math] entry of the first row (or column) of [math]A[/math] denotes the number of ways in which person [math]k[/math] will receive the news from person 1 in one second.   Now comes the cool part: to generalize this to [math]t[/math] seconds, just evaluate [math]A^t[/math] and do this again: the [math]k^\textrm{th}[/math] entry of the first row of [math]A^t[/math] denotes the number of ways in which person [math]k[/math] will receive the news sent originally by person 1 in the [math]t^\textrm{th}[/math] second.   But there's more! If someone else, say person [math]p[/math], decides to advertise something, the number of ways in which the [math]k^\textrm{th}[/math] person receives the news in the [math]t^\textrm{th}[/math] second after person [math]p[/math] has sent the news is the entry in the [math]k^\textrm{th}[/math] row and the [math]p^\textrm{th}[/math] column of [math]A^t[/math].
