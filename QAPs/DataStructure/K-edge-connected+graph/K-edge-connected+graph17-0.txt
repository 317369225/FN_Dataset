What are the problems which we are unable to solve due to the limits of computation?
Find Ramsay Numbers! Let (n,k) be two integers. What is the minimal size of a group of people (i.e graph) such that at least n people know each (i.e. to form a clique) or k people don't know each other at all (i.e. to form an anti-clique). For example, in the picture 1,2,5 form a clique (there is an edge connecting any two of these points) and 3,5,6 form an anticlique (you can't find an edge between any of these two points). This problem, despite being very simple to explain and to represent, is actually very hard. Even for small numbers. We don't know the Ramsay number for (5,5). Here is a quote from Joel Spencer you can find on the wikipedia page about Ramsey's theorem: Erdős asks us to imagine an alien force, vastly more powerful than us, landing on Earth and demanding the value of R(5, 5) or they will destroy our planet. In that case, he claims, we should  marshal all our computers and all our mathematicians and attempt to find  the value. But suppose, instead, that they ask for R(6, 6). In that case, he believes, we should attempt to destroy the aliens. Here is what they look like: (I can't apparently make a latex table on quora, so this is a screenshot from the wikipedia page linked above) The Ramsay number of (n,k) is the same as the one for (k,n), so I gave only the lower half. The 43-49 in the 5,5 intersection means that we know it is more than 43 and less than 49. As you can see there does not seem to be any logical progression in the numbers and it is still puzzling most of us today.
