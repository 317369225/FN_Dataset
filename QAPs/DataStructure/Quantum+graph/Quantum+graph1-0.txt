What are quantum wave guides?
Classical linear systems are characterizable using both linear algebra as well as Graphs. The Graph formalism is very useful in some problems, especially when the graph is sparse and the sparsity topology is the subject of inquiry. Quantum systems can be expressed using linear operators called Unitary matrices. Quantum wave guides are constructs in these graphs. Loosely speaking, they are a measurement of clustering. Quantum graphs are used in studying physical systems at the interface of classical and quantum. They are not, to my knowledge, related to anything pertaining directly to quantum computing, except perhaps in modeling errors and their mitigation due to decoherence.
