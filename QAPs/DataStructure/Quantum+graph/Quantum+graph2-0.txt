I am working on an idea, which relates to space time of quantum particles, understanding that there can be more than one state of a quantum particle<entangled states>, is it right to think that these particles may have their own space time graph?
As far as established physics goes, there is only one "space-time" and it is entirely classical. Quantum mechanical particles may exist in super-positions of locations, but those locations themselves are fixed coordinates shared by everything in the entire universe. Particles do not have their own "space-time graphs." There certainly are theories of physics in which space itself is quantized ("quantum gravity") and in these theories particle location would presumably be entangled with space itself. However, at this point such theories are completely unproven speculation.
