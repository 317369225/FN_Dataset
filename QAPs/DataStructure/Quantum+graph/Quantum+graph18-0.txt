Do physicists also think quantum physics weird or is it only lay people?
Not really -- most physicists don't think quantum mechanics is particularly weird. Quantum mechanics requires thinking in a different way of assessing the Universe. A lot of this is thinking about the world in a probabilistic manner -- of course the quantum mechanics isn't like ordinary probability and uncertainty, but a lot of the same mode of reasoning applies Some people find EPR-like experiments weird, but most professional physicists don't. EPR is an example of quantum entanglement. Entanglement is more difficult and there has been a lot of progress in thinking about it since the 1970s, unfortunately, quantum mechanics education hasn't progressed much since then until the past decade. So a lot of relatively young physicists think about the entanglement in a 1950s or 1960s sort of way. Most undergraduates don't find anything usual about the photoelectric effect, the hydrogen atom spectrum, the harmonic oscillator, a particle in the box. I don't know if anyone finds the two slit experiment weird who is a professional physicist. Undergraduates usually find angular momentum difficult, but that is due to mathematics, not conceptual problems.
