What would happen if my freezer temperature were absolute zero?
It seems somebody has already done it. Physicist Ulrich Schneider and his colleagues from the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich has managed to reach temperatures below absolute zero with quantum gas of potassium atoms. They have observed that the gas displayed very odd properties in negative Kelvin temperature. The properties displayed were similar to that of dark matter.
