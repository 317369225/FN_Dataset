What are some good math jokes?
Invalid techniques of proof These are some of my personal favorites! Proof by intimidation: "Trivial." Proof by vigorous handwaving: Works well in a classroom or seminar setting. Proof by funding: "How could three different government agencies be wrong?" Proof by group complaint: Often employed in classes of few students when they decide the question is too hard. Proof by accelerated course: We don't have time to prove this... Proof by pity: Used by a student who really needs to pass a course. Proof by importance: A large body of useful consequences all follow from the proposition in question. Proof by exercise: The reader is left to do the proof as an exercise. Most commonly found in textbooks. Proof by acceptance: We were asked in an exercise to prove this theorem. Hence, it must be true.
