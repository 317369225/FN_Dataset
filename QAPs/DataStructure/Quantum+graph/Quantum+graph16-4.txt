Does the fact that a reference frame has an exact position and velocity a cause a contradiction in quantum mechanics?
I must expand on this because I feel some people aren't getting the point. QM relies on the assumption that you have a perfect ruler and a perfect watch, and can measure the exact position of a point in space and the exact moment of an event. The uncertainty principle doesn't say that our rulers are bad, it says that a particle has a distribution of different positions or momenta. Trying to measure the position or momenta of identically prepared particles will yield different values of position or momentum each time we measure. If we then plot the different values of x and p that we measured and compute the variances of the samples, then the uncertainty principle will put a limit on the variances of the measurements.
