What are some good math jokes?
On bring-your-dad-to-school day, the teacher asked the students to introduce their fathers. "This is my dad. He's a doctor!" said one child. "My father drives a taxi!" said another. "My dad plays the piano in a brothel!" exclaimed a third. The teacher was horrified, and looked to the father. "Actually, I'm a mathematician, but how can you explain that to kids?" Claim: All horses are the same color. Proof: We'll prove that any set of horses all have the same color by induction on the size of the set. This is trivial if the set contains just one horse. Assume it is true for sets of [math]n[/math] horses. Suppose we have a set of [math]n+1[/math] horses, numbered [math]1, 2, ..., n, n+1[/math]. This is the union of the first [math]n[/math] horses, numbered [math]1~-~n[/math], and the last [math]n[/math] horses, numbered [math]2~-~(n+1)[/math]. These sets overlap, so there is only one color for the whole set.[math]\square[/math] This argument is due to PÃ³lya.
