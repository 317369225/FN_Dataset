What is the point of pure mathematics?
Without theoretical math, scientific and technological progression is cut off before it begins. Here is the example of how theoretical mathematics becomes practical Theoretical Mathematics: a solution to a 1 dimensional hyperbolic differential wave equation d'Alembert's equation of 1747.  Theoretical Physics: around 1860 Michael Faraday proposes that an electric field consists of waves and in 1862 James Clerk Maxwell models "Faradays Law" applying the pure mathematics developed earlier as part of the famous Maxwells equations.  So here we have ~120 years from pure mathematics to theoretical physics.  Now things progress really fast Experimental physics: Heinrich Hertz in 1886. For the Hertz radio wave transmitter Experimental Engineering: In 1894 the first laboratory transmission of an electromagnetic wave is sent and received. Commercialization: In 1896 Marconi builds the first commercial radio.So it took about 150 years from math theory to commercial application of theoretical math. You can choose from lots of examples, try atomic energy and you go back to Greeks asking fundamental questions about parallel lines. There is the example of abstract algebra.  Abstract algebra led to theoretical mathematicians inventing new kinds of Algebra.  In the 1860's George Boole working with abstract algebra produced Boolean algebra, the foundation of our digital world today.  I doubt he had any idea that his theoretical algebra work would result in your IPhone. I remember learning Euler's Beta equation in school.  No one guessed at that time that it would be the foundation of Superstring Theory. Here's the thing that everyone needs to understand: at the beginning there is no way to predict future return when and if it happens i.e., there is no way to predict a return on investment on pure mathematical research; only that we have to have it.  I will leave it at that for the economists to ponder.
