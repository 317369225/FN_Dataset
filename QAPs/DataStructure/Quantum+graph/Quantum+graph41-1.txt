Is there a lot of math in computer science?
Yes, but not in the traditional sense (i.e. calculus). Instead, you'll be using boolean logic (discrete math), set theory, graph theory, etc. If you go into computer graphics, you'll be dealing a lot with matrices and vectors, so linear algebra is very useful.
