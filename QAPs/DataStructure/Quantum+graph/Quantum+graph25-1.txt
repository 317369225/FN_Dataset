What does it feel like to be a doctor with an extremely intelligent patient?
It's great sometimes and mildly annoying sometimes. I work at a university and so I have several professors and researchers as patients. For the most part it is great because they all have done research on their conditions and so I don't have to explain much or repeat myself very often. The downside is especially when they are MDs and don't think the patient instructions apply to them. My family members tend to be the worst of these types. I had one really brilliant patient who always pushed me about removing his restrictions quickly after surgery and even when I said no, he kept doing what he wanted so I had to write detailed notes about our discussions to protect myself legally if his surgery failed (it didn't but I was worried that he would go skydiving or something crazy after surgery). The old adage about doctors being the worst patients is completely true. Updated 42w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
