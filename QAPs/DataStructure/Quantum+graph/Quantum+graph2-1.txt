I am working on an idea, which relates to space time of quantum particles, understanding that there can be more than one state of a quantum particle<entangled states>, is it right to think that these particles may have their own space time graph?
Is there no way to treat our UNiverse like a block and consider parallel universes as well as blocks and then calculate g by ds/dl where s is space-time volume and l is the length?
