What are some topics/fields in physics that aren't traditionally taught in the undergraduate physics curriculum but are worth learning/really cool?
Lots of great answers so far! Rather than discussing electives, I want to mention some topics that are so 'worth learning' that they really should be part of the standard undergraduate physics curriculum (or maybe they have been incorporated already in the many years since I have been a UG?) Numerical methods/simulations/computational physics. I think such a class should be required for undergraduates, in the same way that lab classes are required even for students who have no interest in being experimentalists.  So much of theoretical physics is done numerically these days that it is absurd that an introduction to numerical methods is omitted from the standard curriculum. More instruction in advanced optics concepts (lasers, nonlinear optics, quantum optics, Fourier optics).  Maybe other programs were different, but in mine, we didn't really study optics in depth beyond the 19th century.  My instruction about lasers was confined to a lab class which wasn't very conductive to deep understanding.   I hate to advocate for yet more required classes, but perhaps this can be folded into E&M and quantum coursework.  The non-linear optics portion, in particular, is relatively simple to introduce in 1-2 lectures in E&M class. Edit: nevermind, I think I will include an elective after all.  One problem with many physics programs is that they do a piss poor job of introducing graduates to opportunities outside of academia, such that grad school/postdoc becomes a path of least resistance.  This might be alleviated by a physics in industry elective class, possibly subspecialty-specific.  This might work best as project-based class, possibly including useful mentors and panel discussions.
