What are some good math jokes?
Math is Dirty! How Mathematicians do it: Algebraists do it in a ring, in fields, in groups. Analysts do it continuously and smoothly. Combinatorists do it as many ways as they can. Complex analysts do it between the sheets. Computer scientists do it depth-first. Cosmologists do it in the first three minutes. Galois theorists do it in a field. Geometers do it symmetrically. Graph theorists do it in four colors. Hilbert spacers do it orthogonally. Linear programmers do it with nearest neighbors. Logicians do it by choice, consistently and completely. (Logicians do it) or [not (logicians do it)]. Mathematical physicists understand the theory of how to do it, but have difficulty obtaining practical results. Pure mathematicians do it rigorously. Quantum physicists can either know how fast they do it, or where they do it, but not both. Real analysts do it almost everywhere. Statisticians probably do it. Topologists do it openly, in multiply connected domains Cantor did it diagonally. Fermat tried to do it in the margin, but couldn’t fit it in. Galois did it the night before. Mobius always does it on the same side. Markov does it in chains. Newton did it standing on the shoulders of giants. Turing did it but couldn't decide if he’d finished. When Cauchy did it, the distance became less than epsilon. Godel did it but incompletely.
