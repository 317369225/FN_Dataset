How is a quantum computer programmed?
Some of the questions you ask as they relate to D-Wave are answered D-Wave's dev tutorial, particularly their software tutorial. You can program in MATLAB, SirQL (an extension to SQL), Python, and soon C++. This is compiled down to custom machine code in a process not detailed in their public tutorial. Sadly, you need a developer account with them to access all of this. As for how the code looks, it looks pretty normal. You construct a special data structure, call into one of their custom library functions, and out pops your answer. The strangeness of quantum computing is abstracted away. For a general quantum computer (which doesn't exist yet) you'd need similar functionality built into the instruction set of the processor. The rough details of how to interact with a quantum circuit are given here. Once that's done you can buildÂ  those into an assembly language. Only after that's done will you see higher level languages begin to support quantum computation.
