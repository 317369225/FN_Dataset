Does the fact that a reference frame has an exact position and velocity a cause a contradiction in quantum mechanics?
Let's first ask the question, "How is the position of a particle determined?" We find that it is determined by the center of mass of a body because body has its own dimensions, whereas the position is approximated by a dimensionless point. As the mass increases the center of mass gets more "centered" because the body is harder to move. On the same basis, as the mass decreasesÂ  the center of mass gets less "centered". The physical location of a body is determined by the "centered-ness" of the COM. When it comes to a photon there is no mass and no "centered-ness" of COM, and therefore no physical location that can be approximated by a point. The inertia transitions from mass to frequency of the photon. If there is a "center of frequency" (COF) it is spread out like a wave-packet. Thus, the physical location of a photon is spread out and it cannot be approximated as a mathematical point. Point is an element of Euclidean geometry that fails to describe the position of a photon. A new geometry is needed. Position cannot be thought of as a point when it comes to photons.
