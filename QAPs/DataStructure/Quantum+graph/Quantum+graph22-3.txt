Are there any real reasons to be excited about quantum computing?
Let me take a shot, have any of your family/friends died because of cancer. You obviously know about Cancer. I'm sorry, in just trying to defend a field that is basically my life right now. What protein folding basically translates into is a cure for Cancer. I had no hope for dwave 1, but dwave 2X looks promising. You said simulation is not very useful, have you heard of poverty? It is a problem that is plaguing our world right now. With Quantum simulation you can make economic models to eliminate poverty. Quantum Computing completely redefines computational complexity, we still don't know the relationship between BQP and NP. And for all we know BQP can be a superset of PSPACE. Hope this helps! PS Sorry if it hurt your feelings
