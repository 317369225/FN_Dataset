What would happen if my freezer temperature were absolute zero?
The path to getting to 0 K is absolutely fascinating because, quantum effects could be seen on a macro scale. Say you've managed to trap some light (i.e photons) and some electron gas. Or for that matter any integral spin particle and a spin 1/2 particle. They're called Bosons and Fermions respectively. Both these follow different statistics, i.e the probability that a certain particle would be in a given energy range for a given temperature. Now this is where it gets interesting. The Fermi-Dirac graph: Now observe as the temperature decreases, the curve becomes sharper and is a box function at T=0K. The Bose-Einstein Graph: The Tc mentioned here is the critical temperature at which formation of a condensate starts. As we see from both graphs, we don't get the peaking phenomenon in fermions, because of the Pauli Exclusion principle ( Yeah the same one we used in school to fill up the shells). It says that no two spin 1/2 particles with the same energy can occupy the same state. So in conclusion, bosons would form a condensate and as we approach 0 K it's energy would approach the ground state energy. However, fermions would behave differently. At 0 K there would be a significant amount of energy. The reason being Pauli's exclusion principle. There would hence, be an outward pressure exerted. It's called degeneracy pressure. It's also the reason why massive stars do not collapse under gravity. So yeah if you do manage to get a freezer that would go to 0 K, we would be able to push the BEC results so far to the limits and also study how massive stars behave. All this in your own kitchen. Imagine !
