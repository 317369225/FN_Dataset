What is Lattice cryptography?
Lattice cryptography is one of the latest developments in theoretical cryptography. A lattice in this context is like a grid of graph paper.  You start with a set of vectors, and you can add and subtract them in any integer multiples.  The hard problem is finding points in the lattice which are close to 0 or close to some other point.  These problems are really easy in 2 dimensions, but very hard in, say, 400 dimensions. Lattice cryptography is interesting for a few reasons.  For one thing, nobody knows how to break it with a quantum computer, which would be pretty important if anyone knew how to build a quantum computer. But the more interesting property of lattices is that you can create a lattice with interesting algebraic structure.  This enables cryptographers to create cryptosystems that can do things which were previously impossible.  The most notable example of this is Craig Gentry's "doubly homomorphic" encryption, where you can compute (very slowly) on encrypted data without decrypting it. Lattice crypto tends to be fast, but the public keys are also enormous.  Also, last I heard (several years ago), it wasn't entirely clear how many bits worth of security you get for a key of a given size.  Edit: per William Whyte's answer, there are improvements which reduce key size.  While security estimates are improving, they remain difficult. Another aspect where lattice crypto is different from factoring or elliptic curves is that lattice problems tend not to be generic or randomly self-reducible.  This means that lattice cryptosystems tend to have lots of very technical details in them.  (This is part of why Craig Gentry is so good at lattices, by the way.  In addition to being brilliant, he's better at juggling technical details than probably anyone else I know.)
