What does the word "topological" mean in your field of research?
Well, I do a few different things, but... Generally it refers to properties of the spaces involved which are preserved under topological morphisms. When I'm doing algebraic geometry, the topological adjective comes in when looking at geometric properties of schemes. When I'm doing category theory, the topological adjective comes in when looking at categories which have grothendeick topologies, which are an axiomization of the properties of the category of open sets. When I'm (attempting) TDA, the adjective refers to the underlying topology associated to the space which yields the Cech or Rips complexes. And so on...
