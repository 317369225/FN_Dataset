What is the fundamental difference between a classical bit and a quantum bit?
A Quantum Bit or a Qubit, is the smallest unit of quantum information, analogous to the bit, in classical computers. A qubit will have 2 states, that represent its 2 different configurations. For a classical bit, information is the bit being in either one of those configurations. But a qubit is in a superposition of both states and hence can take all values in between. Say 0 and 1 are the 2 states, then S = a1 |0> + a2 |1> , where S is the state of the qubit and summation of |an| squared equals 1. For a classical system, S =0 OR 1.
