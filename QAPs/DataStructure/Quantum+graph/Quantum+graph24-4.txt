What are some topics/fields in physics that aren't traditionally taught in the undergraduate physics curriculum but are worth learning/really cool?
Hydrodynamics/Aerodynamics.Â  Phase shift, Ising models and percolation. General relativity (I'm not sure how often it's taught in undergrad but when it is, students are often woefully unprepared mathematically).
