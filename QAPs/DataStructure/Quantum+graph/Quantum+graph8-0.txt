What mathematics do I have to study for theoretical computer science?
Your choices of maths courses make sense. Mathematical logic and algebra are also very useful in computer science. There are lots of ideas for first-year projects in theoretical computer science out there. Two topics that come to mind are Scheduling problems. These are important in many settings â€“ in operating systems but also when, say, making plans for a music festival with several stages. Here you could see interesting applications of graph theory but also of some of the other maths courses. Recurrence equations. They arise naturally in the complexity analysis of recursive algorithms. Sometimes you can solve them exactly and obtain a closed form. But there are also times when this gets challenging!All you need to do now (!) is to find an interesting problem worth solving.
