What does it feel like to be a doctor with an extremely intelligent patient?
The question only makes sense if you assume intelligent patients come in a single type.  That's not the case.  There are many other variables.  Many intelligent people have no clue outside their area of expertise. In medicine, we're talking about their body possibly going off the rails, so all careful, disinterested, reasonable thought goes out the window.  People either assume the worst or blow off symptoms.  So it isn't intelligence, but wisdom that allows many people, even - or especially - unintelligent ones, to partner with their doctor.  As an aside, this is exactly the sort of attitude I strive for when I'm a patient. There are other variables at play.  Wisdom is a big one, but think about variations in stoicism, honesty, anxiety, risk tolerance, and cultural/socioeconomics.  On these differences, I have met many smart people and have been struck with the intelligence of humans outside high paying professions, as well as the idiocy of otherwise smart people.  But that doesn't matter as much as you think it does.  The patients who make me feel like I can help (because I have better odds of helping them) have wisdom.
