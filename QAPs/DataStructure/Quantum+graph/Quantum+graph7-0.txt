On a quantum computer, how does the full stack required to calculate 1+1 look like?
You can compute c = a+b within universal quantum computation. In particular, the quantum circuit model offers a simple approach to implementing these ideas as conventional reversible circuits can be mapped to their quantum counterparts. There are numerous reversible circuits for addition. A comment on the original question linked to a paper by Draper describing a circuit developed along these lines and then an extendsion to leverage the quantum Fourier transform, cf. [quant-ph/0008033] Addition on a Quantum Computer. The graph below is clipped from the Draper publication. Each vertical box (carry or sum) has a simple circuit implementation and this particular 3-bit circuit would be sufficient for the 1+1 instance you inquired about.Â  A more sophisticated ripple-carry adder has been reported in [quant-ph/0410184] A new quantum ripple-carry addition circuit However, this circuit only represents the high-level logic employed in the design of addition. The 'stack' will ultimately be both hardware (technology) and software (compiler) dependent.
