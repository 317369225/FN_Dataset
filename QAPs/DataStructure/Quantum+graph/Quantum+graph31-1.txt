If complex numbers are just imaginary and an assumption, why are they necessary to solve other problems?
"Imaginary" is just a name. Don't be confused by it, and don't take it literally. It doesn't have any deep philosophical consequences. The fact that they are called "imaginary" doesn't mean you cannot use them to describe reality. The mathematical models we use in physics make use of imaginary numbers, or more precisely, complex numbers, all the time. In fact, we sometimes use even "less real" numbers such as quaternions and octonions. The only place where you absolutely cannot use imaginary/complex numbers is when describing the result of a measurement. This is because quantities like "[math]2i[/math] meters" or "[math]7-4i[/math] seconds" don't really make sense.
