Which are the 10 algorithms every computer science student must implement at least once in life?
Don't have a list of 10 algorithms, but 7 algorithms that every programmer should know. The first 2 in the list are Sorting and Searching algorithms, which in themselves have many algorithms that should be known, so the list actually goes beyond just 10. Sorting Algorithms Searching Algorithms Hashing Dynamic Programming Binary Exponentiation String matching and parsing Primality TestingThese topics have been taken from this blog post (Top 7 algorithms and DS every programmer should know) that covers all of these topics in detail.
