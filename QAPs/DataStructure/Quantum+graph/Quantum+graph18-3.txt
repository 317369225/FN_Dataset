Do physicists also think quantum physics weird or is it only lay people?
I am not a physicist but from listening to a few of them and reading some of their writings I don't think they spend much time thinking about deeper meanings. I think in most cases professional physicists concern themselves with developing mathematical models that describe their observations and allow them to predict the behaviour of systems. To them understanding QM means understanding the equations. I have also heard from and read other physicists who do think more about the deeper meanings and about the philosophy that underpins modern science. Usually they can only publish the ideas they have as opinion pieces because they do not fit with the content of most journals. An example from Carlo Rovelli is here: A Theoretical Physicist Explains Why Science Is Not About Certainty So I would say the majority of working physicist probably do not see anything weird about QM because they simply ignore the weirdness, shut up about it if they do notice it, and busy themselves with calculations and experiments. I would also say that the few who do notice the weirdness find it very weird indeed and seem to struggle to find a way of looking at the world that might resolve some of the weirdness. I feel I should repeat that I am not a physicist myself and that my comments are based on casual observations of the few physicists I have had the opportunity to meet or to read the writings of. The conclusion I came to are entirely my own and other people are quite likely to disagree with them.
