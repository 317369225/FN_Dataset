What does it feel like to be a doctor with an extremely intelligent patient?
If you know your subject well enough you can talk about it for hours, it’s really fun for the doctor. It’s like teaching a class of really bright students.   But if the conversation turns toward an area where your knowledge is thin (which is most of medicine for EVERY doctor—since no doctor can know most of medicine very deeply) then it gets hard. You end up having to PubMed things in front of the patient (no shame in this—it’s like washing your hands in front of the patient) and you send them out the door with references and guesses and referrals to specialists. You explain about Cochrane, evidence-based medicine, best-practice recommendation reviews, and you sweat.   At a Caltech party many years ago I had Murray Gell-Mann ask me what the risk graph looked like between coronary artery disease and total cholesterol level. I had some idea of this from the China Study and others, so I drew it out for him, with the plateau and no risk decrease below 150 mg/dl. Then he asked if there was a known FUNCTION for the graph. I said I didn’t think so—it was entirely empiric. He said medicine didn’t really know much about their subject *quantitatively*, did it?  I said, “Er, well, it’s not quantum chromodynamics.”  This did not even rate a smile. Soon after, he wandered off in search of somebody else’s brain to drain. I was empty.   Now, I figured that one was almost a draw because it was a party in a pre-internet world, and I even knew the phrase quantum chromodynamics. But probably I overrate myself. A patient like Gell-Mann or Feynman I imagine would really make a doctor humble if they needed a lesson in humility. I can imagine that some of the doctor stories Feynman tells in his little storybook (Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!) probably happened (more or less). Updated 57w ago • View Upvotes
