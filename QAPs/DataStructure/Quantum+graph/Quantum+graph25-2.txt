What does it feel like to be a doctor with an extremely intelligent patient?
I love working with all my patients, but it is easier to work with intelligent people for two main reasons. The first one is that it is easier to explain the ins and outs of an illness to an intelligent person. The second is that intelligent people are usually not arrogant and understand that the little knowledge they could have acquired of medicine is no reason not to trust their doctor. The worst trait in a patient is instead arrogance. It is very difficult for any professional to work with an arrogant person.
