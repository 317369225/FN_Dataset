What would happen if my freezer temperature were absolute zero?
As temperature approaches absolute zero, matter approaches a classification of matter called Bose-Einstein Condensate. Basically, at absolute zero, atoms cease vibrations, thus the whole object kind of begins to behave as one single atom. So essentially, to answer your question, all the matter inside your freezer would contain atoms which no longer vibrate, and this state is very unstable, i.e. it's very hard to maintain. Another cool thing that happens at absolute zero is that some materials gain the ability to super-conduct (conduct without any resistance).
