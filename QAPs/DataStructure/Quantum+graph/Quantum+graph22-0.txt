Are there any real reasons to be excited about quantum computing?
Were there any real reasons for average people to get excited about classical computers? These were machines that used to cost millions of dollars to build and operate. Even though we knew all there was to know about Shannon entropy, watching episodes of "How I Met Your Mother" was probably not on the list of potential applications. With quantum computers, we don't even know what they're good at, even in theory (generally it is thought entanglement is the property that gives them an edge over classical computers, but at least some algorithms that heavily rely on entanglement turned out to have efficient classical counterparts). That said, if we limit ourselves to commercially-available quantum computers (in other words, D-Wave), here's a list of areas where they might be useful: Classification Machine Learning Graph Theory Artificial Neuronal Networks Protein folding Space explorationList stolen from a paper co-authored by Hadayat Seddiqi ([1309.3575] An Integrated Programming and Development Environment for Adiabatic Quantum Optimization). The "space exploration" thing mentioned on [1204.2821] A Near-Term Quantum Computing Approach for Hard Computational Problems in Space Exploration. Keep in mind the D-Wave machine is a subtype of a type of quantum computer! It's actually relatively "special purpose", in that it solves only Adiabatic Quantum Optimization problems. It's not a universal computer. And still has all that potential!
