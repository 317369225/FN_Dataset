Do physicists also think quantum physics weird or is it only lay people?
Niels Bohr, said, “Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood a single word.” Richard Feynman said, “It is safe to say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.” John Wheeler, Feynman’s mentor, also a key player in the way quantum physics developed, said, “If you are not completely confused by quantum mechanics, you do not understand it.” Roger Penrose, one of the leading modern-day thinkers on the meaning of quantum physics, wrote, “Quantum mechanics makes absolutely no sense.” The preceding is a quote from a book that I wrote that will be published next year, with the title "Now-the Physics of Time."  Please forgive me for referring to my own book, but I think the quote directly answers your question.
