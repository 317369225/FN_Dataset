What is quantum artificial intelligence?
There are a small number of groups that are working in this area. You have the Canadian company, D-Wave Systems, who have claimed to have built a quantum computer that uses a process similar to simulated annealing (i.e. quantum annealing) to solve various optimization problems. They have sold a few machines most notably to Lockheed Martin, Google/NASA, and a few others. There is some debate as to weather their machine is a actually a quantum machine given that it works well for some problems and not so well for others. Google was working very closely with D-Wave Systems, when they joined forces with UC Santa Barbra's Quantum Computing group. Now Google is starting to make their own chips: http://www.extremetech.com/extre.... I guess they didn't buy into D-Wave's vision. Google has a G+ account, Google Quantum A.I. Lab, that you can watch for topics they post on the subject:Â  https://plus.google.com/+Quantum...
