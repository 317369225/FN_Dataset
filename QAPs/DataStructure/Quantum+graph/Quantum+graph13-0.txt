What is the fundamental difference between a classical bit and a quantum bit?
I wrote an answer for this question which I will quote here since it might be useful if you know a bit of quantum mechanics: What is the relation between quantum computing and quantum mechanics? If you aren't too familiar with quantum mechanics, read the next paragraph, otherwise you can jump straight to the quoted section. Take an electron and it will have some intrinsic spin that could be in two possible states, either up or down. In quantum mechanics, after every measurement it will be only one or the other. Before the measurement however, it can be in any state that is a superposition of up or down. In mathematical notation, you can take your overall states [math]|\psi\rangle[/math] and describe it like [math]|\psi\rangle = a|\uparrow \rangle + b|\downarrow \rangle[/math], where the coefficients [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] are complex numbers. They are called probability amplitudes, and to get from these amplitudes to actual probabilities, you need to take the modulus squared, i.e. [math]P_{|\uparrow\rangle} = |a|^2 = aa^*[/math], where [math]P_k[/math] is the probability of being in the [math]k[/math]th state and [math]s^*[/math] means the complex conjugate (that is, if you had [math]s = x + iy[/math], then [math]s^* = x - iy[/math]). As in normal probability, [math] |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1[/math]. And now the answer to What is the relation between quantum computing and quantum mechanics? It's actually quite simple. The information for a qubit in some particle will be its spin state. In quantum mechanics, spin is no different than position, velocity, energy, etc. That is, you can't know what state it is in exactly because it's in a superposition of states. It's related somewhat to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Take a look at this graph: In this diagram, we're using the z-axis as our measurement basis. So the vector [math]\left|\psi\right\rangle[/math] has some polar angle [math]\theta[/math], and its projection onto the z-axis is what we'll see (since we'll be measuring according to the z-basis). But of course, as you can see, it's not fully in the zero or one state, it's partially in both. When you measure, though, it will pick one or the other. [clipped] So after going through all this trouble, we understand qubits a little bit. The key reason why we like qubits better (in some cases) than classical bits is clear when we look at a two-qubit system. Remember the notation we used above. [math]|\psi\rangle = a|\uparrow\uparrow\rangle + b|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle + c|\downarrow\uparrow\rangle + d|\downarrow\downarrow\rangle[/math] How did we get four possible states? The overall state can be in any possible configuration (in fact, it is in all these possible configurations, with some probability). Another way to say this is that [math]|\psi\rangle[/math], the state vector, lives in an [math]n[/math]-dimensional space. The state vector tells you "how much" you are in a certain state. A simple way of visualizing the state vector is given by the Bloch sphere, which is the image I used above in the quoted section. With qubits, you have two possible states, so you can see that the number of possible states with [math]k[/math] qubits gives you a state vector that lives in a space with dimension [math]n = 2^k[/math]. And this is why qubits are so powerful. Using entangled qubits allows us an exponentially large computational space (Hilbert space) to represent and manipulate information. [*] How exactly to use that space to do things is not easy to understand, and unfortunately I don't know of any algorithms that are clear enough to explain to the layman. Personally, I have to think pretty hard about quantum algorithms. If I can come up with anything, I will add it to this post. Alternatively, if anyone else has ideas, please feel free to suggest in the comments or edit this section. [*] Now this is not "wrong" to say to an introductory person in quantum information, but it's still a bit of an open question whether entanglement is the whole story for quantum speedup. There are some models, like the one-clean-qubit model, that only require one pure-state qubit and a host of other qubits that are not entangled. It is not a universal quantum computer, but it is believed to be more powerful than classical computers. Updated 82w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
