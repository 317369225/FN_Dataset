How promising is Wen's string nets theory as an explanation of U(1) and SU(3) gauge bosons, leptons and quarks?
I assume you are referring to the model discussed in the 2004 paper String-net condensation: A physical mechanism for topological phases by Levin and Wen. In the paper, they show that string-net condensation (no relation to string theory!) allows for "emergent" bosons and fermions in condensed matter systems. This model is of great interest to people studying condensed matter, but it is of little interest to people working on particle physics and quantum gravity. The bosons and fermions that "emerge" in condensed matter systems are not the fundamental (elementary) bosons and fermions studied in particle physics; there has to be some already existing physical system for them to emerge from. That already existing system might be spacetime itself, though, which will then make the emergent particles fundamental. The 2006 paper Quantum Graphity by Konopka, Markopoulou and Smolin described a new model of spacetime as a graph (i.e. a collection of discrete points connected by edges). This is similar to the spin networks used in loop quantum gravity, but not the same. They also suggested in that a somewhat similar mechanism to the Levin-Wen model might give rise to [math]U(1)[/math] gauge bosons (photons) coupled to matter. (See also Quantum Graphity: a model of emergent locality.) The quantum graphity model is still a work in progress.
