If complex numbers are just imaginary and an assumption, why are they necessary to solve other problems?
Truly speaking all numbers, or for that matter, all of mathematical theory is imaginary. But one must appreciate that the mind operates on an abstract level. And mathematical concepts act as an aid to these abstract processes. As an example, whenever you're referring to the number 5, what you're really referring to are 5 oranges or 5 litres of water, but when you're operating on it, the fact that its oranges is irrelevant and does not contribute to the result. The number "5" is important. Therefore, an abstract mathematical concept has come to aid a process of decision making which will have very physical manifestations. Questions such as one asked here generally arise from unfamiliarity of the very real and concrete uses of complex numbers and complex analysis. While one is very readily able to accept the idea of 2+2=4 since it is used much too often in daily life; one might not appreciate (2+4i)(3+2i)=(-2+16i) as much since most people have never really used it in their daily life. But if you think of it, the number 2 is as much imaginary as [math]\sqrt{-1}[/math].
