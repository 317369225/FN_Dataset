Does the fact that a reference frame has an exact position and velocity a cause a contradiction in quantum mechanics?
Ultimately, any physical observable is not between a particle and a reference frame, but between two (or (more likely) many more) particles, each of which is obeys the laws of quantum mechanics (actually, together they do).   You never measure the the velocity between a particle and some abstract reference frame -- that would violate (Galilean and Special) relativity.   As such, you don't directly measure the uncertainty in position or momentum directly, but you much deconvolve it.   If one of the particles (or systems) is very big, then the uncertainty in its position is naturally very small: [math] \delta x\, \delta v \le \frac{ \hbar}{2 m}[/math] Notice that as the mass becomes infinitely heavy there is no uncertainty in the velocity or position.  But this is just a special case. Basically, if you set up a real system and calculate, there is rarely confusion in what the predictions should be.  It only is confusing if you talk in nebulous terms and take derived relations (like the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) as the starting point.
