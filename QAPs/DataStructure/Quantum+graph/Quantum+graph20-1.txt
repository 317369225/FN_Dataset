While string theory has not been proven, what are the theories or equations which were resolved by it?
String Theory is more or less believed to be a consistent theory that combines General Relativity with Quantum Mechanics.  So far there are no other frameworks that do this.   Over the past decade, it's been realized that String Theory is not a single theory, but instead produces a vast array of theories that are unified under one framework.   The procedure for experimentally confirming String Theory most likely is beyond the range of human buildable experiments, so this means that we should not think about String Theory as a theory we will explicitly confirm, but instead as a framework where we can derive constraints from that we can interpret as constraints that Quantum Gravity imposes upon the theory. More generally, String Theory provides a sufficiently diverse set of theories that it can even be used to describe theories of matter such as superconductors.  Its methods allow for ways of computing in novel ways and can give insights that wouldn't otherwise be readily accessible.
