What is quantum artificial intelligence?
The only sensible definition is that it applies tools from quantum information to invent algorithms for solving problems in artificial intelligence. The QuAIL group that you reference has a special type of quantum computer that solves one (NP-hard) problem: the Ising model, or equivalently the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. Then, you can try to map some optimization problem in your AI application to an Ising graph and hopefully see some increase in performance. There are more complicated strategies, but this is the basic research pipeline.
