What are current research areas/problems in Theoretical Computer Science?
In terms of a theoretical computer science area which is popular today, I would suggest Streaming algorithms. These are algorithms which see the input as a sequence of items which can be examined in only a few passes (preferably one). Additionally, the available working memory for such an algorithm is low compared to the size of the input. This model of computation has been motivated by the increase of data available for processing. The first papers appeared in the eighties. A more recent and 'hot' subfield is represented by graph streaming algorithms. These are algorithms which process a graph on an edge by edge basis, and have a working memory which is significantly less than the number of edges in the graph. Problems which are easy to solve using offline computation (such as single-source shortest paths) suddenly become very hard to do with a single pass streaming algorithm. For example, Twitter follows or Facebook friends can be modeled as a graph in which the vertices are users and the edges are follow or add friend relations. A good introduction to streaming and graph streaming algorithms can be found in [1]. [1] http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~denis/n...
