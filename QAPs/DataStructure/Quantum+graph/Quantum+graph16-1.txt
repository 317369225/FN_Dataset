Does the fact that a reference frame has an exact position and velocity a cause a contradiction in quantum mechanics?
There is really no contradiction at all. The reference frame is not a quantum mechanical object, and thus it does not have to obey quantum mechanics. If you somehow attached the reference frame to a quantum particle you have to take Heissenbergs inequality into account, but I don't know if that would be usefull. What the uncertainty principle really states, is just a manifestation of the non-commutity of the momentum and position operators, that comes with quantum mechanics, i.e. the order in which you measure the two quantities. Your reference frame is just something you define (you can think of it as a basis for your vectorspace if that helps you) so that you can quantify your measurements. Feel free to comment if you need any clarifications.
