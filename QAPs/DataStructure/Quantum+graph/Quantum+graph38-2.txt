What is the most controversial topic in physics?
I would say this is possibly the most controversial topic in physics: Page on arxiv.org This is a paper detailing an experiment in quantum entanglement demonstrating that entangled particles appear to be sharing information with eachother at a rate of at least 10,000 times the speed of light. I'm honestly surprised it hasn't gotten more press, even if it has since turned out to be a faulty experiment, or faulty interpretation (I'm honestly not sure if it has or not, I haven't been keeping up with it since the paper was published). Short of more information, I imagine it's been glossed over... Like "this is too much of a wtf to be dealt with at this time" kind of glossed over. If you know anything at all about physics, you'd know that a transmission speed that fast would result in frames of reference in which the cause appears to occur after the effect. If you know a bit more, it means a space-like four momentum as opposed to the usual time-like four momentum... Tachyons implied? Maybe?
