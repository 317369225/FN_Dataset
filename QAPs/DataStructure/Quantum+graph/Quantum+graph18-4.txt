Do physicists also think quantum physics weird or is it only lay people?
Yes, quantum mechanics is weird.  I don't know any physicist who denies this.  When you read the biographies of great physicists: Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Feynman they all find these phenomena mysterious.  But, these phenomena are very real.  At least with mathematics, physicists can model nature and provide an incredible accurate description of these weird events. This weirdness is not only in quantum mechanics, also relativity is weird but in other ways and less complex.  Even in classical mechanics physicists never accepted the obviousness of actions at distance, or ultimate sources of inertia.  It is your task as a scientist to wonder and to model. As humans we have with mathematics the power to reason about things we can't fit in our brains. With 1200 cubic centimeter of brain we can reason about the universe, which is obviously much larger. The mystery is natural, the model is our power. Updated 10w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Gabriel Silva
