Is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle about existence or observation?
Initially, it was understood as an epistemic limit -- a limit on how much we could know given the means by which observations occur.  From a strictly positivist perspective, we can't speak about metaphysics except insofar as we can test predictions, so the distinction was thought of as irrelevant.  Later, a variety of different lines of evidence supported the idea that an unmeasurable (or unmeasured) quantum-level system simultaneously occupies all possible values within the range of uncertainty, suggesting that it is not merely epistemic but ontological.  For example, Bell's theorem suggests that in certain situations, it is not reasonable to assume that a measured value existed as a local (but hidden) property prior to measurement.
