What are current research areas/problems in Theoretical Computer Science?
Major unsolved problems in theoretical computer science: P = NP? The existence of one-way functions Is Graph Isomorphism in P? Can multiplication of n by n matrices be done in O(n^2) operations? Is Factoring in P? P = BPP? Can we compute the FFT in much less than O(n logn) time? Is there a logic that captures PTIME? NP = coNP? BQP = P? AÂ  linear time deterministic algorithm for the minimum spanning tree problem. Is there a Quantum PCP theorem? ....
