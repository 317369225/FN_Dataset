Is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle about existence or observation?
It is about existence. The use of the term "observation" in this context means any interaction between two particles, not a human observer as most laymen tend to think. The very fact that an interaction results in an exact position being relevant to the interaction, means that the momentum is uncertain in relation to that same interaction. It's just that from our grandiose viewpoint as intelligent observers, we don't really think that interactions have importance unless they are known to higher-order beings, like us.
