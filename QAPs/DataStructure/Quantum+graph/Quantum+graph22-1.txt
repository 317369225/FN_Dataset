Are there any real reasons to be excited about quantum computing?
I am amazed at how breaking of RSA encryption does not sound exciting to you. It essentially implies breaking down of entire security of present day internet. I would like to highlight that as of now 'Quantum Computing' finds no applications that the average person would find useful. However it does offer a significant speedup over classical computation in a subset of problems which can be exploited for various purposes. Some of the famous algorithms include : 1. Shor's algorithm 2. Grover's algorithm One of the most significant areas in which Quantum Computing will have an impact relatable to the "average person" would be Cryptography. Please read the following answer for an elaborate list of algorithms and their corresponding speedups : Allan Steinhardt's answer to What can you do with a quantum computer? Apart from all this, Quantum Computing plays a small role in determining whether 'Quantum Mechanics' is the ultimate theory or are there better theories. One of the famous alternative is the Bohmian Theory. You can read the following if interested : Why I'm Not a Bohmist To sum it up, we potentially have something that can do what the Classical computer cannot. This is in itself a real reason for excitement and motivates us to discover areas and problems where we can do better.
