While string theory has not been proven, what are the theories or equations which were resolved by it?
Let me try to keep it simple (and apologies for butchering terminology). You can broadly divide math into two types.  Continuous math (think waves) and discrete math (think triangles and knots).  Most of physics takes place in a "continuous world" (i.e. image a wave going through space).  At the same time, there are a lot of specific math results that are based on "discrete objects."  For example, in three dimensions, you can only have five shapes in which the number of vertices and the number of sides are equal. The trouble is that there is no obvious way of connecting mathematical proofs involving discrete objects with "continuous physics."  String theory provides a way of doing this.  If you imagine that at the sub-particle level, the world consists of strings, then there are only a certain number of ways that these strings can interact (i.e. there are only so many ways of tying a knot).  At this point you use all of the mathematical knowledge that you have about geometry, and the hope is that connects with "continuous physics." As far as why string theory is hard..... Imagine tying a knot.  OK, now explain why tying a knot looks like to someone that is blind.  Now imagine a knot, and pull on the edges of the knot.  Sometimes the knot will get tighter, sometimes it will get looser.  Now imagine explaining that to someone that is blind. The thing about string theory is that it basically involves the interaction of mathematical objects.  Some mathematicians are gifted enough so that they can "see" how those objects behave, but for the rest of us (including me), understanding how those mathematical objects behave is like trying to visualize a knot if you are blind.
