How is a quantum computer programmed?
If you have experience with conventional von Neumann computers, surprise! Programming a quantum computer is more like setting up a circuit simulation a la Spice than writing code.  Programming Your Quantum Computer, a article in the American Scientist (Jan-Feb 2014 issue) explains that reversibility considerations, inherent in quantum computing demands the use of Stovepipe Architecture in which the information is piped straight through.  The programming process will resemble Electronic design automation.  The article suggests that the quantum computer will be an adjunct to a more usual computer, only serving to process portions of a problem for which it is better suited. QCL - A Programming Language for Quantum Computers looks worth exploring for hands on experience with how Quantum Computer programming works. Also: Page on tuwien.ac.at
