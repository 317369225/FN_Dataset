What are examples of basic research with the biggest real-world impact within 20 years?
I'm not sure this can be called "basic" research, but nonetheless it's very modern. Two important algorithms researched that I can think of, which prompted more focus on quantum algorithms is the Grover search and Shor's algorithm. I won't write out how they function exactly on quora, although essentially Grover functions as a dispersion/walk type algorithm which searches for objects within a list, while Shor's uses number theory techniques to weed out certain roots in modular arithmetic. Since then, both are very useful if simulated quantum mechanically, since both speed up many processes with cryptography, day to day search, etc.Â  This also prompted more interesting research using quantum walks on graphs, preferrably regular graphs, and perhaps contributed to significantly more interest.
