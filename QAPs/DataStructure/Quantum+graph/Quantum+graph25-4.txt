What does it feel like to be a doctor with an extremely intelligent patient?
Usually the patients who turn up for treatment are from different profession and they have expertise in their respective fields. Such extremely intelligent patients usually come prepared with their set of information and questions gathered after their random search over internet. I will call their Knowledge as HALF KNOWLEDGE as they just know the superficial aspect of treatment procedure.And even sometimes their gathered information has no scientific evidence and based on different unidentified sources. At times it feels great while working on such patients as we don't need to explain much in detail about treatment procedure and do's and dont's after the treament.Â  But sometimes it becomes quite irritating.At times it becomes quite difficult to satisfy such patients.we feel like FOOLS.They fail to understand that their knowledge is incomplete and we are Masters in our field.They don't even try to listen our instrustions properly and keep interrupting in between the treatment with their half knowledge questions. Such patients should try to understand that HALF KNOWLEDGE about anything is not less than DANGEROUS.
