How do I get more than 97% in the 12th CBSE boards?
Practicals can et you easily 30/30. But in theory, 70/70 getting is difficult. But work hard so that each and every concept is learnt by heart. Getting full in maths, and I.P. is easy, most difficult is ENGLISH. If you work hard, you will be rewarded.
