Can somebody give me tips to perform well in CBSE XII boards exams and score 90+? I have nearly scored 55-60% in my pre boards.
Hey! Firstly i would say everything is possible! You can really score 90+ despite of the fact that u have scored 60% in preboards. You just need to do the following:- Never ever feel demoralised always during the course of prepration stay Motivated and Confident. Just instill in your mind that "I Can" . Now coming to technicality i would say Complete the NCERTs of all your subjects. Don't run for the refreshers relentlessly! A major chunk of question can be traced from the NCERTs. There is still enough time left to prepare well so dont panic just constantly play ur part well by being sincere towards your work. Do refer to Previous Year's solved Question papers. They really are helpful in shooting the score becz u get a feel of the reall paper and can many a times find similar question repeating! (This had been the case with me xD ). Try to get all your doubts cleared with the help of teachers. This really works becz sometime we dont get things unless someone makes us understand and after having done so they really become easy. Most importantly , The time left now is too precious, So Act cautiously! Dont waste your time Just stay focussed towards ur Goal :) Becaz its just a matter of 2months more and then u can enjoy as u want. Don't pay heed to any rumours related to any paper of CBSE. They really can turn into Havoc. Just follow the above things and Nobody can stop you! Wish u luck!
