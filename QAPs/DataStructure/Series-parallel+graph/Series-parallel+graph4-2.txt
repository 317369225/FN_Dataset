Who gives marks for the CBSE 12th practical examination in chemistry and physics in year 2015-2016?
It depends on the external examiner whether they want to mark you or whether they allow your teacher to mark you. Many times it is seen that your teacher marks you but on the viva part the external examiner has a upper hand and it is said that if your viva is good then it can save you and offcourse your terms with teacher would be an important factor. But don't worry in 90 percent cases your practical marks would be around 25 to 30. In my batch for chemistry and physics the least was 27.
