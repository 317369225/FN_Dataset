What is the relationship between music and math?
Mathematics and music are connected in that they are among the small collection of artforms which totally embody abstraction. At the other end of the spectrum are things like civil engineering or journalism: disciplines firmly rooted in reality.  The measure of a physical structure, ultimately, is whether it stands up.  If I were to propose building a bridge with the express purpose of collapsing in a beautiful manner under the slightest breeze, I'd probably lose my engineering license. In the middle of the spectrum lie disciplines such as literature, where there is room for the imagination but still a fundamental connection to the everyday world. Even the most speculative fiction tends to feature characters which are only slightly different from the people we encounter every day.  Nobody is writing novels set in vacuums populated exclusively by unconscious rocks. With mathematics and music, though, the connection to everyday experience is severed entirely.  Mathematics began when the Babylonians began abstracting structures found in what would now be called physics or economics, but today mathematics has evolved to the point where most of the interesting ideas are coming from mathematics itself.  Similarly, music began in ancient times by abstracting sonic ideas from song and dance, but sometime several hundred years ago we moved past this and began writing music for its own sake, and now the most beautiful music is not intended to be sung or danced to.
