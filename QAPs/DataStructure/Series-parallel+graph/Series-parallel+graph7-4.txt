What are the best books for CBSE class 12 (PCM)?
Comprehensive Physics for Class XI by Laxmi Publications. It has all the concepts explained in details, but only to the extent which is required. (Other Textbook, go in way too much detail, especially Pradeep). There are also solved example and NCERT solutions which covers 90% of exams syllabus. (Trust me on this one.) Message me, if you have any other queries.
