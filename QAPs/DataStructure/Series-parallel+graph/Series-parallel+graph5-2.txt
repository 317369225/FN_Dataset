With 2 months left before the boards, how should one study to score 95% on the boards?
With not much details provided, I'll assume the following: class 12th boards, CBSE board. Now, you have plenty of time in front of you. Start with revising the topics from NCERT books, seeing there solved examples too, as it will give you an idea on how to document your answer to fetch maximum marks. Don't go for reference books, if you're not into competitive exams. Read the theory thoroughly, and remember each and every formula by heart. When you're done with your revision take up previous year question papers and don't let any question pass your eye.
