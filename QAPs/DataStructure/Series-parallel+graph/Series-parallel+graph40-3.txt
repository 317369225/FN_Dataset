Do you think it's possible to score 90% in 12th Board without taking tuition? If so, what are some tips?
Hey, In order to secure above 90% in CBSE 12th, you need to study hard. Keep revising your subjects. Make a proper time table to follw the subjects in sequence regularly. Besides reading from text books try to follow some reference books for deep knowledge of topics. If you belong to maths stream, always practice. Proper utilization of time would certainly help you a lot. Remember wasted time is never recycled. Always remember that there is no shortcuts or shorthand. The best advice would be to solve sample papers. Board papers tend to come in specific patterns. Best wishes Ak47.
