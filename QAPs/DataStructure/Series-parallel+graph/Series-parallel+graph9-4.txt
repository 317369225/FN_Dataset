How do I get more than 97% in the 12th CBSE boards?
Getting 97% isn't only a matter of hardwork but also a bit of luck !! I got 96.2% in my boards !! As far as your preparation is concerned .... Ncert has to be memorized thoroughly by heart as far as chemistry and physics is concerned ... Don't depend on ncert for maths and practice from other books as well (R.D Sharma ) Don't take tension for practical just give your preboards nicely and you'll score full ; guaranteed ; bcz the marks in practical depend on your preboards marks in respective subjects !! As far as English is concerned do know the writing technique and I advise you to write long answers cause writing to the point won't fetch you marks here !! Go ahead and see if you can follow !! If not then devise some better strategy !! Best of luck in whatever path you choose :D
