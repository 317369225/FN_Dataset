What is the relationship between music and math?
I've thought about this before (having both musicians and mathematicians as friends, and having studied both myself, at least to some degree), and concluded there are a few kinds of connections.Â  Numbers and patterns. Many aspects of music are inherently mathematical, in that they involve numbers and patterns. These include tuning systems [1], patterns of harmony [2], highly complex or constrained musical forms (like fugues) [3], rhythms [4], and, indeed most elements of any classical music tradition (Western, but also Indian, Arabic, Persian, etc.) that involves complex conventions for composition and performance. These are the obvious connections that come to mind when discussing math and music [5]. Mathematically inclined people appreciate this kind of thing. Behavior. People with the ability to focus and practice extensively benefit by applying the same habits to both endeavors. Aesthetic appreciation. There are of course many reasons for pursuing music, but the most common is probably pure appreciation and enjoyment. In fact, though some non-mathematicians find it surprising, mathematicians are similarly motivated. Both mathematicians and musicians are largely driven by the aesthetics. Creativity. Related to aesthetics, but distinct, is the fact that to excel at either requires great creativity expressed within complex constraints. Emotional fulfillment. Finally (and this one is the most speculative), there may be an emotional component. Music fills an emotional need, and perhaps there are psychological reasons these needs correlate with the desire to pursue abstruse studies such as math. I'm not sure all of these apply to every person who pursues both activities -- and in particular, I think there can be varying motivations for different kinds of musicians (such as a conservatory-trained harpsichord player versus a casual, self-taught rock guitarist) -- but I do think one or more of these connections are important to many people.
