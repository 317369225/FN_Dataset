How do I write answers in the CBSE class 12th physics and chemistry board exams so as to get the maximum marks?
For physics, Try to elaborate each and every thing in 5 markers. I personally used to write 2-3 pages for 5 markers. Make diagrams, write everything you know about that particular question. For chemistry, All are mostly one markers, but some require diagrams, so try to understand the requirement of the question.
