How do I study for the 12th std. board exam to get a 92% in PCM?
As time is short you have to plan out very meticulously. Devote an hour to make a plan. Count the number of days available and hours of study each day. You will be able to calculate approximately how many hours you have for preparation. Devote 35 % of your study time to Physics, then Maths and then Chemistry. In Physics practice the important derivations at least two times checking the answer yourself. For boards the numerical questions are not too difficult but when you answer keep in mind the marking scheme. Your answer must have the following headings- Given and Formula. Units are absolutely important. Answer without proper units are useless.While deriving relations remember you are answering a question in Physics and not Maths. So don't think writing few steps of mathematical equations will fetch you marks.
