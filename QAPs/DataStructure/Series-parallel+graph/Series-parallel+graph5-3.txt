With 2 months left before the boards, how should one study to score 95% on the boards?
Complete your syllabus just from NCERT books. Do all exercises and solved pieces as they will frame question from there. Be thorough with NCERT books as you will never find CBSE asking questions out of NCERT text books. At the end go with some test papers(I followed Arihant) and Past year papers. This answer is in perspective of Physics Chemistry Maths of XII. For English(XII) be thorough with the lesson and read the solved questions of Golden Guide(possibly Laxmi publications). For Sherlock Holmes read the novel twice and be thorough with the solved questions of Golden guide(possibly Laxmi publications). Computer Science is not at all difficult. All you have to do is review the past years question and you will find they ask questions from a common set of question with veryÂ  minute variations. For mathematics you might consider Arihant test paper after you are done with NCERT for last minute revision and it contains good set of question papers for practice. But for Physics Chemistry if you are thorough with text and all the exercises and solved question you can easily attempt 70 on 70 in theory paper. Wishing you a very best of luck for your preparations. Cheers.
