Which of the following is a better syllabus: ICSE or CBSE?
CBSE: It is best if you want to appear for national engineering and medical exams like JEE Mains and Advanced,BITSAT, or CETs etc. The standard of english is lower than ICSE so you can focus more on Physics Chemistry Maths or/and biology and also all exams dates are according to CBSE. ISE: It is best you want to study abroad as their English is at par with TOFEL and IELTS and  also note that the Indian School Certificate (Class XII) is recognised by UK universities and so applicants are not required to obtain ‘A’ level qualifications or complete bridging courses, while seeking entry to Universities in the UK and other overseas Universities in the Commonwealth. The Indian School Certificate qualification is the only qualification from India that has been granted this special recognition. So for undergraduation in India opt CBSE otherwise go for ISE .
