How do I score 97% in cbse in 2 months?
If you want to score 97% in CBSE, believe me its not a difficult task. Just folow your NCERT books only. Go through them in deep. Read each chapter twice, thrice. Every new time you read the same chapter, believe me you will come to know new things every time. I have experienced this. My personal advice is not to follow local publishers sample papers, guides and all that. Most of your friends used to prefer two or three books for same subject. But, acc to me this is not required. Apart from NCERT, you can purchase solved previous years papers but your first preference should be to write the answer acc. to NCERT then you may see the answer given in that prev yr paper book. So, this was my openion about studying for cbse board exams. Wishing you all the best for your exams.
