How do I get 95% in boards studying during 2 months? If one has not started preparing, are 2 months enough for class 12th boards?
The answer is damn! YES. But first of all you have to believe, cos first and the most imp step towards success is the feeling that u can succeed. Now coming to how it can be done... So lemme tell you it in a very planned manner. Lets count your days from now, you have full 60 days in hand. Now coming to the syllabus you'll have 15-16 chapters in each subject I guess as per mine in 12th science. So if you take 2 days to complete a chapter of one subject u'll be taking 1 month to cover up your main subjects like PCB or PCM . So I'm not going to tell hoe many hours u should study, but u should complete your target everyday. As they say break your goal into simple achievable targets. The time is pretty enough and don't forget to solve 5 years cbse board question papers. Solving them in proper time will boost your confidence. And do believe (future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams) In the two months proper study with NO COMPROMISE you'll surely be among the toppers. So start now,work hard &Dream big                                                                                     Edit: One more tip is to recall the name of topics or important points after reading a chapter, as soon as you recall the name of topic your mind will give you whole gist of that. & this can be done before sleep also for the whole day study. All the very best :) Thanks for A2A Updated 3w ago • View Upvotes • Not for Reproduction • Asked to answer by Anonymous
