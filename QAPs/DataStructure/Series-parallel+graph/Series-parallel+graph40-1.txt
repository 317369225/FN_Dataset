Do you think it's possible to score 90% in 12th Board without taking tuition? If so, what are some tips?
I have already done it! Self study rocks! Scored 95% in CBSE boards without taking any coaching, tuition whatsoever. In fact I did not take coaching all my school life. It was only for JEE preparation that I dropped a year and went to Delhi for coaching. Sorry in case it seems I am bragging about myself. Tips: Go through NCERT regularly. Buy a book that has NCERT questions solved, like Xam Idea and solve them. Solve previous years' question papers which you will find it in Xam Idea kinda books already. Have a good exam temperament. It is very important. The board exams have become quite easy these days. So, just relax and enjoy your studies...err...if it's possible ;p
