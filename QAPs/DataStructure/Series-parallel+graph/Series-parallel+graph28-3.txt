Is it easy to score a 95% in the CBSE class 12 boards?
I have myself not scored 95% but have been able to cross the 90% mark so I think I can answer this one.I know some rights and wrongs about CBSEÂ  preparations. It depends on the work the student makes throughout the session. First of all,don't start thinking about a 95% or a 90%. Our desires are one of the reasons for some of our lesser achieved things. Its written in the Bhagwad Gita that " karm kar,fal ki chinta mat kar" meaning "Just focus on your work,dont worry about the results.Rest will follow." Just attend school. try to work on the coursework of 12th.Dont worry about class 11th results if its not that good because they dont matter in 12th boards.If 11th results were good,try to gain confidence from that. Just finish your assignments,labs etc. Try to focus more on NCERT stuff.Revise daily. Put a lot of hardwork during the last 3-4 months where you should revise your previous studied things. Keep a check on the previous year trends. BEST OF LUCK.
