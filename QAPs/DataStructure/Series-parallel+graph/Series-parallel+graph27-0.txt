How do I score 95 or more in the CBSE Class XII chemistry?
I think I am qualified to write this answer ( scored 98 in 2013 CBSE boards chemistry exam). First let's get to the basics. Exam scheme is (30+70). Those 30 marks do matter and can change your jee mains rank for good. So you need to ace the practical exam. Be thoroughly prepared with the viva and expect questions from salt analysis, titration, laboratory equipments apart from your regular syllabus. If everything goes well, you will score 29/30 in practicals easily. theory exam- You have to understand that the syllabus is quite vast and the paper checkers want the answer to be in a specific format. So even if your answer is correct, but not written in the typical board exam style, you may end up losing marks. Give extra time to last chapters I.e. chemistry in everyday life, biochemistry chapter etc. These chapters are asked in short questions and those 5-6 marks matter. Physical chemistry is considered the easiest part, and be prepared with the numericals. Know how to do quick calculations using logs. Organic chemistry is very interesting and you will ace this portion with dedication and hard work. One of the most difficult part considered is inorganic chemistry. It is really a pain, but you have to do it and pay some extra efforts on it.   After this, you just a look at previous years question (3 years max). Just look for questions you find tricky and solve it. Be confident and you will ace the exam.   All the best.
