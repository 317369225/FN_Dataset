Is it easy to get at least 75% in CBSE class 12?
Yeah, it's very easy. But only if you concentrates in your classroom lectures and practice many questions. If still you don't feel confident enough you may join any coaching or tutorial classes to clear all concepts and applications. Once you are through with everything no one can stop you from scoring more than 90% in you 12th board.
