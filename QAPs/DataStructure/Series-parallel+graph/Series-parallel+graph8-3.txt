Which of the following is a better syllabus: ICSE or CBSE?
I am a CBSE pass out. I consider ICSE as a better option in terms of standard.Â  However ,both CBSE and ICSE are being given equal weightage across top colleges and universities in the country. In terms of standard, ICSE is a lot better. Hope this clears. :)
