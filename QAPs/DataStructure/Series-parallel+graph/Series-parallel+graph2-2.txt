How do I get good marks in class 12 CBSE Practical?
Let me go subject wise. Physics - Know some terminologies. If you can say the exact words from NCERT, that's very pleasing to them. Chemistry - DON'T reveal if you are from KOTA or any other coaching institute. It's the basic funda for all the subjects. Just say limited words. Physical Education - Man! You need to practice jogging for 1-1.5 km. Otherwise you're situation will get worse. And know one or two difficult aasan, like Chakrasan or Mayurasan. And choose cricket, even if you think Kho-Kho or other games have less rules. Most indians have the basic funda of cricket more than any of other ones.
