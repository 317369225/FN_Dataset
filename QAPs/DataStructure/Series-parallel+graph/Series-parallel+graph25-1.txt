How do I prepare for Practicals & Viva Class 12 CBSE from a Dummy School?
Try getting in touch with your other friends who are probably not in a dummy school and get the exact experiments that are done in their schools, and practice those. Wont be much of a problem though as everything is taken care off generally(what i have heard from my friends who were in a dummy school). Viva is generally based on normal course questions that you would have understood in your coaching or preparation.
