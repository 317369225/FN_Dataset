How do I get 90% + % in 12 CBSE?
I had written this answer in response to a question previously Just collect previous 5(10 or even beyond if time permits)yrs questions(deal with each subject individually of course). Go through them in a few minutes maybe 1/2-1 hour. Find the most repeated topics( don't Ingoe maps they're free marks) Or get important topics marked by some reliable source friend/senior/teacher etc) Divide topics according to the frequency of their recurrence and start studying in decreasing order. Study them. They're most likely to be repeated. Include as many diagrams charts tables guidelines protocols in your answers. Make a spare notebook of these things(for each subject separately)and revise them for some fixed time just as you stay studying, just before sleeping, while travelling and whatever time you can't actively study. Write all these answers in the format to be presented in exam. It'll make revision easy and fast. Replace theory by flowcharts or divide it in headings and sub-headings (alongwith the pervious point) Always do all the solved examples of ncert books for any calculative subject Divide time for each subject and stick to it. Always keep some spare time to adjust left over topics. Keep time for revision. 90% is not enough these days, esp for commerce stream. So kindly reset your goal and targets Best of luck.
