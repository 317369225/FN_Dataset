What should my daily routine be to get 95+% in the CBSE class 12 boards?
Hello I just gave my class 12 board exams and secured 95% so I think I can give you some piece of advice. First of all don't take stress. I know you have a lot of syllabus to cover but don't worry!You have enough time left. All you need is to learn how to manage this time. See all work and no play makes jack a dull boy. So don't you just study. Give yourself some break from time to time but dont get swayed! Also try and be regular with your work. Even though it takes an extra hour to complete your day's work. Just do it! And try and be thorough with what you do. Don't do things superficially just for the sake of doing it. And don't keep focus on just one subject. Try to cover up all your subjects simultaneously. Securing 90-92 percent in boards is not that difficult but yes adding 3% more to it requires extra hard work. I think if you keep all these things in mind you can definitely secure good marks but yes you'll have to work really hard. All the best!
