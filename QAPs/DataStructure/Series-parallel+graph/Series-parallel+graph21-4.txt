I have only a month left for my 12th HSC Board Examinations, how I can study efficiently to score well in the exams?
Make the most out of the time that is left. It can still be done. You need an impeccable plan for the month. Also, keep making plans for 3-4 days at once as to what topics are to be covered in these days and stick to it. Try to find out from different sources as to what are the most important topics for the exam and the ones that have the greatest weightage. Give these topics priority. Talk to your teachers to find out how different topics need to be prepared based on what kind of questions are asked from them. For this, you can also go through previous year question papers. But, see that you dont waste too much time on this. Finally, put in a lot of time and effort in the right direction. All the best.
