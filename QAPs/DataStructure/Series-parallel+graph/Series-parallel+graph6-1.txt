How do I prepare for my class 12 CBSE chemistry practicals?
It's quite easy really, the only real challenge is salt analysis. Titration is also a cakewalk. Boards practicals are quite easy, just concentrate more on viva as this is where there is more risk of losing marks. And most important: listen to your chemistry teacher.
