I am in class 12th right now. About 6 months left for the class 12th board exam for 2016. How should I prepare from today in order to get above 95%? What should I study for PCM?
You have pretty good time for preparation of each subject (even topic ) thoroughly. So, it's good to know you'll start from today onwards. :P Okay, for preparation to board exams (CBSE or any), you need to understand topic, take short notes and practice questions ( Physics and Chemistry), you have to understand the concept in both subjects to tackle complex problems. For maths, just kick start from problems and practice, practice, and practice. That's it. Be REGULAR. This is most important habit you have to acquire in order to get your goal, which is not difficult with regular study and practice. Don't wait for exams. Learn everyday. The process of learning and gaining knowledge is much much MUCH more important than your final percentage. So, Enjoy the journey of learning. Happy Learning !!
