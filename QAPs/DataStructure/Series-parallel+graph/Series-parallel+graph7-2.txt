What are the best books for CBSE class 12 (PCM)?
You will get wide ranging answers(somewhat subjective question actually). I'll tell you what I think is best for cbse class XII. PHYSICS- Physics NCERT is one of the best book to learn from( yeah, i admit it is a bit difficult book to understand but it is the best anyways). No other book is required. Learn every examples. Also buy a Cbse solved previous year question paper book(you can choose any publisher. I prefer Arihant. Chapterwise would be better.)) Chemistry- Nothing to say Chemistry NCERT is a masterpiece. Have complete faith in it. Again buy a previous year as stated above. Intext questions along with examples are must do. Cbse have the habit of asking from them directly. (Do exercises if you want to get better grip on concepts). Chem Ncert is enough to get you more than decent marka in JEE Mains Mathematics- NCERT again. But I have to admit- it is not one of the best but enough for CBSE. Moreover you will see same question in your cbse board exam (even the statements are not changed). Miscellaneous exercises are must to get a 100. Again buy a previous year book. P.S. I gave the papers in both 2014(70% in PCM) & 2015(95% in PCM). The difference in both years? Previous years book. NCERTs will teach you concepts but to write smartly is what you will learn from previous years. Decent handwriting will be appreciated. Moreover if you are good at NCERTs then BITSAT & state CETs will be cakewalk.
