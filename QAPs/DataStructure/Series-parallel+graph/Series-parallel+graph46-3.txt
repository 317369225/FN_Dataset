What are some good books to give to a 10 year old?
If I ruled the world, I'd make every young girl on the planet read the following four books from Terry Pratchett's huge Discworld series. These four books work together like a mini-series to tell the story of Tiffany Aching: •   The Wee Free Men •   Hat Full of Sky •   The Wintersmith •   I Shall Wear Midnight   Tiffany Aching is a young apprentice witch (the first books starts off with her at nine years old), and her stories often parallel mythic hero quests and Tiffany's difficulties as a young girl maturing into a responsible woman. She is aided in her tasks by the Nac Mac Feegle, a gang of blue-tattooed, 6-inch tall, hard-drinking, loud-mouthed pictsie creatures also called "The Wee Free Men," who serve as her guardians.   A few of my many favorite quotes (and I have many) from the Tiffany books include:   “Yes! I’m me! I am careful and logical and I look up things I don’t understand! When I hear people use the wrong words, I get edgy! I am good with cheese. I read books fast! I think! And I always have a piece of string! That’s the kind of person I am!”   *********** ''I would like a question answered today', said Tiffany. ‘Provided it’s not the one about how you get baby hedgehogs,’ said the man. ‘No,’ said Tiffany patiently.  ‘It’s about zoology.’ ‘Zoology, eh?  That’s a big word, isn’t it.’ ‘No, actually it isn’t,’ said Tiffany. ‘Patronizing is a big word.  Zoology is really quite short.'  (Wee Free Men)    **********   “And all the stories had, somewhere, the witch. The wicked old witch. And Tiffany had thought, Where’s the evidence? The stories never said why she was wicked. It was enough to be an old woman, enough to be all alone, enough to look strange because you had no teeth. It was enough to be called a witch. If it came to that, the book never gave you the evidence of anything. It talked about ‘a handsome prince’…was he really, or was it just because he was a prince that people called him handsome? As for ‘a girl who was as beautiful as the day was long’…well, which day? In midwinter it hardly ever got light! the stories didn’t want you to think, they just wanted you to believe what you were told…” (Wee Free Men)   ********************************************   Outside of the Tiffany books, especially for the girls, I’d recommend any and all of the series for any 10-year-old kid. They are just as much for the girls as they are for the boys. The boy characters appeal to the girls and the girl characters appeal to the boys. I wasn’t introduced to Pratchett’s books until just a few years ago (I’m in my 40s), and I’m telling you that I have laughed my ass off and cried big drippy drop tears of sadness and joy. I LOVE these characters. And there are so many of them. And I think Pratchett is a rock star of a humanist and headology people knower. This link here is a chart of all Pratchett's series. You can either read them in order OR you can read them by "mini-series" or character grouping. The Wiki chart lets you resort the order to find how the series works within itselff.  Discworld
