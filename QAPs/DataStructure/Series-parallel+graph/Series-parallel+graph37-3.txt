I am in class 12th now. How should I prepare to do good in Boards?
I am a commerce student and I just gave my 12th board exams. I scored 96.5% marks. Let me assure you that it's not how many hours but the quality of hours that matters. A regular study of even 4-5 hours on a school day and 10 hours on a weekend is sufficient to score 96+. It's more about consistency and being throough with what you study. I know students who slogged all day long but ended up scoring only 85-90%, because they focused more on the "number of hours".              Perseverance and hardwork are pre-requisites  to excel in any examination. Plan well. Identify your strengths and weaknesses.  But believe me, nobody can guarantee that if you study this much you will get 98%. Studying even all day long may not guarantee 98% because a lot more comes into play. Work hard and don't worry about the result!
