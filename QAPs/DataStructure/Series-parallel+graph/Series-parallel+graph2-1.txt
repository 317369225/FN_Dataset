How do I get good marks in class 12 CBSE Practical?
Just like the anonymous guy/lady has told you, learn some terminologies,but i would prefer you to learn what you do exactly in practicals. I can only tell you about physics, computer science practicals I am very specific about me learning whats happening in the physics practicals. There are various instruments and various methods to use those instruments.Each can be used in different ways. Ok, coming back to your question, try to remember some stuff(basics) from your class 11, like the ideas of oscillations. Learn how to draw the circuits. Its actually like this, in viva - they ask you a set of questions, from the textbook , mainly regarding how 'x' changes when 'y' is changed like this.They wont ask you more than the basic questions you would have probably never asked your teacher during the practicals like why do we use the 'Half Deflection' method only in checking the galvanometer constant?? There are such crazy methods for this experiment you can do 1/nth deflection for the galvanometer experiment. Learn NCERT, meet your teacher some days before the exam, ask him some questions, which you will get when you do such experiments alone. Think!!! Now comes CSC. Ah C++, its so basic and compact that most of the viva questions are your regular board exam questions that involve definitons and working of loops, switch-cases ,etc. Know what you have done for your project, because you have marks for project viva too. If you have done an application project know what is involved in that application. Learn Sql Commands, they will tell you to write the commands(In my school we cannot use the Sql tool to check our commands). And also learn what the various gates do in boolean algebra, how to write dual of a statement, etc For eg: Hotel management involves availability of seats, reception etc. Well, try to look confident even if you are dead sure of nothing. This gives a good impression.Â  All the Best for your exams!!
