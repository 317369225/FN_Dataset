Is it easy to score a 95% in the CBSE class 12 boards?
I won't term this as really easy, but it isn't very tough as well. Since your chemistry teacher told you so, that means you have a Science background. For: 1)Chemistry-NCERT is sufficient in itself. Divide Chem preparation into three sections- Physical, Organic and Inorganic. For physical, learn formulas and derivations nicely. Practice questions of all possible types. Pradeep's is good for Physical. For organic, make your concepts clear. Understand conversions, make flow charts and try out questions given in previous year papers. For inorganic, make notes and read ncert thoroughly. Inorganic is restricted to ncert. 2)Physics-Prepare all derivations from one chapter you select. Now after you complete derivations, write down the formulas and practice questions. First practice basic questions that is concept building and then do ncert ones. Now move on to the next chapter. Never do the mistake of doing derivations of all chapters at once and numericals together. You'll end up confused. Also prepare theoretical questions. This year the board paper was 70% theoretical so many children's result spoiled because of Physics. 3) Maths- Get one thing. Paper is not 100% from directly ncert. It is ncert based. I suggest you to strengthen your concepts. RD Sharma examples are concept building. Once, you do them, ncert is a kid's play. After you prepare till this level. Do sample and previous year papers. Set 3 hours time limit so that you can work on your speed. Papers are generally lengthy. So you need to have a grip on your speed. PS-I did not have Biology. So, can't say anything about it. Good luck!
