I have only a month left for my 12th HSC Board Examinations, how I can study efficiently to score well in the exams?
You must have heard about quote " Its never too late to start". The most important thing in this situation is not to loose hope.Everything that we do in our life is done based on onlyÂ  hope. Without hope you even don't think of starting a new task. Planned task is half done Next is to plan your study according to priority. You dont have to study everything when you have less time. Always keep your aim in your mind. At this time your only aim is to pass the exam so study according to that. find out the part which is asked more in exam and read that.If at the end you have extra time then go for remaining. (I used to this strategy during my college days, believe me it works.) Set the target and follow it. Now when you have planned your study, It is time to set the target. allot a fix time for particular subject and complete that subject on the time. You should strictly follow your time table now. if you cheat this time, you will not going to make a comeback. So be honest while studying and try to be in confident mood. Note down important things While studying make a small diary of keywords that you may forget at the time of exam so whenever you look at those keyword the whole answer will come into your mind and you will remain updated about subject. Last is : Attempt each and every question in Exam. I Think , I don't need to tell this but attempt each and every question whether you know the answer or not. sometime your tukka will work, some time examiner may not wanted to fail you and sometime you are so fortunate that examiner don't read the answer and give the marks. So be hopeful in every aspect.
