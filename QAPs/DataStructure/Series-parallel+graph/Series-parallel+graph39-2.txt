What are class 12 CBSE board exam tips and suggestions?
See instead of talking about studies I will stress upon some other important tips. 1. The most important thing to do is to have a good and an efficient sleep cycle. Start sleeping early at least 2 weeks before boards start and start waking up early. This will help you a lot. 2. Start studying in the time slots in which board exams are held for eg 9:30 to 1. This will increase the working of your mind during this time period and make you efficient during exams. 3. Stop worrying. The most important thing not to do before an exam is worry. Worry can only cause your trouble and misfortune. Be confident and believe in yourself.
