Can somebody give me tips to perform well in CBSE XII boards exams and score 90+? I have nearly scored 55-60% in my pre boards.
Now, The very first step I will suggest is to throw away that " 90% mindset". Its a trap.    Cover every topic and question that you can not just to get a 90% but because you can do it and you feel like doing it. Make a commitment to yourself that no matter what happens , I will give my 100%. Before the exam, be like ' I have done everything I can, Now , no matter what the result is, I am satisfied'. Intellectual talks apart , coming back to your revision strategy, here are the things that you can do to complete your preparations. Now, first of all make a list of all those topics that are yet to covered in each subject. Make a plan to cover them ASAP. If  they are too many them, only cover the important ones because you have hardly 500 hours in hand. Start revising each chapter and the best way to do that is to go through your notes. After revising a chapter, the best way to check your status is by solving previous years questions of that particular chapters 20 days before the exam , you should start solving the previous year papers and sample papers subjectwise. Solve atleast one paper in one sitting daily. Thus you will get used to that 3 hour exam pattern eventually. Particularly in Maths and physics you should solve the last 15 years papers atleast once. In chemistry NCERT is best. Analyse that part of the topic from which questions are repeatedly asked. 10 days before the exam , do not touch any new topic. First gain confidence by revising your strong topics and then shift to others. Start taking sound sleep and proper diet as they are equally important. Having done all these still one very important thing is remaining,'CONFIDENCE'. Have confidence and Believe in yourself. At last, always remember its nothing more than an exam and you are gonna make it large. Best of luck
