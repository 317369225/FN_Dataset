Hey Follow only & only ncert, do all it's questions including examples intext, thoroughly. Divide your syllabus into topics that to be learned daily, meant to say break your goal into simple small targets for daily. Do study when you want, But a half hour study should be half hour study with every 30 mintues concentration on the topic. Suggest you to do questions of each topic you learn immediately after it. Follow 5-10 year papers of CBSE , and before you know, you'll be having your result with more than 90% marks.
