I want to prepare for my 12th class, my 11 is not good enough and almost wasted 7 months of 12. How can I prepare to score 85%+ marks in 12 board CBSE?
Thanks for A2A.Solving past papers, following NCERT books are must. If you are from Science stream then solving numerical examples from NCERT book is important. Do not neglect the worked out examples too. They help in building up your concpts. Along with these you should also form a strategy to answer the exam papers. For that divide the total available time by total marks . This will give time available for each mark. Hence calculate how many answers you are supposed to complete in each half hour of your exam. This can save you from the time crunch towards the end of the examination which affects your perfomance a lot.
