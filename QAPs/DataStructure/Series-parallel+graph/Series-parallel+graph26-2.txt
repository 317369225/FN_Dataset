How can I score more than 95% in my upcoming class 12 CBSE board exam in PCMB subjects?
Thanks for A2A. You get good marks only when you answer logically. It needs basic understanding of the concept. If you are fine with that then for CBSE exam you need to practice to write the long answers.I teach Physics so I can advise about that subject only. Understanding is not enough for answering questions on derivation. One more point. While deriving any expression students mostly concentrate on mathematical part of it omitting the Physics behind the answer. Remember your knowledge of Physics is being tested and not Maths.
