How can I score more than 95% in my upcoming class 12 CBSE board exam in PCMB subjects?
es it is easy. Just look around in quora every one is getting 95 in PCMB and CS I honestly believe i should have got 92 in phy and 97+ in chem but strangely i got 95 in both. I think CBSE is not even checking paper properly and giving flat 95 to most people who should have got in the range 90-100. Most of my friends too got 95 in most subjects and their marks differed in one or two subjects. To get 95% my tip would be read NCERT well Make a notebook and write down(page wise) all the imp points. Some of my hardworking friends did so. Read/write/recollect NCERT for a month u will see u can answer past years question papers in a flash.
