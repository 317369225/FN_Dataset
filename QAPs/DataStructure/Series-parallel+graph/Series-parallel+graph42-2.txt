What are some good MapReduce implementations for graphs?
Sonal, Ankur, and others have provided excellent answers so far. I would humbly commend the following singular addition: https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/... This reference describes a tall and skinny QR (TSQR) solver in mapreduce. Given the seminal role that Laplacian and Incidence matrix spectral theory has in characterizing graphs, http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spi..., the ability to factor them into Cholesky form, at scale,Â  is an important contribution. Note the above TSQR mapreduce code isn't so much an "open source framework" as simply one more tool in the quiver......
