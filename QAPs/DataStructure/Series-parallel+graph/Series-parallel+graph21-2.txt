I have only a month left for my 12th HSC Board Examinations, how I can study efficiently to score well in the exams?
Achieving it might be difficult but not impossible. I was in the same board. You need to start the preparation with full confidence. Say goodbye to social media till your exams get over. Trust me it will help you a lot. Try to be reserved in yourself as if you interact a lot with your friends you will end up doing much more fun with no study. For maths, practice as much as you can. There is no other way for success in it. Concentrate more on calculus part. For physics, be thorough with the derivations and numericals. Your concepts need to be clear. For chemistry, I would say work more on organic part. Inorganic part has less weightage but it works as a deciding factor. For english, just read the book properly and understand the story. You may need to work on grammar part if required. Solve previous year board papers and your school papers. Make a proper timetable and do follow it. Give equal importance to all the subjects.Studying in the morning is recommended as your mind is free from all the problems at that time.Don't study for long at a stretch, take a short break after every two hours.Best of Luck..!!
