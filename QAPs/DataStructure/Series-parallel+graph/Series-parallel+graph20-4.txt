How do I write answers in the CBSE class 12th physics and chemistry board exams so as to get the maximum marks?
For physics theory part write point to point what question want . Don't explain the hole part if it is of less marks . Write answer by marks if it is of 2 marks then write maximum of 4 line and if it is of 6 marks then explain briefly point to point. And in numerical part if you dont know the answer dont worry if you only write the formula and explain little bit you can get some marks . Dont leave any question answer all .
