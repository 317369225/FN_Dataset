Is it too bad for a 12th CBSE Student to score merely 80%?
80% man if u ask me its quite awesome because i scored just 76% when i was at your age.even if this percentage wont able to get to you a pretigious college but do you think that college would decide your future .iam a btech student buddy from my point of view college is for four years only.its your hardwork that remain with you till your life .the world has a large ocean of oppurtunity all you have to do is dive in deep .dont loose hope actually 80 % are good forget the past work for your present . Buddy thomas edison was a failure when he was a student but see now the world remembers him.so according to me you are better then him at this stage.forget about your marks and workhard thats all i can say.At last i would say to that YOU HAVE NOT FAILED ONLY YOUR SUCCESS HAS BEEN POSTPHONED. :-)
