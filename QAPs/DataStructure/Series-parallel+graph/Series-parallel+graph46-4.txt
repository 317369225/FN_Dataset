What are some good books to give to a 10 year old?
The Phantom Tollbooth is a terrific read.  They're old enough to enjoy the story and the puns. If the kid is interested in science fiction, The Foundation Trilogy is a good place to start, but it might be a bit of a stretch.  I read it then, but it's not to everyone's taste. Anything by Roald Dahl: Matilda, or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, or even The BFG.
