Does studying electric engineering require a lot of math?
Yes, studying Electrical Engineering does require a lot of math.  Not so much once you're working in the field. I've been a EE since 1987, but I've been a circuit designer for a lot longer.  You don't need a lot of math to do most digital circuit design--what math provides is the basis for understanding how and why circuits behave the way they do.  I rarely use anything more than the 4 basic math operators on a daily basis.  However, what my math education has provided is the ability to know how to approach and set up the solution to a problem.  And then I let the computer do the number crunching!
