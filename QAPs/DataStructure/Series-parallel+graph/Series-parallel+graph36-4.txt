With 6 months for board exams, how should a class 12 student aiming for 95% spend his day?
I think you should start by stop attending your JEE classes, convince your parents for that. According to me it will only consume your time now, and I am sure your parents will understand if you try For the preparation part , start by collecting previous year papers , this will definitely help you. Try extracting some time for your self study , because going by your current routine I don't think you are able to so that.
