I have only a month left for my 12th HSC Board Examinations, how I can study efficiently to score well in the exams?
Most of us do not give attention to details and procedure when teachers are demonstrating the practical experiments in class. It is really necessary to redo the experiments before you attempt you exams . CBSE PRACTICALS is a YouTube channel which will surely help you out. All the CBSE Practical Videos for Class 11/12 Chemistry and Physics are available on this channel. You may Subscribe the channel and visit the playlist through the links below :) prepare well for board exams :) Class 11 Physics Practical Experiments - Class 11 Physics Practical Experiments - Class 12 Chemistry Practical Experiments- Visit - YouTube Channel CBSE Practicals Helping students study well and save time ,check out our reviews - Section A 1.
