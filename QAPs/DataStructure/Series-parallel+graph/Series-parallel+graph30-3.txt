I want to prepare for my 12th class, my 11 is not good enough and almost wasted 7 months of 12. How can I prepare to score 85%+ marks in 12 board CBSE?
First of all you need to calm yourselves down and not worry with various disturbances around you. Even if you had wasted your time in class,you would have a faint knowledge of what your teacher taught to you. Recall it and read it again. Meditate for ten minutes before reading your text-books,it will give give you the necessary concentration you had lacked all these days. Remember that marks are no indicator of one's success. No matter what you score now you will end up at a place where your skills matter. For example if you are reading Chemistry & have some doubts in it do not hesitate to ask your teacher or your peers. Hesitation is the most venomous regressor in us. It does not matter how stupid your doubt is,express yourself to your teacher or to your peers. Sleep well. At least eight hours of sleep is necessary for you to be brisk at school. I had a friend who studied hard for his exams without sleeping and ended up forgetting everything in Maths exam hall. So beware. Allot some time for your daily activities,do no push it just because you have exams. Prepare a list of chapters which you are good at,okay at and miserable at. Know your strengths & weaknesses and study accordingly. When I was in twelfth standard I was very poor at memorising my mathematics formulas so I just pasted the printouts containing formulas just above my computer table where I spend most of the time. It paid off as expected. So make innovative ideas to make your study more interesting. If you work hard from now on your goal is not far away to fetch. So prepare accordingly. Best wishes.
