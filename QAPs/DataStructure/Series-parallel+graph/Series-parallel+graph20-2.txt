How do I write answers in the CBSE class 12th physics and chemistry board exams so as to get the maximum marks?
Do not panic on seeing the question, no matter you know the answer or not. Write just anything you know, however distantly it may be related to the question. The checker also knows the importance of 12th marks and would never give you 0 if you have written something, no matter if its the proper answer or not. Yeah but do not take wrong inference that you can write anything in all questions. Prepare very well by reading NCERT textbooks and reading shirt answer questions from any book you like ( personally I had referred to pradeep's) . The above trick is valid only if you have written about 80% of your paper absolutely right and presentation does matter. Leave proper spacing and avoid cutting as much as possible.
