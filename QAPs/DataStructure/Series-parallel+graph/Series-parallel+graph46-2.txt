What are some good books to give to a 10 year old?
When I was that age I was mad for Lloyd Alexander's "Chronicles of Prydain" (The Book of Three, The Black Cauldron, The Castle of Llyr, Taran Wanderer, The High King). They're perfect for someone of that age and they certainly helped reinforce my love of reading. A boxed set is available on Amazon for just $23. http://www.amazon.com/Chronicles...
