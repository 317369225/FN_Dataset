How do I prepare for my class 12 CBSE chemistry practicals?
Internal practicals are mere time pass. u either learn the readings 0f xperiments and try to get the experiment whose readings are with u do be more precise during written practical of chemistry in case u are not good at performing or taking readings. practicals of cbse are just for name sake.they will just check the output thats it how u got it they won't scratch their head over that.
