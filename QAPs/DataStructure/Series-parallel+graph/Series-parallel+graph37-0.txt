I am in class 12th now. How should I prepare to do good in Boards?
12 board preparation just requires focus and concentration, I can suggest you good books for CBSE 12 preparation: Physics:- solve examples and read theory of NCERT Physics, for last 10 years questions Chapterwise Physics- Arihant Publication, for better understanding of topics refer the theory part of HC Verma- Part II, for theory plus numerical and a good overview of whatever you have learned go for Xam Idea- XII, for the real exam practice do solve the question papers of last 5-6 years of All India and Compartment. Compartment papers need a good labor and it will also clear most of your concepts. Chemistry:- you need to clear all the concepts of NCERT book and for better understanding of topics and visual impacts refer the videos of Xam Fear https://www.youtube.com/user/ExamFearVideos, Chapterwise Chemistry- Arihant should be practiced on regular basis. This will surely help you in scoring 95+ in Chemistry. For organic part learn the mechanism of all the named reactions as this will fix your almost 15 marks. Maths:- Solve the whole NCERT textbook for minimal twice and don't go for RD Sharma and RS Aggarwal. After you solve each chapter's NCERT start solving the real questions from Xam Idea- XII, it has a great collection of questions purely on CBSE scheme whereas RD and RS are not particularly for CBSE. English:- For English you should read the Flamingo and Snapshot books thoroughly and exceed your speed, Xam Idea- XII has a great collection of topics to write and read for boards prepration. Biology:- Contact my friend Aman Goel(9521752234), He scored a perfect 100 in CBSE 2015 in Biology.
