What should my daily routine be to get 95+% in the CBSE class 12 boards?
You need to have a plan. Try cover up the whole syllabus in 6 months for all subjects and revise in the two months left. Along with the topics going on try to cover up previous year papers from the same topic which will help you in knowing the question pattern. Study regularly and in a methodological way. Meaning spend quality time with studies. Jishu Das' answer to How can I study more effectively? Jishu Das' answer to Can you share some tips for regular studies? These answers may help you.
