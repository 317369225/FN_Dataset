How do I score 95%+ in CBSE Board Examinations for class 12 in PCM Subjects?
Some tips I can give :- NCERT is really important. Some questions are asked directly from those 'useless seeming' paragraphs in physics and chemistry. Take Pre-Boards seriously. Though your performence in it is no reflection of your 'to be' performence, but do preapre for them and try to score above 80 in them. Previous years papers are of utmost importance. Trust me on this.I would suggest you Arihant's PYQ book for chapterwise questions. Practice few papers before exams. They also play importance in your performence on the d-day. Dont overdo them, around 3 would be enough. Dont worry and relax. Try to avoid any kind of pressure, anxiety or frustation during preparation day.Talking to friends and teacher is of great help. Avoid Facebook. Belive me, its useless.       Cheers
