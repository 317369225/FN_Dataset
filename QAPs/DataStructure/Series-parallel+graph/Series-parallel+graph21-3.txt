I have only a month left for my 12th HSC Board Examinations, how I can study efficiently to score well in the exams?
Thanks for A2A.One request , do not waste your time in self-pity. You can do your best in whatever time is left. If I were in your position, I would divide my available number of days by number of subjects but not equally. The toughest subject should be given more number of days. For example if you are in Science stream then 35% of your study time should be given for Physics, 30 % for Maths and so on. It will depend on your personal choice too. One mistake which many students commit is that when time is short they spend more time in studying the portions which one is not comfortable with. In doing so they miss out on the topics in which they are strong. First make sure that you have thoroughly revised the topics which seems to be easy. Take care to see that they carry sufficient marks. Your mode of preparation should not be tough to easy portions but on the contrary the opposite. Well...I can write a thousand words more but one more piece of advice... do not waste time in front of the computer to find answers on the social media. Work hard and leave the rest for your destiny.
