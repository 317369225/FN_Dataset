Does studying electric engineering require a lot of math?
I studied engineering, and I knew a lot of math. What I realize looking back is that if I had recognized that math is the language of physics and physics is the basis of engineering I would understand MUCH more today. Don't let math intimidate you. Use it to model your understanding of the way the way things work.
