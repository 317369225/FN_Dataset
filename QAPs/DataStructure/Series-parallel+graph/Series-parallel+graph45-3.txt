Does studying electric engineering require a lot of math?
Yes it does. But more than anything engineering requires hard work and passion. So if you are willing to put in the effort, and have a decent ability to grasp mathematical concepts, don't let intensive math hold you back. You can definitely come to terms with any kind of problems as long as you are driven and are willing to throw yourself at it and get things done. Electrical engineering is really fun once you get over your fear of "hard" math.
