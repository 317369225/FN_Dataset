How do I get more than 97% in the 12th CBSE boards?
You should go through the syllabus very thoroughly at first. Know your strong and weak chapters and according to that prepare yourself. Generally NCERT books cover the whole CBSE syllabus and hence you should study NCERT books mainly. Because, these books contain fundamentals given by expert teachers of CBSE board. Other than this,the PRADIP's fundamental books are also very important and to build concept in every major subject these books are much helpful. So start preparing hard from now. All the best..
