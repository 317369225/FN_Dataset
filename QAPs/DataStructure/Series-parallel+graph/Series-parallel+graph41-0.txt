What should my daily routine be to get 95+% in the CBSE class 12 boards?
It's not late at all. Honestly, even I started around this time last year. You can still aim to score a 100%. What you require now is full focus. However, full focus does not imply studying 24x7. Take proper breaks and do the stuff you enjoy too for a little while to ensure that you don't get drained out but when you study, make sure that you make the most of those hours. Make sure you're energetic, attentive and focused. Shorts breaks of 5-10mins are also advisable after every hour or two. Aim to complete your syllabi by November. Then your focus should be on revising your chapters and solving papers from mycbseguide.com . Make sure that you revise your complete syllabus at least thrice. Referring the right books is also very important. You can use Together With to have an idea about the previous exam. Also, you can choose one chapter per day  from the book for accountancy and solve all the questions. Do this at least twice. Your concepts will be on your fingertips. For economics, TR Jain is the best option (helped me score 95). Bst paper is completely based on NCERT (helped me score 95). For accountancy use Together with, TS Grewal and Siddqui. (Helped me score 98). Also,  definitely follow mycbseguide.com it has all updates regarding the change in pattern, syllabus etc. with a sample. (Quite useful for all subjects.)
