I am in class 12th right now. About 6 months left for the class 12th board exam for 2016. How should I prepare from today in order to get above 95%? What should I study for PCM?
Hey Follow only & only ncert, do all it's questions including examples intext, thoroughly. Divide your syllabus into topics that to be learned daily, meant to say break your goal into simple small targets for daily. Do study when you want, But a half hour study should be half hour study with every 30 mintues concentration on the topic. Suggest you to do questions of each topic you learn immediately after it. Follow 5-10 year papers of CBSE , and before you know, you'll be having your result with more than 90% marks. There is no shortcut "Work hard in silence and let you Ferrari make the noise :p " I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it. I get lots of same questions so this is copy of one of my answers. Can also refer to Utkarsh Gupta's answer to How do I ace the CBSE boards? Utkarsh Gupta's answer to How do I get 95% in boards studying during 2 months? If one has not started preparing, are 2 months enough for class 12th boards? ALL THE BEST :) Thanks for A2A.
