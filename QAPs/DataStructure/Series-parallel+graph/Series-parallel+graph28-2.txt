Is it easy to score a 95% in the CBSE class 12 boards?
Yup friend your teacher is absolutely correct. Scoring 95 or more is not that difficult. It just needs a bit of hard work. There are a few things you can follow- Have a schedule. I know it is not possible to follow time table for every student, but at least have a rough schedule. Make a to do list. This can help you in many situation. Make priorities. You should know what is more important and what needs to be done first. Put your efforts efficiently. Even if start to prepare in jan even than you can manage 95%. NCERT books a must that you should do. All concepts should be know. Have the skill to elaborate things. To explain a single line procedure in 5 lines or something. Marking in boards is step wise. Do mention every step that you do. Underline the important points and result that you get from the question. Last and the most important point is to go through the last 5 to 6 years paper. Try to solve them. Like write their answers as if you will in the main exam. This technique really works, even i tried it. It really works. A couple of months of focused study can fetch you 95 and above. Trust me on this.                                                                                                                                            ALL THE BEST.. WORK HARD..
