Is the NCERT enough to score decent marks in the CBSE 12th maths?
I will go chapterwise here. I am in my twelfth standard right now, too. And as per my teacher: 1. Relations and Functions: NCERT is sufficient. 2. Inverse Trigonometric Functions: Solve R.D. Sharma. 3. Matrices: Do it along with the solved examples. 4. Determinants: Properties of Determinants from R.D. Sharma. I think the solved examples should be enough. 5. Continuity and Differentiability: For Continuity, NCERT works well, but I have solved a whole lot of assignments for Differentiability. 6. Applications of Derivatives: Solve R.D., again. 7-9: I don't think you've got enough time to solve the entire R.D, I would suggest you to go through the solved examples only. 10. Vectors: Hardly any weightage, NCERT will suffice. 11. 3-D: NCERT hasn't covered all the types. Do the solved examples from R.D. 12. Linear Programming; NCERT works well. Just in case, see the solved examples. 13. Probability: I thoroughly solved NCERT for this, twice, worked fine for me. P.S. The last year's board examination paper was set from R.D. Just do how much ever you can from it. Because we've not got a lot of time. All the best :)
