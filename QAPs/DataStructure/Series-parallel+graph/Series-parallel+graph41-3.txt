What should my daily routine be to get 95+% in the CBSE class 12 boards?
No doubt that for securing 95+% one has to work hard . At the same time one must have the right strategy too. CBSE has definite marking scheme which gives you an idea how the marks are alloted in a given question. Also analysing past papers and giving importance to marks alloted for different chapters may help you in planning your study.
