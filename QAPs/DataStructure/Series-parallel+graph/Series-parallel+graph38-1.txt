I have to make a working model for physics for class 12 CBSE. How do I go about it?
You can try one of these simple electric circuit models 1) Wheatstone Bridge    Just replace each resistance by light bulbs (LED) of equal resistance and show that no current is flowing through middle wire ( by placing LED at G). 2) Rain Sensing Alarm Rain Alarm Project | Rain Water Detector Circuit Applications 3) And gate circuit using transistor     Similarly, you can try for other logic gates. 4) Fire Alarm Simple fire alarm- thermistor circuit diagram - Circuits Gallery 5) Water Tank Overflow Alarm Water tank overflow liquid level sensor alarm circuit - Circuits Gallery 6) Half- wave rectifier 7) Full wave rectifier
