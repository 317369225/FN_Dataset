CBSE Class 12: I got 55% marks in my first term, can I get 95+ in boards? If yes, how?
The answer is damn! YES. But first of all you have to  believe, cos first and the most imp step  towards success is the feeling that u can  succeed. Now coming to how it can be done... So lemme tell you it in a very planned  manner. Lets count your days from now, you  have full 120 days in hand taking one month i.e Feb for revision.  Now coming to the syllabus you'll have  15-16 chapters in each subject I guess as per mine in 12th science. So if you take 4 days to complete a chapter of one  subject u'll be taking 3 month to cover  up your main subjects like  PCM .  So I'm not going to tell how many hours  u should study, but u should complete  your target everyday. As they say break your goal into simple  achievable targets.  The time is pretty enough and don't  forgot to solve 5 years cbse board  question papers. Solving them in proper time will boost  your confidence. And do believe (future belongs to those  who believe in the beauty of their  dreams) In the two months proper study with NO COMPROMISE you'll surely be among  the toppers.And ya coming to your school hours you can easily study at school also.  Completely focus on ncert and if unable to understand it take help from other books but focus should be on ncert (Do all it's questions including intext & examples) . So start now,work hard &Dream big All the very best :) Thanks for A2A Updated 17w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Anonymous
