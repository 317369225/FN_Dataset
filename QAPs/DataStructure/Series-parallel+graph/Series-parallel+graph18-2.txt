CBSE Class 12: I got 55% marks in my first term, can I get 95+ in boards? If yes, how?
That is my story.Just that I had even lower percentages. I too had a great score in 10th but come class 11th and i got a meagre 60%. I was not able to believe my class 11th result. I was not expecting even 50% XD. Then 12th came, I resolved to "STUDY HARD". By the time this resolve went down my throat it was already September. First term exams assaulted me and i got 43%. That is when I left my physics and chem paper. Had I attempted those I doubt i would have even passed. Come December, time for pre-boards. Before I knew what was happening I had already failed in my Physics and Chem papers. I barely passed Computers and had stinking marks in Maths and English. Another New Year Resolution was made (which eventually went down the drain). Preboards 2 were no different. Next the Final Practicals caught me unaware. But never worry about practicals. They'll be great anyhow. All in all I prepared for my boards in 20 days and scored 92%. So i guess you can get 95%. Just focus on previous year question papers and NCERT...got it? Or should I make it more loud and clear NCERT. Better? Dont be tensed. My classmates practiced maths from RD RS and what not. I swear i did not touch any book except my NCERT. Also FOCUS on ENGLISH. That subject sunk me. GOOD LUCK
