Do you have any advice for class 12 CBSE practical exams?
Thanks for A2A. I am a Physics teacher and can guide you for that only.For XII CBSE exam study the marking scheme for the practicals. Remember the paper which you are going to submit that is the most important factor in judging your work because when the examiner corrects the paper then a lot depends on the answer sheet. Write clearly and neatly. If you need to change a reading strike through it and write the new value. There are many scope of fudging the records in Physics practical so do not do anything which may make the examiner suspicious. When performing the experiment specially those with electricity do not panic if the circuit is not functioning. It happens with best of instruments and most efficient students too. Try to be conversant with the theory behind the experiments. For example in potentiometer experiment if you are not getting deflections in two opposite sides what could be the reason etc.   Good luck and do not panic.
