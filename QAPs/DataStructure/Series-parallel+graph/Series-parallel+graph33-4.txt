How do I get 90% + % in 12 CBSE?
CBSE isn't very tough. You must be having your boards this year itself. Be thorough with all the concepts. Solve previous year board question papers. For physics, be thorough with the derivations and numericals. For chemistry, I would say work more on organic part. For maths,Â  practice as much as you can.
