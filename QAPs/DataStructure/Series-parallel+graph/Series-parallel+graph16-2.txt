What are some projects for class 12 boards in physics, chemistry and computer science ?
I suppose this is for a high school project. I won't tell you exactly what to do but I would suggest you to do some experimental work. Possibly build a simple experiment that verifies some physical law or make a gadget using the physical laws you have learnt in school. You can also try to make something useful from the junk in your courtyard and then verify physical laws. You can also use several experiments to measure one physical constant properly, for example design three experiments which can measure [math]g[/math], acceleration due to gravity and compare your results. Justify your choices, which experiment is best etc. Climb to the 20th floor of a building and repeat these experiments. Verify the effect of height on [math]g[/math].
