How do I get 95% in boards studying during 2 months? If one has not started preparing, are 2 months enough for class 12th boards?
I've had this experience, studied only during last 2weeks in fact. 1) look into the syllabus, blue print of paper so that you can mark out those chapters which doesn't have weightage OR has questions which are all optional. 1a) You'll surely be knowing some math at any given time. Make sure every morning and night you do only math. Dedicate about 2-3 hrs in morning and night for that. 2) Subjects like chemistry takes time to mug, plan your time, and set it before you set to mug that subject. This holds the same till an extent for physics. 3) for languages  better ask the teacher, he'll be able to guide you through. Take some topper's notes, refer a guide, mug again. 4) for Subjects like Computer Science, stick to textbook, ask the faculty for the type of answers they expect in boards. If it's Karnataka PUC board, again try remembering the logic of a program and DO IT AS GIVEN IN THE TEXTBOOK ONLY. DO NOT DEVIATE MUCH from the prescribed book. 5) Keep yourself calm and AWAY from people who spread tensions, or continuously ask questions or pester you with knowledge, unless of course you can cope with them. But do take necessary help from classmates, a person who has the determination to succeed will also seek help!  That's it I suppose :) Best of luck.
