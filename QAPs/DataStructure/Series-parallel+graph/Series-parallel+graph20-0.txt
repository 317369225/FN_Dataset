How do I write answers in the CBSE class 12th physics and chemistry board exams so as to get the maximum marks?
Well I have been through this phase and studying physics was a tough job for me back then , but I did improved myself by the time I reached university for M.Sc . Obviously it took a lot of effort on my part as there is no substitute for hard work. So here is what you can do to improve your scores Look for your complete syllabus and refer to the updated syllabus for your class from the CBSE website just so as to ensure that you have not missed out on any topic. Study with your NCERT textbook. Being completely familiar with all question types from the NCERT text book is good way to study while preparing for your exams, particularly Board Exams. Solve previous years’ Board Papers. Lay your hands on Board Papers from the previous years and practice. Do make sure that the publisher is authentic Understand the marking scheme followed by CBSE. Your familiarity with the marking scheme will help you work along by keeping in mind the marks allotted for the various steps in the correct answer. Avoid last minute cramming. It is important to understand your concepts well if you really want to score high in your exams. Sleep well the day before exams. Getting a good night’s sleep will only help you remember all that you have studied and will help you focus better While writing the exam, pay attention to the number of marks allotted to a question and write your answers accordingly. Just cos’ you may know a lot more than is asked, writing it all down will not fetch you extra marks! Pay particular attention to the key terms used in the question and organize your answer accordingly. For example if the question has ‘Differentiate’ your answer should look different from the answer when the question is ‘Explain’. Simple stuff, yet critical to get those marks! I am not saying that this is the proven method or something you need to find what works best for you. Hope it helped.
