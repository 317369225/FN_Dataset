Do you think it's possible to score 90% in 12th Board without taking tuition? If so, what are some tips?
I was in isc board and I got 89 % in my board exam 2015. I was a pcmb student. And I didn't go for any tuition. Some tips that can come handy are: Pay full attention in class when the teacher is teaching and make your own notes. Try to study whatever has been taught ASAP so that it remember it for a longer time. Do not confuse the board syllabus with your entrance exam syllabus. If you are from state board, you need to mug up your textbooks. So start early. Take all exams seriously, for each exam prepare as if it is your final exam. Clear your doubts and be regular in studies. After you are done with studying for the board thoroughly, practice prelim papers of your school and other schools. Previous year prelim papers are also quite helpful. Be sure to go through last ten years board papers as this will give you a insight into your preparation and also give you a idea of various questions from each chapter. Sleep well. IT IS A MUST! Last but not the least ENJOY YOUR LIFE!!!! Hope you found my answer helpful! Have a good day and ALL THE BEST....
