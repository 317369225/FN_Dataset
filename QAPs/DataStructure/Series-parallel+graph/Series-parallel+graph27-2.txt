How do I score 95 or more in the CBSE Class XII chemistry?
I think you've already done enough to score 95+ Now since you still have time, try solving the last 5 years papers honestly though you've already solved last 2 years because that's not enough and also do the sample papers if you still have time left after that. Also, if you're done with everything try solving back questions from comprehensive and revise the formulas/reactions whatever before the exam. You'll do well.
