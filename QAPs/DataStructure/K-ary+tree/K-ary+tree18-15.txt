Why is e-commerce such a hot area in venture capital now?
Selling products is never old. Having been in at the start of the first boom (I co-founded and was CEO of UK's biggest online DVD store 1997-2002) and having survived the inevitable bust, we were clear that real revenues trump virtual revenues! :) Moving to today, software is cheaper and easier to learn/build/use, massive social networks are easier to exploit, CPMs are reducing all the time and almost every part of the e-commerce machine is measurable and can be benchmarked. What's not to like! BTW we are putting our money where our mouth is on http://gingerparts.com/ for motorcycle parts and accessories. Early days, but it's fun to grow on our wits and experience!
