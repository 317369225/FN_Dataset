Should I rather study CLRS or "cracking the coding interview" in my free time in university?I'll be in university for three more years so the only interviews I'll have will be for internships. However I looked a bit through "cracking the coding interview" and some of the problems look fun to work on. Should I just start doing them or rather work my way through CLRS? Or a mix of both? I already had an algorithmics class, so I know the basics.
I think you can mix of both, since you have a lot of time before graducate.  The CLRS will give you a systemic view of how to write algorithm and prove their correctness and time complexity.  I think this is more like the cores of algorithm design and implementation. Like an old Chinese saying "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.".  Unlike the "cracking the coding interview" which in my opinion focus more on how to practice solve interview problems,  CLRS will teach you the thought behind algorithm design and implementation, which is very important if you encounter unseen problems.  But the CLRS sometimes fall into too details about proving the correctness of time complexity bound of an algorithm, which may seem boring sometimes. At that moment, I think you can read some practical problem of "cracking the code interview" or even practice on online judge like leetcode etc.
