1,000 participants take an examination which consists of 100 questions and 5 options per question. What is the best approach (algorithm) to find all possible pairs of participants with at least 80% match in the options they chose?Looking for the fastest algorithm. Space and processing are lesser of constraints but should be optimal as far as possible. A close-to-real-time solution of getting the match %ge for a chosen participant across all participants would be an ideal soltuion
