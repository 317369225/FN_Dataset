Why is e-commerce such a hot area in venture capital now?
Here's why e-commerce is cool again: Social is changing the game (Facebook vs. Google). For the first time in a decade, Retailers have a net new source of traffic, in Facebook. Typically only 1-3%, but as much as 7-8% of traffic to retail sites is coming from Facebook. Google still drives 25-35% from organic and nother 30% from PPC. But they're sweating a little bit because of Facebook. It's the dollars, stupid. E-commerce is all about the numbers. Traffic X Conversion X AOS (order size) = Sales. Retailers think in terms of percentages and fractions of percentages (if they used "basis points" like finance people, they would sound even cooler). As a result of this metric-orientation, anything that can drive improvements can be a very valuable. Shopping is inherently social. This certainly varies by category, but by and large, consumers rely on trusted friends to give them purchase advice. As a result, anything that makes online shopping social is a natural extension of offline behavior. You can imagine sharing purchases and reviews for brands like Quicksilver, REI and Callaway ("I just bought this sweet 5-person tent. Let's go backpacking!"). In fact, a PowerReviews study found that when consumers share product reviews to Facebook, they garner a 70% feedback rate (Likes and Comments). And each review shared drives $15.72 in sales through incremental traffic: http://www.powerreviews.com/info...While it's early days, retailers realize they cannot ignore these trends. As a result, a wide variety of social commerce companies in particular are seeing interesting traction, whether mature startups like PowerReviews (my employer), or emerging products such as Curebit and ShopSocial.ly.
