Originally Answered: Lifestyle Design:Â If you had one wish, what would it be?I wish I had a healing touch. My Dad was very sick for two years and died of cancer last December. It was very difficult to witness something I could do nothing about. I could wish for a lot of things, but when you watch someone you madly love suffer, all you want is to be able to fix it.
