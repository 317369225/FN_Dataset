If there had definitely been a global flood, as depicted in the Bible, what form would the supporting scientific evidence take?
Flood mythology is most likely rooted in the global sea-rise attached to the end of the last ice age, so yes, there was a "flood" which inspired but was in very few ways similar to the biblical deluge. It didn't even come close to covering the mountains, but we do have a very frightening analog in the modern world: climate change-induced rise in sea level.  Assuming that the human population lived predominantly in coastal regions or close to major bodies of water, and that sea levels may have risen by as much as 30 feet in quite a short period (help with sources, please!), there is every reason to believe that all of the world's great flood myths are based in fact, despite obvious deviations in the details. Evidence for the "flood" is out there, well documented, and clearly visible to the everyday observer.  The Great Lakes are one very obvious remnant of that flooding. Updated 3 May • View Upvotes
