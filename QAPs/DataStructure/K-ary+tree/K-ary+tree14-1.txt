What are the skills that Google and other top level companies look for in a CV before calling a candidate?
Google and such companies are always in search of candidates who think out of box. There is no fix set of steps that you'll follow and land in Google. But still I will share with you what I learned from my friends in Google. No need to be a 'pro' in all computer languages . Since you know you are good in Python, try to become best in next 1 yr. Also you need to be very good with "Algo stuffs". Start participating and improve your rank on online code contests. Participate in Google Code Jam. Create an account on  https://github.com/  and start contributing to open source projects. Your CV should have few projects that you have contributed to. Your previous work experience wont count more then your contribution in open source projects , unless its in some good product oriented company. Guys with years of experience in service oriented company any no open source contribution are shown the gates even before they enter Google campus. Updated 12 Mar • View Upvotes
