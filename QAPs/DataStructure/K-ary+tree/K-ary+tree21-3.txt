Originally Answered: What would be your last wish before you die?I would wish that if the bible thumpers happen to be right, God will make an exception for this lowly heathen and allow Saint Peter to let me in. Plus I would wish that there be no more starvation or disease or war, and that when Thom Yorke arrives in heaven I'll finally get to meet him and he will ask me to marry him.
