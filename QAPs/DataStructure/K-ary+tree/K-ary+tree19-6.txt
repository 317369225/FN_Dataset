If there had definitely been a global flood, as depicted in the Bible, what form would the supporting scientific evidence take?
Any global geologic record will be in the form of a thin sedimentary bed which can be carbon dated to the same date regardless of its location.  There are worldwide ash layers which record volcanic eruptions.  These are used to definitively date strata above and below the ash layer. A global flood lasting forty days and nights would leave a thin indicator bed of clay deposited as the waters receded and the ground dried out.  The thickness of the bed would be fairly uniform worldwide. Needless to say, there is no evidence of such a clay bed, or of any global flood.
