How long does it take for OSPF to converge in a k-ary fat-tree topology built from 128-port switches from a cold state?A k-ary fat-tree topology will support more than 500k hosts, and a lot of alternative paths. Let say the data center is recovering from a power outage and you turn on all your switches at the same time. What happens? Will OSPF converge in sub-second, sub-minute, or sub-hour?
That depends on the implementation.
