Why is e-commerce such a hot area in venture capital now?
For years, there was little innovation in eCommerce (both in technology and business model). Online price comparisons was the biggest (and pretty much only) value-add for consumers for many years.   This has changed in the last 3-4 years - think Social Commerce, Group Shopping, Private Sales, Open Source Technologies, Effectiveness of Marketplaces and Mashups to name a few. All this has led to great shopping experiences.   Then there are other factors - market growth and potential (only about 6% of retail is online, but influences about 80% in most segments), more and more consumers are comfortable shopping online, capital efficiency of setting up a business, easy (and relatively) immediate validation of business models, and still a huge potential for improvements on all ends - customer experience, supply chain, shipping & handling.   It is not hard for anyone to notice this potential. For VCs, well, it is their bread & butter! Updated 17 May 2014 • View Upvotes
