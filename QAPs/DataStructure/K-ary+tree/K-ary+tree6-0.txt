Why would anyone need to use a logarithm base other than 10 or 2 from a practical application standpoint?
Well, log b x=logx/logb  , so up to a scalar factor there's really only one logarithm function; in principle, so long as you have one of them you can use it for whatever else you need. That said, natural logs are easy to calculate, whereas base-ten and base-two logs are basically impossible to calculate without recasting them in terms of natural logs.  Further, natural logs play nice with calculus, whereas the other logs drag around little factors with them that you have to keep track of.  It's analogous to the difference between measuring temperature in Kelvin versus Fahrenheit -- you're probably more used to thinking in Fahrenheit, but it makes all your calculations take three times as long (and gives you three times as many chances to screw something up) to use them for any serious work.
