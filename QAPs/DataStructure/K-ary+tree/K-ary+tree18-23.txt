Why is e-commerce such a hot area in venture capital now?
In the last few years with proliferation of daily deals, flash sales sites has made eCommerce more main stream and more and more consumers are buying online and buying on mobile. In general, ecommerce is not very high margin and if you are holding inventory then it is even tougher. So I am not sure if all ecommerce is hot ex: flash sales sites have to yet prove they can become huge profitable companies. But ecommerce is here to stay and sites such Etsy can be very successful or Amazon could be the first trillion $$ company.
