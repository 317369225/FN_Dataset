What is the process for a normal student to start from very basic coding to high level coding so I that I can solve problems from CodeChef TopCoder etc?
1. Programming Language to start with. I started with C as it is the most basic and easy to learn programming language. 2. Books: Just start a little bit with Yashwant Kanetkar. But as soon as you hold a grip of the language switch to Kernighan and Ritchie. 3. At first, practice questions from Kernighan and Ritchie only. 4. Then start doing easy problems at Codechef, Hackerrank and Codeforces to get acquainted with competitive programming. 5. Side by side start doing Data structures from Tennenbaum or Schaum Series or from any of the online sources. Also start practicing competitive questions on Data Structures. 6. After practicing these for sometime, start doing some Algorithms which you encounter in various contests. You can also read Cormen for Algorithms. 7. Finally practice questions on each and every topic you learn. Data Structures and Algorithms See this link for various Algorithms and Data structures.
