What is the process for a normal student to start from very basic coding to high level coding so I that I can solve problems from CodeChef TopCoder etc?
start with c and learn some programming techniques with c...then go for "PYTHON " my favourite language and you don't need to care about data types and range while solving problems if you gonna use PYTHON...after all start learning an algorithm for a day and try to read the topcoder tutorials which will be useful...GEEKSFORGEEKS will introduce you some algorithms and learn them after making yourself strong in DS... before going into codechef try some easy SPOJ problems in this order /problems/classical/sort=-6,start=0(append this to the spoj url)and try the problems in this order... Happy Coding...!!!
