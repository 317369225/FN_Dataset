If there had definitely been a global flood, as depicted in the Bible, what form would the supporting scientific evidence take?
The water problem. There isn't enough water to cover the tallest mountains. Creationists would argue that Earth was a lot flatter then. The mountains lower and presumably the abyss shallower. Never mind that the bible doesn't say absolutely anything about this. The bible needs to read literally but you can pile the bull at will in whatever it doesn't mention. Of course, earth being flatter at the time of the flood answers that question but leaves many more difficult questions to answer. We need a process through which all our mountain ranges rose from the humble hilly antediluvian origins into their current heights. The energy to raise the Himalayas, the Alps, Andes, Rockies, and all others in only 5000 years is crazy large enough that there would be more than sufficient evidence of that process. Not to mention we would have stories on every civilization about mountains rising several feet every day. I know I would have written about it if I saw that, just as I would have written about all the dinosaurs that survived the flood (because apparently the ark was loaded with dinosaur eggs that rolled into it by pairs).
