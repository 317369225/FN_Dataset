What are the 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm problems?
I found this article and i believe it is a must read for every programmers by Kaushik MV - How do I Learn to Code ? The top 10 are - Dynamic Programming Divide and Conquer Stack and Queue Floyd or Warshall's algorithm Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm Dijkstra's algorithm Min, Max, BFS-DFS Binary Search Sorting Techniques Greedy algorithmYou can read and understand them completely and thoroughly from Data Structures and Algorithms Tutorials. I found this page which proved to be very beneficial to me. Wish you luck.
