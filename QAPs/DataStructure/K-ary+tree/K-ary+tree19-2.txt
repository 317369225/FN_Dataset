If there had definitely been a global flood, as depicted in the Bible, what form would the supporting scientific evidence take?
There was a global flood, but it was nothing at all like the one in the Bible. It happened billions of years ago, not thousands. It lasted for millions of years, not forty days. And the rain included not just condensed volcanic outgassings, but also giant rocks from space. There weren't any animals around to save, much less people to save them, though there might have been some microbes. The evidence for all of this involves a lot of geology, astronomy, chemistry and so on, and there is plenty of it. Take a look at this to get started: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/H...
