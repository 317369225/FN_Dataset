What is the process for a normal student to start from very basic coding to high level coding so I that I can solve problems from CodeChef TopCoder etc?
Go through the following points and u'll find your way in no time: 1. First of all learn a basic programming language like c/c++(from my point of view start with C because it gives u a far better idea of how stuff works in the program ). Then after it step to some object oriented language like c++/JAVA. Some books for C are "let us C" by yashwant kanetkar,"C in depth" by deepali shrivastav, "C programming by balagurusamy". If u ind these books too easy go for "Denis Ritchie" itself. 2. Second join a website like spoj/codechef/topcoder etc. and start solving basic questions. U'll not be able to solve questions on the go, but don't freak out(this happens to all of us), take reference from the internet, read other people codes(but don't copy and paste) and try to understand them. e.g: on spoj follow one of your friend and start solving problems in the same order like he did when he started programming.this can be found in plaintext version in some one's account. 3. Third, start studying a subject called algorithms which includes study of solving various types of problems.this gives u an insight of how to solve particular types of problems and how to approach an entire new problem. Refer to websites like geeksforgeeks.org for good resource.Also refer to books like "introduction to algorithms" by thomas cormen. P.S: Key to success is PRACTICE.
