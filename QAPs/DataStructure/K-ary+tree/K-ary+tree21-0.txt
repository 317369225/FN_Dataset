Originally Answered: If you're going to die soon, what would be your last dying wish?"Whats so funny 'bout peace love and understanding?"  "What happened to all that lovely hippie shit?" and "Try a little tenderness."  Okay, these are songs or snippets of songs,  but they do speak my mind. I'd like ALS to be GONE, Alzheimer's Disease eliminated, cancer eradicated, and all people everywhere to be fed and clothed and happy.  No more war, and certainly no more politics.   Other than that, I'd like my husband and my brother to be nearby.  I suppose I would like for God to smite my enemies.  Bastards.  (Sorry! Nobody's perfect!)
