Should I rather study CLRS or "cracking the coding interview" in my free time in university?I'll be in university for three more years so the only interviews I'll have will be for internships. However I looked a bit through "cracking the coding interview" and some of the problems look fun to work on. Should I just start doing them or rather work my way through CLRS? Or a mix of both? I already had an algorithmics class, so I know the basics.
I strongly recommend taking a look at Elements of Programming Interviews. I felt the questions there were far better in preparation for interviews as compared to CTCI. CLRS is great if you still need to learn the algorithms/data structures to do well on these problems.
