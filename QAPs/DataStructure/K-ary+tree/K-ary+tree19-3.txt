If there had definitely been a global flood, as depicted in the Bible, what form would the supporting scientific evidence take?
All of the remains of all the animals killed in the flood would be evenly distributed vertically through the geologic column and geographically across the globe. All the sections of the geologic column would have the same radiometric date. There would be no surviving freshwater fish. There would be enough water in the ecosphere to cover Mt. Everest. All the animals would have traveled from Turkey to their various widely distributed locations and islands. The DNA of each species of animal would reduce to two of each kind approximately 5000 years ago. In other words, each species and variation of every animal would have been been produced by natural selection in the past 5500 years.
