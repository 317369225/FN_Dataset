What were some questions asked by Oracle and FB to the highest paid IITians?
Thanks for A2A. This might be one of the trickiest questions asked, no kidding: Why Oracle? Anyway, the questions were pretty much of similar fashion as on would expect with other software giants. Some questions were very specific pertaining to the team they were hiring for. Updated 19 Mar • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Prashant Tambey and Harshit Gupta
