Should I rather study CLRS or "cracking the coding interview" in my free time in university?I'll be in university for three more years so the only interviews I'll have will be for internships. However I looked a bit through "cracking the coding interview" and some of the problems look fun to work on. Should I just start doing them or rather work my way through CLRS? Or a mix of both? I already had an algorithmics class, so I know the basics.
