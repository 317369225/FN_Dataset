Should I rather study CLRS or "cracking the coding interview" in my free time in university?I'll be in university for three more years so the only interviews I'll have will be for internships. However I looked a bit through "cracking the coding interview" and some of the problems look fun to work on. Should I just start doing them or rather work my way through CLRS? Or a mix of both? I already had an algorithmics class, so I know the basics.
Introduction to Algorithms (aka CLRS) and Cracking the Code Interview (CTCI) serve completely different purposes. CTCI won't teach you computer science. I see CTCI as resource to use before doing interviews, whereas CLRS allows you to work on your algorithms and data structures knowledge. In a nutshell, if your algorithms and data structures background is already solid, you probably don't need to work your way through CLRS. If in doubt, read a couple of chapters to make sure you're really comfortable with the concepts (sorting and hashing come to mind).
