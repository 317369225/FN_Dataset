If there had definitely been a global flood, as depicted in the Bible, what form would the supporting scientific evidence take?
There's a marked difference between the changing level's of the earth's oceans, and the total coverage of the Earth.     As early as 300 BC it was put forth that that ocean levels had changed, and land masses too had moved. But it was much later with observations on Gibraltar that the fossil shells etc. were NOT in existence today, and that as various layers became deeper, the deeper they went, the more obscure the fossil. The 'flood' was put forth as the reason for this, while up to this point, the Christian explanation was that God scattered such curiosities about for our entertainment.     I find it a sad comment that 2050 years ago the Greeks had a handle on it, yet present creationists are intent upon validating their fables never the less.
