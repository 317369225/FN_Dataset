If there had definitely been a global flood, as depicted in the Bible, what form would the supporting scientific evidence take?
There would be global flood deposits, no fish at all, physical evidence of a mass extinction, DNA bottlenecks, no trees over 6,000 years old and much more water than we actually have.  The only explanations for the flood are:  1. It was all cleared up with magic.  2. It's a myth.  Given the lack of evidence for either a global flood or magic, my money's on option 2.
