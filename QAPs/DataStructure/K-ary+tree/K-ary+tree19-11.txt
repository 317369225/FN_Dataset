If there had definitely been a global flood, as depicted in the Bible, what form would the supporting scientific evidence take?
The depiction of he great flood in the Bible is scientifically not possible. The whole story is intellectually flawed. A 12 year old might be persuaded to believe it, but for adults with normal intelligence and not on strong , mind altering medications it cannot possibly be believed. There is not even a remotely believable scientific evidence of it happening. Don't waste your time on the Bible or the Quran if you are truly interested in science.
