How would several people secretly agree on a common private key?I imagine these people generating their own private/public keys to safely share information 1:1, but what about 1:N sharing within the group without encrypting the message more than once?
Elect a master from the group. The master generates a shared secret (the private key) and then distributes it to the parties through a secure channel. The master could do Diffe Hellman with each node to establish a secure channel with each node. This still involves generating N private keys, but that's only used for bootstrapping. After the master key is distributed all of the extraneous keys can be discarded. I can't think of anything off the top of my head that avoids generating N keys. If you organized the nodes into a k-ary tree then the work of distributing the key could be split among the nodes (eg, share the key with your children and then tell them to share among theirs etc).
