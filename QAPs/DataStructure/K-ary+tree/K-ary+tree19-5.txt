If there had definitely been a global flood, as depicted in the Bible, what form would the supporting scientific evidence take?
There would be enough water on earth for this to be a possibility The water wouldn't have covered Ararat by 22.5 feet: it would have covered Everest There would not be civilizations that didn't seem to notice the flood that was supposed to have covered them There would be genetic signs of a bottleneck in populations There would be a huge diversity of life in the Middle East, and close to no animals at all on places far away from there, like Australia. Humans would be in the Africa, Europe, and Asia (nowhere else) except that... We would all be dead, since all the plants on earth would have died after being underwater for a year, and... Most marine life would be dead. Freshwater dwellers wouldn't have been able to handle the increased salinity, and salt water dwellers couldn't have handled the decreased salinity
