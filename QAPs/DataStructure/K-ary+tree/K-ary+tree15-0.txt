1,000 participants take an examination which consists of 100 questions and 5 options per question. What is the best approach (algorithm) to find all possible pairs of participants with at least 80% match in the options they chose?Looking for the fastest algorithm. Space and processing are lesser of constraints but should be optimal as far as possible. A close-to-real-time solution of getting the match %ge for a chosen participant across all participants would be an ideal soltuion
Initially i thought about 5-ary tree next node of each node depends on which option is chosen This would mean the total number of nodes present are 5^0 + 5^1 ... + 5^99 = 5^100 -1. Then we pre process the leaf nodes and connect all the nodes who can be obtained by maximum 20 options that were differently chosen. Once this is done we can traverse down the tree and then on reaching the bottom most node we can traverse the connected nodes which are 80% similar ( since they are connected like a linked list ) and can have buckets containing the people who reached those nodes by the tree traversal. Hence you get the pairs but the pre-processing involved is large . So if the number of people are n and the number of questions are k then the max time you require is O(k) to find the pairs once the preprocessing is done.
