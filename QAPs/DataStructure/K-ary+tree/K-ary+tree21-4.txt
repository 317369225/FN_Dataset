Originally Answered: What would be your last wish before you die?I have have been with the same crazy lady for almost 36 years. For her I would want financial security so she could live out the rest of her life comfortably. I have also had the privilege of sharing my life with two parrots and a cockatoo. They are the closest things I will ever have to children. They will probably all outlive my wife and I, so for them I would like to see them placed in a home, with a family, with people who would love and care for them as much as we have.
