Should I rather study CLRS or "cracking the coding interview" in my free time in university?I'll be in university for three more years so the only interviews I'll have will be for internships. However I looked a bit through "cracking the coding interview" and some of the problems look fun to work on. Should I just start doing them or rather work my way through CLRS? Or a mix of both? I already had an algorithmics class, so I know the basics.
As already mentioned in some answers, both the books serve completely different purposes. So, mix both will be best, as per your requirement. For solving questions, I would suggest this site : Sign In for Coding Interview Preparation at InterviewBit, similarly for understanding topics and implimentation you may go to : GeeksforGeeks | A computer science portal for geeks , and if you have enough free time and interest you should try Competitive Programming.
