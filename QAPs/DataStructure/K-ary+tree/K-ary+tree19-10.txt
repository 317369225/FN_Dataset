If there had definitely been a global flood, as depicted in the Bible, what form would the supporting scientific evidence take?
1. Enough water to cover the earth to the depth described in the narrative. (There isn't enough.) 2. Some form of solid "canopy," as described in the narrative. (this canopy, called the "firmament" in most English translations, does not, and has never, existed.) 3. Evidence that a population bottleneck that severe would not have meant extinction for all species on the ark. (See Minimum viable population) If any of these were possible, then the one physical evidence I would expect to see would be a layer of more-or-less uniform sediment in one place in the geological column 60-80 feet thick over all of the earth.
