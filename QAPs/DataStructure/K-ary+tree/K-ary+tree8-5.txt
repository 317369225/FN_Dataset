What is the process for a normal student to start from very basic coding to high level coding so I that I can solve problems from CodeChef TopCoder etc?
Start with C/C++, These were my first languages. Some people would suggest Python, but i think C/C++ have a vaguely similar syntax with some other common languages like javascript or C# when compared with Python. So learning 'c' would help in learning those languages later. Anyway learning C/C++ also makes learning Python easier too. Â For learning C, I would suggest this book: Head First C - Free Download eBook - pdf Of Course just reading it isn't going to be enough. You would have to start practicing programming along with the book. Try Hackerrank's warmup questions on algorithms to get started and consequently move to harder and harder questions. HackerRank You could similarly try out questions on codechef with a higher accuracy rate to get started. Once you have knowledge about simple algorithms, recursion etc. then you can learn about Datastructures and Algorithms. Practice makes perfect. Good luck.
