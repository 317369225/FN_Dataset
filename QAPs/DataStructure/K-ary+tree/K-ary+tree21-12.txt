Originally Answered: Lifestyle Design:Â If you had one wish, what would it be?My one wish would be to be able to meet myself. Something like being able to duplicate myself, change the appearance of my duplicate self and meeting me. I want to know what I am like in eyes of me. Bit too complicated I guess!!
