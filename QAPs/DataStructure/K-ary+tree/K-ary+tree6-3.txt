Why would anyone need to use a logarithm base other than 10 or 2 from a practical application standpoint?
In physics they generally use natural log even though yeah it's all interchangeable (as long as you scale by 1/log(2) or 1/log(10)). Several practical uses from computing/algorithms: celling log16(x) or log8(x) is the number of hexadecimal (or octal digits) needed to express x. there are very simple Taylor series for log(1+x), log(1-x) using natural logarithm. Can't do that for base-2 or 10, you have to scale by 1/log(2) or 1/log(10). log_K(N) is the depth of a (balanced) K-ary tree with N elements. Basic result but very important. if you want to binary-search an array or list of length N in the situation where you know there is at most one error/discrepancy somewhere in it, then you need to make ceil(log2(N)) tests. base-10 log is useful (and clear) for dealing with large numbers, e.g. salaries. Take a Cox-Box transform to normalize their distribution, so you can build a random-forest or linear-model. But you could also use natural log. Updated 1 May 2014 â€¢ View Upvotes
