If there had definitely been a global flood, as depicted in the Bible, what form would the supporting scientific evidence take?
The probable story is this. There was a bit of a rainy few days and the rivers overflowed a bit. As it's really flat in Mesopotamia, it didn't take much for the whole plain to be completely covered in water. Luckily, some guy had a boat he'd just built, which was big enough to get his family and a fair few of his livestock into it. They stayed in it till the water went down a few days later and started out again wherever it was their boat fetched up. The guy whose boat it was kept telling the story to everyone who would listen and it sort of got exaggerated a bit. I understand that archaeological research has demonstrated that this scenario may have happened quite a few times. Bear in mind that "the whole world" consisted of a few square miles in those days, and (as long as you have your critical thinking cap on) it should be fairly obvious how literally it is advised to take this tale.
