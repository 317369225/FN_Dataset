What is the process for a normal student to start from very basic coding to high level coding so I that I can solve problems from CodeChef TopCoder etc?
Start learning Python. There are a number of questions on Quora which will tell you where to learn Python from, and where to practice. I won't get into the details of it. Take a look there. C might be difficult initially, especially since you don't have professors to guide you. Python is relatively easy for beginners. Do learn C after you're confident about the programming constructs. Again, for data structures and algorithms, take a look at threads which deal with these specifically! PS: Follow the UNIX philosophy of small is beautiful. Instead of asking a question to answer many questions at once you could just browse through existing threads where people have discussed about each of your questions in detail.
