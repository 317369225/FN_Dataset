What is the relation between abstract data type and generic structure in Java?
A generic data structure is a data structure where you can define methods for the class but use a generic data type. For example, a class that contains multiple sorting algorithms. This class can allow you to create methods that sort a generic data type but you can instantiate it to sort integers or floating point numbers at run time. Abstract data types, on the other hand, refers to a definition to be implemented. For example, I can have abstract class called List and it has methods like sort(), pop() and push(). The List class doesn't have to be have implementations for these methods. I can choose just to implement sort() when I create a subclass for List.
