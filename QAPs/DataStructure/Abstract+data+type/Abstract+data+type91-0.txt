How often does a computer scientist have to create their own ADT(abstract data type)? Ex: bigint?
If I'm to believe Wikipedia, an Abstract Data Type would be (in my terms) a data type whose internals are hidden and where the public operations on that data type are well defined. So, the "FILE *" data type in C is an abstract data type. To me, the idea of an Abstract Data Type is related to the concept of data hiding - and is part of the design of a good API where "handles" are used to perform actions.Â  A Unix file descriptor is an abstract data type (even if typically represented as an "int".) Any software design where a library and API are designed that involves a handle (or pointer to an struct or other object where the details of the object are hidden) involves Abstract Data Types.
