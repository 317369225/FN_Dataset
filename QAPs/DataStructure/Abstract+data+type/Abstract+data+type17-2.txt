What is the relation between abstract data type and interface in Java?
In Java and even C# (among other Object Oriented languages) here are the definitions: Interface is a contract for the object, may be a procedure or a property (in C#), andy class implementing this interface will and need to sere the contract. Abstract class is a class which has contracts (similar to a interface) but the main difference reside that this class may implement some methods, and this is inherited towards the class you use to derive it. Its a facility like saying: this are the contracts, and some of them are already implemented. They cannot be used as multiple inheritance, inste4ad you can use many interfaces and if the class implments this method (his signature) then all is ok. Interfaces are more flexible and you can implement them without getting the source code, an abstract class you need the source code or compiled class of the class implementation, so its more sensitive to changes.
