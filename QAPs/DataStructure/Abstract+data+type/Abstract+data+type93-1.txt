How would you describe the concept of Abstract Data Types to someone who has no background in computer science?
I wouldn't if I didn't have to. If they need to know what an abstract data type was because they're learning it as a programmer with no previous Computer Science experience, I'd point them at an article such as Abstract data type, or give them the definition "An abstract data type is a type with associated operations, but whose representation is hidden" If the point of trying to explain the concept is to relate it to something they might understand, then perhaps I'd look at something that has an internal state that's hidden, but with external controls. Perhaps an alarm clock, a radio, or something else they could relate to.
