What is abstract data type in the context of OOP? What's an example?
An abstract data type can be something that gives an overview of that data type but not the inner depths of implementation. As I think you want to know its usage in OOP, the best example is abstract class, which is a mere blueprint for the classes that inherits that class. Every child class should have the characteristics shown by base class. May this simple c# code helps you understand it better abstract class Vehicle    {             public abstract void Start();        public abstract void Stop();            }    class Car : Vehicle    {        public override void Start()        {            Console.WriteLine("Car started");        }        public override void Stop()        {            Console.WriteLine("Car stopped");        }    } The base class i.e the vehicle class just declares two methods Start and Stop and because they are abstract, all the classes that inherit from Vehicle have to implement these two functions.
