Are linked lists data structures or abstract data types? Why?
Excellent question!  A linked list is an implementation of some abstraction, the simplest being that of a finite sequence.  A data structure is an abstraction described by an interface (api) for acting on unknown data.  An algorithm is an implementation of an abstraction such as a data structure.  These two concepts have usually been confused in CS education.
