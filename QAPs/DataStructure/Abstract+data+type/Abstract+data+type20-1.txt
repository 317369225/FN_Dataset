How do you explain what an abstract data type is in Java to someone who likes Harry Potter?
Well, an abstract data type is so basic that it can't actually be used for anything real.  It's a starting point for other more useful data types that have a basic similarity to each other because they started from the same base type.  So it's kind of like making the Polyjuice Potion.  It's only a potential potion until you add the final ingredient -- the hair of the person be be impersonated.  After you add the hair, the potion is similar in most respects to all the other possible potions with different hairs -- it just does something completely different depending on that last ingredient.
