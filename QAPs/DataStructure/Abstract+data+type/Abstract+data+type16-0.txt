Is an interger an example of an abstract data type?
The requirements for an abstract data type are as follows: 1) The form that you see cannot be tightly coupled to a concrete implementation Obviously, with integers and ordinals, this is not the case. There is a very close relationship. 2) There needs to be an abstract data type definition, usually given as lambda calculus and/or set logic Bertrand Russell took half a book to prove 1 + 1 = 2 for a conventional number line and conventional definitions of add and equals. It may be possible to use his approach to derive an ADT for integers out of logic far more fundamental, but I have never seen it done. Integers are normally considered atomic and fundamental, although Bertrand Russell must have used deeper concepts. 3) There needs to be a corresponding abstract state machine There does not appear to be any ASM that corresponds to the integers that is particularly useful, other than the trivial one of a number line. I therefore conclude that at normal levels of operation, integers are atomic and not an ADT.
