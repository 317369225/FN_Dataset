In C++, How do I sort the string variables stored in an array in a structure (abstract data type)?
The std::sort() algorithm from STL has two forms, just the range, or the range and a comparator. If the elements in your range / container / array / string are comparable directly, just std::sort(std::begin(x), std::end(x)); would do it. Otherwise, define a way to compare two elements, a bool ... (const T& lhs, const T& rhs) { ... } that effectively returns whether lhs precedes rhs in the order you'd like to see. Keep in mind that the comparison should be transitive, and that the comparator should return false for the objects equal with respect to the sorting you would like to get.
