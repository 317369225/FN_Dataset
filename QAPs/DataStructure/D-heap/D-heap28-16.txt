What are some time-saving tips that every Linux user should know?
Use of find command :) The general syntax of find command is as follows. #find  [Directory]  [criteria] Directory is where we want to search Criteria is what we are giving to search. Eg file name, user name, Inode number etc. The following command will search a file with file name file_name in current working directory.  #find -name file_name http://... The default nature of the find is case sensitive. if u search for file abc, it will list only abc. Not ABC,Abc, abC.  To make it case insensitive use "-iname" instead of "-name" #find -iname file_name The following command will search a file with filename file_name in /etc and its subdirectories.  #find  /etc -name file_name The following command will search a file with filename file_name in / and its subdirectories, i.e the whole system. #find  / -name file_name The following command will search for all the files & directories whose owner is randeep. #find / -user randeep The following command will search for all the files & directories whose owner is randeep and group is ibm. #find / -user randeep -group ibm The following command will search for all the files & directories whose owner is randeep or nibul. #find / -user randeep -o -user nibul The following command will search for all the files & directories whose owner is randeep and group is NOT hp. #find / -user randeep -not -group hp Find and Permissions Find command can be used for finding files with specific permissions. The following command will find the files and directories with 755 permissions. #find / -perm 755 The following command will find the files and directories in which anyone can write. #find / -perm +2 The following command will find the files and directories in which everyone can write. #find / -perm -2 The following command will find the files and directories in which others can write. #find / -perm +o+w The following command will find the files and directories in which others can not write. #find / -perm +o-x Find and file sizes Find can be used to find the files with specified size. The followng command will list the files with size 10M [9.5-10.5] #find / -size 10M The followng command will list the files with size less than 10M. #find / -size -10M The followng command will list the files with size greater than 10M. #find / -size +10M Find and Access times Find command can be associated with access times. A  file has three kind of times. atime - access time. When file was last read mtime - modified time. When file was last modified.  ctime - Change in metadata. When file metadata last changed. We can see the information about the above times using stat command. [root@server ~]# stat abc.txt File: `abc.txt' Size: 0               Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file Device: 802h/2050d      Inode: 621459      Links: 1 Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root) Access: 2010-10-28 16:17:15.000000000 +0530 Modify: 2010-10-28 16:17:15.000000000 +0530 Change: 2010-10-28 16:17:15.000000000 +0530 [root@server ~]# Following command will list the files which are accessed five days ago. #find / -atime 5 Following command will list the files which are accessed less than five days ago. #find / -atime -5 Following command will list the files which are accessed more than five days ago. #find / -atime +5 Following command will list the files which are modified less than 10 days ago #find / -mtime -10 Following command will list the files which are changed metadata less than 10days ago. Changing timestamp, permissions etc. #find / -ctime -10 Following command will list the files which are newer than abc.txt #find -newer abc.txt  Following command will list the files which are older than abc.txt #find -not -newer abc.txt Find and Execute We can execute commands on the result of find, on the flow. Suppose we want to take the backup of all the text files in the system.  The following command will search for text files and copy each to the  dir /text_files. #find / -name  "*.txt" -exec cp {}  /text_files  \; The following command will search for configuration files and copy each to the dir /conf_files #find / -name  "*.conf" -exec cp {}  /conf_files  \; The following command will search for the file with inode number 23453 and will delete it. #find / -inum   23453 -exec rm -rf {}\; Other options To search only in the partition where present working directory belongs to. #find / -xdev -name  abc.txt To search for only the directories of name abc. #find / -type d -name abc To search for only the files of name abc. #find / -type f -name abc If you are looking for an old file its is better you use locate command. its fast. #locate filename if the database for the locate is old, updating it by #updatedb& if the locate command is not found, install the mlocate package #yum install mlocate You can get more details in the following link. http://Usage of find command in redhat linux rhel5
