God: Who gave God his name?
God has no true name as God has absolutely no attributes, not even a name.  By extension, you don't go around saying your first name to yourself when thinking about things.  Rather, a name is used by others to refer to you.  Similarly with God, there are a few names that are used, but that's for our purposes because language has natural limitations (i.e. how to refer to that we cannot be truly named in any way). Judaism has a neat way of getting around this issue.  Sometimes questions are used.  For example, "Who is like you?" is a common way of taking care of linguistic limitations.
