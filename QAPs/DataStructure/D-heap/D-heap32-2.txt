What are the pros and cons of using a hash index instead of a B-tree index?
If all you need are lookups, hash will give the best performance - O(1). With Btree you can do more: -lookup/find - O(log n) -max, min, predecessor, successor - O(log n) -nth biggest/smallest element - O(log n) -rank (no of elements greater or less than a specific value) - O(log n) -sort - O(n)
