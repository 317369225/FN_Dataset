How often do software developers debug with core dumps of Java?
Literal core dumps, the ones when the JVM crashes, unless it's own own or some dependency's JNI code, we just look for an updated java version, or hope it won't happen again. If it does, then you'll need support. If you're talking about a heap dump, when the JVM is configured to dump it, and dies with out-of-memory, it's an amazing dump to discover memory leaks. You can dump it even with the VM running (albeit it will stop) using jmap and then look at the dump with jhat, eclipse map or other tools. kill -3 is also amazing to quickly check the thread stack trace and discover if any thread is spinning in a infinite loop.
