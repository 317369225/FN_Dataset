Which is the best book to prepare for coding/programming interviews?actually some say they like codechef but i dint find it any close to the coding interview taken by microsoft in our campus, i actually want some help may be a book which gives me a chapterwise review for coding interview questions...
Most of the best books are already specified here. But I bought this book recently and it is really good. Elements of Programming Interviews: The Insiders' Guide: Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash: 9781479274833: Amazon.com: Books
