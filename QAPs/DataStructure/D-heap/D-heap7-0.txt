How do you make Turkish coffee?I've been doing it in a pretty ad-hoc fashion. Is there a method everyone agrees on?
Start with a finely ground coffee. Ozgur already suggested a very well known and respected brand Kurukahveci Mehmet Efendi (Translated: Dry Coffee Maker Master Mehmet) Use copper coffee pots if possible (example: http://www.tulumba.com/storeItem...) Turkish coffee is served in small traditional coffee cups. They are a bit larger than traditional Illy espresso cups. (example: http://www.tulumba.com/storeitem...) Use filtered tap water for a smoother taste (nothing too fancy. pitcher filters will suffice) Use cane sugar only if you'll prepare medium or sugared Turkish coffee. (Turkish coffee is traditionally prepared as plain, medium sugared and sugared) Scales: 1 heaping teaspoon coffee (5gr =~ 0.17oz), 1 serving cup size filtered cold water. Sugar Scales: Plain: None, Little Sugar: 1/3 or 1/2 teaspoon, Medium Sugar: 2/3 or 1 teaspoon, Sugared: 3/2 or 2 teaspoons. Put all the ingredients into the coffee pot and stir a couple of full rounds slowly with a spoon. Start heating in medium heat. While stirring slowly 2 or 3 times. Heat until the foam reaches the top of the pot. Remember: NEVER, EVER BOIL COFFEE!. Never reheat coffee. Take it from the heater, wait for 20 seconds to let the coffee grounds to settle. Take the foam with a teaspoon and share it to the number of cups first, then  serve the remaining coffee to the cups. Again, slowly. Drinking: Sip until you taste coffee grounds. This portion is called telve and is not for drinking. Drinking a small glass of filtered cold water (10 ml = 0.33 fl oz) beforehand is recommended to clean and reset your taste buds and palate, letting you experience genuine aroma and the body of coffee.
