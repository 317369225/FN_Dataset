Why are Donald Trump and Ben Carson doing so well in the polls?
U.S. Politics are currently in a populist paroxysm. It has happened in the past. One reason the federal government expanded so much in the 1930s was because the states were paralyzed and unable to cope with the Depression. Populists such as Huey Long and Father Charles Coughlin were influential. And, of course, there's George Wallace, who lead the bolt of working class whites from the New Deal coalition as it broke down.Â  Another time was, of course the 1850s, when parties such as the Know Nothing Party were around; the eventual result was the Civil War, though Know Nothing-ism was more of a symptom than a cause. This happens when elites aren't responsive to ordinary voters (or at least important groups of them), and get further entrenched or paralyzed, suffering what Francis Fukuyama calls political decay.
