What are some time-saving tips that every Linux user should know?
Some bash tricks: History expansion !! = previous command !$ = last word of previous command !-n = nth previous command !#$ = last word of current line !<start of command> will execute the command from history starting with letters after "!" Brace Expansion: {a..b} = numbers a to b in order. {a,b,c} = words a, b, c. Useful for paths: touch /tmp/{foo,bar,baz} Parameter Expansion: Suppose that foo=/usr/local/blah.txt ${variable#word} = removes word from the beginning of variable. For example, ${foo#*/} = usr/local/blah.txt ${variable##word} = same thing, but removes longest pattern matching word. For example, ${foo##*/} = blah.txt ${variable%word} = removes word from end of variable. For example: ${foo%.txt} = /usr/local/blah ${variable%%word} = same thing but longest matching suffix Process Substitution: <(command) = treats the output of command as a file. diff -u <(ssh web{1,2} cat /etc/passwd)) shows you a unified diff between /etc/passwd on web1 and 2 Basically, the entire bash manpage is useful and awesome Updated 28 Jul 2011 â€¢ View Upvotes
