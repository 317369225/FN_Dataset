What are some time-saving tips that every Linux user should know?
There are a lot of data manipulation problems that can be tackled with relatively simple Unix command lines. Before you try anything else, see if you can prototype something with simple tools. You might not want to put it into production as a shell script, but given the size of modern computer memories and the speed of SSD disks, a surprising number of jobs lend themselves to being addressed with brute force. The two hard problems of data manipulation that the traditional Unix command line tools based on regular expressions like awk and sed deal with badly are CSV data and JSON structures. You quickly get into regexes that are messy and also that don't work. For those I recommend csvkit 0.9.0 (beta) - "csvkit is a suite of utilities for converting to and working with CSV, the king of tabular file formats." jq - "jq is like sed for JSON data â€“ you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text."
