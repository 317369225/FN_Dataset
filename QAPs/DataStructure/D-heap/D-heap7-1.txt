How do you make Turkish coffee?I've been doing it in a pretty ad-hoc fashion. Is there a method everyone agrees on?
My approach was to put 4 (3oz?) cups of water in the ibrik, add 1 standard coffee scoop of finely ground coffee, 1/2 scoop of sugar, and a big pinch of ground cardamom. I then would heat the ibrik on the lowest possible heat until the foam approached the top, and then would call it done.
