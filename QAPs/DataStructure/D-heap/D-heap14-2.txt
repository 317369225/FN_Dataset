What is the simplest intuitive proof of Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm?
Originally Answered: What is an intuitive explanation of Dijkstra's algorithm?Release a large pile of ants that all run at the same speed at the source node. Now see what order they visit the other nodes of the graph. As the ants trickle outwards, you'll realize that they reach the closest node first, the second closest node next, etc. If you're familiar with breadth first search, you can also imagine splitting up each edge of length L into L edges of length 1, and then running breadth first search. Of course this doesn't work in practice, but it does give some insight into how the algorithm works.
