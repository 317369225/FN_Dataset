Why are Donald Trump and Ben Carson doing so well in the polls?
Adding on to Peter Flom's answer, outsiders like Trump, Carson, and Fiorina will generally fare better early on in the polls. This early, New Hampshire polling might be the best indicator: there, we're looking at Trump (27%), Kasich (10%), and Bush (10%). Carson is down in 5th at 6%. But there are always issues with predictive polling because it's hard to get samples representative of voting time. In addition, at this point in the race, other key factors such as endorsements aren't quite relevant yet. Most of the current GOP House members, senate, and governors (i.e. the establishment) haven't endorsed a candidate, which would officially make them the person to rally behind. Money being raised for advertising and campaigning is meant to draw voters to the booths, not participate in the polls. Second-choice polling will also be relevant when candidates drop out over the course of the race. The most recent second-choice poll I could find is from mid-August by CNN: it puts Trump in a less commanding lead (14%) to Bush (10%), Carson (10%), Rubio (8%), and Walker (8%); +/- 4.5% sampling error.
