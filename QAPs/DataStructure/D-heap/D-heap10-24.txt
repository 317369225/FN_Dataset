How are students in Indian colleges taught programming?
Scene : 1st Semester - Computer Programming and Utilisation We were in our first lab of this subject. We were using TurboC for C programming. I was bored by some writing problems (I had some prior programming experience). So I decided to change the color of screen. So I changed to red instead of Blue. Ma'm came near to me and told me that "Aapko kuchh nahi ata. Itni sari errors fir age kya karoge" (You don't know anything. You got so much errors how can you do further programming). This was because I changed screen color to red and she thought that it was full of errors. Again for same  course we were in the lecture. We were learning conditional statement in C. So I asked mam Me : What will be the output of if(420) will it go to if block or else block ? Ma'm : Else block (I was shocked) (I understood that mam doesnt know how if conceptually works) (I explained with examples if (0)  and if (1)) Me : Then tell me mam what will be the output of if ('0') ? Ma'm : Else block (Facepalm !!!) (I laughed and I was kicked out by mam from class and eventually got BC grade(AA, AB, BB, BC)  in this subject) This is how programming taught in India. In India we are taught syntax instead of  concepts of Programming.
