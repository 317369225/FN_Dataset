God: Who gave God his name?
In the Jewish tradition God has had a couple names and signifiers. Anthropologists believe that Yahweh was a henotheistic god before the monotheistic God, complete with a wife and royal court of fellow gods. Jewish scripture appears to be a melding of a few related traditions so various traditions had different names ("Jehovah"). Use of the name aloud could be too dangerous; honorifics became names by themselves ("Lord"). Christians had Greek words to add to the equation. Islam had names from the polytheistic tradition in Mecca to draw on (Muhammed recognized a couple female gods, too, before dropping them; see the "Satanic Verses").
