I am surprised no one mentioning grandfathers paradox which is usually used to argue, time travel is impossible. The famous time travelers argument  i.e if the time traveler went back in time to the time when his grandfather had not married yet. At that time, the time traveler kills his grandfather, and therefore, the time traveler is never born when he was meant to be. If he is never born, then he is unable to travel through time and kill his grandfather, which means he would be born, and so on.
