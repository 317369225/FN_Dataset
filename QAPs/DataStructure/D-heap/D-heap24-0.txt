You really should be looking at Cracking the Coding Interview .This book covers all aspects of questions asked in programming interviews. If you are looking for more challenging Algorithmic questions, you should look at : Amazon.com: Algorithms For Interviews (9781453792995): Adnan Aziz, Amit Prakash: Books
