Why are Donald Trump and Ben Carson doing so well in the polls?
Trump is doing well because he says stuff and then doesn't back down.Â  While I find much of what he says preposterous or monstrous, there are a considerable number of people who agree with him. Carson - I think it's partly because he is not a politician, but also because he is sort of the anti-Trump in personality while still being a rightwinger in his opinions.
