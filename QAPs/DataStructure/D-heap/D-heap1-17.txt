What books are a good introduction to game theory?
I recently took a course in Game Theory by Kevin-Leyton Brown at UBC. Multiagent Systems by Kevin Brown and Yoav Shoham was used as the textbook for this course and I found it to be amazing. The book assumes that the reader has minor understanding of probability theory and works from there. I would highly recommend this book. Interestingly enough, Kevin experimented the flipped classroom structure for our course. The first part of the course overlaps with the online Game Theory class offered at: https://class.coursera.org/gamet... The video lectures are very well-designed and is aptly supported with Assignments and exercises! If you are looking to start learning about Game Theory, I would highly recommend that course. Moreover, the advanced level is going to be offered soon; which overlaps with the second part of the course offered by Kevin at UBC.
