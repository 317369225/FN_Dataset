How are students in Indian colleges taught programming?
Here is an incident which happened in my 2nd year. Our Java teacher was teaching how recursion works, and as an example, she gave the factorial program. She copied it directly from the book Java: The Complete Reference, which had the code like this: int fact (int n) { int result; if (n == 1) return 1; result = n * fact (n - 1); return result; } When the same question was asked in the exam, I went ahead and wrote the program in my own way, like this: int fact (int n) { if (n == 1) return 1; else return n * fact (n - 1); } The consequences are not something I expected. During evaluation, she kept saying that it was wrong, because I didn't do it in the same way as given in the textbook. I tried to maintain my composure, but on the inside, I was like "What the hell are talking about? You don't even know how factorial works and you became a teacher?" It took me a while to convince her that the program works, and she finally ended up giving me full marks for that question.
