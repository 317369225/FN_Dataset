Is "be a man" a misogynist remark?
No.Â  Not necessarily, though it could be depending on context and delivery. Saying it to an adult man who's acting like a jerk or a wimp may imply that he needs to grow up (i.e. "stop acting like a boy/child"). Saying it to a female or to, say, an effeminate gay man, would CERTAINLY be misogynistic because the inverse implication is that the individual is not acting "manly enough" and that being female/feminine is somehow unworthy, ugly, lesser-than or unequal.
