Does anyone deal with such problems as setting -Xmx argument in Java more than 40 gb?I think that this does not work for me, because after exceeding 10 gb, it throws Java Heap Space exception?
How much physical RAM do you have? How much large is your swap file? What kind of JVM are you using? Unless you have a JVM that has a garbage collector like that used by the Azul JVM, you are unlikely to get reasonable pause times from a 40GB JVM.
