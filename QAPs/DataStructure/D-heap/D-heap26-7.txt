God: Who gave God his name?
Some people call their cats "Kitty," but "Hello Kitty" is actually a human girl with feline features. A god who walked among us as a human man with divine features might be called "Hello Goddy," but that would have possible licensing complications, so when Marketing realized that "Yahweh" was too hard to pronounce, they just went with God instead. It was not a great branding decision, but changing it now would be like going from Nissan back to Datsun. Updated 10 Nov â€¢ View Upvotes
