Why are Donald Trump and Ben Carson doing so well in the polls?
You can get 9% of respondents to say they support a joke. North Carolina Poll Shows 40 Percent for Trump, 38 Percent for Clinton, and 9 Percent Supporting Deez Nuts As we get closer to actually caucusing or voting in primaries, the (I would hope) ephemeral support for Dr Carson and the short-fingered vulgarian may well evaporate.Â  Remember Herman Cain and 9!9!9!?
