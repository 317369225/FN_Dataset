What should I study for Google, Microsoft, Directi, Flipkart, and Amazon interviews a year from now?Right now i am working in a Service based company in india as SQL developer. I did my Engg from a third tier college. I have mediocre programming skills and I can spend 3-4 hours on weekdays and mostly 8-9 hours on weekends studying.
I really got the answer for the question here. All answers are useful. I just wanted to add that, learning DS+ALGO with books or searching youtube tutorials will take such a long time. For learning algorithms, I strongly recommend to go on Coursera or Udacity. They have really awesome algorithm courses and all are for free. On Coursera, i prefer algorithm part 1 & 2 by Prof. Sedvick, Princeton university and on Udacity, Intro to algorithm. All of this are video lectures with lot of exercises, projects and quizzes. Just go and take a look if you found it interesting.
