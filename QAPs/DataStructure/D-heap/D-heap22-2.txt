If you're given a month to eat one elephant, how would you do it?
One bite at a time.  Seriously, an elephant weighs 5000 to 12,000 pounds so on each of the thirty days, one would eat upwards of 40 pounds of elephant a day.  However if you don't eat the skin, guts, lungs hearts, bones etc and just eat the muscle (meat) it would cut that in half.  Can you eat 20 pounds of meat a day?  how about just under ten pounds for a small elephant?
