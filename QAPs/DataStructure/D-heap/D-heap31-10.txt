What is the most awesome paradox?A paradox is an argument that produces an inconsistency, typically within logic or common sense. Most logical paradoxes are known to be invalid arguments but are still valuable in promoting critical thinking. Paradox
My all time favorite Paradox is "My Dog". Matthew Inman of Oatmeal comics is a genius..he made it as an ode to his dog Rambo but it stands correct for each of our furry friends. Dogs are an unfortunate creature to own because unlike children who turn into adults in their teen years, when a dog gets into his teens he dies of old age. So you spend a decade and a half building an affinity for this weird little creature only to have its life extinguished. Maybe that's why we love them because their lives aren't lengthy, logical or deliberate but an explosive paradox composed of fur, teeth and enthusiasm. And you'll never meet a person who is so genuinely happy to be with you. Source: My Dog: The Paradox
