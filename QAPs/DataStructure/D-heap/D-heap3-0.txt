How distinct is Android and iOS memory management?I'm no amateur in Mobile Development. So detailed and relevant answers would be appreciated.
Well both have distinct memory management. Â IOS has superior memory management due to its os. Its os works as a run time environment which takes care of memory and all shared system resources. And it has apps using ARC which increases performance by automatic releasing of unwanted resources. On other hand android is having java which uses garbage collector. It is quite slow process of releasing memory and it results in lacking speed of application performance.
