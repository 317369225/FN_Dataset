Why are Donald Trump and Ben Carson doing so well in the polls?
They do well in the popular polls because they are interesting characters. They look good on TV and are remembered. That's pretty much all people have to go on at this point. The straw polls (in which Ben Carson is doing okay and Trump is doing awful) reflect what the party insiders and loyalists think of the candidates. This tends to be more about political strategy, ideology, leadership qualities and electability. They also tend to be more risk-adverse than popular polls, and tend to promote candidates that aren't too surprising or untried. Next year's primaries will involve a lot more public interest, something like a public beta test for a new video game. Much larger populations will point to the candidates they like (in light of the straw polls' recommendations) and actually choose the parties' nominees for office.
