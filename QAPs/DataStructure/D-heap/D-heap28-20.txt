What are some time-saving tips that every Linux user should know?
Learn vi and Emacs. You will be surprised, that you can readily operate and jump around in shell with the key-bindings of them. Example: $:> cat data2 | sed '/^$/d' To jump to beginning of line:Â  C a To jump to end of line: C e To go back a character : C b To go back a word : M b To move ahead a character: C f To move ahead one word: M f To delete the content from current position till end of line : C k To undo : C / To delete character under cursor : C d To delete till end of word under cursor : M d To transpose the character under cursor with previous: C t To transpose the word under cursor with previous: M t where, C is Ctrl key, and M is Alt key. If you are using terminal in your linux distribution with menubar present, you may need to hide the menubar for M f to work. For gnome based distributions, you can do that by : gnome-terminal --hide-menubar Similarly, if you are reading a long document, example: cat /etc/passwd | less You can navigate in page by j or C n to go down. k or C p to go up. You can search for something by: /search-phrase (note that you can readily use regular expressions in search). q to quit. I am no expert myself, but hey, learning and taming regular expressions is hell lot fun! sed, gawk, grep hold unfathomable power. They have awesome capability to do some complex task very faster. Example: $:> cat notice This is to inform the student below: PEOPLE that they are detained. Kindly do not bother to attend any class henceforth. In interest of *everyone*. $:> cat people Ted Marshall Robin Barney Lily $:> cat notice | sed '/PEOPLE/{ r people d }' OR cat notice | sed '/PEOPLE/r people' | sed '/LIST/d' This is to inform the student below: Ted Marshall Robin Barney Lily that they are detained. Kindly do not bother to attend any class henceforth. In interest of *everyone*. Possibilities are endless.
