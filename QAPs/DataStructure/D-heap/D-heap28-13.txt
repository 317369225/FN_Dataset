What are some time-saving tips that every Linux user should know?
Install Guake or yakuake and add it to autostart. These are dropdown terminal programs for Gnome and KDE respectively. This really increased my productivity atleat 2 folds.  Default terminal takes  some time to open. Once you minimise a terminal you can't call it directly. These problems are solved with Guake or Yakuake. You can launch or hide Yakuake using just F12 button. It opens very quickly because it is autostarted and waiting for you to call it unlike the terminal which is started when you launch it. Change the shortcuts. User may not be comfortable with the default shortcuts. So, one can change them the way one wants. If you are used to windows shortcuts, you can also change shortcuts to their windows equivalent. For eg. You can make Super+E launch Home folder. Install Syapse. Synapse is a good way to launch programs very quickly. The default Unity dash and KDE launchers are slow when it comes to searching and launching programs. Synapse can also search files and folders and a lot more. P.S: I do realise that these are not universal tips that you can use on any Linux computer. But useful for a Desktop PC user. PC != Windows.
