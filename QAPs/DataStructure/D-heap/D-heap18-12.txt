Why are Donald Trump and Ben Carson doing so well in the polls?
Because they're not traditional politicians- like it or not, this is as close we're going to get to nominating an Independant for President- because Trump and Carson can't be "controlled" by the establishment or the GOP. Is that a good thing? Apparently, a lot of voters think so.
