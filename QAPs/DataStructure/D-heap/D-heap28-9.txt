What are some time-saving tips that every Linux user should know?
Suppose you start entereing a command in your terminal, but realize that you want to execute another command before this one... use Esc-q to put your current entered line on a stack and clear your command line. Once you entered a new command (which can be a blank line), the line which were placed in the stack will be pop'ed back onto your command line. (Works on Mac, probably Linux as well). Edit: This isn't working for a lot of people. If you're among them, check the comments. However, there might be another way, which I found (here – click for details and alternatives): Enter the command which you want to postpone executing Press Ctrl+U Enter one or more commands Press Ctrl+Y to get the command you removed with Ctrl+U back.
