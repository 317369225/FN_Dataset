How are students in Indian colleges taught programming?
This is what happened with me in my second semester Introduction to Programming course lab. (I had some previous experience with programming): Teacher: So, this is binary search. Me: But ma'am, we can also use a while loop instead of recursion. Recursion causes stack overhead and stuff. Teacher: Aap hi aake kyun nai sikha dete yaha pe? (Translation: Why don't you come here and teach?). Me: Ma'am I was just saying there is an alternative way to do it. Teacher: Haan haan sab tumhe hi aata hai na? Hum to bevkoof hai yaha pe! (Translation: Only you know everything right? We are idiots standing here!) As a result, I was scolded for the entire semester for the smallest of things, thrown out of the lab for even opening my mouth and ended up with 76 out of 100 marks in my practical, even after writing all the programs and giving all the answers in the viva. Oh, and did I mention? We use Turbo C. :-) Updated 9 Apr â€¢ View Upvotes
