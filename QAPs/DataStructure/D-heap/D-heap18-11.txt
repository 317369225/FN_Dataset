Why are Donald Trump and Ben Carson doing so well in the polls?
They are doing well because outsider candidates are the hot thing right now, there's big anti establishment streak in America.  What's strange is that Carson is no longer supported primarily by individual donors as he was before; as he has increased in popularity he's accepted some big corporate donations and is being courted by a few big name donors.   If people are looking for someone who isn't beholden to special interests, he's not their guy.  Trump is mainly self-financed.
