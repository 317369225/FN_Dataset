What is the simplest intuitive proof of Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm?
Originally Answered: What's an intuitive explanation of Dijkstra's Algorithm?You are going home from you office. There are many routes which you can take to go home. But today is your wife's birthday and you don't want to be late. So you want to find an optimum possible way to reach as fast as possible. But you have an advantage. Your friends live on each of the route possible to go home. Your office is at node 1 and your home is at node 5. 1) You know that the direct route between office and house is too small and has lot of traffic so it will take at least 100 minutes. So you call your friends on indirect route which are toward 2 and 4. 2) Route towards 2 is a highway but your friend says that it will take at least 50 minutes to go from 2 to 3, so you want to look into another options. 3) You call your friend at route 4 who tells that there is hardly any traffic till intersection 3. But lot of traffic from 4 to 5 which will take at least 60 minutes. 4) You know there is a highway from 3 to 5 and it won't take much time to go home. So you take the route 1 - 4- 3 - 5. And you can reach within 1 hours to celebrate your wife's birthday and she is happy.
