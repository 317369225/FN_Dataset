What books are a good introduction to game theory?
I am no math whiz but was curious about Game Theory as well. If you are looking for something totally general and have heard of Game Theory but don't entirely grasp even what it even is, I would watch the scene in "A Beautiful Mind" where Nash discovers out "Governing Dynamics" (and disproves Adam Smith) it is a cornerstone of Game Theory: I would then start reading through the introductory and review notes (in addition to the class slides) from the Game Theory class at MIT (on Opencourseware) General "Game Theory" classes: MIT 04' http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/... MIT 10' http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/econo... There is also notes from the same class on a website (outside of opencourseware) form 2002: http://web.mit.edu/14.12/www/ Here's the 1st set of slides from the 2002 class: http://web.mit.edu/14.12/www/02F... Game Theory Applied to Specific Fields: "Economic Applications for Game Theory" looks pretty cool: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/econo... "Game Theory with Engineering Applications": http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/elect... "Game Theory and Political Theory" http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/polit... or, Browse All of the classes: http://search.mit.edu/search?sit... Yale also has a course on Game Theory, I believe a lecture from it is posted: http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/ec... *as an aside, if I'm ever looking for some sort of general introduction on any topic I browse the online catalogue of courses on any of these kind of University Sites (or go to Khan Academy) UPenn http://www.sas.upenn.edu/lps/online Cornell http://www.sce.cornell.edu/dl/in... Yale http://oyc.yale.edu/ Columbia http://ci.columbia.edu/ci/ecours... There are also a TON on iTunes University
