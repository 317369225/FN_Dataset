God: Who gave God his name?
No one.   The Bible teaches since God is not restricted by time as are we humans, being unique and ageless in both the past and future, there is no one greater who “gave” God his name.    Genesis 2:4 contains the first appearance in the Bible of the name Jehovah.This unique name occurs about 7,000 times in the original-language manuscripts of the Holy Scriptures. Its meaning—“He Causes to Become”—assures us that God is fully capable of carrying out all that he purposes and promises.The very frequency of the appearance of the name attests to its importance to the Bible’s Author, whose name it is.  It is an expression of his very being.   “He causes to become’ meaning that there is nothing Jehovah God cannot do or cause to happen to fulfill a successful outcome to his purpose.   Just as Christ’s followers ask for Jehovah to take action to cause his Kingdom to come and his will to take place, so we ask for Jehovah to take action to sanctify his name. In other words, we are asking Jehovah to act to clear his name of all the reproach that has been heaped upon it since the rebellion in Eden.   How will Jehovah respond to such a prayer? The Bible teaches He states: “I will certainly sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the nations.” (Ezek. 36:23; 38:23)
