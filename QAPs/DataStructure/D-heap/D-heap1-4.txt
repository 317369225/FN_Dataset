What books are a good introduction to game theory?
Playing for Real: A Text on Game Theory http://amzn.to/cICQuo It is much more readable as a book than the classical works by von Neumann.Â  It is a very good book if you want an overview of the ideas and applications of game theory and want to drive deeper into the mathematics and more advanced areas after you have a good overview. The chapters on evolutionary games and biology are especially interesting. This book combines the mathematics with the underlying concepts very well, where as most of the other text books are dry and mathematically challenging and difficult to apply in comparison.
