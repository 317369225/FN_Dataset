What all basic data structures and algorithms should one learn before starting competitive programming?
To enter in order to make yourself in good Competitive Programming, mostly you should aware of at least basic of each data structure and their auxiliary operation (means creating, searching, deleting, updating, adding etc). So you need to focus on : (1). Array (2). List (3). Queue (4). Tree (5). Graph go in this way only, because this flow is independent, and you need to understand previous one to jump further. Hope it will help you...
