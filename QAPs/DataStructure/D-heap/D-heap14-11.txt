What is the simplest intuitive proof of Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm?
Originally Answered: What is an intuitive explanation of Dijkstra's algorithm?I think about it like this:  If I am standing on the source node in the conquered territory (The shortest distances to the nodes of which have already been calculated), then to get out of this territory and explore a little more of the world, I would take the smallest bridge crossing the territory keeping in view the distance that would need to be covered to get to that bridge as well. I can see the numbers that I have marked on the nodes that bridge my territory to the outer world. These numbers tell me how far a particular bridge is from me now. It's an easy problem after that. I look at the bridge lengths and the numbers and start my journey :-)
