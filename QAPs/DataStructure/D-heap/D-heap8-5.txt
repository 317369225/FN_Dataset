Where are the arrays in C stored, in a stack or a heap?int n; scanf("%d",&n); int arr[n]; In the above code in C, when the prog
Not every array need be static. Even if it is,stack is very limited in size( ulimit -a shows stack of 8192 kb on my system) & will overflow if the array is too big to fit.[segfault] In that case you make them global or static with static keyword. or allocate array on the heap(~ram). int* array = new int[1000000]; & delete[] it later. int * array = malloc(sizeof(int)*1000); if (!array){ // failed, ram exhasted } Side- note: The sizeof here gives size of the pointer & not size of 1000,in contrast to array on stack.
