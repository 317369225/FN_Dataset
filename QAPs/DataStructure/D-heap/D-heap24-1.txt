Which is the best book to prepare for coding/programming interviews?actually some say they like codechef but i dint find it any close to the coding interview taken by microsoft in our campus, i actually want some help may be a book which gives me a chapterwise review for coding interview questions...
In addition to all the great books and resources already shared in other answers I would like to add one more: http://www.hiredintech.com It contains a structured curriculum covering algorithms and system design for tech interviews. You will also find practice problems, preparation plans and some tips for the non-technical part of the interviews. All that is free. I am part of the team who built the site. Our goal was to give people a structured process for approaching the algorithm and system design questions. So, hopefully, this is a useful resource for preparation. Good luck with the interviews!
