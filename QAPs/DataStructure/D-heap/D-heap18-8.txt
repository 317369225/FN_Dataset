Why are Donald Trump and Ben Carson doing so well in the polls?
Frustration with Washington and the establishment is at an all-time high. That's why Bernie Sanders is quickly gaining on Hillary Clinton (who has been in the establishment since 1980) and Donald Trump and Ben Carson (neither of whom has held public office) are edging out established politicians such as Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Rick Perry. Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party were both responses to a Washington that favors special interests and never cuts back. People can't take it anymore-they're sick of slick politicians who are great talkers but empty suits. Donald Trump isn't afraid to say what he thinks, and when people do criticize him and tell him to apologize, he doubles down rather than doing penance ("Boohoohoo I didn't mean...."). Washington should be forced to engage in belt-tightening. Congressmen should cut their staffs and take pay cuts. Other senior officials should give up some perks.
