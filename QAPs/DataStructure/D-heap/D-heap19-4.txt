What all basic data structures and algorithms should one learn before starting competitive programming?
To get a decent software job you need a very good command over  datastructures and algorithms. I assume you had a basic programming course in your first year and are familiar with arrays , linked-list, strings and some introduction to C. With the basic things known you can start learning OOP concepts in C++.I learned if from The C++ Resources Network (just have brief look over the namespace, cout, cin, which are not in C, and then jump to OOP concepts , then learn the STL , become familiar with it(STL) believe me it becomes really handy when you solve big problems). Learn Python which also helps in lots of problems , which can't be solved using C++ (easily), it's syntax is also very easy to understand and learn. Coming to algorithms I would suggest you starting from Graph-Algorithms, and then go to Dynamic Programming. I would suggest you going you through What are the "must known" algorithms for online programming contests? , it has a bunch of algorithms yout need to know. Coming to web-designing these algorithms are not much useful.They may (very rerely) become handy in web-developement. Also participate in Acm-Icpc , there is no restriction on department in  ACM-ICPC.I guess Kanpur would be nearer to you so participate in regionals which most probably will be held this december and if you are selected you will be allowed to participate in world finals which is a very prestigious issue. Finally all the best and Happy Coding.You need not learn before participating in online competitions, you can learn while competing , which is the best way according to me. P.S: I am also a second year non-cse student in IIT-Kharagpur
