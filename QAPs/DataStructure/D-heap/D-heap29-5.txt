What should I study for Google, Microsoft, Directi, Flipkart, and Amazon interviews a year from now?Right now i am working in a Service based company in india as SQL developer. I did my Engg from a third tier college. I have mediocre programming skills and I can spend 3-4 hours on weekdays and mostly 8-9 hours on weekends studying.
Hey. Last month i was also searching for the same thing and then i found out this website called Jobs Hiring Process, it has interviews of students explaining their interview process and what all they did in their college life. I hope these links might be useful for you: Amazon Interview Process - Software Development Engineer - Arjun Gupta Amazon Technical Internship Interview - Software Development Intern - Gaurav Kumar Flipkart Job Hiring Process - Software Engineer - Varun Sharma Microsoft IDC Technical Interview Process - Software Engineer - Gaurav Babbar
