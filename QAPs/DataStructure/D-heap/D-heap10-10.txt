How are students in Indian colleges taught programming?
This happened in the my first year (which was last sem) Problem Solving Using Computers lab. We had to program Newton's forward interpolation formula in C++ (Turbo C++ :| ). We were given a pseudo code, which no one bothered explaining and were expected to convert to a working code. I had converted the exact code, but due to some error with the compiler I was getting out of range error in one of the arrays. So I called the instructor to have a look. Conversation between me and the Instructor: Me: "Sir, I think there is some problem with my compiler." Sir: "You don't even know how to program correctly and you are blaming the compiler for your mistakes?" Me: "No Sir, please take a look yourself" The instructor studies the code for 15 minutes and then asks my friend whose code was working to show his code. He then compared the code line by line. My friend had inserted comments while I hadn't. Sir: "See, you have not inserted any comments." Me: "But comments are not executed" Sir: "Don't act smart, insert the comments first" EDIT: First 100+ upvotes. Thanks Everyone. Honoured. :) Updated 26 Mar â€¢ View Upvotes
