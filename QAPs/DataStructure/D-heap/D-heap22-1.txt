If you're given a month to eat one elephant, how would you do it?
Let's see. There is about 460kg meat on an elephant. 540kg if we add the offal. If a single person were to eat that in a month, they would need to eat 15-18kg per day... it would of course loose some mass after getting cooked and the water evaporates, but it would still be at least 12kg meat each day. I don't think I would do that to my kidneys. Especially not when elephant meat is a delicacy and could be sold. Or if I could cure the meat and save it for the long winter.
