What books are a good introduction to game theory?
I am reading this one: "The Impossible Advantage" - http://www.amazon.com/Impossible... - which applies "Game Strategy" to changing the game in Marketing - which is what I'm most interested in ... if anyone has any recommendations more like this, please chime in ...
