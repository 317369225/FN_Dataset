God: Who gave God his name?
You mean the god named God? Christians did, of course. You see, all gods have names, including the Christian god. He is called Yahweh or Jehovah. He called himself I Am. And while he did say he was "the lord your god," he never actually said his name was god. But Christians, apparently lacking both creativity and a sense of humor, named their god God, which is, of course, the equivalent of naming a person Person. I'm sure there's some verse somewhere in the Bible that can be twisted to justify this, but I will instead quote the Book of Beyonc√©, which says, "Say my name; say my name."
