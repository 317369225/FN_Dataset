What are some time-saving tips that every Linux user should know?
Despite what Chen Bin says, I like having timestamps in bash history. I use HISTTIMEFORMAT='%s ' which gives me one-second resolution should I need it. It's useful for correlating actions with logfile entries and file timestamps, some time after the event. Setting "LogLevel VERBOSE" in sshd_config causes sshd to log key fingerprints in syslog. Then,Â  since "ssh-keygen -l" will list fingerprints from an authorized_keys file, it's possible to audit logins by key. E.g. you might be able to tell not just which user ID was logged into, but which actual person logged in from which laptop. Keep all machines on UTC time and synchronized with NTP. That way, logfiles line up across machines and sites. If you keep using a particular directory, make an environment variable. I set W3 to my webserver document root (originally /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs in NCSA httpd), then use e.g. "vi $W3/index.html". Learn to use "find". Useful in forensics, e.g. "find -ctime -40 -ctime +31 -type f -exec ls -l {} \;" will find files that changed on disk between 31 and 40 days ago. On RedHat-derived systems, "rpm -V -qf `which top`" will tell you if /usr/bin/top has been tampered with (does not match the digitally-signed hash in the RPM database) Don't reinvent the wheel. Don't build a program from source if you can install one using a package manager. If you do build a program from source, build it as a managed package. On RedHat Enterprise (CentOS etc.), use yum-priorities to prefer Redhat and EPEL repositories and ensure that your libraries don't deadlock in dependency hell in a couple of months (if you are pulling in video codecs etc. from non-GPL repos).
