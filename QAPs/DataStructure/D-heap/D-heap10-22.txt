How are students in Indian colleges taught programming?
I would just like to point out the one thing people have missed here. How any lab semester (Including programming) works for us : "Write the code in a sheet of paper and get it signed before you switch on the computer" What some professors do with that sheet : Compare line by line with the program they got. And what the rest do : Don't give a shit. Cos your grades are already set in their mind. Strike a word / Don't write it "neatly" in the sheet -> Reduction in marks. (Mind it, I'm talking about writing in the paper, not the one you code in the system. A prof once actually asked me why is my program not "straight". Perhaps he doesn't know the meaning of indentation) Thankfully, there are still very very few people who don't make us go through this shit and we survive because of them.
