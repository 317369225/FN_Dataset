God: Who gave God his name?
It  wouldn't be too far of a stretch to think that many people over the  ages had certain experiences that changed them dramatically. They got to  a point where they needed to talk about it and share it with others and in the process somehow created a name. A name that would separate themselves from another. Probably, the names were developed as each culture began wanting to write these things down in order to record them. It's likely that the name itself fit the manner, language or dialect in which they spoke in so maybe that's why Yahweh didn't come out to be Krishna. So it was essentially the people writing that named it and in the process could have unknowingly contributed to the vast diversity of many Gods names today. They might have sought to personalize it, just as we do with children we give them a name in order to address them. It wasn't just Christians, Jewish or Muslims, that did it. The Maori from New Zealand used Ranginui and Papatuanuku as the sky parents along with naming all of their children too which to them, explains the origin of the world. They didn't mention Jehovah or Allah at all. The strange thing is that we could all be talking about the same thing, but because we've become rather pigion holed when it comes to religion from what might have happened centuries ago, it creates a tidal wave of problems should there be someone who's had a similar experience in the modern day as one could have had long long ago. Humans came up with the names and it took a lot of people to do it.
