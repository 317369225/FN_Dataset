What do "call" and "pass" mean in Java?I hear these terms "call" and "pass" a lot but confused on what they actually mean. Could someone please provide a Java code example of when something is "called" and when something is "passed". Thank you
This seems like homework as it's pretty self explanatory but whatever - I'll amuse myself -- Call means to call a function - It's kind of hard to explain it without using the word in the definition or getting technical.  Calling a function means to jump and execute the code within a function. void displayTable() { //... }   void anotherFunction() { displayTable(); } Inside anotherFunction(), I just called displayTable. Now, passed means to pass.  More technically, the value or reference is placed on the stack or heap and retrieved from within the function (or rather method). void setBackgroundColor(int iRGBColor) { // Do something with iRGBColor }   void anotherFunction() { setBackgroundColor(4); } Inside anotherFunction(), I passed 4 into setBackgroundColor when I called it.
