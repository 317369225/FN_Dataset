Why are Donald Trump and Ben Carson doing so well in the polls?
As far as what they have in common, neither of them are establishment candidates.  They aren't favored by the RNC, nor have they ever held political office.  They're outsiders. Most of Trump's success had to do with how he resonates with older, white, evangelical, working class men.  They can still remember a time when white men were unchallenged at the top of the heap.  Women, gays and ethnic minorities knew their places.  But they've spent the last few decades watching that erode.  Donald Trump is their last scream of rage about it.
