What are some time-saving tips that every Linux user should know?
This question is very vague, but answers have focused on the shell. I'm taking this question as equivalent to this one: What should every UNIX/Linux shell user know? There are several things to be aware of: Learn the difference between Bash, Korn Shell, and Bourne Shell Don't use cat file | cmd when you can use cmd < file Learn and use the command line editor in Bash/ksh Learn vi - it's much more common than Emacs and comes pre-supported in both Bash and Korn Shell Commands like sudo cat xfile > protectedfile don't work - because the shell opens the redirect files (like protectedfile) before the sudo runs Commands like cmd 2<&1 > somefile don't work as expected because 2>&1 (and similar) copies destinations, rather than redirects Use the environment variable $CDPATH judiciously for ease in changing directory Use cd with no arguments to go to $HOME Read the man page of your chosen shell - and any appropriate book: learn it through and through Updated 12 Nov 2014 â€¢ View Upvotes
