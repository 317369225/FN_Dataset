God: Who gave God his name?
When Moses came down from the mountain with the Ten Commandments, Moses asked God who he should tell the people that he was with.  God said, "Tell the people, ""I AM WHO I AM."" The Jews translated that to YAHWEY.. never to be spoken aloud, so it was originally spelled without vowels.  So God has called himself I AM WHO I AM, according to scripture in the Holy Bible.
