Why are Donald Trump and Ben Carson doing so well in the polls?
I can't say much more than what the other's have said, but I'll try. Ben Carson reminds me of Santorum in 2012. He is an intelligent, soft spoken social conservative, but unlike Santorum he is not a politician. It is apparent that the populous is tired of the status quo and Carson appeals to a large base (of the Republican Party) with the added advantage of not being a part of the "good old boy's club." The Donald is an entirely different story. In my opinion (based in fact, and sound reasoning), Trump transformed the debate on illegal immigration. It is a well-known fact that Republicans need to capture a larger portion of the Hispanic vote to win in 2016. With that in mind, it is easy to surmise that the likely Republican candidates would need to treat the illegal immigration issue with kid gloves. In comes Trump! Now, with the other candidates putting illegal immigration in the back of their agenda, Trump seized a unique opportunity to set himself apart from the rest of the field. Much to the chagrin of those who think (know) the Hispanic vote is essential to a Republican victory.
