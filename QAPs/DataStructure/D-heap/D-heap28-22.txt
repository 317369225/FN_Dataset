What are some time-saving tips that every Linux user should know?
www.commandlinefu.com has great stuff. The escape sequences to control ssh connection is one of my favorites (I think it's rarely known): http://www.commandlinefu.com/com... SSH can be controlled trough an ~ escape sequence. Example, to terminate the current ssh connection, type a newline, then the ~ character, and last a . character. This is useful eg when an ssh connection hangs after you reboot a machine and the connection hangs. Which means you don't have to kill the tty session to get out of ssh if the connection hangs.
