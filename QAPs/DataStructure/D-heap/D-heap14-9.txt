What is the simplest intuitive proof of Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm?
Originally Answered: What is the best way to explain "Dijkstra's algorithm" to a non CS student?Let's say you're trying to drive from New York to Los Angeles, but you must use the roads only. Ignoring gas costs, we want to minimize the total tollbooth cost of the trip. So, let's say we start out going from New York to, say, Pittsburgh, then to Cleveland, Ohio, and it costs $12. But wait! If you go through Virginia and then to Cleveland, it costs only $10. So we assume that it costs $10 to get to Cleveland. If there's a better solution, we replace it until we get the lowest cost at each point. In this way, we've managed to reduce our total cost to get to Cleveland. Now, continue this process through every step of the path until you reach the last city, the destination. You now have the lowest toll cost, and hopefully, a map indicating the cheapest path to store for future reference. In CS terms, Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path (lowest weight) in a set of paths given an input and an output and a weight at each step.
