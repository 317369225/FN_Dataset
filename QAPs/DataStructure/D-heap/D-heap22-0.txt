If you're given a month to eat one elephant, how would you do it?
If I were the sole consumer of said elephant in this hypothetical question, I would probably only need a few days to finish this monstrosity. All edible parts I would place into an incinerator and heat it at over 1,000f. This will significantly reduce the actual mass and volume of the elephant into a heap of ash which I can add to my meals with vinegar.
