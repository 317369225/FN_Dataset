What do "call" and "pass" mean in Java?I hear these terms "call" and "pass" a lot but confused on what they actually mean. Could someone please provide a Java code example of when something is "called" and when something is "passed". Thank you
This is recursive function/method for finding a factorial of a given number. int fact(int n) { int result; if(n==0 || n==1) return 1; result = fact(n-1) * n; return result; } obj.fact(n); In the first line of above code int fact(int n), here you are passing some value to "n". See line 6, here you are calling the same function fact(n-1)*n So, you call/pass a method, class or object etc based on your needs.
