Why are Donald Trump and Ben Carson doing so well in the polls?
Originally Answered: Why are two terrible candidates -- Trump and Carson -- at the top of the polls in the GOP presidential nomination fight?The driving force is desperation among the electorate to rally around anybody who doesn’t represent business-as-usual politics, and unfortunately there aren't many Republicans floating around who can fit that bill and present bona fide electability credentials. The logic ought to be that Senators Cruz and Rubio, with their modest political experience, should be sitting pretty at the top with their Tea Party support; and although their fortunes have improved since the debates started, but neither of them have really had enough time in national office to build a coalition outside of their states (unlike the current once-junior senator President), and as such are fighting for the same group of voters.   Enter Mr Trump, everybody’s favorite straight-magic bullet-shooting, “successful” businessman they love to hate, followed by Dr Carson, a conservative personality who’s so outside the mainstream he’s never, ever held an executive position in business or politics. Fortunately there's still enough time to February for the electorate to decide that, just maybe, these candidates' lack of qualifications (if not capacity) to be President (and at least one of their narcissistic personalities) should be taken into consideration. Jeb Bush is still toast, though.
