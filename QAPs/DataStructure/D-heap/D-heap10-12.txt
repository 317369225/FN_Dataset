How are students in Indian colleges taught programming?
In one line: I would say we were taught programs rather than programming. I still remember the days of college when we were "taught" HTML as part of a paper called "Net Centric Programming." We had a 10 mark question where we had to write HTML markup of a web page on paper. With a big table which was provided and you basically had to write for the table with all rows. NO "ETC." I remember me writing "<br />" instead of the prescribed "<br>" and had marks cut off my paper :D One other teacher did not know that "hover" was a word. We used to have fun when she pronounced it h-over. Some of us who were familiar with CSS asked her just to confirm, and she said it meant "heading over" the reason for it being, the example CSS contained "h1:hover {color: red}" One of the above teachers mention "Wireshark" has nothing to do with networking. Lots of quips to add, but useless. You get the point. These are examples of incompetency in teachers in certain subjects that require teachers to be updated. Like some other answer pointed out, they have been shielded, or shielded themselves from getting in front of a computer and writing actual code(including markup). There are incidents from my college, but I would say this happens in many of the colleges throughout India. Even for postgraduate courses, content for presentations are taken off verbatim from slide decks available online (been there, done that) in MANY colleges because: Students want to do something different, but are not equipped. They want to "look" great. Lecturers are not equipped to understand whether content is original. Grades and the way grades are assigned. Having said all this, we did have a few good men and women passionate about what they were doing. We had some rare occasions where were given a problem and asked to solve. This is just my opinion. I might be far from the truth. Please correct my short-sightedness if any. Updated 29 May 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
