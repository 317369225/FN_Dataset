How are students in Indian colleges taught programming?
In Chennai Mathematical Institute, Haskell is taught in the first programming course for BSc Math + CS/Physics 1st year and MSc CS 1st year students. Haskell is a beautiful and elegant language, and the course is fun and interesting, taught by very competent faculty. A huge contrast to some of the other answers. As for the specific points asked : the blackboard isn't used very much, though might be used occasionally. Slides are used (made with LaTeX+beamer, of course, not PowerPoint or similar (ugh)), you can find some of them here : Index of /~kumar/prog2012 (filenames beginning with "lecture"). Students are never expected to memorize programs, they are supposed to understand the question asked and write a program from scratch which they may not have seen earlier, in the exams. Sadly, this is certainly not representative of Indian colleges in general. (See Ratul's answer for more details and other courses.) Updated 2 Jun 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
