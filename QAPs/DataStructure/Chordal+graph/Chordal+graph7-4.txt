Can a trained classical pianist easily transition to play in a rock band? Does everyone need to learn to read tabs?
It depends.  Some forms of rock intersect well with classical music, but on the whole, I'd say it wouldn't be easy.  Possible yes -- if you liked rock.  But I wouldn't say it would be easy.   One of the harder things for classically trained musicians to do is vamp and improvise.  We can often get locked to the tracks of other people's dots, and if a band is on stage playing something, and the bass player goes, "Okay the next solo is in G, it's yours -- go!" a classically trained layer will freeze up.   You can get past it, but it will take a bit of self-examination and work that you might not have been well equipped to do.   I'd encourage you to try, but I wouldn't say it would be easy.  Good luck.  :-) Updated 13w ago
