Can a trained classical pianist easily transition to play in a rock band? Does everyone need to learn to read tabs?
TL;DR: rhythm is a beast that is hard to figure out. Reading tabs isn't the hard part. Imrov-ing the tabs is the hard part. I have studied classical piano since I was 9. I competed and have learned many classical pieces between then and now; from basic Chopin to far advanced Rachmaninoff. Recently I took interest in learning pop/rock as my friends have been requesting me to do so. The hard part is creating the rhythm or "groove" if you will. Playing the chords is simply not enough. Classical piano heavily relies on voicing while pop relies on chord progression and rhythm. Learning how to create the "groove" is very challenging for me. I have no problem just playing the basic chords, but adding that bit of spice to it is very hard. Furthermore, learning pop is far different than a classical piece. I might spend 15 minutes reviewing the chord progressions and rhythm on a pop piece and can play it acceptably well while conversely spending months perfecting some challenging classical piece. My mind is geared to playing the piece perfectly hundreds of times and memorizing everything I do. Pop/rock is very much more spontaneous and improvised, which is challenges how I process learning.
