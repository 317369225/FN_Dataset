Guitars: What are alternate chords?
From looking at it, the author's intent is to give you common substitutions for the principal chords. It's non-standard terminology. I think he's trying to give you a sense, as best as is possible in a static chart, of the fact that there are many different possible fingerings, some of which aren't even the same chord, that might work in a given situation. For instance, if you play C6 (C E G A) you might recognize that it has the same notes as Amin7 but with C in the bass. Those chords are substitutes for each other, in this case inversions, though the fact that the C6 has the C in the bass will make it sound sunnier than Amin7. If you were playing with a bassist, you might have the harmony of the song specify C6 but play an Amin7 instead, with the assumption that the bassist will play the C.  A more interesting example would be to use a different chord that only part of another chord. G7 has G B D F and Bmin7b5 ("half diminished") has B D F A. You can swap one for the other because the guide tones B and F are in common. B fully diminished (B D F Ab) also works. They are substitutes for G9 and G7b9, respectively. The choice of G, Ab, or A depends on what feeling or color you want to evoke, the melody, and where you want to take things. Try playing the chords C6 A7 Dmin7 G7 and then work through the substitutions given on your chart for each one to see how the progression changes. To keep your life simple, don't alter the C but alter the A, G, or Dmin. You should start to see how the different chords move together.
