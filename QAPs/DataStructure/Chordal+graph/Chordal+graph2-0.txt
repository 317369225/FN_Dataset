What are some examples of advanced algorithms you've learned in school that you've applied in a real work environment? Can you explain the gist or nature of this work to a kid?
Topological sort (not really that advanced?) - to straighten out database script dependencies kNN + Damerau Levenshtein - to build a probabilistic data importer when data columns are labelled but not perfectly. Transitive Closure - for validation of "dependently mandatory" UI elements, which is essentially a reachability problem. Lagrange polynomials and interpolation - for implementing an "n of m threshold scheme" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha...) where you need at least n passwords to be correct before being granted access. Interval trees - for storing large numbers of fixed income instruments in memory and servicing "stabbing queries" quickly.
