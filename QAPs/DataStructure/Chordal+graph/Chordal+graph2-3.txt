What are some examples of advanced algorithms you've learned in school that you've applied in a real work environment? Can you explain the gist or nature of this work to a kid?
I'm not quite sure if this could be tagged as advanced, but the following was used in a enterprise-data communication application - String searching algorithm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Str... For optimizing an  search/replace routine implemented as part of a custom string class  - Shunting yard algorithm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu... For a mini arithmetic expression parser - Graphs traversal algorithms (DFS and BFS): In several routines involving file-system searching and traversal - Hash Tables - Karnaugh maps, not an algorithm in itself, but its a usefull technique to simplify and optimize bitwise expressions (especially usefull if you are working with binary encoded data)
