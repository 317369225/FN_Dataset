Guitars: What are alternate chords?
The terminology here is very non-standard. Here's a better way to understand traditional western chordal harmony. If you number the notes in a scale from I-VII, the chords in any given major key are: I ii iii IV V vi vii-dim So, if this were a C major scale, the chords would be   C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim In G, the chords would be G, Am, Bm, C, D, Em, F#dim In A, the chords would be A, Bm, C#m, D, E, F#m, G#dim ... and so on. The same chords would be found in the key of the relative minor of C, which is Am. The relative minor of any major chord is the minor chord built off the 6th note in that major scale. You'll also notice above that all the minor chords in the sequence are the relative minor of major chords in the sequence - Am for C, Dm for F, Em for G. That's probably what the chord chart is trying to say. I don't see any logical grouping to the chords listed as "alternate chords", other than that they all can be used to harmonize one or more notes in the given key, many of which introduce notes from outside the key but that work in some contexts. It's important to remember that are no real "rules," just guidelines on what sounds good with other things. It's very dependent on context.
