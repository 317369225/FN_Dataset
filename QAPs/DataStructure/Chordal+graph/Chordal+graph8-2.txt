Could we as musicians consider guitar to be the hardest instrument of them all?
This was a board game that was popular when I was a kid. It had a great tagline: A minute to learn...a lifetime to master! Asking what is the hardest instrument is a bit like asking "Who is the best runner? An olympic sprinter or a champion marathoner?" If we're talking about a sprint, guitar is one of the easier instruments to pick up. Given what popular music has been like since the 1950's, the barrier to entry on guitar is incredibly low. You can be a functional guitar player or drummer in a band after just a couple of months of practice. These instruments take a minute to learn and a lifetime to master. Compare this to learning a bowed string instrument, a woodwind, or brass instrument. On a violin or a french horn for example, you might spend a few weeks or months just trying to get the instrument to make any sound. It's not just that the barrier to entry is lower when it comes to guitar when compared to the instruments listed above. The expectations of these players is much higher than what is expected of guitar players. It takes much, much longer to reach a point where you are considered competent. If we held all guitar players to the same standards, say, being able to read a jazz chart or trade solos within a rhythm section, we'd consider guitar much harder than it is. You can sell millions of records knowing nothing more than a few chords and like, 3 strumming patterns. These are cultural judgements, not objective facts about how "difficult" or "hard" an instrument is to learn. The fact is, achieving mastery on any instrument is not a sprint, it is a marathon and takes a lifetime of practice.
