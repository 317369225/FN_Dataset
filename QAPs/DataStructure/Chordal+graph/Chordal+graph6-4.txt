Guitars: What are alternate chords?
I've never heard of "alternate" chords and I've been through music school.  I wouldn't use "alternate" as an official term. One thing to be aware of is an ALT chord.  You'll see these in jazz books, and it stands for 'altered'.  I won't go into what they are here.
