Guitars: What are alternate chords?
Well, if you really wanted to know the author's intent you could contact him through his website or phone.  (Maybe get him to join Quora!) KEEPING THE TRADITION OF SALTY SAILORS AND SONGWRITERS (941) 445-9522 Guitar Chord Guide ~ by Danny Taddei 1986 My take is this sheet is intended to be used with some explanation by the teacher.  My interpretation is intended to help people learn chords in context to composing or writing a song. "Principal Chords" - are the I, IV, and V chords of the key.  These are the primary chords you'll hear in a song (Blues, Pop, Rock). Relative Minor - are the "relative minor" chords of those same 3 chords (Am is the relative minor of C, Dm is the relative minor of F, and E7 is the relative minor of G7)  Relative minor is a music theory term and fact.  Each major has a relative minor as taught in the "circle of fifths". I think what the author is trying to teach with the "Alternate" chords is a list of chords that can be swapped in (alternatively used) for the Principal chords based on the composer's taste.  For example, a composer may want to use an F6 rather than an F to give the song a slightly different flavor.  This "works" because both are F major chords, and the flavor is given by adding the 6th degree of the scale to the chord.  6 chords are pretty common substations among composers (or jazz artists).  The same logic applies to the minor 6 chords. These leaves only 2 other types of chords in the Alternate list, Augmented and Diminished.  These are somewhat dissonant chords that are generally used as transitional or "lead in" chords before the I chord.  For example, play the Cdim chord, then a C chord or CAug then C.  See how the diminished chord builds tension, which is then released when the I chord is played?I think this sheet is a way of teaching people a bunch of chords, but giving the student some context of when & how the chords should be applied.
