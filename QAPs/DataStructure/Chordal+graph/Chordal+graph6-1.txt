Guitars: What are alternate chords?
Some of the terminology on this sheet is not standard. I'll talk you through how chords work in general, and then relate it back to what's on the sheet. The most basic chords come from the major scale. Let's think about the C major scale, shown below in red: To make chords from the scale, start on any note. Then go around clockwise, skipping every other scale degree. Here are the seven chords you can make from the C major scale: C major:  C  E  G D minor:  D  F  A E minor:  E  G  B F major:  F  A  C G7:  G  B  D  F A minor:  A  C  E B diminished:  B  D  F The first, fourth and fifth chords above are major (including G7, which is a special category of major called dominant.) The second, third and sixth chords are minor. The sixth one, A minor, is the relative minor of C major. (I don't know why the sheet calls the other two minor chords "relative," that isn't correct.) The seventh chord in the list is diminished, and you should ignore it for the time being. You can extend the chords written above by adding more scale degrees to them. C6 is a C major chord with A, the sixth scale degree, added on top. The theory behind the other chords on your sheet is more complicated; you'll need to consult a music theory book for the full story.
