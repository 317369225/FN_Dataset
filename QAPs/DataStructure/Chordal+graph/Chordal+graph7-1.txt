Can a trained classical pianist easily transition to play in a rock band? Does everyone need to learn to read tabs?
If you, the trained classical pianist, should join a rock band, you may not need to worry about tablature. If you are writing songs for the other members, they should be able to figure things out by ear, or by simple chord markings. If you are writing out detailed, busy solos for others to play note-for-note, then yeah, tab probably helps if they don't read standard notation. But good rock music isn't really about chops or reading skills, IMO. You didn't mention what genre of rock we're looking at, but the burden may be on you as far as simplifying your playing and capturing those rock feels that can't be notated.
