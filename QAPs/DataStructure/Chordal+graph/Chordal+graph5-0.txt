Is there currently a branch of music theory which uses algebraic group actions?
The nearest that I can get to your answer, is by referring to type of music analysis known as "Set Theory". This was a technique developed by the American musicologist and theorist Allen Forte, as a means of identifying chordal formulations in atonal music, where using a terminology that implies  a tonal chordal hierarchy would be misleading. In his book, "The Structure Of Atonal Music" , you will find detailed  charts of "subsets" and  "Zsets" which amount to pitch groupings. It is an academic book, and it would be pointless to go into detail here, but in "Forte world" , what ordinary musicians would call "notes" are accorded a number, so that "pitch class" C is identified 0, C# as 1, D as 2, D as 3  etc. going thus through the chromatic scale. To a "conventional" musician, this type of analysis can appear at first as a bewilderingly complex set of statistics; moreover, you need Forte's book in order to identify a particular "set" or "subset".
