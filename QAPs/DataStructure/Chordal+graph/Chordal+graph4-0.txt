Probabilistic graphical models: what are the relationships between sum-product algorithm, belief propagation and junction tree algorithm?
There is no difference between Sum Product Propagation algorithm and Belief Propagation (algorithmically). Only cosmetic difference is that BP is applicable (in its purest form by Judea Pearl) for tree bayesian network (or tree factor graphs) and hence is exact. However BP can be applied to any Graphical Model. If the model is not a tree model it has to be run iteratively and is known as "Loopy Belief Propagation" Junction Tree Propagation algorithm is also an exact Sum-Product propagation algorithm which is applicable in Junction Tree structure instead of a normal Factor Graph structure.
