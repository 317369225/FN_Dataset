What are the strengths of the visual novel medium versus games or other interactive media? What are its weaknesses?
Basically an addition to Chris' excellent answer: The level of possible character depth/complexity (obviously related to narrative) is also a noteworthy aspect. For example, while eroge/dating sims are often seen as the rotten-apple-niche of the VN medium (maybe rightfully so), some of them still offer some downright impressive examples for character depth and/or character development. At times we can even witness complexity levels that would not work in any other medium. This is possible because: - the pace of the narrative is entirely determined by the player. A line/phrase stays on screen until the player decides to move on. Thus, it is feasible to create some extremely deep lines of dialogue, for example containing multiple layers of meaning. The player can ruminate on a line as long as he/she desires, without having to pause or hurry. And since the narrative is usually the whole point of playing, the player is also strongly encouraged to do this. - the dialog is available as audio, and delivered by professional dubbing actors, whose accentuations can deliver meaning even beyond that of the mere written text. - VNs are usually experienced in a first-person manner, placing the player inside the narrative and thus closer to the 'NPCs', fostering involvement when compared to books. Mind, other PC games can do the same (basically any game containing a multi-option-dialog-tree system can). But this is where Chris' point comes into play. Usually other game mechanics already hog a good deal of the players concentration. If a game keeps you busy with fighting dragons at swordpoint, piloting starships, leveling up your character or finding hidden air vents, you will necessarily pay less attention to the plot - let alone ruminate on the inner workings/motives of the characters.
