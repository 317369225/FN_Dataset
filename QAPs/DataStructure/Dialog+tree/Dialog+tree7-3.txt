Does it look like TOR is going to reach the critical mass of users needed to achieve sustainability as an MMORPG?
It's too early to say for certain. It's true that ToR has had a strong start, but in order to make an accurate prediction on whether it has legs you need at least three months worth of sales and usage data. That being said, my personal take on the situation is that it's PROBABLY going to have to go free to play at some point. The defining characteristic that sets it apart from other MMO's is the Star Wars plot, and the Bioware style dialog trees. Once you get past those two things it's an MMO with all the trim and trappings of any other MMO, and that means it has to compete with WoW for subscribers. It seems unlikely that it will roll up enough new subscribers to draw people away from WoW, and as a result, eventually many ToR players will probably go back to WoW. MMO's are a social experience, and with the tremendous number of people playing WoW, any MMO would be hard pressed to draw gamers away from the game all their friends are playing.
