What were your misconceptions as a kid?
I thought that when it rained, it rained everywhere. I remember riding in the car with my mom when I was around 8. It had been raining and we were on a short trip across town, when very suddenly it stopped. So suddenly I said "Wow! It stopped raining so fast!" My mom, probably slightly confused, said "We just drove out from a cloud." I knew that rain came from clouds, but I hadn't realized that there could be clouds in some places and not others. I was very confused and asked her what that meant. I even tried to argue with her that there were always clouds above us, maybe just higher up. So she explained that not all clouds are raining if one is. Things started to click at this point: we had learned in school about why clouds started to rain, and it started to seem believable that one could be ready but another not. I was suspicious, but realized it made sense. The next day in school I asked my science teacher who looked stunned that I didn't know this. I've been suspicious of clouds ever since.
