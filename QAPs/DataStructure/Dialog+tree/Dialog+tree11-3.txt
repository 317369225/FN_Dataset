How do I believe that the humans around me actually possess consciousness (and it's not just me who is conscious)?
One of my danish professors in psychology (late E. Tranekjær Rasmussen) described a simple method to approach certainty that a phenomenon actually exists independently of yourself. He called it an "Intersubjective procedure of testing concordant relations" (in danish: "Intersubjektiv relationsoverensstemmelseskalkyle") and it goes simply like this: With another person, focus a phenomenon (an object, a situation, a concept, etc.) and describe the different aspects (subphenomena) as you perceive- or know them, and compare with the descriptions given by the other person. e.g.: It is a round object, it is red, it is placed on a plate, it tastes sweet, it is called an apple, it has been groving in a tree, it makes me feel x, it reminds me of Newton, etc.   The more aspects you agree upon, the more certain you can be, that: - you are focusing the same phenomenon - the phenomenon exists outside yourself - another person exists, having some perceptual and cognitive functions in common with you.   The more phenomena you test, and the more persons you test it with, the more certain can you be, that: - the whole physical world exists - other humans are conscious like you, differing only slightly due to variance in their individual genetically programmed constitution and their culturally determined programming (i.e. learning).   You can of course never reach a hundred percent certainty, and no method can!   This method could be used like an advanced Turing Test, to reveal an (alien) impostor or an advanced robot, or to spot deviant individuals -but we use it daily to spot and correct discrepancies in our internal model of the world, of other persons, and of ourself.
