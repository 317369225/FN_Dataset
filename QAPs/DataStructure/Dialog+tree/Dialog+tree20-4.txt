What does it mean when someone uses multiple periods (...) instead of one period (.) to end a sentence?
To clarify what others have said in their answers, in the examples you give, the three periods (or "ellipsis marks") are used to show that the speaker wanted to say something more but stopped speaking before he or she finished what he or she had to say. This is the main function of the ellipsis marks when they appear at the end of a sentence in dialogue (as in your examples). The ellipsis marks in this case indicate that the speech trailed off (that is, the speaker stopped speaking gradually and with a feeling of uncertainty).
