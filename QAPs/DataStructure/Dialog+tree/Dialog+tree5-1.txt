Kickstarter: Why has the funding of Leisure Suite Larry not been as successful as Double Fine Adventure or Wasteland?
Decades later, we don't consider Lesuire Suit Larry a revolutionary and trendsetting piece of art. It's a game. A funny game, maybe, but famous for its notoriety, not its brilliant puzzles, humor, graphics design etc. The same could be said of Space Quest. Less notorious, but not games that wow-ed you. Now compare that to some of Tim Schafer's games. Monkey Island was one of  the first adventure games where it was impossible to die or get stuck. It had hilarious dialog trees (by comparison, Larry and Space Quest didn't get dialog trees until late in the series). It had great, original music (hands up if you can remember any of the music from Space Quest III - even though that won an award). It had a great interface, and even employed the interface for jokes. Then you have Full Throttle, Grim Fandango and Psychonauts - huge artistic successes. I think it comes down to this: Stuff that has artistic quality will stay popular and stay remembered longer. The Double Fine folks had a history of making games which are deemed (in retrospect) to have been artistic successes. The Larry and Space Quest games, while successful in their day, have not stayed in people's imagination in the same way.
