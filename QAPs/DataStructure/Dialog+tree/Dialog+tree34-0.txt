How do you judge what I did? Read the details.
If that girl is provoking the situation, then you deserve better, much better. I think it's wise to not get into fights over a girl. In my opinion, I think that getting over the girl was a wise thing to do. I don't think you're a coward. It's best to stay away from these situations, you'll find a better girl who will like you for your shyness and will approach you. Just be patient, OP.
