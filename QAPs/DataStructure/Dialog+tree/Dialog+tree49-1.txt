What are some great stories about Bill Gates?
When I joined Microsoft, Bill Gates was just leaving and there was a lot of nostalgia among the old timers. My ex-manager often tells about a story where he demoed one of the earlier versions of Halo (as part of Bungee studios) in an internal event, when Bill Gates came up to the stall and happily collected the $20 off coupon that was given to other stall visitors. Bill Gates is often remembered as a shrewd master who valued his money. A few years ago, Bill Gates used to give a personal tour to employees who bid the maximum in an internal charity event. I knew of a few people who paid $10K to charity to get Bill Gates' personal tour of his house or $5K to play basketball with Steve Ballmer. Bill Gates cultivated a great culture of charity/social service within Microsoft and the company's employees are among the biggest donors for most charities in the Northwest. Although the American tech media+silicon valley has managed to paint the "outsider" as an evil businessman, he indeed is a great human and is rather simple & unassuming for a guy who is the richest in the world. He doesn't try to appear sexy, flaunty, macho, but an ordinary Joe. While the rest of the world loves him, America has sadly not recognized their great hero. Watch this light hearted video of his last day. Can you think of any other business leader who will take jokes like he does in this video? Updated 166w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
