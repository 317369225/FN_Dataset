Computational Linguistics:Â What is shallow processing?
Shallow processing is generally used in contrast with something deeper, so it means it is not as deep as something else. Shallow parsing in contrast with full parsing means you do not create the whole tree, either because your nodes still consist of phrases (groups of words) without explicitly marked internal structure, or because some words are not part of the tree. It might be enough for many tasks, e.g. information retrieval, machine translation, evaluation of machine translation, information extraction... Some would argue that it is often more useful than full parsing. Shallow parsing in contrast with deep parsing usually means that you create the full parse tree where every word has its own node, but you do not infer any deeper structure, maybe by adding additional edges for thinks such as correference, maybe by collapsing some of the edges and/or removing some words (such as auxiliary words), maybe by converting the sentence into a logical formula. This kind of shallow parsing is the one that is actually usually used. Shallow tagging is something that is for some reason not the full tagging, probably because you only tag some words and leave other words untagged, or because you use a simplified tagset instead of the full one. May be useful e.g. in information retrieval.
