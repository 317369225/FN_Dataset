Kickstarter: Why has the funding of Leisure Suite Larry not been as successful as Double Fine Adventure or Wasteland?
Probably because the LLL games have a much narrower target audience than Double Fine's work.  Plus, the last few installments in the series were pretty pathetic, whereas most of what Double Fine has put out has been pretty top-notch.
