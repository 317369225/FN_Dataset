What's it like to meet Bill Gates?
In 2003, I had the pleasure of meeting him in his backyard. BillG use to host all the soon-to-graduate interns for an end of summer BBQ at his house located on the shore of Lake Washington. We were escorted onto buses, then screened by his courteous but thorough security staff (I remember that we were allowed to bring nothing other than our MSFT badge, not even keys). Upon arrival, we descended this long continuous stairway which deposited us in his backyard. His house and backyard is absolutely stunning. Though for what it is, it seemed cozier and more modest than I expected. You can't actually see the whole thing in any one view. I'm guessing this is by design.   Once we all got settled, BillG quietly descended, dressed modestly in khakis and a button down shirt. Almost immediately, the "intern donut" (what MSFT recruiters use to call it) formed. More than a dozen interns surrounded him, and began peppering him with questions. What amazed me was how deftly he answered each question. In answering questions that were predominantly focused on software, he drew on analogies and references ranging from biology to economics to world history. It left me with the impression that he just loved to learn about anything and everything. He was unassuming and modest. There was no grand entrance, no announcement of his arrival. I didn't even notice, until I saw that all the interns were gathered in one spot. He was courteous and respectful, but always direct.  Updated 164w ago • View Upvotes
