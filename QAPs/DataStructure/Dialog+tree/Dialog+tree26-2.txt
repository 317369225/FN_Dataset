How can I apply a custom style sheet to a 3rd-party site after making changes using Chrome's Inspect element feature?
Google Reader is dead, but you are asking about applying custom CSS to specific websites. There are many extensions for that. I upvoted a few relevant answers that were collapsed for an unknown reason. Enjoy :) Simply search for "CSS extension" for whatever browser you wish to use.
