Does the science journal "Nature Climate Change" have evidence to refute Al Gore's "Global Warming" or "Climate Change" theory?
[I want to preface my remarks by saying that I don't think Al Gore deserved the Nobel Peace Prize, but I do believe the evidence overwhelmingly establishes the human influence on global climate change.] Arguing that he should give back his prize based on a single scientific study ignores the fact that Al Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize. He did not win a science prize. The Nobel committee granted him (and the IPCC) a Nobel Peace Prize, "for their efforts to build up and disseminate great knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change." Their award was not granted on any specific scientific claim, but on the efforts made by Gore and the IPCC to disseminate knowledge and initiate debate about how to respond to climate change. The Nobel Committee accepted as fact the existing overwhelming body of evidence that points to climate change. Gore and the IPCC did not appear to influence them there. What Gore and the IPCC did that earned the attention of the committee was engage the public in a way that the committee believed would avert human disasters and conflict that may arise from man-made climate change, and increase the overall prospects for peace. Ultimately, this question is a non-sequitur. It is like asking why Lance Armstrong doesn't give back his Olympic gold medals. He didn't win Olympic gold medals. He won Tour de France, and the different contests have different standards.
