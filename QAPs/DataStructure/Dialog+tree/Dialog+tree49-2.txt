What are some great stories about Bill Gates?
Our daughters went to middle school together, and my recurring memory is of his oldest daughter leading him around the cafeteria by the hand at a father-daughter breakfast and overhearing introducing him to her friends "This is my Dad". For those moments he was not the founder of one of the most important companies in the world, or one of the world's most prolific philanthropists or the (then) richest person in the world, he was just another Dad having breakfast with his daughter, and he was loving every minute of it. Just like the rest of us.
