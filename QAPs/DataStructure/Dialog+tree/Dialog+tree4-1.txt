What are the strengths of the visual novel medium versus games or other interactive media? What are its weaknesses?
Personally, I believe that the strength of visual novels lies in storytelling/narrative. Unlike games, where mechanics can often overrule the story of the game, for visual novels the narrative has precedence over any mechanics. Even in VNs with minigame systems, those minigames exist to serve the story, not the other way around. On the other hand, the greatest weakness of visual novels is that as a form of interactive fiction, they aren't very interactive at all. Some, kinetic novels, don't have any branching points at all, or at least none that affect the final outcome of the story. And even for those that do have a lot of branching points, the endings remain more predefined than with games, with little opportunity for a reader to project his or her own twist on what happened.
