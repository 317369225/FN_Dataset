What makes acting believable?
What you're asking is a question that hinges on the audience more so than the actor.  Actors can talk about technique 'til they're blue in the face and it doesn't matter one wit to the audience.  It's a matter of connection.  If the audience makes a connection to a character through an actor believability rears its beautiful head.  This can be done in many ways and can fail to be done in just as many.  There is no secret to be told.  No panacea.  It either happens or it doesn't.  And sometimes great actors fail to do it, and sometimes first-timers deliver.  The connection is ever illusive yet always right at one's fingertips. Training and experience can certainly help make you better at making this connection.  For some it's much easier than others and there are those who simply can't do it at all.  When you make the connection you feel it and acting seems the easiest thing in the world.  But when you're having trouble connecting acting becomes as hard as breaking boulders with a hammer.  The ecstasy and the agony.
