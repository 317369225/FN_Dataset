What are a few important points to consider while writing the storyline to an RPG?
I'm going to paraphrase a great talk I went to at GDC 2014 by Jennifer HeplerÂ  and Sheri Graner Ray. "Engineering Better Dialog" Most dialogs trees are diamond shaped. Write from the bottom up or the sides in, not the top down Beware of combinatorial explosion in branching choices. The purpose of dialog is to move the player forward. Always state what the player is reacting to before giving them a conversation choice. Always make sure you state what they have to do at the end of the dialog. Don't ever make the player give meaningless input in a dialog.
