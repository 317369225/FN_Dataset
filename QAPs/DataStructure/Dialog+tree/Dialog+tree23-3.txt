Why did the Star Trek writers and producers change the nature of the Borg from being a linked collective to a queen-driven hive?
In contemplating the 'inhuman' nature of the Borg Hive Mind, we should note many AI and cognitive scientists have theorized that this is precisely what the human mind is! More explicitly, many researchers model the mind as a collection of semi-autonomous, task-dedicated agents whose collective behavior sums to form our consciousness. Some example: 1. University of Indiana Cognitive Scientist Douglas Hofstadter analogizes biological cognition to an anthill in Godel, Escher, Bach and other works. His key concept a la 'Aunt Hillary' (Hofstadter is as much much and poet as cognitive scientist and  loves puns) the collective activity of a horde of agents dedicated to single-minded, 'mechanical' behavior combines to produce an 'emergent' whole with complex, lifelike behavior: Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid: Douglas R. Hofstadter: 9780465026562: Amazon.com: Books 2. MIT AI pioneer Marvin Minsky also thinks human cognition emerges from the collective activity of simpler 'single-minded' agents, as expounded at length in The Society of Mind: The Society of Mind: Marvin Minsky: 9780671657130: Amazon.com: Books Considering such models of our own minds, we're compelled to ask: Are the Borg and their Queen really so alien, so 'inhuman'? The Hive Mind consists of a collective of task-dedicated 'soulless' automatons, whose swarm of mechanical activity produces their vivacious, philosophical, sensual Queen. She embodies their collective coldly dedicated will, yet her passionate, manipulative subtlety feels so much more than that. So alien, yet so human.
