What are some of the best computer games of all time?
ROAD RASH : (Do whatever it takes to win ) Road Rash is a motorcycle racing game very popular in the 90's. Almost every kid of the 90's would have played this game. This game had a famous feature where the racers could actually kick the other racers and also could hit them with a chain. Who can actually forget the exotic locations like the Sierra Nevada or the Napa valley? The game was released at a time when there were no advanced graphics but still the game won everyone's hearts with its breathtaking gameplay. I am sorry, if you had not played this game when you were a kid because if that is the case, you missed the chance to play one of the greatest games that has ever been made. Don't worry you can still download this. But I can't help, if you dont find it that enjoyable now.
