Computational Linguistics: What is the difference between a language model and a hierarchical language model?
A hierarchical language model is just a type of language model. I'll assume you know what a language model is. There are actually two unrelated notions of "hierarchical": Increasingly specific distributions [math]p(w_i), p(w_i\mid w_{i-1}), p(w_i\mid w_{i-2},w_{i-1}, ...)[/math] are modeled jointly, for example, using a hierarchical Dirichlet prior. (Teh 2006) The vocabulary is clustered hierarchically, resulting in a tree whose leaves represent the words and whose internal nodes represent sets of words.  The probability of choosing a word (in a given context) is then equal to the probability of the path from the root to that word, which involves narrowing down the vocabulary by a series of steps.  The probabilities of these steps are modeled separately and multiplied together.  (Morin & Bengio 2005)
