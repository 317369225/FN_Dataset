Does it look like TOR is going to reach the critical mass of users needed to achieve sustainability as an MMORPG?
It's too early to tell - the key milestone for examining this is going to come at the end of January, when people decide whether or not they're actually willing to pay for the game on an ongoing basis.  Right now, it's a sunk cost - those who bought the game are using their 30 days of "free" game time.  When that expires, we'll see who's sticking and who's leaving, and the next few months will determine whether there's a growth curve that's positive, neutral, or negative.
