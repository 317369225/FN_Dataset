What does it mean when someone uses multiple periods (...) instead of one period (.) to end a sentence?
Thanks for the A2A. The three dots are called an ellipsis. In formal writing, they usually mean that one or more words has been left out of a quotation. "Oak trees, which belong to the beech family, Fagacaea, are found in a variety of habitats." "Oak trees...are found in a variety of habitats." Your examples are different, though. In dialog, an ellipsis at the end of a sentence--or often in the middle of a sentence--indicates that the speaker trailed off. That is, the voice dropped in volume and the utterance ended. The speaker was interrupted or became lost in thought.
