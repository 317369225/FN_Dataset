Where are JAPE grammars used? What applications use JAPE grammars or similar systems?
According to Wikipedia, JAPE (Java Annotation Patterns Engine) is "a component of the open-source General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) platform. JAPE is a finite state transducer that operates over annotations based on regular expressions. Thus it is useful for pattern-matching, semantic extraction, and many other operations over syntactic trees such as those produced by natural language parsers". Again from Wikipedia, a "JAPE grammar consists of a set of phases, each of which consists of a set of pattern/action rules. The phases run sequentially and constitute a cascade of finite state transducers over annotations. The left-hand-side (LHS) of the rules consist of an annotation pattern description. The right-hand-side (RHS) consists of annotation manipulation statements. Annotations matched on the LHS of a rule may be referred to on the RHS by means of labels that are attached to pattern elements". => google.com/search?q=site:meta-guide.com+jape By doing a cross-reference on my own Meta-Guide.com website, it can be determined that JAPE is used in Dialog Systems, particularly in Joke Generators, for instance via Semantic Role Labeling. JAPE is also used for Sentence Patterns and Sentence Splitting in Dialog Systems.
