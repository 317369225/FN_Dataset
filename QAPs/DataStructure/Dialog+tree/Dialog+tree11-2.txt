How do I believe that the humans around me actually possess consciousness (and it's not just me who is conscious)?
The fact that you can even consider that others around you are not conscious belies that you have a default understanding of the others around you as being conscious. You would not ask, for instance "How do I believe that the garbage cans around me actually possess consciousness?". Why? The simple explanation is that there are numerous psychological cues that tip you off - they look like you, they speak like you do, they interact with you in the same way that you interact with them. It is not difficult to make the leap that these similarities are not an accident. It may, however, go deeper than that. We may have sensitivities which are available to us intuitively, but not rationally. We don't know how we know that blue is blue, but that doesn't mean that our ability to identify blue can be denied, or that it must be diluted to the status of a belief. We might ask instead 'How do I believe that my direct awareness of other people's consciousness could be merely a belief?' That question is easy to answer. It is because we have been conditioned in a culture which is dominated by the tradition of skepticism and reductionism. By default, our deep thinking is influenced by the expectation that the logical parsing of linguistic concepts offers deeper insight into nature than does direct apprehension. Our mind defines itself in intellectual terms that have been inherited from the likes of Aristotle and Euclid so that we rely on ideas like the law of identity and the law of non-contradiction to insulate us from the overwhelming mystery of our own sanity. In reality, solipsism is sophism. Nobody* really believes that they can't tell if anyone else is conscious, otherwise they wouldn't ever talk to anyone. *Except for those in a profoundly altered state of consciousness like catatonia or advanced dementia maybe.
