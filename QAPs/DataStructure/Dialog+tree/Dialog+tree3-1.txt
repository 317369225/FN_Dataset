Is Python good for developing games? Why or why not?
In theory, you can make any kind of program in any programming language you want. However, some things are easier or done better in some languages than others due to factors such as how active the community is, if the language is suitable for the task, if there are good tools available, etc. Python is certainly one of the most popular languages today, so you'll probably find a lot of tools for working with games, and as long as you're not working close to the hardware, then Python should be fine. You can check out the pygame library. Also, if you're planning on doing game development for a living, then you'll need to start with working with C/C++ sooner or later as it is the industry standard.
