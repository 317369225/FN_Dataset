What makes acting believable?
Not a simple question.  There are so many styles of plays, and interpretations, that "believable" isn't even always something Directors - and actors - are trying for.  In a naturalistic play/interpretation, "believability" is important.  The audience has to see the characters as "real people".  There's no greater compliment for an actor than to hear, from people who know him/her well, that "I forgot it was you up there!"  There are many ways and acting techniques/approaches used to get to this place; every actor finds the approach or mix of techniques that works best for him/her.  The superficial stuff is easier - a use of natural movement, natural voice quality, facial expressions etc.  The hard part is actually expressing "real" emotion.  It's easy to go over the top, or come across as artificial.  It's when the actor manages to somehow actually feel the emotion the character is experiencing, and use it in their body and voice that it works best.  The best actors do this easily and well, but it doesn't come naturally - it takes work and a lot of practice.
