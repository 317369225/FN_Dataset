What are some things I can learn in minutes?
A safety tip: Recently, one of my friend met with an accident. She went unconscious, people who gathered there tried to help her and took her to the near by hospital. She was carrying her phone and a wallet with some money. When people tried to get information about her, they couldn't. As she had kept a password to her phone and didn't have any information in the wallet, they had to wait till she got her consciousness back. This tip helps you in such situations by providing information about you to the people who are trying to help you. Add your parent's or any other emergency contact information on your phone's owner information without fail. Steps: Go to Settings. Click on Security option. Click on Owner info - Provide your name and emergency contact numbers here. This information gets displayed on your screen even before unlocking the phone. As shown below. This is really help full in situations like accidents. This might even help when you lose your phone and the person who finds it wants to contact you. Always keep an emergency contact number and your details in your wallet also. Phone and wallets are the two things we always carry around. EDIT: There is a similar option in IOS 8.x on iPhone and iPad to Set up Emergency Medical ID Steps Open the Health app. Tap on Medical ID menu at the bottom. If you haven’t set up any info for Medical ID yet, tap on Create Medical ID. Fill up all the details for medical conditions. Make sure you mention emergency contacts in case of medical emergencies. Enable the Show When Locked switch. Enabling this means your medical ID info will be visible even without unlocking the lockscreen. Thanks Farhad Tarapore for this information. For Windows users there's an app Lock Screen Text ( Lock Screen Text – Windows Apps on Microsoft Store ). This helps you add text on your locked screen. Thanks Amulya Sahoo for this information.
