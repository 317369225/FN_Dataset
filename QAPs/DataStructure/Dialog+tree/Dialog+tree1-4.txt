What are a few important points to consider while writing the storyline to an RPG?
"Story is to games as plot is to porno." -- John Carmack Having said that, certain genres, such as RPGs and Adventure games, require more story.  Here are a few suggestions: (1) Do not get bogged down in back-story.  The players really dont care what happened before the game begins.  The only purpose to back story is to set the stage and to guide you in writing the actual story.  A good rile of thumb is, if you cannot write your back story in long hand on 3x5 index card, its probably too much. (2) Write good fiction.  So much game fiction is like fan fiction-- plot driven crap that is a pastiche of standard tropes.  Know who your charcters are and the story should come from them, not you.  If you can afford it I highly recommend Sol Stien's "WritePro" (Home of the New WritePro).  At least download the free first lesson and maybe consider getting a CD of his lectures.
