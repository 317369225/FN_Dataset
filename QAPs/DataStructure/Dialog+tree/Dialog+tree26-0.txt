How can I apply a custom style sheet to a 3rd-party site after making changes using Chrome's Inspect element feature?
The Inspect Element was made for the inspection of the DOM tree and on-the-fly editing of DOM elements. While you can see your changes reflected in real-time in Chrome on the page you are in, the same change cannot be "saved" through the Inspect Element dialog screen, since everything is supposed to be re-loaded from the site, by default Chrome operation. [1] You can though, persist any changes that you want to be seen on any specific website every time you visit it, by anyone of the two methods: Install an extension from the Chrome Web Store which works for that specific site. As I see your need in this case is to set the background of Google Reader to a custom color, which could be accomplished either through Stylish or Stylebot. Another round-about option, if you don't want to install an extension in the safe and sound way, is to write a user-script yourself (or download one from Power-ups for your browser) and install it into Chrome manually. While Chrome has disabled the option to install user scripts from third-party sites by default, what you can still do (at least in Chrome stable v23), is to drag the js file to the chrome://extensions tab and it should be automatically installed and visible in your Chrome extensions list or relaunch your Chrome with the "--enable-easy-off-store-extension-install" parameter [2].
