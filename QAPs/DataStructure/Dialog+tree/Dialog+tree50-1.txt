What's it like to meet Bill Gates?
I can add a modest contribution. I met Bill Gates for a small meeting on December 23, several years ago at his office at Microsoft. I thought he was really relaxed and down-to-earth. It was the day before Christmas Eve, and he came off as a pretty normal person who was at the office wrapping up a few things before the holiday. He was wearing a sweater and was casual. In person he was a good listener and very polite.
