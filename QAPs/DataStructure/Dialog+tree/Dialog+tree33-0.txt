What are some little known tricks or hacks for Ubuntu?
I am not sure if these are little known as these are picked up from the Ubuntu community itself :) . However, these are something that I do regularly on any new setup which help me a bit, and i do not see many other people setting it up this way. 1. Install tree sudo apt-get install tree This gives a hierarchy of files/folders from the command line. to use : vibhu@Aum:~/Documents$ tree . ├── Open Source for Enterprise.ppt └── Open Source for Enterprise_vibhu.ppt 0 directories, 2 files 2. fortune ! Its a very old program on linux, but I still use it. Sometimes it gives some very relevant fortunes as below :) to use it, apt-get install fortune and then add the command at the end of your ~/.bashrc file : # randrom stuff fortune 3. World of Warcraft ! Do you know that World of Warcraft runs quite nicely on Ubuntu ? The process is quite simple - just copy the installed World of Warcraft directory from windows to your linux system ( for me it was a copy from the windows partition to linux ) and then run it (requires wine to be installed first !). Most online resources talk about installing from the CD which is just not required. $ wine Wow.exe -opengl 4. Install Tweak Tool This is quite good as Ubuntu hides a lot of stuff that you are used to seeing. This makes it easy to get back those settings - like showing the mounted volumes on the desktop etc. 5. Install sl This was pointed out by Aruna Sankaranarayanan in the comments below. If you mistype ls, and type sl instead, it will have a steam locomotive go across your screen ! Updated 151w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Balajiganapathi Senthilnathan
