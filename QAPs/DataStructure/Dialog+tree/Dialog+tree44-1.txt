Which historical figures best demonstrate the internal struggle between good and evil?
An evil impulse caused George Washington to cut down the cherry tree, but the angel on his other shoulder made him confess. Except that story is apocryphal. In fact, history gives us the facts about what happened (or some version thereof) but it doesn't give us the internal dialog with any reliability. One rare exception might be Joan of Arc who very publicly explained her good/evil dillemma, as she perceived it. Her choice to burn confirmed her thinking.
