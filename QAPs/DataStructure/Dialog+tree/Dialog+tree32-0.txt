Why has the hard disk remained Drive C for all PCs I have seen?
If you had two disk drives they were A and B respectively. If you only had one, it was both A and B. For example, if you wanted to copy a file from one disk to another using only one disk drive, you would type COPY A:FILE.TXT B: and the computer would read a part of FILE.TXT into memory and then ask you to insert a disk into drive B at which point you would swap the disks. The hard drive has been hardcoded at C since MS-DOS 5. There is no longer any need for the drive letters since there are directories now. In the beginning MS-DOS had no directories, all files were stored in one place on a disk, so you needed a way to specify which disk you wanted to the store the file, thus the need for drive letters. On Linux/Unix systems (Mac OS X included) there are no drive letters, simply a directory tree. I think the drive letters will eventually disappear from Microsoft's operating systems. They are not as important to the user anymore and are not emphasized in file saving/opening dialogs or in Explorer. Behind the scenes they will remain a bit longer due to backwards compatibility.
