Why is machine learning not more widely used for medical diagnosis?
An actual clinical example will be more powerful than any spiel/explanation. This is what happened when a patient came in with the single complaint of abdominal pain. === STEP 1: DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS === Possible etiologies broken down by type (to be honest, I'm sure there are many possibilities I'm forgetting): Infectious (* = multiple causes): disseminated TB worm/other parasite* gastroenteritis* ulcers* abscess* Malignancy (* = multiple types): pancreatic cancer* colon cancer* stomach cancer* kidney cancer* sarcoma* cholangiocarcinoma lymphoma* MALToma* hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis from a primary tumor elsewhere in the body* Physiologic (* = multiple causes): constipation* hepatic damage* splenic damage* diverticulitis/diverticulosis Crohn's disease intussception appendicitis inflammatory bowel disease irritable bowel syndrome kidney stone* === STEP 2: HISTORY === What questions did I ask the patient? All of the following: How old are you? What is your ethnic heritage? Can you describe the onset of your pain? Where specifically is the pain? How long does it last? Is it sharp? Dull? Throbbing? Constant? Intermittent? Are there any associated symptoms? Does the pain radiate anywhere? On a scale of 1-10, how bad is it? Does anything make it better/worse? Do you have any other medical problems? What major illnesses have you had in the past? Have you ever been hospitalized? If so, for what, when, and how long? What medications have you been on? What medications are you on now? What is your current living arrangement? Do you have a job? If so, what is your profession? Can you describe some of your daily activities? Are you experiencing stressors in your finances, personal relationships, or other aspects of your life? What is your diet like? Do you exercise? How often? What do you do? Do you drink alcohol? How often, and how much? Do you use tobacco products? How often, and how much? Do you use any illicit drugs? How often, and how much? Do you have any religious beliefs that might affect your health or medical care? Do you have any family history of chronic conditions or malignancies? Recently/previously, have you had any of the following: weight loss/gain, fatigue, fever, chills rash, lump, sore, itching, dryness, change in hair/nails/moles headache, dizziness, lightheadedness vision changes, eye pain/redness, excessive tearing, double/blurry vision, spots/specks/flashes, glaucoma/cataracts hearing changes, tinnitus, vertigo, earaches, ear infection, ear discharge cold, stuffiness, nose discharge, nose bleeds changes to teeth/dentures, bleeding gums/tongue, dry mouth, sore throat, hoarseness goiter, neck lumps/pain/stiffness, swollen glands cough, sputum (color/quality), hemoptysis, dyspnea, wheezing, pleurisy, asthma/bronchitis, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis blood pressure changes, rheumatic fever, heart murmurs, chest pain/discomfort, palpitations, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, edema trouble swallowing, heart burn, change in appetite, nausea, vomiting, changes in stool color/size, change in bowel habits, painful defecation, rectal bleeding, black/tarry stools, hemorrhoids, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, food intolerance, excessive gas, jaundice, liver/gall bladder trouble, hepatitis leg cramps, varicose veins, past clots, swelling/tenderness calves/legs/feet, color change in fingers/toes in cold weather urinary frequency changes, polyuria, nocturia, urgency, burning/pain, hematuria, UTIs, kidney pain/stones, suprapubic pain, incontinence, hesitancy, dribbling hernias, penile discharge, genital sores, testicular/scrotal pain, STD history, change in sexual habits muscle/joint pain/stiffness, arthritis, gout, neck/low backache, timing of symptoms, history of trauma, fever, chills, rash, anorexia, weight-loss, weakness nervousness, tension, mood swings, depression, memory change, suicide attempts changes in attention/speech/orientation/memory/insight/judgment fainting, blackouts, weakness, paralysis, numbness, tingling, tremors, seizures anemia, easy bleeding/bruising, past transfusions/reactions heat/cold intolerance, excessive sweating, excessive thirst/hunger, change in glove/ shoe size What I would like you to realize is that there are not "discrete answers" to these questions. The moment someone says yes, we ask follow-up questions to probe deeper. Sometimes, it's important. Other times, it's not. You can't tell until you just go for it. === STEP 3: PHYSICAL EXAM === Two physicians and I did a physical exam of the patient's abdomen, heart, lungs, extremities, and head region. === STEP 4: LAB/TEST WORK-UP === We ordered the following basic labs: complete blood count with differential metabolic panel liver panel HIV status We then consulted the radiology team and pursued some imaging: frontal X-rays of the abdomen and chest abdominal and pelvic CT We ordered a few more tests: hepatitis panel guaiac iron studies ferritin level We also consulted the GI team and scheduled a colonoscopy. They then took some biopsies from the patient's bowel and sent it off to the pathology department for stains, cultures, and histology. === STEP 5: DIAGNOSIS === It took 3 days of work-up and 4 teams' brains to make the final diagnosis of early Crohn's disease. === CONCLUSION === Please feel free to tell me how you believe this diagnostic process could have been interpreted by a machine given today's available knowledge base and technology. Please explain to me how statistical analysis and clever algorithms/heuristics would have sorted through the history/physical exam/labs/imaging. Please teach me what programs are able to make use of a CT's 2000 shades of grey to determine what areas are abnormal given the enormous variety of variation in the human form. Please tell me what kind of data sets you believe are available to train the programs you're imagining, and where you'd obtain them from, and how you'd ensure their integrity. Please illustrate how this program would handle the increased complexity when a patient presents with more than one symptom. While you're at it, please explain why, in spite of all this available awesomeness, we have yet to perfect something as simple as a heart telemetry monitor. I was interviewing another patient today and the machine was sounding an alarm the entire time swearing the patient was undergoing ventricular fibrillation even though the waveforms were perfectly normal. I'm not trying to mock you. I'm prodding you to think: How do you determine when someone is lying about their symptoms to obtain drugs? Do you really think hooking every patient up to a lie detector is an appropriate solution? How do you account for omitted data? People may not want to talk about a rape that left them with syphilis. People may be poor historians. They may simply not remember details about their health. What about people with altered mental status who are unable to give any history at all or give a completely false history? Would you account for genetics? As much as those who live in the Silicon Valley bubble would like to believe that genetic screening/testing is totally happening at a magically awesome rate and that we know a lot about how our genetic code influences our health, the truth is that these tests are extraordinarily expensive, the so-called "results" from consumer companies are actually mostly useless in a clinical setting, and that beyond specific tests such as those for Down Syndrome, genetics has extraordinarily little part in general medical care--and righteously so, given the relative lack of firm data. How do you account for diseases whose symptoms are exactly the same? There are more of these than most will ever realize. For instance, all that wheezes is not asthma--the line between asthma and reactive airway disease is a clinical judgment call, and the two are treated very differently. HIV infection can mimic a simple cold upon presentation. Tuberculosis is a great mimic of just about everything. How would you choose what tests to run? There's a certain point at which you need to respect the finances involved in any work-up. Physical exam findings/lab results rarely have truly "discrete" results. One technician might read a blood culture as "3+" while another might think it more severe and rate it "4+". What a young internist considers a 2/6 heart murmur due to lack of expertise might actually be a 4/6 according to an experienced cardiologist. Discrete results on X-ray/ultrasound/CT/MRI? Forget it. Textbook findings are not as common as people would like to think, and much of imaging is dependent on the technician and the patient's cooperativeness (which you cannot assume will always be "good"). How would you account for false positives/negatives that match a highly likely syndrome? The truth is that no one has invented an effective doctoring algorithm, and no one will for a very, very long time. If you sincerely believe I'm wrong, then you have never spent years studying the human body and trying to apply what you know to the art of medical diagnosis. There are over 15,000 documented pathologies/conditions/diseases/infections, and each one has a nearly infinite number of variables. No amount of data is going to grant a machine the intuition required to know how to proceed. Those who would argue that intuition is unnecessary are ignorant of the existence of "clinical diagnoses": these are not diagnosed through lab data or some hard evidence, per se, but rather a pattern that fits a set phenomena that is labeled as a certain condition. Legally, there's not a whole lot of issues (AFAIK). Heck, just about everyone in the medical profession would probably love to have their workload decreased by just having to check/confirm a machine's work and tweak as necessary. Culturally, you're right. Healthcare professionals are resistant to computer diagnosis, and this method is not really used at all. The foolish ones resist because they haven't seen an algorithm that works yet. The smart ones resist because they understand that the human body is incapable of being defined by any algorithm, no matter how bloody brilliant it is. === Commentary === Oh, computer scientists. I love you, I really do. The things you have done for this world are incredible, and I admire you all very much. I loved that ability so much that I learned Java, C, and C++ in high school and then went on to get a CS minor in undergrad as soon as I finished my biology major. I came into med school thinking that I could help with the very problem discussed in this question. Now, though, I just find it sad that I allowed my optimistic ignorance of the human body to make me arrogant enough to believe that algorithms and formulas can solve the infinite complexity that is the human body. I neglected to consider that every M.D. and D.O. undergoes at least 7 years of training to develop the intuition that will help in the insanely difficult nature of medical diagnosis. I handily ignored the fact that in one cubic millimeter of brain tissue there are more connections between neurons than stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. I'm sorry to be a buzzkill, but quite frankly, medical diagnosis through machine learning is simply not something that is going to be accomplished in my lifetime, your lifetime, or even our great-great-great-grandchildren's lifetimes. If you believe that doctors are poorly trained in probabilistic reasoning and that medical errors are usually due to incorrect diagnoses, you would be incorrect on a multitude of levels, and that is a whole other spiel altogether. I welcome you to enter medical school and see what it's like--and until you do, don't knock it. Comments, questions, rebuttals, and concerns welcome. Especially for those of you in CS/bioinformatics, let's hear it--this is an issue that's been stuck in my mind for years, and I feel it needs to be addressed. Please, for the sake of patient care, stop being snobby and judging those in the healthcare profession as technological ignoramuses who drag their feet about adopting new technology--many of us are not. Instead, try to work with us and understand what it is we need to deliver more effective care...because a medical diagnosis machine is, to be blunt, near the bottom of my current wishlist.
