What are the most time-saving keyboard shortcuts for Eclipse (Java)?
Here is the link where you should find all usefull shortcut list. @Eclipse Shortcuts  Some of them i like most is: Ctrl + Shift + R   Search dialog for resources, e.g. text files Ctrl + Shift + T   Search dialog for Java Types Ctrl + Shift + O    Organize the imports; adds missing import statements and removes unused ones Alt + ←               Go to previous opened editor. Cursor is placed where it was before you opened the next editor Alt + →               Similar Alt + ← but opens the next editor Ctrl + Space        Content assist/ code completion Ctrl + T               Show the inheritance tree of the current Java class or method. Ctrl + O              Show all methods of the current class, press Ctrl + O again to show the inherited methods. Shift + Enter       Adds a blank line below the current line and moves the cursor to the new line. The difference between a regular enter is that the currently line is unchanged, independently of the position of the cursor. Ctrl+Shift+Enter  Same as Shift + Enter but above
