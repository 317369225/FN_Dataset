Does the science journal "Nature Climate Change" have evidence to refute Al Gore's "Global Warming" or "Climate Change" theory?
Ben Watson covers all the substantive points, but the other half of your question still needs an answer. If there were conclusive science that Mr. Gore's position/theory on climate change was incorrect, he would not, and should not, give up any awards he won regarding that position or theory.  That is not how science and the acknowledgement thereof works. Awards such as the Nobel prizes are awarded to those persons making significant advances or important change at the time of the Award.  In science, later discoveries that show previous theories to be incomplete or incorrect do not negate the importance of the previous theory.  In fact, those later discoveries are usually made because there was an existing theory to investigate.  An example is the science of the chemical elements (hydrogen, gold, radon, etc.).  Without previous theories of the make-up of matter, e.g. the four-element theory of Earth-Fire-Air-Water, there would be little to motivate the search for a better theory. Science can be described as the process of making our understanding of the universe less wrong.
