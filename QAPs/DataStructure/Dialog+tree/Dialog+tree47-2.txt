Is the call center model broken?
No, it's not broken. Call centers are still an important part of sales and business, no matter what jokes are made about them. Having a person to talk to on the other end of a line makes the experience more personal and ultimately more helpful. That's not to discredit automated call systems, but they're not quite as adept at customer service inquiries. Really getting down to the nitty-gritty with a human being lets you learn more about the product in question, instead of just hearing pre-programmed answers. For example, if someone wants to know how long a product will be useful, they might be confused by the static reply the automation gives. Talking to a representative lets customers have a multifaceted experience with their queries, unbound by any programming code. The call center is still as efficient and useful as ever.
