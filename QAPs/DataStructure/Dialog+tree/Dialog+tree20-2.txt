What does it mean when someone uses multiple periods (...) instead of one period (.) to end a sentence?
It's an ellipsis.  You'll find some people that strenuously object to its use in the contexts you describe.  I am not one of them.  While in formal writing the ellipsis is normally used to refer to the omission of part of a quoted statement, in literature, and increasingly in informal writing, it can be used to indicate that a sentence is trailing off, or recently also to indicate the tonal inflection associated with a trailing-off sentence (a dash is used to indicate a cut-off sentence).  The difference in connotation is hard to describe.  "I'm hungry." is a pretty cut-and-dried thing; "I'm hungry...." is likely "I'm hungry but I don't know what I want to eat" or something to that effect; there's sort of a feeling that the speaker wants to say or hear something more.
