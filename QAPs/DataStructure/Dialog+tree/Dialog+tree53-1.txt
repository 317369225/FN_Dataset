What are some of the best computer games of all time?
Civilization (series) Turn based, take over the world and prove how smart you are. I played this bloody game for 18 hours at times without eating, sleeping, breaks, or even getting up to turn on the lights. ... Also taught me a love of history and technological progress. Tetris I played this game until I could see those dropping blocks in front of me without a computer. My wife (then girlfriend) had a similar experience. We could tell that the other were in the Tetris Haze by our glazed over looks. Learned nothing form the experience. Loved every minute of it. edit: maybe Tetris did help me: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tet... Updated 158w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
