What is your favorite 'easter egg' found in Tolkien's literary works?
My favorite Easter egg stems this bizarre passage, from his Old English translation of the Silmarillion: MMD. Hér þurh searucraeftas aþohton and beworhton þa Nold-ielfe gimmas missenlice, 7 Feanor Noldena hlaford worhte þa Silmarillas, paet waeron Eorclanstánas. Translation: In the year 2500 the Noldor learned to make and work gems, and Fëanor king of the Noldor created the Silmarils, which were holy jewels. The word Eorclanstánas literally means "precious jewels"; in a different form it appears in Beowulf (a poem to which Tolkien was deeply attached). Another way to write it is "eorcanstanas", which would have been pronounced "arkenstones". The Arkenstone isn't a Silmaril, but it is an example of Tolkien re-using his ideas from the Silmarillion to create The Hobbit. There is definitely a connection between the two, even if you have to go through Beowulf to get there.
