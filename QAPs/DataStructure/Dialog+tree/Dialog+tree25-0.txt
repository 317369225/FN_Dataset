Computational Linguistics:Â What is shallow processing?
Shallow processing means that you're not going in-depth. In terms of parsing, this might mean that you identify the word type for every word in a sentence, maybe even group nominal groups or the like, but you don't try to make a complete parse tree for the sentence. Grammars that describe every single possible sentence structure for a language are huge and not error-proof, and parsing a sentence to that level is a time-consuming process. So you'd use shallow parsing whenever possible, whenever you don't actually need the extra information. An example where shallow parsing is usually enough is understanding human requests in a dialog system. If someone asks your system 'Where do I find Main Street?', you only need to understand that it's a question about a place and that place is 'Main Street'. It is not necessary for your users to use correct language even - someone could ask 'Where Main Street' and you'd still answer that. If you fed that sentence into a full parser though, it might choke because the sentence doesn't have a verb. Shallow parsing is not enough if you want to determine if a sentence is correct, for example for a grammar checker. In that case you want to make sure that the sentence contains all the required parts, that the verb matches the subject, (in many languages) that the adjective is congruent with the noun, and so on, which requires more detailed analysis of how the sentence parts fit together.
