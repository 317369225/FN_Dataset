What are the most hilarious English mistakes (Indian)?
This is more of a vocab mistake, but since I have no where else to post it, I will, here. I have noticed very often you will find people using the following two words interchangeably, owing to their similar pronunciation and spellings; whereas they are miles apart in their meanings.   "Oh! I cannot see X loose! " Really? Which part of X is hanging loose? :P   "Why are you wearing such a lose top?"   Come again, you lost your top? Where? ;) For the record, Loose: adjective , not firmly or tightly fixed in place; detached or able to be detached. Antonym for "tight". Lose: verb, be deprived of or cease to have or retain (something). Antonym for "win".   P.S.: I have made this embarassing mistake more than once. Hence I keep a lookout for it. :) Updated 81w ago • View Upvotes
