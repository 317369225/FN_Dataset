What is the best sarcastic statement you have ever heard or read?
Some of my favorites include: "There are several good protections against temptation, but the surest is cowardice." "Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence in society." "The only way to keep your health is to eat what you don't want, drink what you don't like, and do what you'd rather not." "The holy passion of Friendship is of so sweet and steady and loyal and enduring a nature that it will last through a whole lifetime, if not asked to lend money." - Mark Twain “I am easily satisfied with the very best.” - Winston Churchill “Do you remember me telling you we are practicing non-verbal spells, Potter?" "Yes," said Harry stiffly. "Yes, sir." "There's no need to call me "sir" Professor." “Why were you lurking under our window?" "Yes - yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our windows, boy?" "Listening to the news," said Harry in a resigned voice. His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage. "Listening to the news! Again?" "Well, it changes every day, you see," said Harry.” - JK Rowling “We...we could be friends.' We COULD be rare specimens of an exotic breed of dancing African elephants, but we're not. At least, I'M not.” - Neil Gaiman
