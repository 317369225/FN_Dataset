Why did the Star Trek writers and producers change the nature of the Borg from being a linked collective to a queen-driven hive?
I couldn't possibly hope to top London Rook's answer here, but I would like to add a small point: in my view, "adding" a Queen to the Borg collective does not necessarily change their nature... it only changes what we've seen of their nature thus far. Consider the idea of the collective consciousness as akin to a vast network of individual computers forming a singular mind... at some point, for the good of the whole, SOMETHING must have the ability to filter, assess, and ultimately control the collective.  A bunch of automatons acting individually toward a group goal is fine, but who sets that goal?  Who get the final say if there's a "tie" between two ideas in the hive mind? The Borg are called a "hive mind" for a reason: most creatures in nature that exist in hives and work as a collective toward a common goal... have a queen.  Bees... ants... you get the idea.  Having a Queen for the collective really only makes sense... it's only "changed" because we never saw her before this movie... because there was no need to.
