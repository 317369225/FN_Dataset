Why is machine learning not more widely used for medical diagnosis?
Probabilistic expert system based on Promedas is being used at Ultrecht Medical Hospital. You can see how it works by creating a fake patient and running some tests under "Promedas Live" http://www.promedas.nl/ As far as going further than assisting with diagnosis based on series of test outcomes, there are unresolved challenges -- an ML system that replaces a doctor needs good natural language processing to be able to read latest medical journals, an inference engine to turn that information into decision rules, visual recognition to make judgements based on patients appearance, etc.
