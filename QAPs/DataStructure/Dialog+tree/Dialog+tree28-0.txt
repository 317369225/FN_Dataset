Which is the best language, C or C++?
"BEST" is hard to say. Which is the best tool, a hammer or a screwdriver?  Depends on what you want to do.  If you need pedal-to-the-metal speed, C is a good one to go for (unless you can read assembly language).  If you like the organization that object-oriention can bring to a language and programming, then C++ is better.  If you don't like pointing at variables or worrying about memory, C# takes a lot of that away. And of course, you CAN drive in a nail using a screwdriver if you want to. But best is to analyze and pick up the right tool for the right job. Still, this question raises a TON of passionate answers in other forums.  I am not here to evangelize any language, I plan to duck and watch the conversation!
