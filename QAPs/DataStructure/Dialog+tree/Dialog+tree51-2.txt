We know that the Harry Potter movies are a lot different from the books. Was there any change that made the movie better?
Order of the Phoenix: Umbridge: "Do something! Tell them I mean no harm!" Harry: "I'm sorry, professor. I must not tell lies." Harry stuns a death eater. Sirius: "Nice one, James!" Half Blood Prince: Slughorn telling Harry about the goldfish Lily once gave him as a gift. The night Lily died, the fish also gone. Deathly Hallows: Helena Ravenclaw: "If you need to ask, you will never know. If you know, you only need to ask." (That's a much better way to figure out that the diadem was in the room of requirements than Harry suddenly remembering seeing the tiara when hiding the Prince's potion book)
