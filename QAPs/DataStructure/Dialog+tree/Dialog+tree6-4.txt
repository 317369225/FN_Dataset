What qualities of Mass Effect 2 make it an exceptional game?
I finished both ME-games, and got bored with both Oblivion and Fallout, here's why I prefer Mass Effect 2 to most other RPGs: 1: Good acting and excellent facial animation. It actually makes trudging through the dialog-trees of ME2 enjoyable. In Oblivion and Fallout, it feels like a chore. And don't get me started on the silly idle chatter you get when you pass characters on the street -- it's a real immersion killer. 2: Engaging combat. The ''select enemy'' - ''select attack'' - ''watch canned animation'' mechanic of many RPGs (not including Oblivion and Fallout) makes me feel very distant to the fighting. ME took something that worked; the cover-based third person shooter, and added an option to pause the action to select special abilities. I don't know about consoles, but playing it on a PC with keyboard and mouse works great. 3: It feels less like accounting. Sorting through the 200 different kinds of assorted junk I've gathered in Fallout, or summing up stats to figure out if I should be selling my ''leggings of immolation'' or my ''socks of setting things on fire'' in Oblivion... well, it may be some people's idea of fun, but it's not mine. 4: Less filler. I get the whole thing with the sense of scale and the feeling of freedom, but the quantity seems to come at a cost of quality. I think Mass Effect 2 strikes the better balance here, but I can understand why some may feel differently. Updated 90w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
