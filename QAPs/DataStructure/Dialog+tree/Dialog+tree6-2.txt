What qualities of Mass Effect 2 make it an exceptional game?
The reason it is exceptional is that it is a BIG step forward from Mass Effect 1 and represents major genre growth that is long-term promising, so it's likely to be a game we look back on and see as a turning point in a genre.  And it was fun for a lot of people -- I personally like it a LOT.  The two major improvements that make it so ground breaking are: 1) The core combat is much improved and is somewhat unique to ME2. 2) The storytelling is much improved, and the characters are memorable and engaging.  ME1 did an good job of this, but ME2 did a great job.
