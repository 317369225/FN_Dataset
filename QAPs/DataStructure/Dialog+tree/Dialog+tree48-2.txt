What are some programming concepts, patterns or algorithms that give you insight into real life situations?
Programming in general is about problem solving. So anyone with a skill in programming will generally be a good problem solver. It's about deconstructing symptoms and finding the best resolution possible. Programming is also heavily rooted in logic and critical thinking. Generally these are powerful skills in every aspect of life. In terms of specific concepts which might also relate... Abstraction is a pervasive concept in programming which basically translates into... Create many parts of a program that do one thing well and connect with other things that do other single things well. This is another strong endorsement of focus and translates well into general life strategies. Hope that helps!
