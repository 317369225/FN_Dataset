How are NPCs programmed?
I assume you're talking about a NPC in a RPG / adventure like videogame. Use decision trees, and pre-define the answers. The former Maniac Mansion, ZarkMacraken and former The Secret of Monkey Island were the first games to achieve this. The modelling is like this: use a PERT diagraming tool, like MS Project or other tool used for project management; then, from there, use a directed graph like tree structure. Model it, fill it with strings with questions and answers; then create the same structure in C, C++ or Java or whichever else language you're using and make a decision algorithm which is based on those very same presets answers by the user. Therefore comes easy: no user, not even in quite advanced games like Oblivion, will give "normal language answers/questions", so in the end you decide by a preselected set of responses and answers. You program what the player could ask, so, you could fill in the answer in advance. Got it?
