How does writing for a video game such as Mass Effect or Dragon Age compare to the conventions of modern day screen and television writing?
I have written both screenplays (for my current university studies) and for games (my current position as a game writer/design intern for Schell Games). I agree wholeheartedly with Cliff Gilley's answer, but, have to say having done both that game writing is more challenging. In a screenplay, yes, all the characters in the show/film have a character arc, but it's a single, linear character arc. Drop these same characters into a video game and it's no longer necessarily linear, and you are dealing with multiple character arcs on each character, which are based on player decisions. I think dialogue has MORE of an emphasis in games than in screenwriting, though, it is important to screenwriting. In films, the director has the option of also using things like lighting, shot composition, clever placement of props, etc. in order to help tell the story. In a game, cinematic cut-scenes can be written similarly to films, but, for the most part during gameplay, the user is part of the scene and exerts control over what is seen when they are interacting with others. That means that the dialogue has to figure prominently because it's one of the only things the devs know about the player's experience (since each player will look different, approach from different places, choose different dialogue options). (Hope that makes sense.)
