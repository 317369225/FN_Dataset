What are some of the best computer games of all time?
Here's two PC Games that no one mentioned so far, chosen for the simple fact that no matter how long it's been since I played them, I just can't forget about them. 1. ARCANUM: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura Open  world rpg with a steampunk feel to it, great replayability and some of  the damn funniest dialogs I ever read. Great story, great writing, interesting world, choices that affect the story in interesting ways. Also, the sheep. ;) You can't  mention Arcanum without mentioning the sheep. ;) It's a  cult classic, and if you can put up with some bugs and the occasional crashing, it's on GOG. 2. THE WITCHER Semi-open world rpg, with great story, great writing, an interesting world with interesting politics, a morality that matters with actual shades of grey, and choices (even tiny ones) that really affect the way the story plays through. (Haven't played the second yet, ask me again in a couple of weeks.) You might notice a theme there. ;) As in, mature games, putting emphasis in writing-story-writing-choices-writing. I somehow feel if a game has that, it just becomes more memorable. Personal preference I suppose.
