How can I get back my AutoCAD command bar?
First thing to try: See if it was simply turned off by trying to turn it back on. you do this by typing the following command (even into the drawing environment) and pressing Enter to execute: commandline Or you could use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+9 to toggle it on/off. If that doesn't work, did you per chance have a different monitor setup at any time? E.g. a second monitor and now only one? Any changes to resolution? It might be that the command panel is floating somewhere off screen. If so type in CUI<Enter> ... again direct into the drawing window. This opens the Customize User Interface dialog. in the left hand tree-list open the top-most branch named Workspaces. Look for the workspace with (current) next to it, select that and then click the Customize Workspace button at the top on the right. In the tree-list just below that button, scroll down to the Palettes group, expand it and select the Command Line palette. In the bottom right properties panel change the Orientation property to Bottom so it docks in the bottom of the ACad window.
