What are the strengths of the visual novel medium versus games or other interactive media? What are its weaknesses?
Visual novels offer the potential for total creator control of the reader's optical input. You can control the angle from which every event is perceived, the timing of visual cues so as to ease the flow of the story and enable frictionless narrative comprehension. You can do anything you can imagine, and only represent the single most aesthetically striking/pleasing moment from a continuum that would take time and massive resources to reproduce in any other medium. Comics offer the potential for a sequence of perfections, both in an aesthetic sense, and in a totally subjective sense of what is perfect for any given story as told be any given storyteller. Comics rule.
