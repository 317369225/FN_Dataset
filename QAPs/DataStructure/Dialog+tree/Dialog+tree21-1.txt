How does writing for a video game such as Mass Effect or Dragon Age compare to the conventions of modern day screen and television writing?
I would think that one of the biggest differences in writing for a computer or console RPG is that you're not just telling one story from beginning to end, nor are you piecing together segments of a story in varying order (such as Pulp Fiction's mixed timeline or Memento's backward story).  In fact, you're required to weave multiple storylines that branch and merge and branch off again and again into a veritable web of interesting and compelling stories.  While this is obviously true in a game where you pick your background and origin - often each of these will have their own starting story - it's equally true of the entire game as a whole.  If, for example, you have a story that results in a decision to kill the king and take his place, to intimidate him into abdicating for his long-lost bastard son, or letting him remain on the throne and rule with an iron fist...well, you have to write those choices into the narrative as a whole,and take into account what the longer-term repercussions of those choices are on the world as a whole. And that's just the macro example - no longer are gamers comfortable or interested in going through the same old dialogue trees every time they talk to an NPC - there's an increasing focus on and expectation of "immersion" in these kinds of games, where we want to feel as though we're having an actual dialogue with them, not just picking an choosing from a multiple choice menu that rewinds every time you interact with them. I won't say it's more difficult (having never written a screenplay or even dialog for a massive RPG), but it is very different and perhaps more complicated from a technical point of view.
