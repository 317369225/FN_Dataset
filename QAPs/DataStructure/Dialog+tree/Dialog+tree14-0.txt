Does the science journal "Nature Climate Change" have evidence to refute Al Gore's "Global Warming" or "Climate Change" theory?
The paper linked to above doesn't "refute" climate change theory. Basically, the authors examined a series of independently selected tree cores from Scandinavia, and recorded the density of the tree ring widths. Using those widths, they compare the early and late season growth, and use that to calculate average temperature per year. The conclusion of this study was that the data suggest that there had been a slight cooling trend due to variable exposure to sunlight from variable solar orbits of the earth. These subjects are not touched upon in this paper, but are cited from another paper. The key issue arises because the cooling trend that arises in these data is not present in other published data. This doesn't refute the theory. Climate change is a theory based upon a massive amount of complexity and uncertainty. We don't have perfect knowledge about past temperatures, CO2 concentrations, or all the factors that contribute to climate. Tree ring width has been used as an analog, a tool that has been useful in trying to reconstruct past data. It is not the only tool that has been used, though it has been widely used. This study does present a challenge to the previous data, but a challenge to methods is a key part of the scientific process, and part of what makes the scientific process so reliable. Perhaps the study should be recreated elsewhere, to see if a wider examination upholds the hypothesis. Or, perhaps this study is due to local climate effects that were not in evidence elsewhere. The key factor is that people are thinking and acting upon those thoughts, and engaging in dialog.
