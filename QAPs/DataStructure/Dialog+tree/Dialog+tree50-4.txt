What's it like to meet Bill Gates?
Flying out of Chicago (ORD) as a reserve flight attendant, sometime in the early 80's, I was on a 727 working a Coach aisle position to Omaha, Nebraska. We served meals on domestic flights in those days and the service was finished. I was securing the galley in preparation for landing.  A call light illuminates and I make my way to seat 15D where a gentleman asks me "Do you have a Forbes magazine?" (Before it was determined that a lot of jet fuel could be saved by removing them due to the weight, we used to have a selection of magazines.) I grabbed a Forbes and returned to the passenger. He said "Look at the cover". I asked "What about the cover?" Pictured was Bill Gates.  "Look at Mr. 15C". In 15C, was a sleeping Bill Gates with his mouth wide open and body sprawled, contorted in the space. I could not contain myself and broke into a gut wrenching laugh along with everyone around. Mr. Gates slept soundly through the commotion. Mr. 15D said "Just wanted to see the look on your face!". I asked him why they were flying Coach and he told me it was the company policy and they always flew coach. I have utmost respect for this man who can laugh at himself, is family friendly to employees and who is using his generosity to help change the world. Now with frequent flier miles and more cramped conditions, I would imagine the company policy has probably changed. Hope you don't mind me sharing this story, Mr. Gates! Updated 14w ago • View Upvotes
