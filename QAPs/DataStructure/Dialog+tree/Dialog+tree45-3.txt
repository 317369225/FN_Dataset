What philosophical arguments from the Upanishads are useful in today's world?
8th Sloka of first valli from 2nd chapter, Katha Upanishad This is from Katha Upanisha. What I like about this is it talks about two kinds of fire that are maintained by mankind. Fire is maintained and nurtured the way a pregnant woman takes care of her child in the womb. One that is external (regular fire) which in old days used to be generated by rubbing two twigs of Aranya tree against each other. Other one which is of more relevance to everyday life is the fire that is maintained within our body (nothing but hunger). It is suggested in the sloka that this fire has to be maintained as well and the way to maintain that fire is by not eating full stomach always. There is medical proof that by always maintaining a slight hunger in our stomach (and not eating full stomach) our brain remains active.
