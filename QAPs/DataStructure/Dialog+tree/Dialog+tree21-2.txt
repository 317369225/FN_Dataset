How does writing for a video game such as Mass Effect or Dragon Age compare to the conventions of modern day screen and television writing?
Yep, definitely agree with Heidi and Cliff. I've worked as a writer in the games industry and outside and it is really hard to write game dialog well (and quickly). At BioWare it was hard to find high quality writers. A while back I did a couple of posts on this http://blog.brentknowles.com/201... and http://blog.brentknowles.com/201...
