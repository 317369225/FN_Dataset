What philosophical arguments from the Upanishads are useful in today's world?
Isha Upanishad: AUM THAT IS THE WHOLE. THIS IS THE WHOLE. FROM WHOLENESS EMERGES WHOLENESS. WHOLENESS COMING FROM WHOLENESS, WHOLENESS STILL REMAINS. AT THE HEART OF THIS PHENOMENAL WORLD, WITHIN ALL ITS CHANGING FORMS, DWELLS THE UNCHANGING LORD. SO, GO BEYOND THE CHANGING, AND, ENJOYING THE INNER, CEASE TO TAKE FOR YOURSELF WHAT TO OTHERS ARE RICHES. CONTINUING TO ACT IN THE WORLD, ONE MAY ASPIRE TO BE ONE HUNDRED. THUS, AND ONLY THUS, CAN A MAN BE FREE FROM THE BINDING INFLUENCE OF ACTION. UNILLUMINED INDEED ARE THOSE WORLDS CLOUDED BY THE BLINDING DARKNESS OF IGNORANCE. INTO THIS DEATH SINK ALL THOSE WHO SLAY THE SELF. AUM "Slay the self" means to slay the ego.Ego is the limited identity of ourselves which we have created due to the influence of maya http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May...
