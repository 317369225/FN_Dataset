Some aliases that I use are   alias a='./a.out';   alias open='gnome-open'; # open files with appropriate program from terminal   alias p='python';   alias v='vim';   alias mv='mv -i' # asks if accidentally replacing alert: Comes by default these days (>=Ubuntu 12*). When running commands that take long time to finish, put alert after them and you will get a notification after the command ends. Eg   sudo make install; alert; No more coming back to see if the command ended! Actually it's an alias too,   alias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i "$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)" "$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\''s/^\s*[0-9]\+\s*//;s/[;&|]\s*alert$//'\'')"'
