What were your misconceptions as a kid?
I thought language translation was algorithmic. When I was quite young, maybe 5 or 6, I knew that there were languages other than English, and I knew that my father spoke a language called French. When he told me this, I took it to mean that he knew literally every word in the French language (or at least every word for which he knew the corresponding word in English). It never occurred to me that anyone could possibly memorize so many words, let alone new grammatical structures! So at first I assumed that "learning a language" meant learning some series of rules for converting the words from one language to the words in another. At the time, I was really into blimps (seriously, I even had a stuffed one that my grandma made for me - but that's not important right now). Anyway, at some point, I asked my dad to tell me the French word for "blimp." He didn't know, which blew my mind - I thought he knew French! So I began to wonder if the rules for translation were more complicated than I'd originally imagined. Maybe there were lots of rules, but my dad had only learned some of them. Or maybe there was something about "blimp" specifically that made it really hard to translate? I knew a handful of French words, and I spent some time trying to figure out the "rules" that mapped from the letters in English words to the letters in French words. Of course, I was unsuccessful, but I figured it would all be explained to me in school. Not long after that, in an (ultimately failed) attempt to get me to learn French, my dad sent me to a summer French class. I figured out pretty fast that yes, you do actually have to memorize all the words, and no, there don't exist simple 1-to-1 mappings between languages!
