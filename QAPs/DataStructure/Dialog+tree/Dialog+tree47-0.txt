Is the call center model broken?
The call center model is not broken; it must be utilized complementary to other services such as chat, email, and support forums. It is necessary: the reason behind that people quite simply are too impatient and not informed enough about a product to deal with the other methods of support. How do you tell someone what you need to get done over a text-based method if you do not know how to phrase your answer? The call center model empowers employees representing the company to make decisions, probe a customer's needs, and make that customer a happy customer again. It allows for customer service. You can set up repairs easily for hardware, remote into a customer's screen to see their issue and talk to them while they are doing what you say, and work efficiently to ensure a successful issue resolution. The average person on Quora might be comfortable utilizing other methods of support. The average person on Quora also codes in 5 programing languages, can create the support tools that companies utilize, and probably works in Silicon Valley, the technology capital of the world. Call Centers aren't met for us. They're meant for the grandparents, soccer moms, and normal people of the world.
