What are some great stories about Bill Gates?
When Bill Gates was CEO, he once told the head of university recruiting at Microsoft that he could help if needed.  Years later the recruiter emailed Gates asking for his help with a prospective intern.  Later that night, Gates personally called the intern, and explained the opportunities for her at Microsoft.  The next day, that intern accepted her internship at Microsoft.   Gates however, emailed the college recruiter saying that he needed to work on his introduction because the intern refused to believe that it was actually Bill Gates.
