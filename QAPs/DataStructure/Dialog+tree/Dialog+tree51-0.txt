We know that the Harry Potter movies are a lot different from the books. Was there any change that made the movie better?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban stands out as a superior film than any of the others on account of its inspired direction (by Alfonso Cuaron). It contains many memorable additions to the book that improve upon it. One of these that comes readily to mind is the Knight Bus. In the book/s, the plot device seemed to me to be underutilized and underdeveloped, whereas the film makes it into a wonderfully quirky spectacle. It's one of those moments in the film that you remember even after you're done watching it. In the books, the Knight Bus and its supervisor, Stan Shunpike have a marginalized appearance.
