What are a few important points to consider while writing the storyline to an RPG?
Very good answers, but one other aspect should be named: Unless the game is supposed to be a very lighthearted one, try to give the players at least one antagonist to HATE. Note that, yes, this can be the ''big bad'', but does not have to be. It's pretty hard to write such a story well. The boss is usually out of the hero's league for the lion's share of the plot, and often takes a back seat until the climax approaches. (It's possible though - System Shock pulled this off with Shodan, for example.) Maybe try someone who is halfway between the boss and the hero. Avoid supervillainy traits for him for as long as possible, since early on, they make him larger than life and thus unrealistic - its easier to first hate him for his immediate actions and ruthlessness. He does not cackle maniacally, he does not plan for world domination... he just has his own little agenda and will stop at nothing. Killing family members is a start. Talking the local king/mayor/captain into falsely imprisoning the protagonists or abandoning them on an island to die. Placing some variety of explosive necklace on a party member. And so on. Make it personal. Make it up close. Maybe even place him right next to the hero for a while. It fills the gap until the boss and adds plenty of grim satisfaction / potential moral dilemma to hunt him down.
