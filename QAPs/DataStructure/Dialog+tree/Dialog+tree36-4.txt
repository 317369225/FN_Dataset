Which is the best video player for Windows, other than VLC?
Best player for Windows is VLC without any doubt but as you asked, yes it does affect speakers because it can increase the volume more than it should. If you'll keep the volume upto 100% max always then you need not to be worried about your speaker's. Another good players i found 1. KMP Player- supports enough codecs which you may need, simple interface and support subtiles also. 2. MPC( Media player classic)-Â  can externally install codecs, supports subtitles and simple user interface 3 GOM player- it's also a good player. (I didn't find the interface attractive and simple, people may disagree but everyone has their different experience) Thanks for A2A. :)
