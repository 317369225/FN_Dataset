What is something that money can't buy?
“I think the next generation of entertainment is experiential, where people go out of the house and go and get a unique experience.”- Mark Cuban. In today's society people seek to make more money and grow their wealth, but even the richest people aren't happy.  What really brings people happiness, excitement, and life-fulfillment are life experiences.  Just last weekend I went for a hike and marshmallow tour with my girlfriend and had an amazing time. You can check it out here: Night Hike and Marshmallow Roast We enjoyed a feasible five mile hike and then indulged in some delicious marshmallows for an unforgettable experience. That moment with her meant everything.
