What type of algorithm does Web MD and other online automated diagnosis/advice websites use?
I do not know, but if I were tasked to do that with limited resources, I'd give ID3 algorithm a try. There are many ways one could try to model the problem of giving diagnosis, but when I think about the dialog between a doctor and a patient, I imagine all possible dialogs as a big tree, with doctor's questions as internal nodes, edges as patient's answers, and diagnosis in leaves. There are many possible ways to define the goal here, but I'd say that the goal is primarly to minimize the risk of giving wrong diagnosis, and secondary to minimize the expected length of the search path in the tree. ID3 is one of algorithms which aims to build a good tree for your data set, but it's just a heuristic. The reason I'd prefer such solution to neural networks, or evolutionary algorithms, is that at it produces a comprehensive outcome - a tree which a real doctor could read, understand, verify and manually fix - while it seems much harder to do with an instance of a neural network, which to me seems like wasting beautifully architected silicon to make ugly meat-like brain. (OTOH using silicon to replace meat makes sense in some areas of medicine). Updated 67w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Chris Banks
