How do you judge what I did? Read the details.
I would die for my mother and motherland. But getting beaten up for a girl you hardly know is not bravery. Its stupidity. Fight the world, if she was getting abused. Take a baseball bat in hand if she was harassed. Die for her if she loves you. But do not even get abused for the wrong person. Going by the facts, she is your classmate and you like her. However, she doesn'tÂ  like you and also provokes Adam. So you are barking at the wrong tree. Do not chase that car. Stop right away. END. Now, assuming that the girl also has interest in you but is afraid of Adam and you are also scared of Adam (you will face this situation in future because Adam is habitual of hitting every pretty girl in college) then, you have but one solution: Be patient. If the girl has any better taste, she will never fall for Adam. All you have to do is finish your degree in flying colors, get an excellent job and once the college is over and once there is no fear of Adam, propose to the girl of your life. She will definitely say yes. Borrowing a dialog from The Dark Knight Rises (2012): Talia al Ghul: You see, it's the slow knife... the knife that takes its time, the knife that waits years without forgetting, then slips quietly between the bones... that's the knife that cuts deepest. For some reason I feel that you are an Andhra guy (I am sure you are a south Indian) and watch lot of Telugu movies where hero loves a girl, a big rowdy (villain) also loves the same girl. Our hero fights this rowdy and his henchmen and finally unites with the girl. Its a dream sequence. Do not try that at home or college.
