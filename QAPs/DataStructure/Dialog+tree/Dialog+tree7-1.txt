Does it look like TOR is going to reach the critical mass of users needed to achieve sustainability as an MMORPG?
To add to Cliff Gilley's answer, endgame plays such a huge part in the success of an MMO, so we don't know if people are going to stick around once they hit max level. Being a new player is a lot of fun, but what happens when the personalized quests start drying up and you're (potentially) left with Just Another MMO?
