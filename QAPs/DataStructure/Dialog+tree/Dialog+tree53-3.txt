What are some of the best computer games of all time?
I present to you: The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Kinda surprised this hasn't been mentioned here yet. This is an open-world action RPG by Polish developer CD Projekt Red based on the fantasy books by Andrzej Sapkowski. Is there one word to describe it? Probably, yes. Masterpiece. Blazes its own path through the crowded lanes of cookie cutter RPGs. This is a game to experience - telling you more about it will just spoil the fun!
