What is the way to develop careers in game development?
The main career paths in the games industry are: 1) Programmer - usually hired from graduate Comp-Sci / Math background. But portfolio work definitely can help. 2) Artist / Animator - usually hired on basis of portfolio. But often with some fine art training.  3) Designer - senior game designers have no fixed career pathway. They often migrate from other junior positions.  Content programmers & scripters hired from modding community, programming qualifications. 4) QA Tester - not as fun as it sounds. The role which requires least formal qualifications. 5) Manager  / Producer - can migrate from similar role in other businesses. There are other roles in games, but the ones below are often outsourced to specialist vendors. 6) Sound Designer -  Will have back catalog of work. 7) Musician Composer - Will have executed game soundtracks 8) Localisation - Responsible for translation of text and audio assets from other languages.  Usually educated with language qualifications 9) Writer - Able to write game scripts, dialog trees etc. 10) Motion Capture & Photogrammetry specialists Getting into the industry means entering one of these roles. You can also enter the business by becoming your own boss and setting-up your own development enterprise. To develop your career, I'd suggest that the most valued employees are those who solve the most problems (rather than the ones who do the most work)
