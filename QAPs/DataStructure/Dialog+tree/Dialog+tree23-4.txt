Why did the Star Trek writers and producers change the nature of the Borg from being a linked collective to a queen-driven hive?
The reason this was changed, as stated by the writers of First Contact, is that it made the Borg easier to write for. What bothers me about the Borg Queen isn't that she exists, but the way she is portrayed. If she was simply an avatar of the entire Collective, basically a construct that the hive mind uses when they need someone to speak for them, that would be fine. But the way she is portrayed, it's impossible to interpret her as anything but the literal Queen of the Borg Collective, i.e. an individual leader in a hierarchy. In that moment the Borg ceased to be a unique threat and became a cliche and formulaic one. You could replace the Borg in First Contact with any army of drone-like soldiers controlled by a despotic leader and you'd barely have to change any dialogue. Though frankly, this is the least of the issues I have with the Borg. The Borg, much like the Ferengi, are a classic case study in why consistency is important when writing a fictional alien race.
