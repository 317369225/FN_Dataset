What does it mean when someone uses multiple periods (...) instead of one period (.) to end a sentence?
Those multiple periods are taken to be a single typographic character called an "ellipsis," which is used to indicate that something that normally should be there has been purposely left out. The dictionary says it is "a set of three dots (â€¦), used to indicate that words have been omitted." The Online Etymology Dictionary says: from Latin ellipsis, from Greek elleipsis "a falling short, defect, ellipse in grammar," from elleipein "to fall short, leave out," from en- "in" + leipein "to leave" (see relinquish). The grammatical sense in English was first recorded in the 1610s.
