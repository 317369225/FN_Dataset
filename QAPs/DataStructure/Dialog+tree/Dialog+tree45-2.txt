What philosophical arguments from the Upanishads are useful in today's world?
The teachings of the Upanishads created the theoretical framework for what we nowadays observe as applied Hinduism.  Upanishad means to "sit down near" or prostate oneself in the presence of a wise teacher or guru.  The Upanishad movement directly led to the master-disciple dynamic that pervades Indian religion today.  This is its most important contribution. Scholarly brahmins left the orthodoxy in order to spend meditative time alone in the presence of the Vedas and the Upanishads reflect their interpretation of how best to apply Vedic doctrine to human life.  A spiritual guide is expected to know and understand scripture in a very personal way in Hinduism. Enlightening Essays -The Mundaka Upanishad (pt-5) In my opinion, the notion of an enlightened guru leading you to salvation through discourse is the biggest idea that comes from this body of work.
