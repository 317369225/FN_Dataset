Which historical figures best demonstrate the internal struggle between good and evil?
If you include mythological figures too then I believe the best example would be Pitamah Bhism... He knew the difference between right and wrong... That kauravs deceived pandavas... And that with lord Krishna and morality on pandavas side kauravs were fighting only to lose... But he was bounded by his oath... And so he had to fight for the kauravas... That's why, Though, he was lieutenant (senapati) for duryodhan still he blessed yudhisthir to win....
