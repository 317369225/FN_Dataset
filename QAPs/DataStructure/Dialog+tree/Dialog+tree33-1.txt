What are some little known tricks or hacks for Ubuntu?
- Keyboard shortcuts! Each distro has the settings hidden away somewhere or the other, but they're a gold mine. You can make keyboard shortcuts for just about anything. Let me say that I use Ubuntu forks mainly, and not Ubuntu Vanilla, for the most part this is Pinguy OS and occasionally Linux Mint for playing around. - When installing your OS, use the advanced partitioning and don't go for the default partitioning. Generally I set my partitions up like below. The reason for this is that the next to you wish to change your OS to another distro or do an upgrade, you may essentially wipe out / and leave your /home as is with all your data and settings intact. The swap is important as well as is a /boot. - Another thing, if your GUI ever locks up or you have trouble doing something in your main window, learn to love your virtual terminals which you may navigate to using ctrl + alt f1 to f6. ctrl + alt f7 will take you back to your GUI. Unix - Virtual Terminal If even those freeze up, know what your IP address is, and have ssh enabled so you can always remotely see what the ruccuss is about in your systems innards. - And best of all, Google is your friend.
