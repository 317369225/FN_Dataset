What are the most hilarious English mistakes (Indian)?
This one is probably for Indian readers only. A friend of mne was asked this question by our English teacher and his reply was so awesome that the teacher was left spellbound. Sir- Translate this sentence in English. " Main chala , chalta chala gaya,aur kabhi dobara nahi lauta." (I walked , kept walking and never came back!.) Student (after a pause to frame the answer)- Sir it says, " I went, so went hi went , aur aisa went ki came hi not! ". That was one of the highlights of that class. Ironically ,that guy is studying pursuing MBA right now.
