Are there any AI systems that work by a debate-like process between alternative points of view?
Recently the Watson AI system has been programmed to argue a point of view of a topic.  IBM's Watson can now debate any topic At a lower level, there are also reasoning programs that do Assumption Based Truth Maintenance (ATMS) which is reasoning by maintaining several concurrent viewpoints.  Other reasoning programs can do Justification Based Truth Maintenance, which is reasoning by maintaining a single viewpoint which can change what it considers true based on new information.  The book Building Problem Solvers by Kenneth Forbus and Johan de Kleer (and its companion  guide Building Problem Solvers Listings, containing Lisp code) is a very good introduction to this subject.
