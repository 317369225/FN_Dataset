What are the most treasured aspects of '90s adventure game design and how might these be modernized and used in modern games?
A question I'm very obligated to answer! I built a career on the adventure game genre and work at Telltale Games. The answer won't be any one particular response and there's a lot of insight already to this thread. Hopefully I can give a different set of answers to the conversation. My treasured aspect of adventure games is character. While narrative is a part of any game, the adventure game genre places an emphasis on the development of characters. The player cares about the development of not just the player character, but of the cast surrounding the player. Because of this, these titles explored narrative in interactivity. Myst (1993) Myst is an exploration of the film principal of mise-en-sc√©ne in interactive storytelling. The objects placed in the frame are not just keys to solving puzzles, they communicate the deeper context of the characters without lengthy dialog. Under a Killing Moon (1994) Apart of the Tex Murphy series, here is one of the better examples of live-action-video (LAV) titles that weren't minimalist like the Myst series. Not bad, just different. Here the challenges were to make an engaging plot with decidable more interface. All of this and more leads to the development of the language of interactive entertainment. We figure out how to communicate using this form of media though the past. While every title contributes to the art form as a whole, the particular note that adventure games illustrate for me are ways to illustrate a depth of a character in interactive media.
