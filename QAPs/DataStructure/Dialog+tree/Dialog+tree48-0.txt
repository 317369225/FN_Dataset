What are some programming concepts, patterns or algorithms that give you insight into real life situations?
The big part of the field of AI is concerned with modeling human behavior. Concepts such as decision trees, fuzzy logic and semantic analysis come to mind. They all strive to allow machines to make choices using several sources of data in a way similar to what we are capable of. Abilities we take for granted but which are very hard to model in a formal language. Take this dialog from the movie Machine (2013): Vincent: Green: Mary saw a puppy in a window, she wanted it. What did Mary want? Green Candidate: The window. Vincent: Why? Green Candidate: Windows look out onto the world. They are pretty, and help you feel less alone. Vincent: This is beautiful programming. This is a form of subject resolution. To us it is obvious what Vincent refers. To an AI it's hard. It requires contextual knowledge and being able to draw conclusions from it. Try to come up with a way to write a computer program that understands what Vincent meant in the exchange above. It's one way to model a real life situation.
