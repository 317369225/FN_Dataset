What philosophical arguments from the Upanishads are useful in today's world?
If there is one thing that Upanishads teach then that is Strength and Fearlessness. Each and every sentence of the Upanishads reverberates with the idea of Strength. There is no place for any kind of weakness. Strength here doesn't mean physical strength. It means mental strength. Freedom from all animal instincts, free from all sensuality, free from all selfishness and attachment. That is the kind of strength which nothing in this world can ever give you other than the Upanishads. Swami Vivekananda spoke a lot about Upanishads. On his commentary he said about Strength and Fearlessness. You could refer to the following books : The Message of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad The Message of the Upanishads The Charm and Power of the Upanishads Universal Message of Bhagavad Gita All are authored by Swami Ranganathananda of Advaita Ashrama Bhagavad Gita is also an Upanishad. Its called Gitopanishad(sounds like that)
