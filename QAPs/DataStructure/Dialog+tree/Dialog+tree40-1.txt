Computational Linguistics: What is the difference between a language model and a hierarchical language model?
I'm not a formally trained expert, more like a hobbyist or maven, but a quick search of my Meta-Guide.com website seems to indicate that language models are generally statistical, whereas hierarchical language models are rule or tree based.  So, a more precise distinction may be statistical language modeling versus hierarchical language modeling. See my quick and dirty webpages: IRSTLM (IRST Language Modeling) Toolkit - Meta-Guide.com Language Modeling & Dialog Systems 2011 - Meta-Guide.com Rule-based Language Modeling - Meta-Guide.com SRILM (SRI Language Modeling Toolkit) 2011 - Meta-Guide.com
