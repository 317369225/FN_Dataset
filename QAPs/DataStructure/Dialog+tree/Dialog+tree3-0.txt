Is Python good for developing games? Why or why not?
Python and Pygame is a good language and framework for rapid game prototyping or for beginners learning how to make simple games. Ultimately the performance of Python isn't good enough for the performance intensive parts of the game engine for higher end games. Your export options may be limited to devices with a python interpreter however, which basically excludes mobile. Python is also good for building tools for game designers which simplify tasks like level design or dialog tree creation and having those tools export that work into a format the main game engine can use. Some game engines might use Python as a scripting language. For instance I know all the AI behaviors in The Sims games are scripted in Python. 3D Editing Packages like Maya use Python for scripting and it's pretty much a required skill to be really competent with those tools. Python's powerful string manipulation, large set of easy libraries, and easy shell access makes it an extremely useful language for quickly automating repetitive tasks. (Like resizing 500 textures in a batch) To sum up, Python is not really the best language for programming games; but it is a very important tool in a game programmers tool kit. You would be well served by learning it.
