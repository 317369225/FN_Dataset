What are some little known tricks or hacks for Ubuntu?
Umm, a few: I don't know if it's really an Ubuntu trick or a hack, but I find "hnb" (hierarchical notebook) to be an incredibly awesome text-mode notebook for keeping track of various tricks, hacks, notes, snippets and tools that I might want to remember for later. I can jump in and add a note and be out in seconds. apt-torrent is a nifty tool using P2P to keep your system up to date. When I need a bleeding edge version of software already installed on my system, I always stick it under /opt, say /opt/gnuradio.  If I need it to override the package-installed version, I add it to the start of my $PATH environment variable like so: export PATH=/opt/gnuradio/bin:$PATH.  If I want it to permanently override until my package manager upgrades it, I do: ln -sf /opt/gnuradio/bin/* /usr/bin.  If I want to permanentally override it regardless of what my package manager does, I do: ln -sf /opt/gnuradio/bin/* /usr/local/bin. I love SquashFS because it is awesome.  See, I have several very large packages on my system, including different versions of the same package (SideFX Houdini 11 and 12, Xilinx Webpack 9.1, 10.1 & 12.3, Altera ModelSim 6.1 and Quartus II, etc).  Each of these packages range between 2 gigabytes to 10 gigabytes for each version and 10s or 100s of thousands of small files.  SquashFS is a nicely compressed read-only filesystem that supports the very fast, lightweight lzo compression (as well as lzma, gzip and others) and file deduplication - so it not does it efficiently pack down all these 100s of thousands of files but it also finds duplicate files and only keeps one copy. So software that originally occupied 20+GB of space on my computer in half a million files (not counting considerable filesystem metadata overhead) now exists as one single 8GB SquashFS file that I can mount as a filesystem with in command and use whenever I need it.  In addition, it's *FASTER* - as in, software loads slightly faster.  Doing a 'find .' that would normally take a few minutes to recurse through thousands of directories takes about 5 seconds.  Creating a SquashFS filesystem is as easy as: mksquashfs /opt/webpack webpack.sfs -comp lzo Mounting it back as a filesystem (after I've removed everything in /opt/webpack/*) is simply: sudo mount webpack.sfs /opt/webpack -o loop
