How are NPCs programmed?
Ok, so there are many ways this could work out -- it all depends on the actual specifications of how the dialogs should act out. First way would be to just have an array of strings, and then pick an index randomly and make the NPC output this string. This is hardly human-like behaviour however. So the second approach would be to create some kind of path, or manuscript that the NPC will follow. This would be a graph-like structure which would most likely have one or several root nodes (depending on which dialog to start!) with edges to different answers available to the human player. The player would then traverse the graph to one of the end nodes. A third way would be to utilize some more advanced AI techniques, like having a database of dialogs, and use natural language processing to construct new dialogs based on the corpora (collection of texts), and present them using the second approach.
