What are the most time-saving keyboard shortcuts for Eclipse (Java)?
As far as I see, the most used two shortcuts are: Ctrl + Shift + T : To open a .java file Ctrl + Shift + R : To open a resource (every file is on that list) Other than these two and the other answers, if I need to add Javadoc to an instance variable or to a method, just while the cursor is on it, use Alt + Shift + J : Eclipse will automatically generate javadoc for it. I also use Alt + Shift + S then R to get to add getters/setters window (which is done over and over again in Java). I also prefer CTRL + Click over F3 to jump to definition.
