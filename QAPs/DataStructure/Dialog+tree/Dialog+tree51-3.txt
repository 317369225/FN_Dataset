We know that the Harry Potter movies are a lot different from the books. Was there any change that made the movie better?
For me the first two movies were very nearly perfect. Especially the casting! I mean Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Mcgonagall, Snape, Quirrell, Draco, Dobby... all were very much perfect. So were the general sets used and also music and tunes. I didnt like anything much after the first two...
