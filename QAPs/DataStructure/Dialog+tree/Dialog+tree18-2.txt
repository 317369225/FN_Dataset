What were your misconceptions as a kid?
I grew up in India, so whenever my family said "galat fehmi" (misunderstanding) I though they said "galat family" (wrong family) and always wondered why do they say "You have a wrong family" (aapko galat fehmi hai) in random conversations with people. EDIT : Thanks to Agam Kapur. Apparently, "Fehmi" is also wrong. (There's nothing such as 'fehmi'. Its 'galat vehemi'. The core word being vehem and vehemi being the derivative. ) Updated 103w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
