Which is the best video player for Windows, other than VLC?
Thanks for the A2A Nivi R.V. Since you have kept VLC as the best, let me not speak about that. My vast experience in technology has shown me various players, like Windows Media Player, Winamp, Real Player, PowerDVD, QuickTime, VLC, KM Player, just to name a few. Of these, none compare to the experience PotPlayer has brought me.Â  Imagine it as the child born when the wide format-support, simplistic design and customization of VLC marries the snappiness and audio quality of KM Player. I'm sure it was designed by some potheads. ;) No ads. No flashy stuff. Lightweight. Fast. I changed my complete video preference to PotPlayer just because of that. However, I still keep VLC because it plays H265 (also called as High Efficiency Video Codec (HEVC)) content better and also as a backup plan. You can download it here : Global Potplayer PotPlayer 1.6.51480 / 1.6.51610 Beta EDIT : Here are some screenshots Happy Watching.
