How do I believe that the humans around me actually possess consciousness (and it's not just me who is conscious)?
People around you are "merely" programmed to act that way. They are programmed by their genes and upbringings. The main programmer is Nature, and it uses the programming language of DNA. When a map perfectly resembles the terrain, it is the terrain.
