How do I believe that the humans around me actually possess consciousness (and it's not just me who is conscious)?
The ancient sceptical Problem Of Other Minds is usually reckoned insoluble. Worse, mainstream scientific materialism offers no grounds for believing that one is not surrounded by p-zombies. (cf. Philosophical zombie) However, the conjecture that one is surrounded by sentient beings rather than p-zombies may instead be treated as an experimentally testable hypothesis. Consider the Hogan sisters (cf. "Could Conjoined Twins Share A Mind": The New York Times Developing technologies of reversible thalamic bridges promise a future of â€œmind-melding" with other humans and sentient beings from other species. Such utopian technologies should finally lay the philosophical Problem Of Other Minds to rest. "Mind-melding" technologies may lead, not just to a Copernican moral revolution, but also to a revolution in our conception of decision-theoretic rationality. Naturally, the proposal that mature posthuman ethics and decision-theoretic rationality might converge sounds too good to be true. But once sentient beings can "mind-meld", behaving "selfishly" may come to seem not just immoral but also irrational - akin to harming oneself.
