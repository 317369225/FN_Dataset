What are a few important points to consider while writing the storyline to an RPG?
For me: 1. Know your Cliches RPG's suffer from alot of them, be aware. Save the princess, be the hero, beat the bad guy; all a little tired. 2. Allow your players to feel weak RPG's are generally about growth, development and discovery. What is the point if you don't give players obstacles that will defeat them, meaningful character flaws, and areas they seemingly can not reach? Just having the first boss beat you is not sufficient! (See #1) 3. Allow diverse styles of gameplay People play role playing games for different reasons, and the genre is more fragmented than any other in the space. (Did you know that the original Diablo was going to be a next-generation rogue-like?). Speaking of rogue-likes, they are pretty unforgiving, but Pokemon Mystery Dungeon is anything but. Do you want your players to be able to skip the story? Dig deeper? Is the story the only real game at all? (See link at bottom) 4. Provide the illusion of choice Many RPG's make the mistake of focusing the story down very narrow lines. What exactly is an RPG if it doesn't have some element of roleplaying? Can your character steal, cheat, be nasty, say inappropriate things? There is a fine line between the illusion of choice and actual choice. Pay close attention to the dialog in Bioware RPG's, make a save and play the same encounter multiple times, make different choices (The intro levels of Mass Effect and KoTOR tell the same story, and are remarkable examples). How much choice did you really have? How did your choices effect your gameplay experience? You don't even need to tie into mechanics.
