Does it look like TOR is going to reach the critical mass of users needed to achieve sustainability as an MMORPG?
Speaking as someone who has experienced the Endgame content in TOR now, i still foresee that the game itself has a shaky future. As Jason said the majority of the reasons why MMO's enjoy such large numbers for long periods of time is the Endgame content. However TOR's endgame is horribly buggy, as of now 7 out of the 11? Flashpoints (Dungeons) are unplayable on Hardmode, The Eternity Vaults & Bonethrasher are clearable, but susceptible to be made 10x harder then they need to be by the presence of quite annoying Bugs. Given that the majority of endgame has already been cleared, even by non-hardcore raiding guilds, Bioware are gonna have to start to get a move on keeping the high-level users Engaged as, put simply, there just isn't enough stuff to keep someone who has hit 50 entertained for a long time.
