What does it mean when someone uses multiple periods (...) instead of one period (.) to end a sentence?
Thanks to Andrew Joh for the A2A. Those three dots are together known as ellipsis (plural: elipses) -- or "suspension point" in the printing trade. The principal (and traditional) function is to indicate intentional omission of a word, section or a whole section of text. However, it has come to pass that the ellipsis is also used as a visual cue or signal in the text to show 4 possible things: 1. Something more is to come (e.g. to break up longer turns in conversations). 2. Politeness, such as to show changing of the topic or hesitation. 3. Silence or pause, such as to show confusion, disagreement or disapproval (and this was started in the comic strips and comic books in the 1950s to show "trailing-off silence"). Updated to add: 4. Some sort of 'deeper' meaning implied by the writer or for the recipient to figure out. In other words, the ellipsis is also to inject a personalised flavour into the message.
