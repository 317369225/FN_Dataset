What qualities of Mass Effect 2 make it an exceptional game?
I think if you enjoy oblivion and fallout, ME franchise is probably not your cup of tea. And the fact that you singled out ME2, I assume you didn't play ME1 and start right from 2? That could be part of the reason you find it less impressive. Fallout and oblivion are free roaming RPGs, which is very different from ME, which is heavily scripted, and much more linear. Mass Effect is about story and character development, both your own character as well as your companions. Many players (myself included) become very attached to the NPCs. That's make the story a lot more engaging and the choices you make carries more weight. They're part of your adventure, they grow with you, and eventually, each become an distinctive person. They have their own stories and their own quests. While in Fallout or Oblivion, you have henchman, you can hire or fire them at anytime, They're there mostly for combat needs, they tank for you, they carry your loot, and that's about it. I remember the most attachment I had in Fallout 3 is with dogmeat. I feel really sad when he died, and willing to reload a saved game to revive him. That's nothing compare to the kind of attachment you get from ME. So if you didn't played ME1, then the emotional impact of having your old teammate back to you would be a lot less profound. Although I don't recommend you play ME1 considering the combat is such a pain and mako driving is hellish. But still, ME2 and 3 are superb PRGs (Except for the stupid finale).
