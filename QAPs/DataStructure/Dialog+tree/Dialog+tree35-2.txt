What makes acting believable?
Acting intentions and objectives instead of emotions. Declan Donelan, who has served as director of the "Cheek by Jowl" Theatre Company and the Royal Shakespeare Company, had this to say about acting in 2002: "Playing an emotion is like trying to shit out of your ear.  You push and push, but it just doesn't come.  The tubes aren't connected."
