What is Sansa Stark and Theon/Reek's fate at the end of season five?
Reek rescued Sansa from Myranda after she tried to harm her, and he did so in the best way possible: by throwing Ramsay’s crazy girlfriend over the side of the castle walls. It was a bold move, indeed, and proves that Theon still exists inside that shriveling shell of a man that he’s become. SPOILER- In books Jeyne was married to Ramsey, and Theon and Jeyne Pool jumped from the wall. In Winds of Winter Excerpt of Theon, they both were captured by Stannis army when they were running away. But in show, Stannis is dead, So i think they will be founded by Brienne and Podrick.
