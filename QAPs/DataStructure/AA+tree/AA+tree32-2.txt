What are some songs that cheer you up?
There are many songs that make me happy; it depends on the type of "happy" I'm looking for. However, at the moment, I would say this song: "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)" by the Proclaimers Reason: It brings back many happy memories. Also, it reminds me of the film, "Benny and Joon" which is quirky, heartwarming, and funny. :)
