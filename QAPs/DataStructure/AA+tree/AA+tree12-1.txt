What is the best thing you have heard MSD say from behind the stumps?
Dhoni saying to Ravindra Jadeja while bowling to Chris Gayle- "Ek baar bola hai baar baar nai boluga, per pe khilana hai to per pe hi khilana hai". (Seeing the inability for Gayle to play fast flatter balls to his legs, Dhoni warns Jadeja "will say only once, deliver nowhere but his legs"). He's the captain though, he can command.
