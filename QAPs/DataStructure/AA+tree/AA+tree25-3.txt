What film scene(s) influenced you most?
I am going a bit off beat here. None of the answers go towards scenes which are so morbid that they haunt you. They leave you with an uneasy feeling which is difficult to get rid of. Here are is one scene which has influenced me the most. Irreversible, the rape scene: Alex (Monica Bellucci) while crossing an underpass, is spotted by a street thug, Le Tenia. He brutally pins her down at knife point. Then he anally rapes her. And to conclude, he kicks, punches and abuses her till she is unable to move. Bloodied and lifeless. The violence of the scene hits you. Aggression of Le Tenia, helplessness of Alex and sheer brutality of human nature which the scene reveals is too much to take. I can not help but feel sorry for Alex as I am typing. Every time I hear of a rape crime, shrill cries of Alex haunt me. If you want to know the horrors of rape, do see the film Irréversible.
