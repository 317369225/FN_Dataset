Do you believe babies are born atheist, and do you believe atheists never convert? How can these two beliefs coexist?
Unfortunately, everyone has their own definition of what an "atheist" is.  Oxford Dictionaries defines an atheist as : "a person who disbelieves or lacks belief in the existence of God or gods"*.  This is the definition that I use, and for the most part, the definition that is most widely accepted. In light of the above, I certainly believe that (all) babies are atheists, yes.  It is undoubtedly the case that when you are born, you do not inherit any beliefs - be them religious, political or otherwise - held by your parents.  You, as a new born baby, "lack belief" in more or less everything. However, some argue that to be an atheist, you have to make a conscious evaluation and decision; whether to believe or disbelieve. I do not share this point of view. No definition that I can find defines an atheist as someone who "consciously makes an evaluated decision in regards to the divine". If you lack belief in god(s), you are an atheist.  Babies lack belief. The answer is clear. The two statements cannot coexist.  * (Source:  definition of atheist in Oxford dictionary (British & World English))
