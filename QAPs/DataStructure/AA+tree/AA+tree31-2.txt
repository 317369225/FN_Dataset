What do people think about Nagpur?
Well living in nagpur is a bliss... There are endless things but here are few: 1: The lakes. You have just had a busy day and you are all stressed out; take your vehicle and just go to the nearest lake. Somehow the chaos help to relax.. Magical and illogical. 2: The late night Chai and Poha. Blessing for the students. Just need to take a walk around shankar nagar or lokmat square and you know that the world is awake with you. 3: Partying at Haldiram's. Be it a birthday party or just hanging out after bunking the college; most feasible is Haldiram's. God bless him!! 4: Maharaj Baug and Botanical Gardens. Heaven for all lovebirds ;-) 5: Sauji chicken. No need to explain that . Never had anything better. 6: Roads and Traffic. Best place to drive. You know that even if you hit someone deliberately and pick up the speed you are safe. Just pray that you do not get trapped at next signal. 7: Language. This is one thing that a Nagpurian yearns for if you are anywhere outside. Hao, aara na, garam me chal raha tu, etc already mentioned in other answers. Lastly The Ram Jhula... Guess that is the dream of every Nagpurian
