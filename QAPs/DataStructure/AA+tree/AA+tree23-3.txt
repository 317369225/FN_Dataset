What are some real life examples of chutzpah (please read details)?
You are traveling without ticket in an Indian Train.   The Train ticket examiner comes and asks for your ticket.   You present the Indian Railways weighing machine ticket that declares “६५ किलो - आप मेहनती, समझदार एवं  ईमानदार हैं। 65 Kgs-You are hardworking, sensible and honest”“ as Indian Government’s honesty certificate for traveling without ticket. ​ PS: Have read this reference in some Hindi story. Do not remember the name of the story.
