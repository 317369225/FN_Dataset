I am going to be in Dallas for only 3 more weeks. What do I have to do before I leave?
Sadly, Fort Worth may be Dallas' best tourist attraction. After that: 1. 6th Floor Museum. 2. and 3. Pecan Lodge and Lockhart Smokehouse are now the best BBQ in Dallas and top 5 in Texas per Texas Monthly Magazine. 4. Dallas World Aquarium
