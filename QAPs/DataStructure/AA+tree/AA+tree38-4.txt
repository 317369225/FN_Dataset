What jargon and abbreviations should newcomer DOTA2 players familiarize themselves with?
I'll add some general multiplayer acronyms: Before the game begins: gl hf = Good Luck. Have fun When the game ends: gg wp = Good Game, Well Played The term gg is often used during the game, when it's obvious who is going to win. e.g. "Troll got Butterfly now. It's gg."
