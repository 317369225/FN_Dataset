What are some real life examples of chutzpah (please read details)?
NASA AMENDED ITS EMPLOYMENT RULES TO EMPLOY THIS PATRIOTIC INDIAN WHO DENIED TO APPLY FOR A U.S CITIZENSHIP. AN ENTIRE NATION BELIEVED THIS. I've seen such things in movies. What this guy did can be compared to Frank Abagnale's stints (Di Caprio's role in "Catch Me if You Can") except that he couldn't rake in millions of dollars (that is what I think, I don't know if he did) like Mr. Abagnale did. This guy fooled entire an entire nation claiming to be a scientist in NASA. The whole story goes on like this. Read oN!! The 27 year Old Arun P.V hailing from the State of Kerala, India is an Engineering Graduate.  The information here on, is what the media told about Arun. I have no clue which part of it is true. The fairytale story goes like this. . . . He first joined the prestigious Bhabha Atomic Research Centre(BARC) soon after completing his B.Tech. Then he left BARC to pursue higher studies . He joined for M.Tech in a prestigious NIT. On completing M.Tech he worked as a faculty in Bhutan Royal Institute for some time. Then he claims that he was a research student under famous scientist Dr. Barbara Liskov, faculty of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). There he was offered a job in NASA which he refused because NASA had a policy that employees have to take up U.S citizenship on joining and he was not willing to give up his Indian citizenship. Apparently NASA modified its rules to recruit Arun. His monthly salary was 32 Lakhs(~$52,000) according to the reports in news media. And he was working in His achievement was celebrated all over and he was facilitated by many politicians, educational institutions and other organizations. I am listing down few links from the internet which talks about his achievement. Most of them will be removed soon I expect. :-D   In search of extraterrestrial lifehttp://www.thehindu.com/news/cit...

I remember a viral post from the facebook page of 'The Logical Indian' which claimed that Defence Minister Rajnath Singh heard about Arun's heroics and passed this information to Shri. Narendra Modi, Hon'ble PM of India and that Modi ji had invited Arun to his residence. A Picture from Facebook page of The Logical Indian. Arun being facilitated by L.K.Advani Ji, Senior BJP leader and Former Deputy PM of India. With Kerala Education Minister in an IHRD function. With MLA P.C.George MLA P.C.George showing off his appreciation. All this fan fare and one fine day we get to hear THIS.
