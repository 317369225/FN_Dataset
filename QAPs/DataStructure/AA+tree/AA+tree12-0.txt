What is the best thing you have heard MSD say from behind the stumps?
Today during the match of Ind vs Ire in the WC 2015. Ed Joyce was new in the crease and had just faced 7 balls so far. He scored a century in Ireland's last game against Zimbabwe and the stage was set at 91/1 for him to score some brisk runs. Raina bowled a quicker one first up and Ajinkya Rahane fielded the ball in the covers. Dhoni then advised Rahane, "Halka peeche reh sakta hai Jinx, ye dheere nahi khelta." He was trying to tell Rahane that Joyce isn't known to take singles by nudging the ball softly. Raina bowled the next one a little slower, but directed it at the stumps. Result: Joyce tried to cut, missed and saw his middle stump pegged back.
