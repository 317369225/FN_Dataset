What was the ragging scene in IITs back in 1980s-90s?
While I'm in my 12 preparing for IIT-Jee one of our teaching staff is a graduate from IITB who teaches dynamics. He shared his story how different ragging at IITB were. "I was searching for hostel room and I asked one of the passing student (unfortunately my senior) for help. Instead of answering he asked whether I'm first year student or not before I answer he took me to mess where all the freshers are lined up. They gave us a question paper and told to answer all the question in half an hour otherwise you won't be allowed for course work. After 10 minutes all the attitude and pride of clearing jee has vanished and I got 2 marks out of 10 and I am so depressed as I didn't even got 50%, But it made me realize where I stand and never too proud of what you have achieved, there is all ways some things we still didn't know. After two days one of the my classmate asked me what's your score  and applaud by quoting so you are the topper who scored 2 marks." Source: first person hearing. (I will update the name, l have to dig.) Edit 1: his name is RLR (Ramalingeswara Rao ). But one thing I'm still not sure whether he is from IIT Bombay or Madras. Updated 15h ago • View Upvotes
