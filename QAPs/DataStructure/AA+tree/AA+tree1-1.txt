What is your favourite Dota 2 hero lineup and what is the strategy behind your choice?
I would put it like this, 2 carry, (one hard and one "not-so-hard" :D ), 2 supports and one tank (for pub matches). A lineup like the following would be good - Axe, Weaver, Natures Prophet, Ancient Apparition and Tree/Dazzle. If it is a pub game, this is most likely going to be a weaver mid, Axe solo lane, Prophet straight to jungle, Tree and Apparition in one lane or one of the 2 supports could go help axe. In a pro match, (if such a line up is chosen), then, it is going to be a safe trilane - Weaver, AA, Tree, Axe "might" mid and an offlane prophet. Or it can be a mid weaver and a axe with 2 supports stacking and taking care of lane and axe. But the pro teams are inclined to picks that gives you a team fight potential. Bounty/Prophet offlane, Invoker/SF/Puck mid, Life+Rubick/Tide+Dazzle/Tree/Disruptor/Visage. Something like this. In most pub matches, heroes like Bat, Visage etc are not played with full potential. They are fantastic heroes and a aganims visage can be deadly in team fights. So, that is pretty much it. :) .
