What film scene(s) influenced you most?
I saw this movie - Bruce Almighty (2003) as a teenager and the below dialogue really changed my whole belief about God. A single mom who's working two jobs, and still finds time to take her kid to soccer practice, that's a miracle. A teenager who says no to drugs and yes to an education, that's a miracle. People want Me to do everything for them, but what they don't realize is, they have the power. You want to see a miracle, son? Be the miracle. Updated 38w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
