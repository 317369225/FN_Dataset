Which letters do not appear as a double letter in any English word?
I've done a quick analysis of a dictionary file in Python, and I got the following results: a: 8 hits b: 125 hits c: 185 hits d: 200 hits e: 836 hits f: 362 hits g: 146 hits h: 4 hits i: 3 hits j: 2 hits k: 10 hits l: 1346 hits m: 302 hits n: 300 hits o: 802 hits p: 336 hits q: 0 hits r: 448 hits s: 956 hits t: 564 hits u: 8 hits v: 8 hits w: 1 hits x: 0 hits y: 0 hits z: 62 hits Based on this pretty extensive dictionary file, I can say that there are no words in the English language in which the letter q, x, or y appears twice in a row. For those who prefer the full list, it can be found here. Those who are interested, can find the Python script that I used here, though it's not very clean; it was meant to quickly generate a the above list without much ado, nothing else. UPDATE: I've used a more extensive dictionary file (standard dictionary on any UNIX system) because of CJ Marland's comment, and sure enough, it does seem to make a difference: aa 124 bb 924 cc 1524 dd 1033 ee 3955 ff 1742 gg 1134 hh 74 ii 420 jj 2 kk 72 ll 11328 mm 2020 nn 2421 oo 4611 pp 2020 qq 1 rr 3646 ss 13820 tt 3229 uu 27 vv 12 ww 57 xx 0 yy 4 zz 271 While there were no words with double q or double y in the smaller dictionary file that I used initially, they do seem to exist, although I would say they're not very common: zaqqum Ayyubid cubbyyew gayyou snarleyyow Updated 39w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
