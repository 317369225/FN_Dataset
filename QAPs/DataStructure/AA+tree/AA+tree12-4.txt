What is the best thing you have heard MSD say from behind the stumps?
The girlfriend remarkIn a Test match, Sreesanth was slacking off in the field, moving away from his original position. Dhoni promptly said, "Oye Sree udhar girlfriend nahi hai, idhar aa ja thoda (Hey Sree, your girlfriend isn't there. Come ahead a bit)". Et tu commentatorOn another occasion, Dhoni tried to imitate a commentator's description of Jadeja's bowling, quipping, "Bharpoor bowling ka pradarshan karte hue Ravindra Jadeja!" ("Showcasing his immense talent of bowling, Ravindra Jadeja"). The best remarks of MS Dhoni caught on stump mic Whoa Attitude: Ind-WI test.Collins defended successfully against Kumble twice in Ind-WI test and was applauded by the crowd. At that moment, Dhoni said "2 strokes khel ke apne aap ko chane ke jhaad par samajh raha hai..... Haan.... Haan, yahi samajh raha hai 2 strokes khel ke, ki jaise wo chane ke jhaad pe khadaa ho". ("After playing two strokes he's feeling as if he has hoisted a small tree." This looks better in English :P) In another Kumble over, after Collins defended a few deliveries again, Ramdin came up to him, told him something, and both tapped each other's hands. Collins used the hand in which he was holding his bat. As he tapped, his bat slipped out of his hand. When he came back to take his stance, Dhoni said "Ab to ye aayega, bhai..... Haan, bat gira na abhi iske haath se.... Ab to bas ye aayega". ("The bat fell from his hand, now he will come. Yes now he will come".) Overheard on Stump Mic Updated 58w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
