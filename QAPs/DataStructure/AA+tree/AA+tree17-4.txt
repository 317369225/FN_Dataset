Could trees be used for providing electricity?
Way back in the 90s a planning application I was involved in for the growing of willow trees for local energy generation was thrown out when objecters pointed out the waste of good land involved, the transportation costs per kWh generated, the amount of additional carbon thrown into the atmosphere, and the wasted water.   The applicant retired hurt, never to return in that area. The objection that touched the spot from my point of view was that if you dedicated the same amount of land (far more than was needed) to growing reeds etc. to cleanse the local sewage water, you would enhance the quality of water flowing down the Thames to a significant degree. Which did we want, very expensive electricity or more and less expensive drinking water for Swindon, Didcot, Oxford, Reading, Slough, and Greater London?   No brainer, really.
