Which is the most inspiring Hindi poem you have come across?
Kabeerdas ji ke dohe. are very much inspiring.I read it in 5th class but his lines still ring in my head. http://kabeerdas-dohe.blogspot.in/ specially the following one which i'm reminded of everyday. Dukh Mein Simran Sab Karen, Sukh Mein Karay Na Koye Jo Sukh Mein Simran Karay, To Dukh Kahay Ko Hoye. Meaning of these lines in English: The poet  says that we remember God when we are in grief, We don't do the same when we are happy, if we remember God even in happiness then it is possible that we are never in grief.
