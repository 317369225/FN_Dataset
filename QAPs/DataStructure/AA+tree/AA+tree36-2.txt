As Ned Stark is dead, who else can prove that Jon Snow is half Targaryen?
Following people can confirm Jon's parentage:- 1. Howland Reed- first hand witness, only other survivor of battle under the tower of joy. Highborn enough to be taken seriously. 2. Bran Stark- accomplished greenseer, can look in the past to know about lyanna and rhaegar eloping and conceiving Jon. They were close to Isle of FacesÂ  at that time which is home to only grove of weirwoid trees south of the neck. Bran can then, through dreams tell the right/important people of Jon's parentage like Daenerys or Jon himself. 3. Ashara Dayne(if she's still alive) - after the battle under tower of joy, Ned went to Starfall to return Dawn(Arthur Dayne's sword). There, Jon got a wet nurse. Ashara might know about Jon's parentage and faked her death to disappear. 4. Most likely scenario- Jon revives an Ice/Stone Dragon or tames one of Daenerys' dragons. He will also fulfill the Prince who was promised prophecy. Both of these will be enough proof for Noble or common people to realise that Jon is a Targaryen. This scenario will most likely occur along with points 1 & 2.
