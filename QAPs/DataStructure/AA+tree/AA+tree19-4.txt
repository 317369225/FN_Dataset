Which are the most common Kannada phrases/ expressions used in everyday life?
I am a person from North Karnataka(NK), and I have been with different cultures across the state. So here I share our NK phrases, rarely heard by others. (Notice that we use just "t", while most south Indian/South Karnataka people use "th" for words. E.g.: We use Santosh and not Santhosh, Akshata and not Akshatha.) En pa dost/a? - what's up dude? En nadsi/madakatti/madlikatti? - What are you doing? Yaav le nee? (inf) - who the hell are you? - Used when showing disbelief. Ond plate uppitt-shira kodri (at a restaurant). - Give me a plate of chou-chou bath (Upma and Kesribath). Naashta/tiffin aata? - Did you have your breakfast? Asking "tindi ayta?" gives a very different meaning in NK, so using tiffin/naashta is better :) ( Tindi in NK Kannada means itching sensation). Taatinalli kai toleyabaradu (sign board at a restaurant). - Do not wash hands in your plate. Taatu is NK equivalent of Tatte(plate). Awa/ava/aata - equivalent term for avanu (he/him). Awa/ava is used in Mumbai Karnataka(MK) region of NK and Aata is used in Hyderabad Karnataka(HK) region of NK. Awa is seen as rude term for using it for people who are close in HK. Laghu/jaldi/pattna baa pa! - Come quick(for a male)! Aki hesr enu? - What's her name? - aki = avaLu = she/her. Ivatt nam saali sooti(ಸೂಟಿ)! - It's a holiday for our school today! Saali = Shaale= School, Sooti=Raje=Holiday. Deed(ದೀಡು) saavr rupayi kodu. - Give me fifteen hundred(1500) Rupees. Deed= one and half. Yes from the dedh in North Indian languages. Paav kilo uLLagaddi kodri. - Give me a quarter kilo of onions. - We use paav to say quarter/kaalu bhaaga. Kilo = Kg. ULLagaddi=EeruLLi= Onion. Hawa madkobeda! - Don't exaggerate about yourself! - Different from SK Kannada. Mashkiri - Fun(nearest word). Pichchar benki aiti! - The movie is awesome! I will add more as I remember them.
