Do you believe babies are born atheist, and do you believe atheists never convert? How can these two beliefs coexist?
Babies are not atheists. Babies are babies. Although babies are biologically humans they are not culturally human when they are born. They must learn to be culturally human, that's what parents and other relatives are for, and it takes a long, long time to finish that education (I dare to say that it takes all their lives). Since religion is a cultural artifact and babies are acultural, the proposition "babies are atheists" is as valid as "babies are theists" since they, obviously, are devout believers of the Goddess Mom and Her Overflowing Tits. If the baby is indoctrinated in a religion eventually it will become a theist child. That theist child can later become a theist adult or an atheist adult, depending how was his/her education in other aspects of life. In fact, he/she can change their minds about religion as many times as they want. In fact, I think it is obvious that atheists can convert to theists. I don't know why there is such a saying that atheists never convert. No, no, no, you got it all wrong. What you must have heard is that you can't convert to atheism, which is obvious since atheism is not a religion so there is nothing to convert in. Convertion only works with religions So that's why an atheist can convert to a theist but not the other way around. If the theist stops being a theist, becomes an atheist.
