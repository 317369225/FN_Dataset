Do recovering people in Alcoholics Anonymous have to consume their life with only talking about that part of their life?
Staying sober can be.a full time job, especially in the first few years.  It takes patience, understanding, and love with skills to match to.have successfull relationships. This is especially true with people new to recovery. 12 step meetings are all about focusing on solutions instead of problems. Its about getting honest and taking resposibility for the.spiritual principles that can bring healing and peace if we do the work. Finding the balance in our lives between addiction and recovery takes time. Some people get addicted to the process but its not going to kill them like.drugs and alcohol. Taking the time to learn more about sobriety may be helpful to you. You can read literature on line or talk with others who can relate to your circumstances.  The main thing is to enjoy the best parts of your relationship and be responsible to have clear boundaries for what works for you. What you are doing is not easy.but if your boyfriend stays clean and sober ....it could be worth it..!!!
