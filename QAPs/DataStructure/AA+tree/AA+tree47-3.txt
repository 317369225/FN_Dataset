What advice do you have for a Brit moving to Silicon Valley?
- Be sure to tell the government where you're living within 10 days of arriving, and every time you move: http://www.uscis.gov/ar-11 - You can only drive on a British driving licence for up to 10 days of arriving. You must get a californian driving licence after that. My friend was driving around on his British licence and didn't know better. He ended up getting pulled over for some reason and he ended up in court with a big fine.
