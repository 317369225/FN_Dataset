I am going to be in Dallas for only 3 more weeks. What do I have to do before I leave?
Take one last trip south. Drive past West, TX, and have some Kolaches. Wait for the sun to set and enjoy the unpolluted sky and the Milky Way. Stop at Lockhart and Hard 8 BBQ and have brisket, ribs, and pulled pork. Sit at Common Table and watch the law school 3L mingle with the lawyers. Drink some obscure beer and have the pulled pork grilled cheese sandwich. Go window shopping and have some amazingly obscenely expensive coffee at the Highland Park Village. Then go to Rise NÂ°1 and have the souffle, the best in the States, in my humble opinion. If you're lucky you get to share a bottle of wine with G.W. Bush (I've seen him a few times there for dinner but only once got the "come over and have a glass with us", so this might be hit or miss). Walk Fair Park. Take a picture under the World Fair sculpture. If you do nothing else and haven't done it yet, go to the Heritage Village downtown and check out old Dallas houses. It's well worth going. The Old Red Museum downtown is the location organized women's suffrage started in the South. Everyone has been to the Sixth Floor museum to see a stain on our history, few have seen the museum that celebrates the righteous fight against another one. Have a beer at the House of Blues. Sadly Reunion Tower is often closed these days, call ahead. Enjoy the weather. Won't get that much better anywhere else. And enjoy your last few days in Dallas, good luck in the Lesser 49.
