Do you believe babies are born atheist, and do you believe atheists never convert? How can these two beliefs coexist?
Babies are 100% dependent. Their gods are their parents. Literally. They are not making them up, they are not questioning their existence. They have no choice. Theological subtleties form way later. That includes atheism. Addition: Given the above, I would venture to suggest that babies and later children are the most honestly authentic theists you can imagine. And that includes the 'tooth-fairy' and all the others. Notable exception: the flying spaghetti monster.  (Of course they don't have a denomination) The baby is completely self-absorbed. It has just one tool to influence the world. It can cry. And it is heard or it is not. It projects itself onto the universe not just in an anthropomorphising way, no, it does so in the most personal way possible. Whatever happens to it means the universe treats it this way. It will colour all of its future life. A child can separate between itself, mother and father, but still carries very strong images of identification with the original parent images. Later you have many stages of emancipation. Separation from the mother, then the father - the parent child relationship as such, the peer group etc. etc. Believing in a universal God, i.e. separate from oneself and even the people around, is already an advanced stage. Atheism as a reaction to that, I would put even later. Theism doesn't just come out of nowhere, it is a deeply ingrained impulse. That does not mean it is a valid approach to every problem, but still. Updated 72w ago • View Upvotes
