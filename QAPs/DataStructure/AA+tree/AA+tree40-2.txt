Failure:Â How is life after failing in the 'IIT JEE' examination?
More or less the same, IIT has its pros and cons, like anything else.On the downside, you can't boast of being in India's best university despite having a 0 CGPA , however you won't to compete with individuals who've slogged night and day for 2-4 years and will continue to do so. Your English stays untainted by words like "put" and "RG". Down the line if you feel engineering wasn't for you, you don't have to slog it out for the rest of your course to get a decent GPA on your degree. Culturals are pretty much the same, so are most amenities though you've probably saved yourself 4 years of crapping on an Indian toilet.You've dodged a life of a 95% male population and the general public doesn't expect you to start fires with your mind. There's always a bright side :) Edit1: Totally forgot about IIT hostels not having ACs
