Failure:Â How is life after failing in the 'IIT JEE' examination?
I joined NITK Surathkal after failing JEE for the first time and then gave JEE again during my first year of college. Got a decent rank but could not get the branch of my choice so i decided to stay. I ended up wasting my entire 3rd semester doing nothing constructive,just playing games, screwing my exams, cursing my luck, etc,etc. I used to spend a lot of time thinking about what i could have done to clear JEE and what my life would have been at IIT'S. Then in the vacations,after speaking to my friends and teachers and over 2 months of peaceful thinking, i realized that the only difference between me and my friends who had cleared JEE was that i had not worked hard enough and did not have that enthusiasm or that hunger that was required at that time. Just one exam was not enough to show who was better or worse. It just showed that i did not put in the effort that was required at that time, not that i could not do it later in life. So i came back in my 4th semester with much more enthusiasm, tried to learn new things and put everything behind and make a new start. Finally all the hardwork paid off and i got my intern at Microsoft this semester(5th). It is not something great but definately not something i thought i would ever achieve after failing in JEE twice. I now have the confidence that if i work even harder then i can atleast match or maybe achieve even more that what my friends at IIT's will. So here is my answer to your question: Your life after JEE is what you want it to be and not about what it could have been . So choose your path wisely.
