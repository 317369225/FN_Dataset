What are some real life examples of chutzpah (please read details)?
This is the transcript of the actual radio conversation between the British and the Irish off the coast of Co.Kerry (Ireland) in Oct. 1998. Radio conversation released by the Chief of Naval Operations (of Ireland I'm assuming) Irish: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the south to avoid a collision British: Recommend you divert your course 15 degrees tot he north to avoid a collision Irish: Negative. You will have to divert your course 15 degrees tot he south to avoid a collision British: This is the captain of a British navy ship, I say again divert YOUR course Irish: Negative. I say again you will have to divert YOUR course British: This is the aircraft carrier HMS Britannia! The second largest ship in the British atlantic fleet. We are accompanied by three destroyers, three cruisers and numerous support vessels. I demand you change your course 15 degrees north, I say again, that is 15 degrees north or countermeasures will be taken to ensure the safety of this ship. Irish: We are a lighthouse. Your call.
