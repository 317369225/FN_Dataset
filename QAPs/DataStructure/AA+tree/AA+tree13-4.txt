If you could pick one book for each letter in the alphabet, which ones would you choose?
Tried put in as much variety as I could, selecting some of my favorites. Here goes : A - Alice in Wonderland (Lewis Caroll) B - Byomkesh Samagra (Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay) [Bengali Novel] C - The Catcher in the Rye (J. D. Salinger) D - The Diary of a young Girl (Anne Frank) E - The Emperor of all Maladies (Siddharth Mukherjee) F - Feluda Series (Satyajit Ray) [Bengali Novel] G - The Great Gatsby (F. Scott Fitzgerald) H - The Hound of the Baskervilles (Sir Arthur C. Doyle) I - If on a Winter's Night a Traveller (Italo Calvino). I haven't read this one as yet; just ordered.. so presently, this is on my mind. J - Julius Ceaser (William Shakespeare) K - Kafka on the Shore (Haruki Murakami) L - The Lord of the rings (J. R. R. Tolkien) M - Maus (Art Speigelman) N - Nineteen Eighty Four (George Orwell) O - On the Road (Jack Kerouac) P - Peter Pan (J. M. Barrie) Q - ____________ R - Red Rackham's Treasure (Herge) S - The Sense of an Ending (Julian Barnes) T - To kill a Mockingbird (Harper Lee) U - Uncle Tom's Cabin (Harriet Beecher Stowe) V - The Virgin Suicides (Jeffrey Euginides) W - Walden (Henry David Thoreau) X - ____________ Y - Year One - Batman (Frank Miller) Z - Thus spoke Zarathustra (Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche) [Confession : Bought it and kept it aside, haven't ventured into reading as yet.]
