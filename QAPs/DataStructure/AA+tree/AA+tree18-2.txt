Which letters do not appear as a double letter in any English word?
Well let's see... A: aardvark B: bubble C: accident D: riddle E: glee F: effigy G: nagging H: used in onomatopoeia like "ehh" or "ahh" I: radii J: ujjayi (admittedly a borrowed word, but a word common to English-speaking yogis nonetheless) L: dillydally M: ammunition N: innate O: loop P: opportunity R: arrogant S: hiss T: attend V: savvy W: used in onomatopoeia like "eww" X: used in abbreviations like "XXL" and in Roman numerals like "MCMXX" Z: pizzazz Those are all the letters I can think of with legitimate examples, so that would leave K, Q, U, and Y.
