I want to put tube lights on my bike. Are there any ways to get a portable power source to put on my bike to power the lights?
By "tube lights" do you mean neon lights, like some people have on the undersides of their cars? And by "bike" do you mean motorcycle, or bicycle? Although they don't have quite the same look as neon lights, manufacturers are offering LED lights that are sort of equivalent. They have the advantage of not needing a special power supply; they'll run directly from a car/motorcycle 12 V battery. You can buy them in kit form; do a search on "LED underbody lights." If you want to put them on a bicycle, that is going to be more difficult, because the car-oriented kits consume a lot of power. If you're satisfied with a single, 30" tube light, you can power it from a small (3 A-h) motorcycle battery for a couple of hours, but it weighs about 3 lb., and you'll need a battery charger to keep it topped up between uses.
