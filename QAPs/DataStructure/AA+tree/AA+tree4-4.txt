What is Sansa Stark and Theon/Reek's fate at the end of season five?
In the books, Theon and Ramsay's wife Jeyne Poole (the role that Sansa has taken over on the show) escape from Winterfell and run into Stannis's camp. Stannis, who thinks that Jeyne is Arya Stark (the name that she has been masquereding under), agrees to protect her and send her to the Wall to Jon. He wants to kill Theon, since Theon is a traitor who betrayed the Starks. That's where the story leaves off. Obviously, Sansa and Theon's story on the show cannot be similar, as Stannis has lost his army and is on the point of being killed by Brienne (who is nowhere near Winterfell in the books). But I suspect that their story will intersect nonetheless. Maybe Sansa and Theon will arrive on the scene just as Brienne is about to kill Stannis, and Brienne realizes that her true duty lies in protecting Sansa. Maybe Sansa asks her to show mercy towards Stannis. So Brienne will agree to spare his life if he leads them to the Wall to Jon (not knowing that Jon has been stabbed). This is all speculative, of course, but it seems to be the most logical way to tie together the different Winterfell-related stories from this season, as well as get it as close as possible to the story in the books. Thanks for the A2A.
