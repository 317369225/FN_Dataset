What might a database look like if it were a tangible non-computer thing?
What databases basically do is keep things in order so you can find them quickly. And these days databases are often used to store graphs, like Facebook's "Social Graph" i.e. their social network, which looks something like this (but with connections between branches): Closely related to databases are data structures. This tree is exactly how a dictionary of the English language would be stored in a computer: each large branch is a letter A, B, C, ... , the next level of branches would be AA, AB, AC, ... , and all the way down to the leaves of the trees, where you get whole words, like Aardvark.
