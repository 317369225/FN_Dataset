I am drinking and driving a lot. What are some things I can do to stop myself?
I've been A2A, but I'm not going to improve much on any of the answers given already (why can't I upvote Jeff Kesselman's answer a dozen times or so???). First, don't "just drink one drink."  Just don't drink anything TODAY.  It's an addiction.  You need to treat it like an addiction.  My addiction is Pepsi.  I give it up cold turkey for a month or so, then think, "Drinking one is not going to hurt anything."   Before you know it, I'm back to drinking three or four bottles a day.  I wish there was a PA group out there ("Hi.  I'm Chris and I drink Pepsi."  "Hi, Chris..."). You claim to not be suicidal.  I disagree:  You willingly and knowingly engage in an activity that is dangerous to yourself and others, can be extremely expensive (not that you're worried about the estimated $15,000 -> $20,000 'total cost' of a DUI), and creates the risk of suffering a life-changing traumatic event (re-read Christopher Reiss' answer here).  It sounds  like you've already chosen your method of killing yourself and are literally playing "Russian Roulette" every time you drink and drive.  Get professional mental health help before you wrap your car around a tree and kill yourself or someone else. You may think you understand why I have an issue with you not being scared of "the legal things," but it's not really because I'm a cop.  To me, what you just said is, "I have a lot of money and that makes me better than you."  Frankly, your money will probably be a big help if you're arrested for a plain ol' run-of-the-mill DUI.  You'll be able to help a DUI lawyer get that yacht or sports car he's been looking for.  But if you kill someone, you can look forward to losing a LOT of that money in a  lawsuit from the victim's family. If you won't get help on your own, feel free to message me with your location and a description of your car and I'll make sure some other professionals are ready to help you....
