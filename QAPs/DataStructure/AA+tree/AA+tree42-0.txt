What are the largest or most significant US airlines to have gone bankrupt, become defunct, or been acquired?
Somewhere on the net I've seen a family tree for airlines in the US but I can't remember where or find it easily.   I did find this which shows how UA and CO grew up (and went bankrupt) http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4... and this for DL/NW http://deltamuseum.org/pdf/Delta... Otherwise my memory may be hazy but... Western folded into Delta Pan Am lost the plot and sold various route rights to UA and DL but before that Pan Am bought National TWA was taken over by AA
