How do I make a fresh start in life?
Even though their are pretty neat answers to your question by other Quorans you shouldn't expect a "wiki-how" answer on "starting again". The only advice worth sharing on this topic is for you to remember to forgive yourself first, but never forget what you've learned through failure... because what you learned in those moments will surely define your success.  "I don't like people who have never fallen or stumbled. Their virtue is lifeless and of little value. Life hasn't revealed its beauty to them.” ― Boris Pasternak, Doctor Zhivago Updated 61w ago • View Upvotes
