What is the best thing you have heard MSD say from behind the stumps?
Below answer is dedicated to one of India's greatest Test Captains under whose leadership India became the No. 1 team in the Test Rankings. #ThankYouDhoni What is that one thing a bowler wants from his captain ? Confidence. (India's tour of Australia .2nd Test, Day 2.) Ishant was having problems while bowling. He was pitching short and wide.Dhoni observes this and he comes up to Ishant and says, "Agar chauka gaya to mera risk hai, tu bindaas daal.Tujhe agar ek fielder aur chahiye to mai bula lunga.Mujhe koi problem nhi hai" {If it goes for a four,it's my risk.You don't bother and just bowl.If you need an extra fielder,I am giving you one.I don't have any problem} And Ishant bowls a blinder in the next delivery.He doesn't get a wicket.But what he got was captain's trust. This is Dhoni for you. Updated 57w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
