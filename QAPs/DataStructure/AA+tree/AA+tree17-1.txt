Could trees be used for providing electricity?
In terms of using trees as power cells, no.  I think you are likely talking about microwatts.  Using trees as fuel is workable, although messy.  One study I read proposed short growth cycle hardwoods.  Plant the trees 6" apart, and harvest when they are 1" in diameter.  Chip them up.  Dry the chips with the waste heat from the power plant.  Burn the chips to generate steam.  Study claimed it could be done on about the same amount of land that would be strip mined to fuel a coal plant for 40 years. Its more expensive than coal, but it's not *that* unreasonable to do.  However using switch grass may work just as well.  I did a rough calcultion and figured that 100 square miles of switch grass could fuel a 1 GW power plant. A better way may be to gasify the grass, making syngas (easier to burn) and charcoal (return to the land.)  This would double the amount of land needed, but half the carbon would be returned to the land in a form that doesn't decompose easily.  Such a power plant could have a negative carbon footprint. One advantage of this system is that syngas can be stored under pressure, and used to fire gas turbines on an as-needed basis. This would make it a good complement to wind power.
