What kind of questions are asked in a Google interview for the software engineer role, for a candidate with a year of work experience?
Questions involving high level of logical reasoning and analytical ability are sure to be there so as to separate smarter candidates who are more capable of solving hard problems. Also expect a few good quality coding problems. google doesn't ask language specific problems but focuses on problems which are algorithmic in nature. A problem that i came across lately which was asked in google interview: You have 15 horses and five racetracks. What is the minimum number of races that you would require to find out the top three horses.
