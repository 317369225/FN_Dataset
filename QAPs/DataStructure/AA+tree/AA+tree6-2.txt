Has Narendra Modi brought "achhe din (the Good Days)"?
I have experienced that.. Let me explain how : Every Indian (I hope) is aware of the cleaning conditions of Indian Railways and I (am) or used to be one of them who( thinks) or used to think an Indian train cannot be clean. And then  I experienced this. I was traveling from Raipur (Chhattisgarh) to Kolkata. One lady sitting in front of me spilled tea. Everybody saw following notice and all the people of my compartment were like let's check whether they are following this or not but all of them were pretty sure, it isn't going to happen. Another lady had almost started cleaning, but somebody stopped her. So I followed the instructions and texted my details on this number. To my surprise within 2-3 minutes I got a reply mentioning details like cleaner's name and phone number( I am not sure) and they gave me time limit as well! He came within half an hour  (20 mins to be precise) as I had given my PNR he came directly to me and asked what is the problem. After cleaning he took my name,signature and feedback. Of course feedback was excellent. So if you ask me about good days... Yeah! They have come! This is the picture of that notice :- ​ ​ ​​ ​Edit: I would like to thank everybody but not for their upvotes or comments. Rather I would like to thank them for showing enthusiasm towards the good governance. For all who are little skeptic about Modi I want to clarify this, it's not like we are blind followers of Modi, it's just that we like his way of working. It doesn't matter whether it's Modi, Mr. Arvind Kejrival or even Mr.Rahul Gandhi. We are gonna appreciate anybody's work which is for the amelioration of India . For now that is Modi. P.S - I would request everyone to help Modi to make India better. It can be helping him in keeping our country clean or it can be giving up our LPG subsidy or anything! ​​
