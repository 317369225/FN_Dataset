What is your favourite Dota 2 hero lineup and what is the strategy behind your choice?
My favourite hero lineups always revove around 1 main carry,3 supports, and 1 semi-carry. I like that semi carry to be a guinsoo carrier. So heroes like Puck, Windrunner, Prophet, Death Prophet, Batrider, Necrolyte, Invoker etc. are my choices. Also Abbadon is one of my fav. semi carries. Carry to be a bit tankish. So Dragon Knight, Nessaj, Tiny, Morphling etc.Â  are my choices. I like OD because he can dish a lot of damage. Void in some cases. Supports, A healer, stunner and a slower. 2 Arcane boots and a Mek carrier. I live variety of supports, but I specifically am fond of Jakiro, Omni Knight, Dazzle, Venge, Chen, Enchi, Lich. So a sample team might look like DK, OmniKnight(AB), Jakiro(AB, Pipe), Lich(Mek), Windrunner. A team with OD would look like OD, OmniKnight/Dazzle, Krob, Chen, Batrider. Problem is this exactly isnt a winning lineup. Semi carry needs some farm, else they are supports too and if my key support(like omni) gets initiated upon, we are screwed.
