I am drinking and driving a lot. What are some things I can do to stop myself?
You wake with a pounding headache.  The lights are bright. You try to put your hand over your eyes, but suddenly realize you are handcuffed to a bed. The chart at the foot of the bed says "Alcohol Intoxication."   You'll be fine.   But you're not going home. You don't remember, but you killed two children in the car you hit last night.   You'll be seeing their parents in court. The Judge will send you to jail.   15 years later,  long after your existential angst has passed, your job applications have the box checked : convicted felon. One of the parents of your victims committed suicide. A cop walks toward your hospital bed. "You have the right to remain silent ...." You close your eyes and wish to God you could do yesterday over, and put down the keys or the booze. By an inexplicable miracle there is a brief flash of light, and you're back to your normal life - a day earlier.    The only trace of that horrible morning is a post written by some stranger on the Internet. Your move. Updated 46w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Anonymous
