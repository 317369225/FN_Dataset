What is Sansa Stark and Theon/Reek's fate at the end of season five?
That's a very good question. In the books, Jeyne Poole, masquerading as Arya Stark, and Reek are picked up by Mors Umber and delivered to Stannis. But, everything just went to hell in the TV series. Stannis is probably dead, so Sansa and Reek can't go to him. However, Sansa has recently learned that Jon is Lord Commander on the Wall, so she might bully Reek into going there. But, Jon is at least mortally wounded, so that might not work. Or it might work perfectly. To wake the dragons, Daenerys had to sacrifice her love and the traitor Mirri Mazz Duur. Perhaps, after the Night's Watch mutineers are put down, Melisandre will conduct a ritual to resurrect Jon. She has a preference for using kings' blood, or rather their descendants, as offerings to R'hllor, and Theon of House Greyjoy is both a traitor and of king's blood. As for the love sacrifice, I think she'll burn Olly, who Jon loves like a little brother even at the moment when Olly stabs him. The sacrifice of love and a traitor, an offering of king's blood, and Jon's Targaeryen ancestry shall wake a dragon.Â  And then Sansa, who's looked down at Jon all her life, shall get to see what her cousin really is. As for Theon, his sad and painful life shall get the gift of death, a purposeful death, if not a painless one. Or at least so I hope.
