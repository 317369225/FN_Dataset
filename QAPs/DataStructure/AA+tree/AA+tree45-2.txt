I want to put tube lights on my bike. Are there any ways to get a portable power source to put on my bike to power the lights?
There are lots of electric bikes that have batteries you could try and link to your light system. More importantly is safety and how you plan to mount the lights and cables to make sure you don't limit controls or braking in anyway.
