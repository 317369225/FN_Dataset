Could trees be used for providing electricity?
Intriguing idea. It doesn't appear that the electricity harvested directly from trees would come even close to meeting what we think our electrical needs are. A better bet would be a wood gasifier, though that isn't a magic solution. What is a gasifier and how does it work on a biomass energy source? The amount of electricity is very small. So an oak tree might provide between 20 and a few hundred millivolts. So perhaps with improvements, 5 to 25 oak trees could power one tiny LED bulb. And you would likely lose that just in the wires hooking them together. Voltree Power is exploring options. Green from Green by Innovation Trees could be the ultimate in green power Can the tiny voltage produced by a tree be harnessed for anything useful? Trees seem capable of providing a constant voltage of anywhere between 20 and a few hundred millivolts – way below the 1.5 volts from a standard AA battery and close to the level of background electrical noise in circuits, says Babak Parviz, an electrical engineer at the University of Washington in Seattle. "Normal circuits don't run from very small voltages, so we need ways to convert the small voltages to something that is usable," he says. His team has managed to obtain a usable voltage from big-leaf maple trees by adding a device called a voltage boost converter. The converter spends most of its time in a kind of stand-by mode as it stores electrical energy from the tree, periodically releasing it at 1.1 volts.
