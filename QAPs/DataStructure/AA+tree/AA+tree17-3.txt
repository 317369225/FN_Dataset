Could trees be used for providing electricity?
There already is a way that we use nature to generate electricity... Biomass boilers and generators, wood chip boilers etc all use natural resources and so are renewable... See eco-link.co.uk for example. With regards to using the actual energy, I see what you mean in theory, but surely things such as wind solar and even water produce more energy than each individual plant, it would take quite a few plants to match this level I imagine?
