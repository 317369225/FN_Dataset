I am drinking and driving a lot. What are some things I can do to stop myself?
Mostly it just sounds like you are confused right now and looking for meaning. Im sure there will be religious folks here that will jump on me for this, but i don't think dropping an addiction or addictive tendency is the right reason to start going to church.  You risk substituting one addiction for another (see When Religion Goes Bad: Part 2 -- Religious Addiction) You say you aren't suicidal yet, but you sound clinically depressed and like you are self-medicating.  Its possible you just don't actually know what real clinical depression feels like.  Its not the same as the every day emotion most people call depression.  It is estimated that as much as 25% of all alcoholics are actually self-medicating mood disorders. I would strongly advise getting some real, qualified counseling and not looking to groups of by and large untrained amatures  like Quora.  Most employers these days have a mental health service they pay that you can call confidentially who will help you find the proper specialist.
