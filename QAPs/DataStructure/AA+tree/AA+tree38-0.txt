What jargon and abbreviations should newcomer DOTA2 players familiarize themselves with?
top, mid, bot The three map lanes ss, re Good players will report when the opposing heroes in their lanes go missing by typing something like: "ss bot 2". [1] Then use "re" when the player returns. jungler, carry, support, etc Hero types.  Junglers can head into the jungle and solo the 'creeps' without the need of heavy items or levels. Carry heroes are heroes that get MUCH stronger in the late-game, independent of items. Support heroes have abilities that aid other heroes, such as heal, buffs.  Support heroes are typically weak in a 1v1 scenario. ehp, dps Theorycraft acronyms for Effective Hit Points, Damage Per Second successively. bkb, mkb, sheepstick Item names for Black King Bar, Monkey King Bar, Scythe of Vyse successively. rosh It's time for the team to attack Roshan p, focus, b p = Push a lane and take out a tower or three. focus = focus your attacks on a certain player / hero. b = back. Retreat your hero before he gets into harms way. rax Barracks.  The buildings that 'spawn' creeps for each team. Usually taking down the melee rax is your team's best bet after taking down the last tower in a lane. [1] I suspect ss is not an acronym, and rather a left-hand shortcut or "miss" without the "mi".
