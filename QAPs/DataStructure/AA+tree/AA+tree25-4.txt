What film scene(s) influenced you most?
Almost every influential number are mentioned in this thread. I like to add one from Machine Gun Preacher. The movie tells the inspirational true story of Sam Childers, a former drug-dealing criminal who undergoes an astonishing transformation and finds his unexpected calling as the savior of hundreds of kidnapped and orphaned children in war-torn Sudan. Many scenes from the movie influences like anything, like: Sam Childers: In your actions you give service to the Lord he's not interested in your good thoughts... your good intentions... he wants your hands... your backs... your sweat... your blood to pour into the foundation that will build up his kingdom! In start, his family is against him and he lefts his family and sell everything he got for his noble cause. The orphanage he builds is burnt down, he has lost everything and his hope and when he calls home, her wife rebuilds his faith in him again. She (Lynn Childers) says: Got off your butt, stop your crying, and build it again. Sam Childer is a real-life ex-biker gang member. He decides to turn his life around by heading to East Africa to help repair homes that have been destroyed by civil war. He is affected by the plight of the people, especially the children. Against advice, he begins building an orphanage in militia territory. He also goes on an armed mission to rescue the children who have been kidnapped by the militia - who are being taken and forced to become child soldiers.
