Is the current racism against whites in South Africa in any way justified because of the history of apartheid?
All depends on what you mean by racism. If you mean violence, robberies both home and street and so on. You must bear in mind that criminals are not stupid. They research the houses and if you have poor security, and it looks like you have valuables, expect trouble. Regardless of your skin colour. They research the walks. So if you walk somewhere alone for the beauty of nature. Or in the wrong part of town. And look like you have valuables like money, fancy cell phones etc.Â  Expect trouble. Again regardless of your skin colour. Bottom line if you have an asset you have to live behind locked doors. Like in a jail, because the criminals are on the streets and not in jail The real racism against Whites today is a bit different. According to the latest BBBEE laws. If you have a 51% Black shareholding you automatically qualify for top rating even without an audit. If not, your company requires an audit costing a lot of money. If a "White" company tenders for State business even if you are the lowest cost tenderer. I recently lost a tender for the supply of Science equipment for a new Laboratory and training the users in their use. To a Black company with NO Science graduates in their employ. NO previous experience in this form of Science. At 3x the price. This company then wanted me to "Sub-Contract" the tender. A 51% Black Company need not discriminate against Whites as employees. And many hire only Whites. "White" companies have to submit endless reports on Racial Demographics of their staff. The result is that if you are an Afrikaans speaking White Male you have virtually no chance of getting a Study Bursary or Scolarship. If your parents cannot afford your studies - forget it. Reagrdless of intelligence or ability.
