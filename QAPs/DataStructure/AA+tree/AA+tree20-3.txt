How can DNA analysis reveal a person's geographical ancestry if race doesn't exist?
"Race" is a social concept, not a biological one. What 23 and Me are exploiting the fact that when people settle in a new are and tend not to migrate much, they tend to have a certain amount of skew in the genetic markers. Until the industrial revolution, there wasn't really much in the way of migration, and it was slow when it happened. As a result, you might, for example, find that a particular genetic marker might occur almost exclusively in a particular village (generally speaking, the region would be much larger, but it's possible). This is much different than the concept of "race" which might refer to ethnic identity, religious affiliation, or something as non-specific as hair and skin color. A lot of people might consider "black" a race, for example, but 23 and Me might be able to say "Northern Morrocco and Central Chad" - indicating that a person has a heritage that at some point involved picking up markers from those regions; such a person today may appear semitic, asian, black, or caucasian and may not have any ethnic relationship with these areas -- they just had one of many ancestors that comes from that area.
