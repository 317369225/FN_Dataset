Do you believe babies are born atheist, and do you believe atheists never convert? How can these two beliefs coexist?
No. I think there is a difference between a human who is empty of all concepts of god and religion and one who is consciously atheist. Babies are born a-religious and a-political. They have to know some stuff about the world they live in before they can have religious or political beliefs. Most babies, as they become children are indoctrinated into the religious and political beliefs of their parents. In some, the indoctrination fails. That number is increasing as children have access to more and contradictory information. The notion that "all babies are born atheist" is simply a metaphor for the fact that babies are born empty of belief.
