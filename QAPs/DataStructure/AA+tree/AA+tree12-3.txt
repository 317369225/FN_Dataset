What is the best thing you have heard MSD say from behind the stumps?
I) India vs Srilanka. Final. Celkon Mobile Cup 2013. Needing 16 off the last over and 1 wicket in hand, India won the game with Dhoni hitting a six off Eranga. Dhoni uprooted one of the stumps as a souvenir. I believe accidentally the stump mic was still attached to it while he walked back to the pavilion.  Kohli, who had come on to the field to celebrate, complemented Dhoni on that six saying, "Mujhe laga Benc#*d stadium paar ho gaya!" Here's a video of the incident. II) India vs Ireland, Hamilton. March 10th, 2015. ICC Cricket World Cup. "Nice Bowling Jad!" "Aage se Maarne de!" Raina to Porterfield.  29th Over. "Oye!...Raydu Jag ke Zara! Iska pair dekh kaise hil rha hai. Uske hisaab se anticipate kar. Volleyball ki tarah khada hua hai beech mein!" Same over. MSD to Raina "Badiya Badiya!" Raina "Mahi bhai, Umesh thora andar aa gaya hai, bahar hi rakho usko!" Later in the same over. MSD *in a squeaky voice* "Shami! Thora peeche hoja!" Last ball of the 33rd over. Porterfield plays the ball to Jadeja at short midwicket who fumbles slightly. Raina *taking his cap back from the umpire* : "Aaj Ram bharose hi pakad rha hai tu!'
