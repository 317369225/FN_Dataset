Do recovering people in Alcoholics Anonymous have to consume their life with only talking about that part of their life?
Most people are answering your question explaining what an addict has to do to get sober. I will answer just woman to woman. Do you love him enough to stick by him during this time? True love is wanting the best for the other person. If you love him stick it out and become involved with his recovery. If you are feeling that this is all too much for you, then leave him. I also don't think a couple should be together all the time. Like two trees planted too close together a relationship becomes smothering when you live in each other's pockets. On the other hand if you feel truly neglected or abused by his behavior he doesn't love you so you should try to talk about getting counseling together or think of ending the relationship. No matter what, take care of yourself and find out what makes you happy and do it. Good luck
