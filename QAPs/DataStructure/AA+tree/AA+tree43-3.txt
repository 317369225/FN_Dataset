Which songs have the deepest lyrics?
All of me by John Legend Just the title of this song says it all. I am transported to a totally different world when I listen to it. John expresses his love, his feeling of complete submission in such diverse ways. Every phrase, every word of the song seems to have been penned down with great thought and sung with so much intensity. Yet, at the end, you realize the inadequacy of words to describe the depth of his feelings. That's the beauty of this song! So click and lose yourself! :)
