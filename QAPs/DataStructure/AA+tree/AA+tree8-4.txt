What is the best short story on 'social issues'?
Today Ram Manohar opened a bank account in the name of his wife. In-spite of the bad Monsoon and ruined crops, now he would be able to give the dowry for his daughter's marriage. His sons could pay the school fee which was overdue since last 8 months and buy new uniforms. All the loans would be paid and his wife could start harvesting new crops for the next season. He gave this happy news to the family at dinner which included chapattis with hand-made pickles. He told them how lucky he was to have them and how much he loved them. After the dinner, he kissed his children goodnight and told his wife that he was going for a walk into the fields. He never came back.
