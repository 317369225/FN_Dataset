What is Sansa Stark and Theon/Reek's fate at the end of season five?
Sansa and Theon, as already mentioned, are definitely not dead. In the books too, they (with Sansa replaced by Jeyne) jump, survive the fall, meet with the Umbers, and are taken to Stannis's camp. Jon is the biggest mystery. He is the reason the book-readers have waited throughout the long winter of 5 years (and counting). There are camps on both sides - some believe he is truly dead as that is what one would expect of GRRM, some believe he warged into Ghost at the final moment, and some believe he will be resurrected by Mel. As for me, I personally will go with the last. Both in the books, and the show, it is hinted, that Mel knows Stannis isn't the true AA. I pray for a glimpse of Azor Ahai, and Râ€™hllor shows me only Snow. In her defense, she truly believes (or believed) that Stannis is. But she made a small error somewhere. And now after the finale, it is fairly accurate to say that she knows she was wrong. She knows that Jon is AA and she will resurrect him in the name of the Red God. Plus, Jon dying ends his watch. So he has no more vows to keep to the NW after he is resurrected and is free to avenge his family and take the throne. Stannis is a 50-50. In the books (and upto the chapters of book 6 released), he isn't dead. But the battle of Winterfell hasn't taken place yet. My take is he isn't. Remember what he says just before Brienne swings the sword? "Do your duty". And then, she swings. But the death isn't shown. Her duty is not to avenge Renly. The last she was sworn was to Catelyn Stark and promised to keep Sansa and Arya safe. Stannis's words remind her of the same and she swings at the tree in frustration. I believe that at this point, Reek and Sansa stumble across them and the 4 make it safe somewhere (the Umbers, the Karstarks?).
