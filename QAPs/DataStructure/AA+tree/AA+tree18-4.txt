Which letters do not appear as a double letter in any English word?
This is an addition to the nice list already posted by Doug Hales. Here are some of the problematic letters. First the easier ones: H: withhold, beachhead, hitchhike K: bookkeeping, trekking, jackknife U: vacuum, continuum, duumvirate Then the problematic ones: I can only come up with hajj for J and sayyid (and rubbish like "playyard" and "everyyear") for Y, and I'm completely stumped on Q. The best I can come up with is that "seqq." is used as an abbreviation.
