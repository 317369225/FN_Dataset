What are some songs that cheer you up?
I'm more of the rock-metal type, but I always go to Gangnam Style when I need cheering up! It can work wonders on anyone's mood. Possibly the reason for it's insane popularity? Savior by Rise Against also works. So do Sweet Home Alabama by Lynyrd Skynrd and The Middle by Jimmy Eat World.
