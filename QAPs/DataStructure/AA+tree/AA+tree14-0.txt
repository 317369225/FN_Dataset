As a CS 3rd year student, how do I prepare for internship at Microsoft?
The internship test is usually composed of multiple rounds. Generally the first round is a written round that tests your CS basics. It is designed to filter candidates out. So make sure that your basics in Data Structures and Algorithms, complexity, programming, OS, Networks etc. are well read. The next series of rounds are generally interviews. The initial 2 (or 3) interviews would be completely technical in nature. You would be given puzzles, programming questions and design questions. So prepare accordingly. Be very good in basic things like stacks, linked lists, queues, trees. I found http://careercup.com and Cracking The Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions And Solutions (English) 5th Edition - to be useful. The last round would be an AA (As Appropriate) round. This mostly tests your fit within Microsoft. It would be semi technical or wholly HR.
