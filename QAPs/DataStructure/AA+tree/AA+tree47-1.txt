What advice do you have for a Brit moving to Silicon Valley?
I did the reverse a while ago. - Do not bring any electronics with you. - Obtaining a driver license is way easier in California (comparing to London) - If you have good insurance from your company you're not gonna miss NHS. - You don't have a credit history so you need to pay more for deposit when youÂ  rent a place. - If you have SSN, opening a bank account is not hard. I recommend Wells Fargo. But obtaining a credit card, you need time. Not that easy. Go with a secured credit card to create it faster. - Craigslist is your best friend. - Get a Google Voice number and distribute that one to people.
