My vehicle hit a tree. Do I need a police report to tow it to a body shop?
Pennsylvania Law requires filing form AA-600 for any motor vehicle accident occurring in PA, and causing "damage to any vehicle involved to the extent that it cannot be driven under its own power in its customary manner without further damage or hazard to the vehicle, other traffic elements, or the roadway, and therefore requires towing." So - if your car needed to be towed, then you need to file the form. http://www.dmv.state.pa.us/pdotf...
