What was the ragging scene in IITs back in 1980s-90s?
My father joined IIT Kharagpur in 1982 He says that there wasn't any serious ragging at IIT even at that time. Everything that seniors did was dedicated more towards personality development than causing physical or mental harm. But there was something called the 'Nose Football' which a few unlucky  freshmen had to face. A coin would be kept on the floor, and students had to bend down, pass the coin with their nose, run about and score goals (an already marked specific spot). Painful eh? I can already feel my back aching! That was all I had to share. Maybe there used to be some harsh ragging (as we see in Five Point Someone) but my father never mentioned it to me. [Well, this is not relevant, but I am a 2016 aspirant. Wish me some Luck. I badly want to get into one of the IITs] Updated 5w ago • View Upvotes
