I want to put tube lights on my bike. Are there any ways to get a portable power source to put on my bike to power the lights?
My son put LED light strings (Christmas tree lights) on his bike. The string he used employed a small transformer (AC->DC converter), so he powered the lights from a small battery pack using "AA" batteries. The LED's do not draw much power, so the battery solution works quite well. Trying to put the lights on the wheels definitely requires a lot of effort to prevent snagging on the forks and/or brakes. Place the heavy components (battery, etc.) near the axle to minimize "out of balance" when the wheel is rotating. Make sure that the lights are placed and secured well away from surfaces that move relative to one another, and make absolutely sure they do not move or loosen when in motion. Staty safe, and have a great looking, visible bike!!
