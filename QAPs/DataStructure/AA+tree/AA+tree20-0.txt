How can DNA analysis reveal a person's geographical ancestry if race doesn't exist?
African genotypes are generally easily distinguishable from Asian ones, particularly Samoan. You should know this definitively with a Genetic Testing for Health, Disease & Ancestry; DNA Test at 23andme or one of the other providers offering the $99 genotyping test. ...unless your father was part Samoan and part AA, in which case all bets are off. But you might also be able to connect with family from that side of the tree. Good luck!
