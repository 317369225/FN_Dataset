Has Narendra Modi brought "achhe din (the Good Days)"?
This is what you call "Acche din".The willingness of the government to serve the country and its citizens. Sushma Swaraj and General V.K Singh have been on the ground and have personally co-ordinated the evacuation effort. Indian Navy's operation Yemen impresses world: 23 nations ask for help with evacuation Heartfelt salute to the soldiers and the government. yeah "Acche din a gaya he". :) Edit: The list of Nations who have asked for India's help and support in the evacuation operation,as released by MEA. Syed Akbaruddin on Twitter Why the evacuation effort has impressed the world: The complexity of the situation is due to the following reasons: 1.Yemen is undergoing the worst civil war. 2.There are competing forces who are fighting to gain control over the country.The Houthis,The forces loyal to President Hadi,The Al-Qaeda etc. 3.The Saudi led coalitoin and Iran are trying for regional supremacy.Saudi led forces are trying to stop the advance of Iran backed Shiite military group. 4.The airspace is being controlled by Saudi led coalition. 5.The airports Yemen controlled. 6.Some military bases are being captured by the al-Qaeda. 7.A no fly zone has been declared. 8.India's air operations has been limited to only 3 hour per day. 9.Indians are being moved out to Djibouti first. 10.Evacuation is also done by seaways. The Narendra Modi led government has been very practical in its approach.
