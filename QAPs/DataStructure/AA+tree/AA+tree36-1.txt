As Ned Stark is dead, who else can prove that Jon Snow is half Targaryen?
1. Howland Reed- He was one of the Band of Seven who fought alongside Ned Stark at Tower of Joy. According to Ned's thought Howland saved him from the sword of morning Arthur Dayne. He was there when Lyanna died. 2. Brynden "Bloodraven" Rivers - He is Greenseer and he have eyes all over Westeroes and Narrow seas. Bloodraven sees many things. As was said, things that were and things that are about to happen. So, I imagine he knows the truth about Jon`s parentage, and believes he`s fulfillment of AA/PTWP prophecy. But also, he needed him as LC of NW to fight the Others. I think Bloodraven gave him position with good reason, so he could lead a war against the Others.Â  He is also of Targaryen bloodline as well as First Men. 3. Benjen Stark- As far as many theories have stated that Lyanna was Knight of Laughing Tree, and Benjen was the one who lent her the armor for the same. And then he might have saw him running away with Rhaegar. Their was one point in AGOT Jon POV, where Jon mentioned that he is growing fast because of his bastard birth, there was a downward twist in Benjen mouth after hearing this. So there might a possibility of him knowing and joining the Night's Watch. 4. Arthur Dayne- There is a very less possibility that he is alive,and if he is alive then he will know that Jon is Lyanna's last promise to Ned. There is one more person with this theory and its addition to Jon Snow parentage knowledge :- 5. Lem Lemoncloak- There are theories that Lem Lemoncloak from the Brotherhood Without Banners is actually Richard Lonmouth in disguise. He was a squire to Rhaegar and he might have knowledge about Rhaegar/Lyanna kidnapping or relationship. He was there at Tourney of Harrenhal where Rhaegar choose Lyanna as Queen of Beauty. Lem cloak also matches in description to Richard's. He might have been present as witness to their marriage and pregnancy of Lyanna.
