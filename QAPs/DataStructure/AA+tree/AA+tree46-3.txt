Is the current racism against whites in South Africa in any way justified because of the history of apartheid?
This is a loaded question. And one that articulates a depressingly common trope in the discourse of some white South Africans. If you you are referring to Black Economic Empowerment and Affirmative Action you are barking up the wrong tree by calling it "racism". BEE is actually very tame (look at a BEE scorecard to see how pathetically easy it is to get a high BEE rating it is for a company.Affirmative Action (better named "regstellende aksie" in Afrikaans) also hasn't made much of a dent in white incomes, while creating a black middle class that is an important buffer against populism. Whites are still richer, healthier and better educated than other groups in South Africa. If they have to put up with the pin-pricks of affirmative action and BEE, they should view it as a small price to pay for economic and political stability. Remember, the world was in no mood to defend the beneficiaries of apartheid, and would not have botheredÂ  if they were robbed of all their assets. Thank your lucky stars for BEE and AA, and move on.
