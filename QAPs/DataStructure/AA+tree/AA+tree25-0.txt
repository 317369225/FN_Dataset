What film scene(s) influenced you most?
It has to be the final scene from Dead Poets Society. John Keating (Robin Williams) passes by Todd (Ethan Hawke) and the other students after collecting some personal articles and before he leaves, Todd leaps up from his seat and turns to face him. Todd shouts that all of them were forced to sign the letter that resulted in his dismissal and that Neil Perry's death wasn't his fault. Todd stands on his desk and salutes Keating with the words "O Captain! My Captain!." More students stand on their desks despite Headmaster Gale Nolan's threats to expel them and repeat Todd's act and say "O Captain! My Captain!" as their final good bye to their revered teacher. Keating stands in the doorway, staring up at the boys in wonder. Deeply touched by their gesture and with a smile on his face, Keating says "Thank you, boys. Thank you." and leaves. I watched Dead Poets Society when I was 16 and it had a profound impact on me. The central theme of the movie is "Carpe Diem" (Seize the day) and Keating always encourages his students to make their lives extraordinary. And the final scene is a testimony to the the transition he has brought in his students. He succeeds in encouraging his students to follow their passions and instills courage to stand up for things that are right. In the final scene we see Todd's remarkable transformation from a quiet boy who is full of diffidence to a leader. Robin Williams inspired a generation to seize the day through this movie.
