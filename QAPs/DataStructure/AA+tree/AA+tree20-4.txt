How can DNA analysis reveal a person's geographical ancestry if race doesn't exist?
In the text you quote they don't mention the word 'race' at all. The genetic markers they look at are associated with the geographical location where they are most prominent. The problem with 'race' is that the definition is somewhat arbitrary. There is no absolute cut-off in the amount of genetic differences within a species where we say, now we have a different species. But I do believe that most geneticists are fine with using theÂ  word race with regards to different groups of humans. The differences between human 'races' is just much smaller than between dog races, for example.
