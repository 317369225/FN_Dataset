As Ned Stark is dead, who else can prove that Jon Snow is half Targaryen?
First of all neither the books nor George R.R Martin has ye confirmed that Jon Snow is half Targaryen. The R+L=J, is still a fan theory, a very famous, mostly correct, but still a fan theory. R+L=J tells us that Ned stark,(as he remembers) after sacking of  Kings Landing went to Tower of Joy, to rescue Lyana Stark. He was accompanied by Howland Reed and 5 other men. They combated and defeated 3 Kingsgaurds including Ser Arthur Dayne. After defeating them Ned reaches into Lyanna's room seeing her drenched in her own blood, and Lyanna asked Ned for a promise to keep for life. After this Ned went to starfall (seat of House Dayne) to return Ser Arthur Dayne's legendary sword Dawn to his sister Ashara Dayne. (Some believe that Ashara Dayne is Jon's mother from Ned Stark) ​ Ser Arthur with Dawn. The R+L=J theory faithfuls (including me) believe that Lyanna died from Jon's birth and he was the promise. Now to show this story the show people can do a literal flashback (like the Cersie and Maggie the frog flashback she imagined). OR they can do a wierwood flash back. So Jon's lineage can be proved by Howland Reed, who was present at the tower of Joy. He is still alive in the books, somewhere in the North. And FYI he is father of Jojen and Meera ​   Or they can show it through some person whom Rhaegar Targaryen could have told that he is expecting a baby from Lyanna. Some one very close to this could be Measter Aemon. ​ Even though he is very, very dead, he had documented his writings and Samwell Tarly loves to read.
