What are some of the best "Shers" (please provide English translation too)?
The beauty of Urdu never ceases to amaze me. And more so when expressed as follows. I will post meanings to all Urdu words, and the shayari should become easy to understand:- Unki berukhi mein bhi, Iltefaat shaamil hai Aaj kal meri haalat, Dekhney ke qaabil hai Qatl ho to mera sa, Maut ho to meri si Mere sogvaaron mein, Aaj mera qaatil hai Muztarib hain maujein kyun, Uth rahe hain tufaan kyun Kyaa kisi safeeney ko, Aarzu-e-sahil hai Sirf raahzan hi se kyuun, ‘Ameer’ shikwa ho Manzilon ki raahon mein, Raahbar bhi shaamil hai Look at the beauty of the word #1! 1.
