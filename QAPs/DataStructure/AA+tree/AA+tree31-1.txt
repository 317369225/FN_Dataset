What do people think about Nagpur?
I am from Nagpur and currently study in IIT kharagpur,West Bengal. As everyone knows JEE is a national level exam brings students from different parts of the country together at one place.Many of them do not know anything about Nagpur before. But later,they come to know about "NAGPURI LANGUAGE". "Nagpurkar" often use "KYA KARENGA,KAHA JAENGA" instead of "KYA KHAYEGA,KAHA JAYEGA" And there are many words like "mahol,bawa,"hao" instead of "haan"" and many more which other states' people find hilarious.But that makes Nagpur special though. What do Marathi people (even me)in Maharashtra think about Nagpur? Marathi language is fading away in this place.This is not because a marathi person is answering this question and wants marathi language everywhere.This is the fact.When two marathi people are talking,they prefer hindi( not marathi). I asked one of my friends,"why do they do so?" The reply was," we find it cool".This is ridiculous.But Do they know ,one language in this country is fading way. In simple words,I would say ,use  other languages  for conversation,but don't forget your mother tongue whether it is marathi,gujrati,punjabi or any other language.
