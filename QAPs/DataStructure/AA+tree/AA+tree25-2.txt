What film scene(s) influenced you most?
The scene from Into the Wild where Christopher McCandless's father goes out of his house, sits on the middle of an empty street and just cries.The scene gave me goosebumps while watching the movie. A grown up man realizes his greatest loss- His own son, who he never appreciated much while he was with him and there is no way he can make amends now as his son is long gone, probably never to return. I have started to associate this scene with the feeling of loss and its realization. I think this is how someone's parents might feel after he/she commits suicide orÂ  just leaves unable to cope with the expectations of his family. Or someone after a long term relationship with his better half leaving him. I guess It is even more painful than losing something you never had. A word which comes to my mind while re watching this scene.
