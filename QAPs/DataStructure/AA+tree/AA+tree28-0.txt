My vehicle hit a tree. Do I need a police report to tow it to a body shop?
A  police report needs to be made if the car left (drove off of)  a public road, and hit a tree belonging to either a private citizen or on public property. It's called a "collision with a fixed object" and may or may not be a citable offense, depending on the circumstances. Whether the vehicle is towed by the police depends on whether its to be held as evidence, the owner or driver is not there to make other arrangements or if the driver/owner is there and requests it towed to a location of their choice. Towing to the impound lot can be expensive, especially as every day it is there more charges are accrued. If the vehicle is held as evidence there may be some different rules regarding that. But when a vehicle collides with another car or object on public or sometimes quasi public property, the police must usually be called to avoid a "hit and run" charge being filed.
