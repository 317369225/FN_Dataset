Amongst various sorting technique as merge sort, insertion sort and bubble sort, which is best in the worst case?Best is mergesort having o(nlogn) time complexity in worst case and worst one is bubble having o(n^2) in worst case. Bubble sort interacts poorly with modern CPU hardware. It requires at least twice as many writes as insertion sort, twice as many cache misses, and asymptotically more branch mispredictions. Experiments by Astrachan sorting strings in Java show bubble sort to be roughly 5 times slower than insertion sort and 40% slower than selection sort see this website for complexity analysis Big-O Algorithm Complexity Cheat Sheet
