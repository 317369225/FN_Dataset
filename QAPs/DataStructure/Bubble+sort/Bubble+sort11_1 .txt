How do I use statements to do a bubble sort in Java?In general avoid bubble sort unless your data is already sorted. There are better sorting algorithms with average case time complexity as O(nlogn) while average case time complexity for bubble sort is O(n^2) You will find Java code for bubble sort implementation here : Beginning Java - Unit 6 Arrays - Bubble Sort and here : Java: Bubble Sorts
