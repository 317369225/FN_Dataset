Which sort is better when a list already sorted bubble or selection in terms of time complexity?Bubble and selection both have same running time if you use them in their original form. However, Bubble sort has the advantage that you can slightly modify it. You can check after each pass whether any swaps occurred or not and accordingly terminate you algorithm, in which case Bubble sort is taking O(N) time. You cannot do any such terminations for selection sort because in selection you are comparing with the maximum element. Now say after first pass you see max is already in last position and you decide to terminate. But the possibility that second highest is not in its position always remains. So irrespective of the nature of the data, selection sort seems to take O(N^2) time. You can nonetheless perform checks like whether each element is greater than the preceding element. Again, keeping with question, that is not selection sort. So, no matter what happens selection sort takes quadratic time. However, you can check if the array is sorted already during input itself, which will take O(N) time, which you have to allow otherwise for taking input. No extra time cost for sorting would be required.
