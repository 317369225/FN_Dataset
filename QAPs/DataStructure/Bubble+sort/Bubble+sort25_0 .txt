How do I optimise bubble sort using insertion sort or vice versa?You don't. Bubble sort and insertion sort are both O(n^2) sorts. If the number of items you're sorting is multiplied by 1000, you expect it to take about 1,000,000 times as long to run. The advantage of bubble sort and insertion sort are both really easy to write. If you're sorting 10, 20, or 100 items, you aren't likely to care that this sort is "slow." For a large number of items you worry about optimization. There are lots and lots of different sorts available. Quicksort is a well-known sort that's quite good on average. It has an expected complexity of O(n log n). If the number of items you're sorting is multiplied by 1000, you expect it to take about 10,000 times as long to run). The worst case for it is O(n^2) though, and the normal way people chose a pivot (the first item) makes this more likely. One way around a worst case is to check out a dual pivot quicksort.
