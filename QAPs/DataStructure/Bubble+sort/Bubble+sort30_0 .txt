There are many sorting algorithms Sorting algorithm and Bubble sort is just one of them. Generally, Bubble sort is the first sorting algorithm taught in schools and colleges because it relatively easy to understand(this a very subjective). You can implement any sorting algorithm in C++ or any computer language. Algorithms are language independent. Try implementing other sorting algorithms. A good reference is What are some great books about data structure?
