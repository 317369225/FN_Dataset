Why is selection sort said to be better than bubble sort though both are of order n square? I dont see a significant difference in their algo. Plz explain?Selection Sort is used normally in cases where memory writes are quite expensive than memory reads. It only does O(n) memory writes, but Bubble Sort need atleast twice that many memory writes. Experiments by Astrachan sorting strings in Java show bubble sort to be roughly 40% slower than Selection Sort
