When would it make sense to use a bubble sort?Only when teaching sorting algorithms. Insertion sort is essentially strictly better for small lists. Edit: Steve Jessop notes in a few Stack Overflow answers that bubble sort is actually optimal if your only available memory is "drum storage" which rotates in a single direction. If anyone is still working with such a platform today, I'd like to hear the story.
