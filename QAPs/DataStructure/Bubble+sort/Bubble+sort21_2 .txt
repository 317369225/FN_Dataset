How is the cocktail sort algorithm faster than the bubble sort algorithm?Since, in the implementation of Cocktail sort, we use two loops one to go forward and the other backwards, I think it should take exactly the same time as bubble sort.Bubble sort has the worst complexity time in relation to quicksort , merge sort or heapsort which in turn has less better complexity then radix sort and bucket sort. But it is not possible always to use radix and bucket sort due to lack of space. In those cases one can use quicksort , merge sort or heapsort. Bubblesort never comes into the picture and i suggest you should never use it. Making comparisons with equal and worst sorting algorithms is a far bigger waste of time.
