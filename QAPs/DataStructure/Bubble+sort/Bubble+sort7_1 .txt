When would it make sense to use a bubble sort?Actually I use it quite often when I have things mostly sorted and just changing slightly now and again. For example, I made the graphics engine for the Pixeljunk PS3 game, "Monsters". It is a 2D game so all sprites are simply sorted with the y position and then drawn over each other. Most entities like trees and buildings are static, and mobile entities don't usually move very fast, so the list is at all times "near sorted". For this, a list of entities is kept and a single bubblesort pass is performed each frame, that is, I just iterate once through the list swapping neighbours if needed. It is extremely fast and simple to implement. Note, with this kind of sort, objects can move quickly down the list but not up it. So if your entities are moving fast, it might be a good idea to do a forward and backward bubblesort pass.
