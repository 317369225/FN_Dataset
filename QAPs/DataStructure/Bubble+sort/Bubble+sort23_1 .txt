Why have the O(n^2) sorting algorithms (like insertion sort and bubble sort) been developed, and what are they used for?The algorithms were developed because they are simple to design and code. It would seem most unlikely that if you were setting out to sort a small array of values that you'd conceive of quicksort on your first go. Jon Bentley has some interesting things to say in talking about how to make a practical Good sort implementation. Bubblesort has very little going for it aside from having a catchy name. Insertion sort is the better choice as analyzed by Knuth in his volume 3. When working in a language that doesn't provide a sort routine, given a need to sort a small array (perhaps a dozen elements), I've written O(n**2) simple code to do the sorting and been happy with the results.
