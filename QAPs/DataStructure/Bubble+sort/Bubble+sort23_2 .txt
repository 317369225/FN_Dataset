Why have the O(n^2) sorting algorithms (like insertion sort and bubble sort) been developed, and what are they used for?We always do asymptotic analysis i.e. we look at the growth of running time ignoring machine dependent constants and other factors so that we can compare performance of an algorithm irrespective of the computer architecture. Asymptotically, an algorithm will always beat for sufficient large . But for smaller input size, an algorithm may perform fairly better than . Example : For smaller input size, Insertion sort outperforms Quicksort and other sorting algorithms like Merge sort and Heapsort. That's why even std::sort implements Insertion sort for smaller input size.
