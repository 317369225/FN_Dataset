In layman's terms, what is the difference between a bubble sort and an insert sort?Well Kevin, Let me answer that for you in laymans terms. . . . The main advantage of insert sort is that it's online algorithm. You don't have to have all values at start. This could be useful, when dealing with data coming from network, or some sensor. I have a feeling, that this would be faster than other conventional n log(n) algorithms. Because you the complexity would n*(n log(n)) e.g. reading/storing each value from stream (O(n)) and then sorting all the values (O(n log(n))) resulting in O(n^2 log(n)) On the contrary using Insert Sort needs O(n) for reading values from stream and O(n) to put the value to correct place, thus it's O(n^2) only. Other advantage is, that you don't buffers for storing values, you sort them in the final destination. Got it? Hope so . . . . Additional (or all) credit to 'jnovacho' on stackoverflow.com
