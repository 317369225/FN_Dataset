In layman's terms, what is the difference between a bubble sort and an insert sort?It suffices to say that most sorting algorithms are highly mechanical and unfeasible/not practical for a human being to do. Humans have small short term memory and are not very good at tasks that require lots of attention for a perfectly rigorous execution. Insertion sort is the algorithm that suits best the human's way of working, although it is not the most efficient computationally speaking. Bubble sort is what you observe bubbles doing inside a liquid: things that are heavier go to the bottom while lighter things go to the surface. So on each sweep of the items you compare each item with the next one in physical position: if the preceding one is 'bigger' than the next, you swap their positions and so on. There are several minute improvements to this algorithm, but its complexity (efficiency) will not be changed in orders of magnitude. Insertion sort is what you do when you receive a hand of cards in a card game: you look at each card, pick it if it is out of sequence, and insert it in the right place. :) Bubble sort has the advantage of being easy to understand, intuitive and therefore easy for a novice programmer to implement as his first sorting algorithm. It is not, however, the most efficient algorithm. There are more efficient algorithms but they are much less clear to understand, of an almost transcendent yet wonderful logic, like the quicksort.
