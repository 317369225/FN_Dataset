insertion sort O(n^2) and because of in-place sorting O(1) space complexity bubble sort O(n^2) and because of in-place sorting O(1) space complexity Merge sort: When you need a stable, O(N log N) sort, this is about your only option. The only downsides to it are that it uses O(N) auxiliary space and has a slightly larger constant than a quick sort. Insertion sort: When N is guaranteed to be small, including as the base case of a quick sort or merge sort. it is a stable sort. Bubble sort: When you're doing something quick and dirty and for some reason you can't just use the standard library's sorting algorithm. The only advantage these have over insertion sort is being slightly easier to implement. So if the N is large go for merge sort and make insertion sort to be a part of it as a base case for real world bubble sort is outdated (no need of it).
