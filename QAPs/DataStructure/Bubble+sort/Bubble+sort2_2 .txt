Which is faster: quicksort or bubble-sort?Please give detailed explanations. I have been playing with them throughout the whole morning and I am not sure which one is faster.Quicksort is definitely not human brain friendly like bubble. But it's extremely good for machine. Anyway, just play around with this site. It should give you pretty good views of most of the popular sorting algorithms. http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/
