How can I combine merge sort and bubble sort into a single C programme?i just want to know how to connect merge and bubble sort into a one c programmeThe C++ STL actually does use something similar to this idea but it combines quick sort and insertion sort instead. The key here is the size of the data size N. If N is less than some amount then there is no benefit to using merge sort (or quick sort) and instead you want to favor bubble sort (or insertion sort). Simply in your sort check size of < N less than some value (test it yourself for the best one), then favor bubble sort else use merge sort. It should be noted that you should use insertion sort instead of bubble sort because it ends up doing less operations overall.
