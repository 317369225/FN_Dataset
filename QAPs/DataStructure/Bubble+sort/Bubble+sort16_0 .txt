Is this a valid Bubble sort function? If yes then how?No, this is not a bubble sort. Yes, it is a sorting algorithms and is a selection sort. Bubble sort: In bubble sort each consecutive numbers are compared to find the largest or the smallest number and are moved to the last or first according to the need and the code written. eg: Input: 3 5 1 4 7 6 Step 1: 3 1 5 4 7 6 Step 2: 3 1 4 5 7 6 Step 3: 3 1 4 5 6 7 Step 4: 1 3 4 5 6 7 So, in this example we compare the consecutive elements and doing so finally move the largest element to the last. In the second iteration, we again go from the start until the second largest element and place it in it's proper place.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516 void sort_it(int a[],int n) { int i,j,temp; for(i=0;i<n;i++) { for(j=0;j<n-1;j++) { if(a[j]>a[j+1]) { temp = a[j]; a[j] = a[j+1]; a[j+1] = temp; } } } } Selection Sort: The selection sort selects the largest or smallest element among all the element and put it in it's proper place. In short, it selects in for a proper place for an element in each Iterations: Input: 3 5 1 4 7 6 Step 1:1 5 3 4 7 6 Step 2:1 3 5 4 7 6 Step 3:1 3 4 5 7 6 Step 4:1 3 4 5 6 7
