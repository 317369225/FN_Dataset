How do I use statements to do a bubble sort in Java?Kaustubh's answer provides some good advice on using bubble sort. In regard to the specific lines you have asked about: It checks to see if the value at index j of the array is larger than the value at index j + 1 of the array (the index after it). If it is, it will swap the two in the array by first storing the value at index j, replacing the value at index j with the value from index j + 1, and then replacing the value at index j + 1 with the previously saved value from index j.A2A.
