Is this an efficient implementation of bubble sort?the complexity of bubblesort is O(n*n) which is inefficient regarding sorting methods like heapsort or quicksort which are O(n*log(n)) in average (heapsort even in regards to its worst case). lets compare your bubblesort to some kind of best implementation bubblesort. you should add a stopping criteria if during an iteration no change was made. then you could avoid some loop runnings because often you will get an optimal solution without running through it n times where n is your first indexCheck. you can add a boolean variable "sorted = true" in the first line and set this after your if(first > next) statement to false. then check this variable before calling the recursion. you don't need to go on, if its still true, because you didn't need to do changes which means your array is sorted
