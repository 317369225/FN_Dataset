When should one use selection sort and bubble sort ? Is there any advantage of selection sort over bubble sort or vice versa?I hope that we go for bubble sort in conditions where the inputs are moreover sorted with some randomness in it. Even though the best case and worst case complexity of selection sort is O(n^2), when should we go for it?One advantage of selection sort is that it requires only write operations. If we have a system where write operations are extremely expensive and read operations are not, then selection sort could be ideal (I'm assuming write time outweighs processing time). However, such a scenario is pretty rare. One such scenario would be if we are sorting a file in-place on flash memory. Selection sort is also pretty good for smaller arrays of maybe 10 to 20 elements.
