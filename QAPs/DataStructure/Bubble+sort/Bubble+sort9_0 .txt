What is modified bubble sorting?Modified bubble sort is a better version of bubble sort. It includes a flag that is set if an exchange is made after an entire pass over the array. If no exchange is made, then it is clear that the array is already in order because no two elements need to be switched. In that case, the sort should end. The new best case order for this algorithm is O(n) , which was O(n^2) previously , however the worst case time complexity remain unchanged .
