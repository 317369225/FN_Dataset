How do I make a bubble sorted 2-D string array in C?What you are looking for is called lexicographic ordering. Use the normal bubble sort algorithm each element being an entire string, and use strcmp to compare them. I.e. in normal bubble sort, we write 1 if (a[i] < a[j]) swap(a[i], a[j]); instead in this case we will write if (strcmp(a, b) < 0) swap(a, b); assumption : a, b are two strings.
