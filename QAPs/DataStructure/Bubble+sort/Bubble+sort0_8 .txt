Is this an efficient implementation of bubble sort?I do not see any big problem in this implementation. However, you should know that the bubble sort is seldom (never?) used for efficiency, since its average case performance is O(n^2). Modern sorting implementation usually use a general algorithm among quick sort, heap sort or merge sort, which have an average complexity of O(n log n), enriching them with small optimizations, such as resorting to more simpler algorithms (usually insersion sort) when they reach a small sub-list to be sorted. The reason for this is that the complexity is usually viewed as an asymptotic quantity, i.e. becoming true when the number of elements is big. The big-O notation, however, hides the multiplicative constants of the algorithm, that typically get bigger with more sophisticated algorithms. While this effect is negligible when the size of the data is big enough, it can be the dominant effect when applying the algorithm on small input. This is why, paradoxically, algorithms of worse complexity can sometimes outperform algorithms of better complexity.
