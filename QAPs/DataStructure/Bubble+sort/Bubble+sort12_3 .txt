What is the programming for bubble sorting to avoid unnecessary comparison?You can probably have another variable to check if any swaps have been made and exit the loop if there are none. Bubble sort is recommended only for an array which is "nearly sorted" int flag; for(int i=0;i<N;i++)  {  flag=0;  for(int j=0;j<N-i-1;j++)  {  if(arr[j]<arr[j+1])  {  temp=arr[j];  arr[j]=arr[j+1];  arr[j+1]=temp;  flag=1;  }  }  if(flag==0)  break;  }
