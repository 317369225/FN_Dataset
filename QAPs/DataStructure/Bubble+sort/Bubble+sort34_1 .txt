Amongst various sorting technique as merge sort, insertion sort and bubble sort, which is best in the worst case?Merge sort. Bubble sort has significance w.r.t learning/academic/demonstration purposes. In most of the cases, it is not implemented/suggested practically. Insetion sort is useful when the data is almost sorted. So, in majority of the divide and conquer strategies, there would be a base case when implemented via recursion. So, in these base cases, it is suggestable to use this Insertion sort[because the data that has to be sorted in the base case is either small or is almost sorted]. Merge sort performs better just like quick sort. In most of the programming languages, the language offers an inbuilt sort operation. And this is usually implemented via a merge sort or a quick sort. Moreover, this sorting technique can help you utilize parallel nature of CPU processing.
