What is a bubble sorting array?Its a simple sorting algorithm. It compares an element of an array (a[i]) with the next (a[i + 1]), and if the element is greater than the next, it swaps them, if not it does nothing. It then moves to the next element and then continues this procedure until the array is sorted. Example: consider an array with elements: 10, 4, 11, 77 First Pass: compare 10 and 4, swap 10 and 4 => 4, 10, 11, 77 compare 10 and 11, no swap compare 11 and 77, no swap Resulting array: 4, 10, 11, 77 (sorted) sample code: --------------- int[] bubbleSort(int[] unsortedArray) {  for (int i = unsortedArray.length; i > 0; i--) {  for (int j = 0; j < i - 1; j++) {  if (unsortedArray[j] > unsortedArray[j + 1]) {  swap(unsortedArray, j, j + 1);  }  }  }  return unsorted; } void swap(int[] array, int i, int j) {  int temp = array[i];  array[j] = array[i];  array[j] = temp; } You can see that the total number of times it makes a pass in the array is: (n - 1) + (n - 2) + (n - 3) +... + 2 + 1 = n * (n - 1)/2 ~ n2 As you can see the complexity of the algorithm is O(n2). Note: n squared.
