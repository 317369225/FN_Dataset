How can I combine merge sort and bubble sort into a single C programme?i just want to know how to connect merge and bubble sort into a one c programmeIdk if I understood what you want, But normaly, you use the bubble sort as an end case of merge sort, (if you implement it recursively). For example, when the size of the vector to sort is > n, you dont split it again, you call the bubble sort. would be something like mergesort(v) {  if(size(v) > n) {  [a,b] = split(v);  mergesort(a);  mergesort(b);  v = combine(a,b);  } else {  bubblesort(v)  } }
