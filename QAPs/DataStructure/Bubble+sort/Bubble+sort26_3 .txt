according to me bubble sort and insertion sort both are best because of space complexity 0f O(1) and time complexity of O(n^2) although if you are giving a priority to time complexity than merge sort is the best option with a time complexity of O(nlogn) and space complexity is O(n). but when considering both as a priority i think you should prefer hep sort { time complexity O(nlogn) space complexity O(1). But you should keep in mind the requirement of your program and your algo varies according to the demand of the situation.
