Bubble Sort vs Insertion Sort vs Quick Sort: which algorithm is best for which case?Bubble Sort is strictly worse than the other two in all cases. Insertion Sort is best for collections that are already partially sorted. Quicksort is better than the other two in pretty much all other cases. You would also do well to familiarize yourself with Radix Sort (also called Bucket Sort and Counting Sort), as it's better than all of the above for sorting low-cardinality integers.
