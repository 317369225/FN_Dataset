Is this an efficient implementation of bubble sort?It is inefficient in most aspects: a) Bubble Sort is a relatively inefficient algorithm, in terms of time b) The recursive implementation (vs. iterate on j) increases memory usage (the stack), unnecesarily (and for a large enough N, potentially getting out of memory). Most Bubble Sort implementations just need a few extra integers and the array, not many copies of the array as your version c) Using a list, inserting and removing, adds an extra linear time operation, potentially on each iteration; so the standard O(n^2) Bubble Sort implementation is much faster than your O(n^3) sample...
