Which is faster: quicksort or bubble-sort?Please give detailed explanations. I have been playing with them throughout the whole morning and I am not sure which one is faster.Bubble sort is considered one of the worst, if not the worst, sorting algorithm. Quicksort is faster on larger amounts of data. Quicksort is meant to be used on hundreds and thousands of pieces of data to be be sorted.
