What are some applications of the bubble sort algorithm?Briefly 3 applications, if there are any, unique to Bubble sort.Short answer: None. Longer: if the items to be sorted are already sorted then Bubble Sort is as efficient as Insertion sort and more efficient than most other sorts. However that's a niche market. However, if the data set is sorted in reverse order, then Bubble Sort has nothing to recommend it at all as most other sorts will be faster.
