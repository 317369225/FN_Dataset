What is time? How is time affected by gravity?
Gravity curves space-time. The greater the gravitational field, the greater the curvature. Light must always travel at a constant speed. A beam of light in a weak gravitational field travels between two points "a" and "b" in the same time as a beam of light in a strong gravitational field going from "c" to "d". ​ ​Since the distance traveled by the beam in the stronger gravitational field is longer due the curving of space-time, in order for the speed of light to remain constant, [math]{speed} = \frac{distance}{time}[/math] time itself must pass slower in the stronger gravitational field relative to the weaker gravitational field. So when you count the number of ticks on two very precise clocks while timing a beam of light going from "a" to "b," then from "c" to "d", where the apparent measured distance between each pair of points are equal; each beam of light will arrive at the same time but the clock in the weaker gravitational field will have counted more ticks than the other clock. This means time has passed faster for the clock in the weaker gravitational field. An observer in the weaker gravitational field will see the clock in the stronger gravitational field running slower. Conversely, an observer in the stronger gravitational field will see the clock in the weaker gravitational field running faster. This effect has been confirmed by experiments and is even used to keep the clocks of GPS satellites in sync. Updated 61w ago • View Upvotes
