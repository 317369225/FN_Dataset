What's the significance of the cliché "six degrees of separation"?
TL;DR: "Six degrees of separation" is a colloquial expression for a phenomenon in network theory called the small-world effect. The term "small world," in turn, refers to the observation that, in many model and real-world networks, the typical distance between nodes rises very slowly as the number of nodes grows. This effect occurs in a wide variety of networks, where the nodes and links take on very different meanings. Most famously, it can occur in social networks, where nodes represent people and the links represents friendships or acquaintances [1]. However, it can also occur, for instance, in the neural network of C. elegans, where nodes represent neurons and links represent synapses [2]. It's important not to get too fixated on the "six" in "six degrees of separation." This number is motivated by the results of the famous Milgram experiment on social networks, which I'll discuss in more detail later. In different networks, this number will vary, but if the small-world phenomenon occurs, the typical distance between nodes will be surprisingly small, even in networks with a large number of nodes. Thus, the "six" can be thought of as a gesture in the right direction. At a basic level, the mechanism that's responsible for keeping distances short, even in networks with a lot of nodes, is the following: if you pick a node, start traveling outward from it, and count how many nodes you can reach within [math]M[/math] hops, this number often grows very quickly with [math]M[/math]. In fact, it often grows exponentially quickly. Thus, in a few hops, you can reach a huge number of nodes. If you'd like to see this argument fleshed out in more detail and learn about some real-world examples and counterexamples, please read on... The Small-World Effect in Model Networks You can get some intuition for why the small-world effect occurs by thinking about how distances between nodes scale in a "tree" network. Consider starting with a single node and building out a network where each node is connected to three others and there are no closed loops. The first few steps in this process look like: ​ By step [math]M[/math] of this process, the network will contain [math]3 \times 2^M - 2 [/math] nodes. Meanwhile, after [math]M[/math] steps, the distance from the center node to the outer nodes is [math]M[/math]. The maximum distance between any two nodes will be [math]2M[/math]. If we call the total number of nodes in the network [math]N[/math], the typical distance between nodes is just proportional to [math]\log(N)[/math], which grows very slowly with [math]N[/math]. This slow, logarithmic growth of typical distances with network size characterizes the small-world effect. Now, you can reasonably object that the network that we've looked at above has a very special structure, but the small-world effect occurs in more generic network models too. For example, it's known to occur in models where the connectivity between nodes is completely random. Suppose you begin with [math]N[/math] nodes and connect each possible pair at random with a probability [math]p = \frac{d}{N -1}[/math]. Here, [math]d[/math] is the average degree, or number of links, of each node. This leads to what's called an Erdős–Rényi random network. Within this model, you can show that the average path length scales like: [math]\ell \sim \frac{\log(N)}{\log(d)}[/math] as [math]N[/math] grows, as long as two conditions hold. The first is that the number of links per node is high enough so that the network is connected: specifically, we need [math]d[/math] to grow faster than [math]\log(N)[/math]. Second, the number of links per node needs grow less quickly than [math]N[/math] itself. If it grows proportionally to [math]N[/math], the average path length can be constant (i.e., shorter than logarithmic). Given that the two conditions hold, there are two steps to the argument for logarithmic scaling of path lengths, and I'll just state the intuition behind each. As [math]N[/math] grows, most nodes have degree between [math]\frac{d}{b}[/math] and [math]bd[/math] for some constant [math]b[/math]. This hints that you might be able to bound the average path length by the tree models with [math]\frac{d}{b}[/math] links and [math]bd[/math] links. The reason why you might be skeptical of a tree model is that there can be closed loops in the random model, which lowers the number of nodes that you encounter as you travel outward from any given node (because you loop back on yourself via certain paths). This turns out to be a small effect, and here's the intuition why: imagine building up the random graph, link by link. The number of pairs where at least one node has not yet been reached is usually much greater than the number of pairs connecting nodes that have already been reached, and this keeps the effect of closed loops small. Thus, it turns out that the random network is sufficiently tree-like that the bounds from point 1 apply. The average path length grows logarithmically, and the small-world effect occurs. For a more complete argument, I recommend this video from Matthew Jackson's Social and Economic Networks Coursera course [3]. Ok, but the small-world effect is famously claimed to occur in social networks, and many of these violate point 2 above. The probability of closed loops is often higher than in a random model, because two of your friends are more likely than random to be friends themselves. This means that closed loops of length 3 are quite likely. In the language of network theory, social networks tend to have a high clustering coefficient, and this calls into question our neglect of closed loops. In highly regular networks where every node is just connected to its immediate neighbors, the typical path length can scale linearly in network size and, thus, not exhibit the small-world effect. Social networks tend to have close to, but not exactly, this structure. In addition to clusters of connected neighbors, there are rarer long-range ties to distant acquaintances or friends. Motivated by this, Watts and Strogatz proposed a model that interpolates between a regular network and a completely random model like the one that we discussed above. Here's an illustration from their original paper [2]: In the Watts-Strogatz model, you begin with a network like the one of the left, where each node is connected to [math]d[/math] neighbors (in this case [math]d=4[/math]). Then, with probability [math]p[/math], you remove each link and rewire it to connect two randomly chosen nodes. Note that, if [math]p[/math] is small, the randomness will not strongly affect the clustering of the regular model. I like to use a "coarse graining" approach to understand why the small-world effect occurs in the Watts-Strogatz model. Suppose we take the middle network in the figure approach and "coarse grain" it into blocks of [math]c[/math] nodes each as follows: Roughly speaking, if we think of each block as a node, it forms a random network with the other blocks. Typically, there will also be some non-random links between adjacent blocks, but these can only make the path lengths shorter, so let's ignore them for now. To get between nodes of the original network, you typically need to make order [math]\log\left(\frac{N}{c}\right)[/math] hops between blocks and travel order [math]c[/math] steps within each block before making each hop. Since [math]c[/math] is just some constant, the path length still scales logarithmically and the small-world effect still occurs, even with a small amount of randomness. Thus, the small-world effect occurs in a wide range of model networks, with varying degrees of randomness and local order. For further reading here, I highly recommend this chapter of the book by Easley and Kleinberg [4]. Examples in Real-World Networks After showing that their model exhibits a small-world effect for even small [math]p[/math], Watts and Strogatz noted that "the small-world phenomenon is not merely a curiosity of social networks nor an artefact of an idealized model- it is probably generic for many large, sparse networks found in nature" [2]. Let's now look at some examples of such networks. The original empirical demonstration of the effect was, in fact, in a social network. In the 1960s, Stanley Milgram sent 96 packages to randomly chosen individuals in Omaha, Nebraska. He instructed them to try to get the packages to a specific person in Boston. However, they were asked to only directly send the package to someone whom they knew on a first-name basis. The idea was that each of these 96 individuals in Omaha could choose, amongst their acquaintances, the person most likely to know the target individual in Boston. The people to whom they sent the packages would need to pass them on by following the same instructions, and in this way, the packages would hopefully eventually reach their intended destination. Of the 96 packages, 18 eventually did, and the mean number of steps that these 18 packages took was 5.9. This gave rise to the popular expression "six degrees of separation" [1, 5]. Since then, the small-world phenomenon has been observed in many contexts, including: the network of actors who have performed together in films, colloquially known as "six degrees of Kevin Bacon" [2] the network of researchers who have collaborated on mathematical papers (see Erdős number) the power grid of the Western United States [2] the neural network of C. elegans [2] public transit networks [6] airport networks [7] ... Now, in looking at model networks, we saw that the small-world effect is, in a strict sense, a claim about how typical path lengths grow as we consider progressively larger networks. Meanwhile, in considering real-world examples, we're sometimes looking at single snapshot image of a network. Note that signatures of the small-world effect can still be present in such snapshot. For example, you can test the claim that as you walk out from a typical node in the network, the number of accessible nodes grows exponentially in the number of hops. You can also test the claim that typical path lengths are short, closer to a random network of the same size than a fully regular network. If you're checking for Watts-Strogatz behavior, you can also test that clustering stays high despite the short path lengths. When people claim that small-world behavior exists in real-world networks, these are often the tell-tale signatures. Counterexamples in Real-World Networks It's really important to understand that the small-world effect is not a theorem about all networks. We've already noted that it generally won't happen in a fully regular network where nodes are just connected to immediate neighbors, but that's not the only counterexample. Here, I'll just discuss a couple of others. If you're reading this, there is no short path of acquaintances that connects you to the inhabitants of North Sentinel Island. Since the Sentinelese are one the most isolated human populations still remaining, this statement might seem obvious, but it highlights an important point. When we looked at model networks, we made sure to look at connected networks so that you can reach any node from any other. When this condition doesn't hold, or in many real-world networks, the small-world effect may only occur within the largest connected component (i.e., the giant component) of the network. The Sentinelese have thus far chosen to remain outside the giant component of the graph of human acquaintances. While the case of the Sentinelese or other uncontacted peoples may seem like a minor edge case, an interesting possibility that's emerged in the last couple of years is that the small-world effect was much more limited or non-existent in the historical human contact network. This was argued in the paper "The small-world effect is a modern phenomenon" by Mark Newman's group at Michigan [8]. They looked at the progress of the Black Death epidemic through 14th century Europe and inferred that the pattern of spreading is not what we should expect if the small-world effect occurred. I'm not sure about how confident we can be about the historical inference, but it's an important cautionary tale against assuming that the small-world effect always occurs in social networks.
