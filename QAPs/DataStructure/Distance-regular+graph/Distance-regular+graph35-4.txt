What are the top running technique suggestions?
Ask a question like this and the "one size fits all" responses will come out of the woodwork.  The reality is that every runner needs to find the technique that works for them.  And this is really a case that "form follows function" - you can't force technique shortcuts if you don't have the balance of strength to support them. It has been frequently reported that sports med docs, physical therapists, and orthopedic surgeons are thrilled with the "minimalist" movement in running because many runners who don't have strong enough calves or feet are trying to leap right into forefoot landing and flat shoes and injuring their Achilles or developing plantar fasciitis. So proceed carefully if you choose to follow such advice.  I've been working for years to strengthen my calves enough to support a mid- to forefoot landing, and I still am not there.  Yes, a heel-strike can cause injury issues of their own, but the tendency towards injury under a given running style is dependent on your individual strengths and weaknesses. There are some more universal truths though, like keeping your shoulders and fists relaxed, standing tall, leaning forward ever so slightly at the ankles, swinging your arms so your hands pass by your hips and don't cross your midline, and running as lightly on your feet as you can manage.  But don't try to think of these things at the same time.  Focus on one element at a time until you become "unconsciously competent" before moving to the next (ie, you have adapted the change without having to think about it any longer.
