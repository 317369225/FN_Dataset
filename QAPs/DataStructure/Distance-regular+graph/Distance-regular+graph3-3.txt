What are some startups with really unique business models?
Personally I really like Duolinguo's business model. I think it's just ingenious. If you don't know Duolinguo, it's an online platform that helps people learning new languages. It takes a very straightforward approach: you learn a language as a kid plays a game. You earn points, have challenges, compete with your friends. Despite his basic approach, it has proven itself to be a very effective way (@How effective is Duolingo in learning a language?) to learn languages. And, oh, it's free. So, how does Duolinguo make money? Well, it turns out that Duolinguo is so good that you can actually "merge" (using an algorithm) basic translations from first-time learner and create a complete and almost-perfect translation Check this video out for more info Sounds magical, doesn't it? Duolinguo takes thousands of translations, merges them and creates human-like translations. And, well... You guess that. Then it sells the translations to whoever needs them ;) So you get high effective lessons for free, Duolinguo makes money without charging its users and customers pay much less for same quality translations. I repeat my self: it's just ingenious. PS: I don't work for Duolinguo, I just love what they do!
