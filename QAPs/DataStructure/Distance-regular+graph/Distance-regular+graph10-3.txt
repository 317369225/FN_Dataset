How can any celestial object leave an imprint on the fabric of space if there is no up or down? Wouldn't gravity be affecting it on all sides therefore not causing it to leave an impression because there is no down?
The bowling ball on fabric is a model of a graph, where height is the gravitational potential, and E2 is a plane of space.  In this, it is a dynamic graph because it can be used as a billiard-ball table to show how things move.  So all we're using here is height = potential, and the model works just as well in newtonian physics. The Schwarzchild metric is a solution to Einstein's equations, works like this:  Space is ruffled up in the direction of heavy objects, and cloth in equal tension will be pulled more towards the direction of the ruffle.  The extent of the ruffle is of the order of m = GM/c², a circle drawn around a mass of M has the radius of r, and the circumference of 2pi(r+m).  That means the m in smaller circles make a bigger contribution, and the net tension of space is due to that  m/(r+m-d) is bigger than m/(r+m+d), so things fall onto smaller circles, and hence to the object.  This model exactly matches newton's law at low velocities. The other model is that there is a gravitational flux, which solves maxwell's equations.  This means that the cause of electrical to magnetic conversions are due to SR, and that there is a corresponding gravity form of magnetism too.  In either case, the field is propergated through space.
