How do mathematicians discover new 'things'?
Mathematical theorems are justified through proofs, i.e. logical reasoning based on assumed axioms. But before we can prove a theorem, we need to have a potential statement of the theorem in mind. How can these pre-theorem statements be generated? One way that this can happen is by doing lots of computations with specific examples, whether it's numbers, geometric objects, algebraic objects, or other types of abstractions which arise from scientific models and scientific problems. After a while, you may begin to notice some patterns. Then you may try to prove that the patterns are actually true. Now, after doing that for a while, you may begin to notice that similar patterns appear in multiple different contexts. You may begin to suspect that there is some overarching structural reason for this. In other words, you notice that there is a pattern of patterns â€” so now you can try to prove that these analogies, these patterns of patterns, are actually true. These types of theorems are usually the more beautiful and useful ones.
