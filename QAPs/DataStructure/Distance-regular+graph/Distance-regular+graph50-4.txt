How much more powerful could the Roman Empire have become with a thorough understanding of modern economics and finance?
Modern Central banking techniques are dependent on electronic money.  If I buy a house, the money is transferred from my bank to the sellers bank in the form of electrons.  This is massively expanded when dealing with large businesses and even more expanded when dealing with nations. In Roman times, I would have carried a bucket of coins over to the seller.  Tributes from countries were convoys of gold laden wagons or jewels.  Taxes were paid in grain or olive oil or goats. Money represented things.  A gold coin had value because it was made of gold, not because the government said it did.  The fiat money system that we have now took centuries to develop.  A central banker would never live long enough to see even a start of the changes that would occur.  Without the strong guidance, the reforms that you are talking about would simply fail.
