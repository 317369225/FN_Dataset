What is time? How is time affected by gravity?
Let me start by explaining Einstein's Theory of Relativity Space is like a paper or a fabric. It is stretched out like a large sheet Imagine a stretched sheet and someone puts a heavy ball at the centre. What do you observe? the fabric at around the ball "Bends" So, space bends due to heavy mass such as Earth Since Gravity is affected by mass, the gravity changes around the earth Now, Mass is inversely proportional to time When there is heavy mass Time Slows Down When I say Time slows down, imagine that Life is like a Video and when time slows down, life goes in slow motion. Earth has a huge mass, and you're standing on it. Since mass affects time, you tend to "Slow Down" You may ask why nothing is slow to you. The reason is, that you wouldn't know it. If some alien were to watch you from outer space, you would be in slow motion. When you see the alien from earth, it'll be in fast forward... So the person in the video will think everything is normal. But the person watching the video will know that the video is in slow motion Similarly, Satellites that revolve around the earth are far from earth's gravity.  Hence, the Atomic clock inside the satellite is faster than the atomic clock on earth. GPS satellites travel at approximately 8,700 mph (14,000 km/h) with respect to Earth. This means time runs 7,200 nanoseconds per day slower for a satellite relative to us on Earth as described by Special Relativity. However, using General Relativity it is possible to calculate that time goes faster for a GPS satellite by 45,900 nanoseconds per day, due to the satellite being 19,000km above the Earth (therefore in weaker gravity). This means overall time runs 38,700 (45,900 – 7,200) nanoseconds faster per day for a GPS satellite relative to us stationary on Earth. Thanks for the A2A. Hope you understood.
