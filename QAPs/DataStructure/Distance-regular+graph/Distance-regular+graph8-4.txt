A gun shoots bullets towards infinity at a constant rate for an infinite time. The speed of each bullet is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Whenever two bullets collide they disappear. What is the probability that a bullet would reach infinity?
On one hand, as time progresses the distance travelled by the farthest bullet will increase without bounds. On the other hand, every bullet that is fired will eventually collide with another bullet. To see that distance increases without bound, consider a subsequence [math]\{ a_r, a_{r+1}, ..., a_{r+2k} \}[/math] of [math]2k+1[/math] bullets satisfying [math]  \left\{\begin{matrix} 0.6 < V(a_{r+x}) < 1.0, & x<k \\ 0.5 < V(a_{r+x}) < 0.6, & x = k \\  0.0 < V(a_{r+x}) < 0.5, & x>k \end{matrix}\right \} [/math]. The first [math]k[/math] fast and last [math]k[/math] slow bullets clear the path for the middle bullet to travel [math]k[/math] time units without collision. Such a subsequence obtains a distance at least [math] { k \over 2 } [/math], and occurs with probability [math] (1-.6)^k * (.6-.5) * (.5-0)^k = {.2^k \over 10} [/math], and therefore is definitely within the infinite sequence. To see that all bullets eventually collide, consider the sequence of all bullets fired [math] fire = \left \{ a_i \right \} [/math] and the (supposed) subsequence [math] escape = \left \{ a_{f(i)} \right \} [/math] that never collide. Clearly the velocities [math] \left \{ V(a_{f(i)}) \right \} [/math] must decrease monotonically. However by symmetry in the problem we can consider the set [math] wouldescape [/math] of bullets that would escape if all bullets fired before time [math] f(i) [/math] are ignored. Each time we make such a consideration, by symmetry we get an equation like [math] P( V(a_{f(i)}) < V(a_{f(i+1)}) = .5  [/math], which implies by an inductive argument that [math]escape[/math] is the empty set.
