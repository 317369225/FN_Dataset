What are some brain storming/puzzle questions asked in a data scientist/analyst interview?
For data scientist interview, one brain storm question I like particularly is "describe one of your past projects (relevant to the position) with details", which is also mentioned in Giri Gopalan's answer. Compared to "random" questions picked by interviewers, this question gives the candidates less "surprise" so they could be relaxed a bit, which in turn helps them to demonstrate their true expertise. In addition, as a candidate describes her/his project, it is very easy and natural for interviewers to ask questions around certain specific aspects to gain more insights about the candidate. Those questions can go beyond the candidate's knowledge but won't deviate too much as they are about the candidate's own project, which can give interviews some extra insight about the candidate's reasoning and research capability.
