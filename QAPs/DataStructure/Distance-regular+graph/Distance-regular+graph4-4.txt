How do mathematicians discover new 'things'?
The whole field of Metamathematics deals with this question. To be brief, though, the basic idea is that there are these systems we want to learn about (basic arithmetic may be the most widely studied). To do this, mathematicians basically say, lets imagine a system that follow these rules; A, B, C, etc. Now, what else can we know about this system? In the future, if we ever find a system for which these assumptions hold, we can then immediately know some of its properties. This is done by essentially building sets of strings that represent these models and then making sets of string-operations correspond to operations that the model has. In this way, mathematicians construct a Homomorphism between the model and the theory. The set of strings corresponding to the assumptions (A, B, C, etc.) are designated as "true" and anything that can be proven via the operations allowed by these rules are also designated "true". This allows mathematicians to prove things.
