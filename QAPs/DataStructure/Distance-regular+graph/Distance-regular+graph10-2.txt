How can any celestial object leave an imprint on the fabric of space if there is no up or down? Wouldn't gravity be affecting it on all sides therefore not causing it to leave an impression because there is no down?
It was a matter of convenience to represent to fabric of space time as a plane. So, while looking down on the fabric, it is easier to represent the effect of gravity being down. Not, decide which image is easier to understand and explain. ​ ​
