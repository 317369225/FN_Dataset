Is it possible for a plane to take off with a damaged engine?
Yes, both unplanned and even sometimes planned. Unplanned - If an aircraft has exceeded its go/no-go speed (V1) on takeoff, and has engine problems or even total engine failure, it is designed to continue flying safely.  Moreover the pilots train to this situation in a simulator regularly.  Of course prior to V1 speed, the takeoff will be aborted with an engine problem. Planned - In extremely rare occasions with a multi-engine aircraft lacking one engine, it is possible with proper planning of takeoff distance required, etc., along with a special waiver, to reposition an aircraft from one airport to another for maintenance or other purposes. It is deemed a test flight or ferry flight, with no passengers and minimal crew.  But yes, it can be done.
