Is it possible for a plane to take off with a damaged engine?
In some cases it may be necessary to fly a less-than-whole aircraft somewhere so it can be repaired.  This may require issuance of a "ferry permit" for a one-time flight to the repair station.  Under such circumstances, no passengers are allowed aboard the aircraft who don't have a specific need to be there during the ferry flight.  Since the regular performance charts (takeoff distance, climb rate, etc.) are invalid with a malfunctioning engine, aircraft engineers assist the crew in figuring out the safest weight to fly at, what speeds they should expect to reach for takeoff and how long they'll need to accelerate, the amount of runway they'll need, etc.  As a functional check flight-qualified pilot, I did this a couple of times in my military days (although not with a bum engine).  On the one hand, it's kind of nerve-wracking to know you're deliberately flying something that's broken; on the other, you know that very smart people well above your pay grade have been involved in the decision to approve the flight, and you're probably getting some really reliable data to work with regarding what to expect.
