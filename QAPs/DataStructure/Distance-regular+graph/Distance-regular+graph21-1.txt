How hard is calculus without pre calc knowledge?
I'm currently a freshman taking Calculus III over the summer; a class which, if you believe the student handbook, is a junior level class. I have never taken pre-calculus. Your question tells me that you, like many, are completely taken with a fear of math higher than basic algebra. A fear which makes about as much sense as parents not vaccinating their children because they were told it would make them autistic. I once put my calculus book on a table and a generic popped-collar frat guy said to his cohorts, "That looks fucking terrible." For reference, this is what my textbook looks like: It is blue. It has text on it. If I couldn't read I probably would've thought it was about beginner music because the integral symbol looks like the beginning of a treble clef. But because there's the word "calculus" the book becomes the goddamn Necronomicon and burns off retinas. I blame television and pop culture for equating calculus with "heinous and particularly difficult mathematics". The disgusting truth of calculus is that it is terribly, horribly simple. There is no magic to it; there is no Asian prerequisite. It's just a question of you and how motivated you are. Returning to the original question. Calculus is not particularly difficult. What you would learn in pre-calculus will almost definitely be gone over in your calculus class. On the off-chance that your professor does not pander to the lowest common denominator, there's always Google.
