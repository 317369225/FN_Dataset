A gun shoots bullets towards infinity at a constant rate for an infinite time. The speed of each bullet is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Whenever two bullets collide they disappear. What is the probability that a bullet would reach infinity?
Firstly, let us use the shorthand 'makes it' for a bullet that reaches infinity after infinite time. If a bullet makes it, then infinitely many bullets will make it (since the same situation applies taking the next bullet as the starting point). A bullet can only make it to infinity if all subsequent bullets that make it are not strictly faster (since the bullet will otherwise be caught before infinity). Let [math]s_i[/math] be the speed of the [math]i+1[/math]st bullet that makes it. Then [math]\forall i>0: s_i \leq s_0[/math]. We know* (see edit below) the probability [math]p_i[/math] of [math]s_i \leq k[/math] is [math]k[/math], so the probability of this universal is: [math]\prod_{i=1}^{\infty} s_i \leq \prod_{i=1}^{\infty}s_0[/math] The latter product is zero unless [math]s_0 = 1[/math], so any bullet which makes it has to be going at the top speed. Our countable collection of bullets on [math][0,1][/math] are sparse, and almost all possible bullet speeds are missing. So, with probability [math]1[/math] there are no bullets of speed [math]1[/math] and the probability of any bullet reaching infinity is [math]0[/math]. *Edit: Whilst we do know that [math]P(b_i \leq k) = k[/math] for the [math]i[/math]th bullet, we do not know this for the [math]i[/math]th bullet that makes it, which is a conditional probability. So this proof is not solid :-(
