How do I get my girlfriend to lose weight?
Start eating healthy foods (in particular, avoid sugary foods and carbs at night) and going to the gym multiple times a week, and casually remark to her that there are some pretty hot girls at the gym. You don't need to try and tell her to do anything directly.  Just talk cheerily about how you're feeling way better nowadays as a result of going to the gym and avoiding certain unhealthy foods, and she's going to want to do it too.  Nothing's a better endorsement of doing something than someone you like/love/respect doing something and talking positively about how good their life is.  Her natural insecurities will cause her to start sharing your meal habits (especially if you live together or spend a lot of time together - this is harder if she's just someone you go on a date with once a week) and going with you to the gym.  It'll become self-reinforcing because then it becomes something that you both do together (even if you go separately, because you can compare notes, talk about exercise, etc) and bond over. Unfortunately, this solution requires a lot of hard work on your part (i.e. eating well and exercising) so if you were looking for a low-effort solution to finesse the problem this won't work quite as well for you.
