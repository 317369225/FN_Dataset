How strong would an electromagnetic field need to be in order to deflect a .50 caliber bullet?
A constant magnetic field would do nothing to your bullet. A time-varying magnetic field creates an electric field, which would drive a current in the bullet and in turn produce an opposing magnetic field within the bullet, which would push on the bullet to slow it down. The energy in the bullet would eventually be lost as heating, due to the current being dissipated by the resistance of the metal. You'd need a row of magnets arranged alternately North South North... and to fire the bullet over the top of those magnets so that the bullet saw an oscillating magnetic field as it travelled along. NSNSNSNSNSNSNSNSNSNSN (bullet)--> SNSNSNSNSNSNSNSNSNSNS Pure lead has a resistivity of 22×10^-8 Ω.meters, so a bulk 9mm bullet (pretend it's a centimetre cubed) has a resistance of 22×10^-6 Ω. Suppose the peak magnetic field B between the gaps is 0.1 Tesla, which is about right for a neodymium magnet you can buy in a store. If we make the distance between each pair of magnets the same as the length of the bullet, about 1cm, then when the bullet is moving about 3000 ft/s ~ 1 km/s, the bullet is going past 100,000 pole pieces per second as it enters the train of magnets, e.g. the bullet sees a full cycle of the magnetic field every 2cm - the magnetic field has a frequency of ω/2π = 50kHz. The skin depth now matters, because the current will not be carried uniformly through the body of the bullet at that frequency. The skin depth is given by [math]\delta = \sqrt{\frac{2 \rho}{\omega \mu_0}}[/math] So putting the numbers in, the current is only flowing within the top 0.5mm of the bullet surface. (μ0 = 4*pi*10^-7, ρ=22*10^-8, ω=2*pi*50*10^3) So, the effective resistance seen by the current induced by the AC magnetic field is: R = ρl/A = 22e-8 * 1e-2 / ( 1e-2 * 0.5e-3) = 0.44mΩ The EMF produced in the bullet is found from Maxwell's equations [math]\frac{dV}{dx} = - \frac{dB}{dt}[/math] so if B is changing at 50kHz, and the bullet is 1cm tall, we might expect V = ωB.x = 2π.50000.(0.1).(0.01) = 314 Volts. This voltage could drive a current I = V/R = 710kA in the bullet. Depending on the geometry, this current would quickly charge up the bullet and induce a Hall voltage to cancel the EMF. It's interesting to think what would happen if the induced current could flow (e.g. if the bullet was a ring shaped projectile) NSNSNSNSNSNSNSNSNSNSN (top of bullet ring)--> SNSNSNSNSNSNSNSNSNSNS (bottom of ring)--> NSNSNSNSNSNSNSNSNSNSN The power dissipated in the bullet ring by this AC current is then [math]\langle P \rangle = \frac{VI}{2} = \frac{V^2}{2R}[/math] Putting the numbers in, I find about 100 Megawatts of dissipation (!) If the bullet initially has 20kJ, it'd slow down at a rate that would bring it to a halt in about 20cm - obviously as the bullet slows down, the frequency of the AC electric field goes down too, and therefore the damping force decreases - I think you would then fit an exponential decay of velocity to the initial speed versus time graph, and integrate - the result would be that the bullet loses 1/e of it's energy every 20cm, and would be effectively stopped (would be harmless or have less than 2 Joules) within two meters. This wouldn't quite work for stopping a regular bullet due to the Hall voltage - the charge driven inside the bullet would pile up against the faces of the bullet and would cancel the induced EMF - then the AC current is only about 30mA and the dissipation rate is 0.4 microwatts - over 1000 years to stop the bullet.
