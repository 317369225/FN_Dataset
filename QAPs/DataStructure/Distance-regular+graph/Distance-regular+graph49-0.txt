How do you find algebraically the area that a polar equation encloses?
So, let's convert the given polar form of the equation into a Cartesian one. We are given that: [math]r = 2 sin (\theta) [/math]                              (1) On the xy-plane, we can use the following relations to relate rectangular (Cartesian) and polar coordinates. a) the Pythagorean relationship : [math]r^2 = x^2 + y^2[/math] This definition for the radius really comes directly from our understanding of distance on the plane. The radius, r is related to the rectangular axes as the hypotenuse of a right triangle (see Fig. 1 below) . b) [math]sin (\theta) =\frac{y}{r} [/math] This can also be derived from a  right triangle on the xy=plane (see attached figure). The sine function for a right triangle is defined as the length of the side opposite the angle divided by the length of the hypotenuse. In our triangle on the plane, the hypotenuse is the radius itself. The opposite side is the y-coordinate of the point. Their ratio gives us the required value, [math]sin(\theta)[/math] Figure 1: Now, we are ready to go back to the given equation in (1) and work out the rectangular form of the graph. [math] r = 2 sin (\theta)   [/math]                                                                                                        [math] sin (\theta) = (\frac{y}{r}) [/math]           [math] r = 2 (\frac{y}{r})  [/math]                            [math] r^2 = 2y   [/math]                      [math] x^2 + y^2 = 2y    [/math]                            [math] x^2 + y^2 - 2y = 0   [/math]                           [math] (x)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1 [/math]   We recognize this as the equation for a circle on a Cartesian plane, with center (0, 1) and radius [math]sqrt(1)=1[/math]. For the area enclosed by the graph, we do not concern ourselves with the location of the center, but just the radius. We now know from geometry that the formula for the area of the circle is [math]A=π*r^2[/math]. From the equation above we see that [math]r=1[/math], so the area enclosed by the polar graph in the example, is π. Now the question at hand, however, is much more general. Often we use  an integral to calculate the general area enclosed by a polar curve. Specifically, if we have r=f([math]\theta[/math]) [math] \int_a^b \frac{1}{2} [f(\theta)]^2 d \theta [/math] And in fact, if we set f([math]\theta[/math])=r=[math]2sin(\theta)[/math], then we see the integral from a=0 to b=π does evaluate to ~3.1416. The reason we only integrate up to π is because the polar graph is in effect periodic with respect to that. You'll notice that r, the radius must have a positive distance associated with it. So, when the [math]sin(\theta)[/math] is negative, then we merely draw r in the opposite direction. The sine function is negative when the [math]\theta[/math]-values are greater than π and less than 2π. Likewise, as we can see from the graph of this function, as [math]\theta[/math] gets larger than π, we merely go back to zero. (Because we start drawing the graph in a negative, opposite direction). The example provided, however, does not require this integral, and we can use regular algebra to solve it.
