How hard is calculus without pre calc knowledge?
It's been said that "precalculus" is not really a subject; it's a set of algebraic tools assembled for use in calculus.  But algebra, functions, and trigonometry are all necessary to do problems in calculus. I think that one could understand the concepts of calculus (slope of a line tangent to a curve, area of a closed region, etc.,) without being fluent in precalculus, but it becomes very hard to actually compute something and be confident in your answer.  Suppose you are a student in French Literature and you have to write an essay in French on some text you studied.  Suppose also you didn't know much about the grammar or vocabulary of the language.  Yes, you could write the paper by consulting a dictionary for every word and a grammar for conjugating every verb, etc., but it's probably going to be pretty hard to say something coherent.  A student in that situation might say French Literature is a very hard course.  But the student's real problem is that he doesn't know French.
