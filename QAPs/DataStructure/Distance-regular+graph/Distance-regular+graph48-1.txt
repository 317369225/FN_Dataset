What Uniform continunity of a function gives on the graph?
From Wikipedia: In mathematics, a function f is uniformly continuous if, roughly speaking, it is possible to guarantee that f(x) and f(y) be as close to each other as we please by requiring only that x and y are sufficiently close to each other; unlike ordinary continuity, the maximum distance between f(x) and f(y) cannot depend on x and y themselves. For instance, any isometry (distance-preserving map) between metric spaces is uniformly continuous. --- I have checked that polynomic functions are uniformly continuous (x^1, x^2...) in a close interval. In short, this definition is more restrictive than regular continuity. All uniformly continuous functions are continuous in a regular sense, the opposite is not true.
