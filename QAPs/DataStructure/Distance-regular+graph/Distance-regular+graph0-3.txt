What is your favourite area of mathematics? Why?
I love so many areas of math... but if I had to choose one, I think it'd be real analysis.  For those who aren't familiar, it's basically a more formal version of calculus - where you learn exactly what a limit is, what it means for a function to be continuous or integrable, etc; more interesting topics include metric spaces & defining limits and other calculus concepts in them, things like interchange of limits and integrals, uniform convergence, etc.  My favorite parts are the ones that defy intuition - like functions whose Taylor series converge everywhere, but not to the original function, or all the ridiculously pathological cases you can have like functions which are continuous and nowhere differentiable.  I could go on for a while... but it's all a ton of mind bending fun. Also close on my list would have to be abstract algebra and graph theory.
