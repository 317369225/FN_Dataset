How can I clear Gate cse exam, how to study, what to stdy, and from where to study and how much to stdy?
first of all get the syllabus of GATE and then according to every subject collect the enough information about every subject and every topic completely don't miss any topic. more focus on basics of every topic and prepare for it.. procedure 1- collect the contents 2- revision 3- previous year questions practise time for study is 3 to 4 hours daily. If u do group study then its much better for u.
