What are some ways to "work smart" rather than just working hard?
1. Golden Rule : Don't work for work's sake. Work for result's sake and challenge everything that comes in the way. 2. Minimize context switches 2a) Prioritize. Always work by priority. If something new comes up, context switch only for a higher priority task. Otherwise just add it to the backlog and prioritize later. 2b) Identify and batch activities that are in-effective when done one by one and highly effective when batched. The Greatest example is Email. Batch email viewing once in an hour and get out of the email blackhole. 3. Do not multi task. When you do something you should only have that particular task in your mind. So have a 'simple' TODO list that will point to what's next. This is to keep your mind clear. [But remember, a TODO list must be as simple as possible]; 4. Take time to relax yourself by taking regular breaks. 5. And finally know what's coming up. Never be the guy who asks what's next only when you complete the current task. You should be knowing what you must do in the next 1 week atleast.
