Is the infrasound emitted by wind turbines harmful to humans or animals?
It doesn't matter, as another person pointed out, if a child's swing produces more infrasound. A child's swing isn't on all day. There are studies that suggest that humans who are overly sensitive to low levels of sound (any sound) will have adverse reactions from living within the close vicinity of a wind turbine or especially wind turbine farms. Low Frequency Noise, Infrasound and Wind Turbines - The Society for Wind Vigilance Pierpontâ€™s research on wind turbine infrasound vindicated Wind turbines, infrasound, and health effects There is also significant evidence that wind farm advancement in the US is based more on making money then saving the environment (see information about Somerset County, Pennsylvania). - Those who agreed to setting up wind turbines had large swaths of land cleared destroying the natural habitat. - There are many days when the wind in that area doesn't move enough. On those days, electricity has to be used to move the turbines to maintain them. The amount of energy used isn't offset by the amount of energy supposedly saved. - The cost of maintaining and repairing the turbines in that area is extreme. Winter weather is harsh there and causes damage. - Many who didn't read the fine print of their contracts found out afterward that if a blade or entire turbine falls and someone is injured or another person's property is damaged the land owner and not the wind turbine company/energy supplier is accountable.
