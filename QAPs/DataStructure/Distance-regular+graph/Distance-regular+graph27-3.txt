How does Facebook determine who is displayed as friends on the left side of the profile?
It's been a while since I saw the code, but I distinctly remember it being just a very very simple random call. This may have changed since a year ago, but I don't think so. This is actually a question I get asked really often ("is it based on who's viewed my profile?? or whose profiles I've viewed??"), and I think it's mostly because you notice when it's somebody you care about ("ugh that person is such a creeeep", or "ooh X is showing up on my box again! maybe I have a chance with them"), and you don't notice when it's just some random person.
