How much more powerful could the Roman Empire have become with a thorough understanding of modern economics and finance?
I doubt banking would have made a difference.  The technology wasn't then advanced enough for anything like the Industrial Revolution.  Which in turn depended on the earlier Scientific Revolution. Watt's Steam Engine relied on an understanding of what heat was, and that a lot of energy was wasted by the Newcomen atmospheric engine turning water to steam and back again.  But his complex solution was just about at the limits of the technology of the time and its success was doubtful until Matthew Boulton became his partner. A lot of modern banking is parasitic.  Britain and the USA haven't actually grown any faster after banking was de-regulated in the 1980s.
