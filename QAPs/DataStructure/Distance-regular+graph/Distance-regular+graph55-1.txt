How should I prepare for the SSC-CGL?
You have 9 months of time from now. So, daily 2 hours spent for general awareness from NCERT textbooks from 6th to 10th. Mainly focus on Biology,chemistry,economy and polity. And also spend extra 4 hours on weekends for english. Continue this procedure till Feb 2016. After that daily 1 hour revise the covered topics and practice maths and reasoning. If you are belongs to general category your aim is to get 130+ marks in tier-1. i.e, G.A(35), Eng(35), Maths(30+) and reasoning(35). Because of less time you can't answer more questions from maths and reasoning. All the best.
