What are some startups with really unique business models?
This is more of a different financing model and a different governance model for a 21st Century business organization. In a post to Medium I proposed financing a company with a new security I called a Profit Participation Instrument which is not debt and not equity. Here's the Medium link to that article: A New Financial Instrument — Not Debt – Not Equity Essentially the investor would be paid a specified share of adjusted gross income calculated under a specific formula for a set period of time and the investor would not have any voting rights. Upon expiration of that time period the instrument would expire. The instrument would be tradable on public markets. I suggested that this form of public financing could be used to fund a Consumer Controlled Company (CCC) in which the voting rights would only belong to the company's customers at the rate of one vote per dollar of product purchased during the 12 months previous to the vote and the customers would elect and fire the CEO. I outlined how a CCC would work in this post on Medium: A New Form Of Business Organization These structures would eliminate the Wall St. pressure for short term profits while providing an investment vehicle with the possibility of returns equal to multiples of the amount invested and would focus the company's management on making great products rather than making great short-term profits. I would like to start a discussion among professional finance people with the goal of revising these very basic ideas into something better. David Alexander writing as David Grace
