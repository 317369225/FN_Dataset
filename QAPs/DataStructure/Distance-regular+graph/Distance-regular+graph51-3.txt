How does quantum computing work?
Thanks for A2A. First I believe that the usual "complaint" about quantum computing is you cannot look at all the data because of wave function collapse. At any rate conventional computers allow you to look at any data you want any time you want! I will assume then that you meant to ask "why can all bits take on many values at once with a quantum computer, whereas for a regular computer only one value of a bit (zero or one) can be true at any time? I do not think I can explain quantum computing in a deep way in a single quora post. I could guide you to Allan Steinhardt's answer to What is a quantum computer? or two quora posts of mine on the topic or to Scott Aaronsen's site. But instead, assuming you want the gist, I will try a simple partial answer. The bits of a quantum computer are called qubits. Each such bit is in superposition of zero and 1Â  until you stop the program and measure the bit. At that point it "chooses" to be a one or a zero, depending probabilistically on all the operations that have transpired since the program began executing. It is this mysterious property that gives quantum computing insane amounts of power (if we can ever build one at scale!), but also makes them insanely difficult to use. Building a viable universal quantum computer that can surpass a classical computer would (will) be arguably the greatest feat of technical prowess in human history. No one knows if we can indeed do this or if so when we will do so.
