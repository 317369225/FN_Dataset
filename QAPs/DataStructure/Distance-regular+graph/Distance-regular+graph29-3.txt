Is it possible for a plane to take off with a damaged engine?
It is possible, and is sometimes a must. If V1 (speed at which, aircraft won't have enough runway space to abort the take off) is reached, and there is an engine failure, take off is continued, and normally the pilot will come back and land. A modern airplane is well capable of flying almost perfectly with one engine, but if one engine fails there is a chance the live one may even fail. So, the plane should land as quickly as possible. V1 is applicable to only large airplanes, small single engined airplanes will typically have no V1, and usually enough runway to stop in the case of an engine failure. Even after take off, most of the times aircraft will have runway available to idle the power and return to land immediately.
