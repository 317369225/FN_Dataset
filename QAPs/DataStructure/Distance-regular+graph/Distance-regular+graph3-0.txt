What are some startups with really unique business models?
Some of the most interesting business models are made possible by government regulation, or the lack thereof. Example 1: China P2P mortgage lending The Chinese government forces companies to require a 30% down payment on mortgages.  However, individual lenders don't have to comply with this law. Coupled with the dearth of a vibrant fixed income market in China, it's no wonder that P2P real estate lending platforms are booming in China, to the tune of $16bn per year.

Because they allowed households to buy shares in a wind turbine that reduces their own electricity bills. This may be possible in the United States as well, but I would bet that regulations make it difficult.
