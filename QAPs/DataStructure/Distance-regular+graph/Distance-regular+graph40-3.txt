Why are the stars in the Sagittarius A* region presumed to orbit a supermassive black hole and not just the barycentre of the galaxy?
There are so many misconceptions about the mysterious concept of "barycenter"! For instance, even educated folks sometimes tell you that the Sun and the planets orbit the common solar system barycenter (SSB). This is absolutely not true. What is true is that in a two-body system, the two bodies in question orbit the common barycenter. But this ends with two bodies. It is not even true for three-body systems. In the solar system, Jupiter for instance orbits the barycenter of the Sun-Jupiter two-body system, with minor perturbations from the other planets. Earth, on the other hand, orbits the Sun-Earth barycenter (which is quite distinct from the Sun-Jupiter barycenter), again with minor perturbations from the other planets. The Sun itself, yanked about by several planets, is not orbiting any particular barycenter; rather, its motion is somewhat chaotic, though loosely centered on the SSB. If we took the Sun out of the equation and turned it, say, into a loose cloud of asteroids with the same total mass, located, say, 10 AU from the SSB, neither the Earth nor Jupiter would be orbiting anything. That despite the fact that the SSB would be exactly where it is now, with the same total mass. The planets would fly straight out, through the cloud, and away, as their velocities are larger than the escape velocity of that cloud would be beyond its 10 AU radius. In the case of stars orbiting Sagittarius A*, if they are orbiting a barycenter, there has to be another object in the corresponding two-body system. The rest of the Galaxy, with all its distant stars, would only produce small perturbations, and the location of their barycenter is irrelevant. The orbit of stars orbiting Sagittarius A* must be determined by the large, nearby mass with which their respective two-body barycenters are formed.
