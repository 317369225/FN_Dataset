How strong would an electromagnetic field need to be in order to deflect a .50 caliber bullet?
I have to agree with theories here. There is no amount of technology that could deflect an objective that small, with that much speed and momentum over such a small distance especially given that the materials in question don't respond much to magnets. I would just like to provide some more information for the person who finally can produce an exact amount of energy required to deflect it. Here is a cross section of a different bullet, but that is made of the same stuff. The orange and blue and grey areas are primarily soft lead and the jacket is is the copper coating. The copper will be ripped off during flight and become a series of smaller projectiles, lethal to people, but not to the traditional targets of a .50 cal weapon. The large lead core however will tumble along the way. To add to the complexity equations, you will need to figure not one object flying, but dozens. One being the lead round and the rest copper fragments. I think that the copper fragments might have a chance of being deflected, even given that all the materials are not very responsive to magnetism. The core though would need to calculated separate. The momentum of that sort of weapon is capable of splitting men in half or piercing the armor of a tank or the wall of a building. I believe that theoretically anything can be deflected, given enough power. I just don't think that power could be produced through any rational amount of electromagnets. I don't see how it would possible given modern technology we could produce a magnet powerful enough to deflect an object that small, moving that fast over that short of a distance. I would, however, like to see someone produce how much power it would take.
