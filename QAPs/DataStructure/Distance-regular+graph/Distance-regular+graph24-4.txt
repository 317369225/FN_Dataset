What are some issues that you should know about owning a Tesla before buying one?
If you consider buying a Tesla, you consider to buy a luxury sedan in the 100K area, so first of all you need to know if you can afford such an expensive car. Next thing: You may recharge the car for free at a supercharger, but these are not meant to deliver all the energy the car needs, so you need a garage or parking lot with a high capacity a/c outlet and a wallbox, so that you can recharge the car overnight. When calculating the operation cost, count that electricity in. If you buy a Tesla not because it is fun to drive but mainly out of ecological reasons, sign a contract with a company which delivers green electricity to your home or have some solar cells and a big battery installed. Keep in mind that the solar cells won't work by night, so you have to store the energy for the rcharging at night. A tesla which is not run by green electricity is noch an ecological car. If you want to buy a Tesla in order to save money, just forget about it. This is an expensive car and it will stay expensive. Check with your local thax authorities, maybe you get some tax refunds for buying such a car. After that: if you like it - buy it.
