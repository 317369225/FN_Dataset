What are some ways to "work smart" rather than just working hard?
Working smart reminds me of the Quadrant II made popular by the book "7 habits of highly effective people". (image taken from the website http://weekplan.net) Quadrant II is about preparation, planning, automation, training of others to be able to delegate, relationship building, etc... By spending more time in the Quadrant II, you will slowly reduce the sense of urgency and crisis in your life: Working smart is about spending time on things that gives you the most leverage (small amount of time required for great returns). It could be spending the time to identify repetitive tasks in your day and try to automate them or delegate them. It could be spending time training someone so that they can do part of the work with you. Etc...
