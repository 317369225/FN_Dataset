How do I find the degree of separation between two people on Facebook? What are the ideas, algorithms, and trade-offs? How does LinkedIn, Facebook, and Yahoo implement this feature?
A known result is that any two users in facebook are separated between 6 people. Recently, I attended a talk, where the speaker quoted a result of 4 degree separation. However, I could not find it in the web.Â  What I found is this: Anatomy of Facebook where basically, they claim that the degree of separation is smaller than 6 (the result is from 2011, so I guess we can believe to the 4-degree result). About how the algorithm is implemented, I really don't know, but I am sure that it is not creating a graph and running BFS. How can you imagine to store such a huge graph in memory?
