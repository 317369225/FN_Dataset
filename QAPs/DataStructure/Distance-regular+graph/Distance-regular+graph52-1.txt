How strong would an electromagnetic field need to be in order to deflect a .50 caliber bullet?
An electric field will only affect charged particles. Since a bullet is likely to be electrically neutral, there would be no electrical force acting on it. Now, bullets have traditionally been made out of lead. Some new bullets are now being made out of materials like tungsten, and encased in plastic. None of these materials are ferrous in nature. That is, none of them are attracted/repelled by conventional magnets (ferromagnets). There is also Lorentz force to consider when dealing with moving particles in magnetic fields, but that also acts only on charged particles, and as we've already established, bullets are electrically uncharged. So in general, a typical bullet will not experience any force in an electro-magnetic field, and not deflect at all. If you want to make bullets that are susceptible to electro-magnetic fields, you will have to either artificially chargethem electrically, or make them out of another material, like iron or nickel EDIT: Brian Bi's comment below tells me that lead is actually weakly 'diamagnetic'. This takes the problem out of classical physics to quantum physics, which I don't completely understand. Brian, maybe you can add an answer about solving this problem in the quantum physics domain?
