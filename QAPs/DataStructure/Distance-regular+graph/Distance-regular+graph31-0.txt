Is the infrasound emitted by wind turbines harmful to humans or animals?
Note: fully up-to-date information on this subject is maintained here: Humans evolved with infrasound; is there any truth to health concerns about it? Summary:  the infrasound produced by wind turbines is too quiet to be heard, felt or to cause harm.  Infrasound measurements 75 meters from beaches measure higher levels of infrasound with otherwise very similar noise characteristics to wind turbines, yet hundreds of millions of coastal dwellers are not sick from it.  A child on a swing experiences infrasound at a level of around 110dB and frequency 0.5Hz.  This is much higher than wind turbines generate yet swings are not banned. People driving cars are exposed to approximately 100 dB of infrasound, yet commuting isn't being declared a significant threat to health. First, the facts: What is infrasound? Infrasound is very low-frequency sound, typically defined as being between 1-20 Hz.   It is called infrasound because it is below what human ears can normally hear.  Some differentiate 1-16 as infrasound and 16-20 as low frequency noise, as the 16-20 range can be audible at very high volumes. [4] Can humans hear infrasound? Yes, humans can 'hear' infrasound if it is loud enough. The graph lists the frequencies and dB ranges. Basically, the closer the frequency is to normally audible ranges, the lower the decibels have to be but they are still well above decibels required for audibility above the 20 Hz level.[3], [14] Can humans feel infrasound? Yes, humans can feel infrasound at volumes significantly above those where normal sound is audible, about twice the sound pressure. [3],[14] Can infrasound harm humans? Yes, some aircrews exposed to infrasound at about 130 db(G) for hundreds of hours a month in helicopters and Hercules have experienced physiological changes. This is a bit difficult to separate from airframe vibration however, and the two are often confused.  Military helicopter seats, for example, are designed to address airframe vibration, but are sometimes referred to as addressing infrasound.[5] Is Vibro-Acoustic Disease (VAD) real? Sort of.  The aircrew syndrome as described above was dubbed vibro-acoustic disease long after the initial findings.[5] There are physiological changes at lower levels of sound pressure that have been recorded for airline crews who are exposed to 83.2 dBLin (A weighting removed) sound for most of their careers.  It is worth noting, of course, that people in cars are exposed to 100.8 dBLin, yet commuters are not considered an endangered medical group.[11] The following analysis of the research on VAD is also highly telling: Of the 35 papers on VAD, 34 had a first author from a single Portuguese research group. Seventy four per cent of citations to these papers were self-citations by the group. [13]As the average level of self-citation is 7% in science, this is a strong indication that this is not taken seriously by other scientists, and the handful of researchers working on it take themselves too seriously. Can infrasound have other impacts on humans? Yes, there is some evidence that some people feel anxiety when exposed to sufficient volumes of infrasound.  The experiment masked volumes of infrasound above 85 dB(G) in loud music and assessed the reactions of the audience of 700.  Some 22% reported anxiety and other mild stress reactions.  Other physiological impacts are asserted in terms of resonance frequency of various body parts such as seeing ghosts, but these are also experienced at high-volumes of infrasound.[4] Does infrasound travel further than other sound? Yes, infrasound does propagate farther than higher-frequency sound, but it still diminishes as distance increases. Like normal sound, the louder the infrasound, the further  away it will be detectable. As a useful rule of thumb for the math-inclined, audible ranges of sound typically diminishes with cube of distance, while infrasound diminishes closer to the square of distance.[2]  Interestingly, elephants use this to communicate over longer distances and it took a while for humans to figure this out as no one could hear or feel it.[8] What emits infrasound? Virtually every piece of mechanical equipment, traffic, air conditioners, refrigerators, surf, your heart and wind.[4] Surf sounds 75 meters from the beach are about 75 dB(G), yet tens of millions of seashore dwellers do not fall ill from it, but in fact are lulled to sleep by it. [1]  A child on a swing experiences infrasound at a level of around 110dB and frequency 0.5Hz, much higher than wind turbines emit, with no ill effect and no one suggests banning swings as a result.[9] How do you detect infrasound outdoors? In order for infrasound to be heard above infrasound from wind, microphones are typically placed in holes dug in the ground.[1] Is infrasound the same as the regular slightly louder sounds caused by the blades passing the tower? No, this is regular noise that occurs a few times a second, but it is different than infrasound. It is often confused with infrasound as it occurs a couple of times a second. This is best described in the same way as your heart-rate or music, as beats per minute. How much infrasound are people exposed to daily? If they live in cities, typically they are exposed to 50-65 dB(G) of infrasound most of the time due to traffic, air conditioning, heating fans, subways and air traffic.  If they live near airports, more. Now for wind turbines: Do wind turbines emit infrasound? Yes, like virtually every other piece of moving equipment, wind turbines emit infrasound. How much infrasound do wind turbines emit? Modern wind turbines emit an average of 60-63 dB(G) next to the wind turbine.  This means that humans can't hear or feel the infrasound when they are standing next to the wind turbine.  It also means the infrasound is far below the levels at which other impacts above were noted. [1] How low is the infrasound at dwellings near wind turbines? Measurements with good methodology and approaches detected infrasound at 200 and 360 meters at less than 60 dB(G) outdoors, and showed that indoors with the windows closed infrasound was even lower. [1] Does wind energy cause unusual amounts of infrasound at dwellings?  No.  A well-structured comparative study sponsored by the South Australia Environment Protection Authority concluded that wind energy generated infrasound was below the levels experienced by urban and rural dwellers from other sources, and could not be separately identified. Organised shutdowns of the wind farms adjacent to Location 8 and Location 9 indicate that there did not appear to be any noticeable contribution from the wind farm to the G-weighted infrasound level measured at either house. Do wind turbines cause ground vibration? Yes, there are minute amounts of ground vibration. Measurements show that they are less than vibration from people walking or cars idling.  The vibration is undetectable by humans.  Very sensitive seismographs were used to record it. It's not the same as infrasound.[2] Do wind turbines cause regular beats? Yes, the blades passing the tower produce a slightly louder sound than the blade swish through the air. It's not the same as infrasound. Many people writing on the subject of wind turbine impacts make this mistake, such as the first reference in the question. Is Alec Salt -- the only researcher who seems to think this -- correct that infrasound specifically from wind turbines affects the ear at much lower levels than previously thought? [16]  Peter Seligman, PHD, DEng, and director of seven generations of cochlear implant sound processors doesn't think so. [15] The level of infrasound picked up from the body by this microphone was a major problem and far exceeded all infrasound from external sources. In fact it was some ten times greater. and Another argument that has been put up (Dr Alec Salt) is that infrasound stimulates the outer hair cells of the cochlea. These cells are said to be inhibitory and thus do not create any perceivable sensation. It is held that because wind turbine infrasound is air‐borne rather than conducted through the body, it has different effects on the auditory system and also the vestibular system. The explanation given is that these systems have not evolved to deal with air‐borne noise. Even if that is the case, the former point stands; that beyond a few hundred metres, airborne infrasound is below the level of natural and other man‐made noise. Other researchers do not appear to be replicating or citing Mr. Salt's work except in the process of debunking it.[17] It is worthy of note that Mr. Salt's work is not based on human studies, but a significant extrapolation from studies on guinea pigs.  In the absence of significant other work by others in this area, it is gross speculation that infrasound above 60 dB(G) poses a threat to humans. As has been pointed out, Salt and other researchers making these claims are taking measurements very close to wind turbines and measuring levels of low-frequency sound far above that at dwellings: Two articles (Jung and Cheung 2008 and Sugimoto et al 2008) have been cited as arguments that wind turbines generate high levels of infrasound and LFN (Salt and Hullar 2010). However, the measurements reported in those articles were made in close proximity to wind turbines and are uncharacteristic of exposure in residential buildings. Jung and Cheung (2008) measured at 10 and 98 m from a 1.5 MW turbine with levels exceeding 80 dB in the frequency range 1–10 Hz. Sugimoto et al (2008) report levels of up to 80 dB in the frequency range 1–20 Hz inside a small shed 20 m from the wind turbine. [17] From the same paper, Bolin et al rather thoroughly dismiss Salt's wildly speculative claims: Salt and Hullar (2010) hypothesized from previous research that the outer hair cells are particularly sensitive to infrasound even at levels below the threshold of perception. In their article, the last paragraph mentions that wind turbines generate high levels of infrasound, with reference to three articles, two of which are not relevant to exposure in residential environments (Jung and Cheung 2008, and Sugimoto et al 2008). No references were made to published compilations of knowledge that indicates that the infrasound to which humans are exposed to by wind turbines is moderate and not higher than what many people are exposed to daily, in the subway and buses or at the workplace (e.g. Leventhall 2007, Jakobsen 2005). It is therefore hard to see that Salt and Hullars' results are relevant for risk assessment of wind turbine noise in particular. In Australia, anti-wind advocates such as Dr. Sarah Laurie are referring to a report by The Acoustic Group Pty Ltd [19] as evidence that infrasound is dangerous to humans near wind turbines. Is this true? This is the conclusion of Steven Edwin, Principal of the firm and an acoustical consulting engineer for 34 years.  However, the data he collects does not support this.  He does not measure infrasound, but infers it from dB(A) measurements by adding 31-37 dB using a rule-of-thumb.  He then bases a conclusion of danger on Alec Salt's work, which as has been shown sounds impressive until people who know what they are talking about look at it.  The dB(A) measurements in the Cooper report, by the way, showed a peak noise in the bedroom with the window open of 33 dB(A) which is quieter than a library, much quieter than bird calls; it's slightly noisier than a quiet rural area according to industry standards.[19] As this house was likely the closest to the most wind turbines, it's hard to imagine a scenario in which very simple noise mitigations such as occasionally closing the window wouldn't have eliminated any noise annoyance. To summarize, while infrasound can cause impacts on humans when its very loud and with very prolonged exposure, wind turbines generate too little of it to have any impact near or far. The evidence remains the same: some people near wind turbines find the noise annoying, some of them find it stressful, some of them lose sleep due to stress.[6],[7] References: [1] http://www.goyder.sa.gov.au/webd...
