What is the importance of this algorithm?
It's trying to teach you graph or grid traversal. Probably not the only importance, but reading your description that's the first thing that comes to mind. Imagine instead of two words you had two cities. Nearly all cities are connected to each other by roads that go through other cities. If I wanted the shortest path from City A to City Z, which city should I go to first from A, then next, then next, etc. until I get to City Z.Â  What if I could only drive 100 miles before needing gas? Does that change the cities or the route? What about 300 miles? What if I only want cities with at least 10,000 people? The words in the dictionary or cities on a map represent valid and/or quantized values. For example, say I wanted to go from the number 3 to the number 8 on a number line in 2 steps. The easiest way might be 3 -> 5.5 -> 8.Â  What if I only want integers (only words in the dictionary, only locations where there are cities on a map). Then the answer can be 3 -> {4,5,6,7} -> 8. What if I only want numbers with curved lines, or that are even, etc.
