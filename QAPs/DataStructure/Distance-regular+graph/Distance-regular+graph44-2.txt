How does warp drive work on Star Trek?
Warp engines, powered by a deuterium-fueled matter/anti-matter reactor, generate a subspace bubble around a vessel, distorting, or “warping,” the local spacetime continuum.   This bubble then carries starships across normal space at Faster Than Light velocities without violating relativistic limitations. How does it do this? Well, imagine a moving train, and you are running on top of that moving train. You then throw a baseball, while running on top of that train. Warp drive… is nothing like that.
