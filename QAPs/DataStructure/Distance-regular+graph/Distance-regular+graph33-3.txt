How should I invest Rs 1 crore in New Delhi to earn at least Rs.40-50K per month passively?
Consider the following approach Commercial Real Estate @ 60L According the a report by La Salle Real Estate consultants, commercial properties in Tier 1 cities in India generate 9-11% in rental yield (as opposed to 3-5% in residential peoperties). My own investment is generating 9%. Please note that there is vacancy risk. If you manage to find an office or retail space for about 60L, that gives you about 45k / month, but may not be steady income due to vacancy periods. On the positI've side, both the rental income and corpus can be expected to keep up with inflation. Liquid funds @ 15L Invest 15L in a liquid fund. This will be your emergency fund as well as the amount that you can dip into during vacancy periods of your property. Balanced Funds @ 25L Invest the remaining 25L in one or more balanced equity oriented funds for long term appreciation. This is of course without knowing your circumstances and risk appetite. Enjoy your investment journey. All the best.
