Is the infrasound emitted by wind turbines harmful to humans or animals?
I don't see any clinical evidence of ELF (extremely low frequency) sound causing damage to humans.  I would like to see a longitudinal  clinical study proving that such damage is from the ELF and not from something else. This reminds me too much of the nonsense that cell phones cause brain cancer.
