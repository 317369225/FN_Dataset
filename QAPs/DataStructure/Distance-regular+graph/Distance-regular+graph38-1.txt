Why is a degree from the IGNOU discriminated?
Dear Friend, remember,  the thinnest elephant for sure is heavier than a full grown wildbeast. If some one is discriminating you just on the name of IGNOU they actually do not know what  IGNOU is. Present your answers with concrete knowledge and do not stop your studies. I do myself have IGNOU degree and I am just barely passed by 1st Division,still i believe i know much more and better than my regular courses counterparts. I have not faced any discrimination yet and have worked in State government , central government and currently employed in  a PSU. Do not loose heart, if you can score 77% in IGNOU then you deserve something bigger and better which the interviewer may not have to offer. Treat this situation as an opportunity to prove who you are and do not somebody let you down on your dreams. Best luck, cheer up and yes keep your fighting spirit ,fight hard!!
