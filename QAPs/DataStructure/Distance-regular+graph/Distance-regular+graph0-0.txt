What is your favourite area of mathematics? Why?
The area I am currently doing research in, Finite geometry. I find it fascinating because a major part of finite geometry lies at the intersection of graph theory, extremal combinatorics, group theory, field theory, linear algebra, coding theory and design theory.  I have been interested in many of these areas since I started my undergraduate studies in mathematics. For example, one of the objects that I am currently exploring, the Hall-Janko near octagon has the simple sporadic Hall–Janko group acting on it as an automorphism group, has a  distance-regular graph as its collinearity graph, gives rise to the Hall-Janko graph which can also be constructed in various intriguing ways like considering hermitian forms on projective planes, is related to the G2(4) graph which was used to show that Borsuk's conjecture is false for all dimensions greater than 64.
