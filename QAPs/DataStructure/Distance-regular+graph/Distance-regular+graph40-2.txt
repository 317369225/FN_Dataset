Why are the stars in the Sagittarius A* region presumed to orbit a supermassive black hole and not just the barycentre of the galaxy?
It is essentially their speed that points to this conclusion. Especially this one star called "S2" which has the fastest known ballistic orbit, going at a fantastic speed of "11,000,000 mph or 1.67~% of the speed of light and acceleration of about 1.5 m/s2 or almost one-sixth of Earth's surface gravity." (Wikipedia). Such speeds clearly point to the influence of an object with enormous mass. The recent estimate of that mass lies at 4.3 million solar masses. Such an object can -at this point in time- ONLY indicate the existence of a so-called black hole.
