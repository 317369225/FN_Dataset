What is time? How is time affected by gravity?
Simply put, gravity curves spacetime. Now it's very important that you think of space and time as basically one structure (think two sides of the same coin). Now go and bend that coin. It now takes slightly longer for a really tiny germ (imagination needed here) to traverse the surface of that bent coin from tip to tip as compared to an adjacent coin which isn't bent but whose tips exacty matches our bent coin. There is simply more 'ground to cover' due to the bentness of the coin. And because we said that space got elongated, so did time.
