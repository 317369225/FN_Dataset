Is it possible for a plane to take off with a damaged engine?
Yes, sometimes it it possible for a plane to take off with a damaged engine.  It's a violation of standard operating procedures, also downright stupid, to start a takeoff with a jet engine that is not running properly, registering excessively high temperatures, that has broken turbine blades, or is not producing the required thrust.  Likewise, a piston engine that is running rough, where cylinder pressures are insufficient, where electrical ignition is functioning badly, or where a propeller is unbalanced, would be reason to go back to the hangar.  A pilot always checks the aircraft engine(s) one last time before putting the aircraft on the runway and starting the takeoff. Sometimes the engine doesn't show itself faulty or damaged until the throttle is pushed forward and the takeoff run begins.  A pilot is trained to abort the takeoff if there is enough remaining runway ahead. If it's too late to abort, if there's not enough runway, if the catapult has fired, then the pilot may have to make the best of the remaining poor choices:  bail out (assuming that's possible) and let the airplane full of fuel fall where it may, hope the runway overrun area is flat and smooth and crash-fire-rescue is prompt, or get the thing in the air and keep it there for a successful recovery. If there is more than one engine, or if the one engine is turning-and-burning enough to provide sufficient airspeed, then the pilot will soon find out whether it's possible to take off with a damaged engine.  Sometimes it IS possible.
