How can the cycloid (brachistochrone curve) path be the shortest time path and not the linear one?
The Brachistochrone curve is the shortest time path for an object to travel between two points, starting from rest, under the influence of uniform downward gravity, assuming there is no friction. I will talk about the intuition for why it is something like the upside-down cycloid shape, but not go into the derivation of it. Since there is no friction, the total energy (potential + kinetic) of the object remains the same, potential simply turns into kinetic and vice versa. That means, the lower the object, the less potential energy, and the more kinetic energy. More kinetic energy = more speed. So it will travel faster the lower it is. (In fact the speed is entirely determined by the height and gravitational acceleration.) But if we take that to the extreme -- drop vertically to a very low height, go horizontally to below the destination, and then rise vertically to it -- although the middle part would be very fast, the path (including the dropping and rising parts) is unnecessarily long. The fact that the path is longer makes it not that efficient time-wise. For short time, we want both fast speed and short distance. Making the curve lower than linear makes the object move faster, but makes the path longer. There is a tradeoff. Intuitively, the optimal curve should drop below the linear path for faster travel, but curve upwards to the two points smoothly to keep it as short as possible. It makes sense the drop in height happens more at the beginning, because that leads to a longer period of faster travel later for the same amount of additional distance. The cycloid shape matches this.
