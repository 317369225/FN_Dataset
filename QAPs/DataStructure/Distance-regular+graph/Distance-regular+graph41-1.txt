How can the cycloid (brachistochrone curve) path be the shortest time path and not the linear one?
Distinction between space and time only results for the limiting case ,namely classical mechanics. That  said,Hamiltonian principle clearly states that [math]x = x(t)[/math]  represents actual motion or in other words, obeys Euler Lagrange equation ,namely [math] \frac{d}{dt}L_{\dot x}=L_x )[/math], iff [math]x(t)[/math] is critical function of the action  integral ,which is a scalar functional, namely [math]S[x] = \int_{t_o}^{t_1} L_{x,\dot x}[/math],which is  length of the graph. Critical function to (scalar) functional is what extrema (minima here) is to regular functions. Hence if [math]x = x(t)[/math] is actual motion,iff it is the least action or minimum length of the graph or shortest distance. DIY : see if there is a relation between shortest time path and degrees of freedom of the motion that traverses it.
