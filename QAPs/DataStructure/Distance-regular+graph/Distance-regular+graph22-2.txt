How can we prepare for CAT?
When you say - you want to prepare by yourself, I guess what you are saying is that you do not wish to join any classroom coaching for the CAT. However, you would still require some kind of assistance for your CAT prep - study material, Mock tests etc. That said, it is quite possible to prepare all by yourself by taking the bare minimum assistance. Step 1 Where do you stand today? You can answer that question by taking a Mock CAT without any prep. It will help you understand the gap that you need to fill. Eg: After you analyse the test yourself, you will get a sense of the extent of efforts that you need to put in. Step 2 Build basics in all the areas tested in the CAT. Depending on your current level, this could take about 3 - 5 months with about 2-3 hours of daily prep. This is the list of topics for the CAT: Quant: - Numbers : Odd/Even | Prime | Digit Based | Factors | Multiples | HCF,LCM | Cyclicity | Remainder | Base System | Factorial Based | Misc - Arithmetic : Percentages | P&L | SI/CI | Ratios | Averages | Alligation | Mixtures & Solution | Time Speed Distance | Time & Work - Algebra : Linear Equations | Quadratic Eqns | Other Eqns | Maxima/Minima | Functions | Log | Progressions | Coordinate Geometry - Geometry : Angles | Lengths | Area | Volume - Modern Math :  Set Theory | Principles of Counting | Permutations | Combinations | Distribution/Grouping | Probability Data Interpretation : Tables | Line Chart | Bar Graph | Pie Chart | Caselet based problems | Logic based DI | Combination graphs | Games & Tournaments | Data Sufficiency Logical Reasoning: Characteristics & Traits | Comparison | Groups | Sequencing | True/False | Family based puzzles | Number based LR Verbal Ability: Reading Comprehension | Grammar based questions | Vocabulary based | Verbal Reasoning - Para Jumbled, Para Completion, Para Summary, Fact Inference Judgement, Critical Reasoning Basic Assistance Required: A study material for the CAT. You could either get hold of one from your seniors or you can buy one. In any case since you require Mock Tests, it is preferable that you enroll into a correspondence program. A good correspondence program will have study material  systematically categorized into each area - you can simply start using studying from those books. Focus on learning through solving questions. The more you solve questions, the better you will get. Make a study plan. On an average spend about 5 - 6 hours per area/week : Quant, LRDI, Verbal Complement the above with topic wise tests. Make sure that you solve quite a few Level 2 questions. Post this you can enter Step 3 which would be taking Mocks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Here's a list of DON'Ts: 1. Mugging words to build your vocabulary : It doesn't help. Period! 2. Leaving out topics in Quant : I am sure you fill find some topics in Quant that were always 'well-left'. Not anymore.  3. Not focusing on other areas of life!: College, Extra curricular activities, Time Pass etc. They too are important - may be far more important than a test. You can take the test again, not your college. 4. Blindly taking up online training courses: There are many courses available. It may be too slow or too fast for your taste. Career Launcher, where I work, also have an online program. If at all you plan to choose one, please make that decision wisely. Chose a program after an assessment of what your requirement is. 5. Getting psyched out when you find people discussing shortcuts: This will happen, especially since you have decided to prepare on your own. You will find YouTube videos which have shortcuts; you will find 'experts' screaming on social media about their ability to provide 'amazing shortcuts'. Most of them are pretty useless! If you think about it, Maths is about shortcuts : for instance, Pythagoras theorem is one such shortcut. What you need is judaads. The more you solve, you will anyway figure out your own jugaads. 6. Practice without analysis : Every test you take, every question you solve : analyse: This is especially for the Verbal questions. Every single mistake you make must be thoroughly analysed. 7. Too much focus on Quant: Dont ignore other areas. Which is why you must have a study plan which incorporates all the areas. 8. Giving up: Never give up... you will have some tough times... just don't give up. The crux of the game would be self-discipline & motivation: If you can motivate yourself to prepare for the CAT consistent basis, whatever be the problem you might face you will handle it. Wishing you the best.
