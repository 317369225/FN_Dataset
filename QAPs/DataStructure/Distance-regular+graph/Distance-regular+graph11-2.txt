How do I get my girlfriend to lose weight?
To encourage anyone to lose weight, don't mention a thing, but instead: take her or him out regularly for sashimi dinners and lunches (protein-rich foods) go on long quick walks together every evening before dinner (put dinner in the oven on low and then come back to it in time... ) play games like frisbee in the park buy two jump ropes with digital handles in them, and make a bet that you can each daily increase your maximum amount of jumps without tripping the rope chart your joint jumprope and walking distance progress on graph paper reward yourselves with art or music, -- not food buy hula hoops and play with them in the living room when it is too rainy and cold outside to take a walk take a yoga class together admire one another's progress in everything undertaken create the habit of doing all this by rotating these exercises daily for 60 days eat more sashimi
