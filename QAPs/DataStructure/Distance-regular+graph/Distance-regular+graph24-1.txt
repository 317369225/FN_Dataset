What are some issues that you should know about owning a Tesla before buying one?
Choosing rear wheel driven Teslas will make rear tires wear faster. Dual motor Teslas are more efficient. It means that they drive further on the same juice. That means that 70D is much more reasonable choice over 85 (not 85D). 85 RWD should be avoided. 21" wheels are much more expensive to maintain (not only buy). They wear out much faster. They use more juice (lower range), they get more damage from bad roads. They wear out suspension faster. 19" should always be preferred. 21" might be reasonable only for insane or ludicrous modes. Owners should be ready to use smartphone with internet connection to preheat or precool vehicle on demand. Before buying Tesla buyer should check the map of Superchargers specifically the next year map and near their home. If there are no chargers in range one might consider ChaDeMo adapter to use other rapid chargers. The weakest powered Tesla is very powerful compared to regular vehicles. Autopilot is something everybody will want if they travel more than 20 minutes every day. Sunroof is not recommended in very cold climates. Regular roof is better insulator. Insurance is more expensive than regular "Prius" or "Corolla" but it will be very expensive for performance models.
