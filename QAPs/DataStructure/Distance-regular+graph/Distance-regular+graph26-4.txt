What is time? How is time affected by gravity?
Imagine a trampoline and a heavy ball kept at the centre of it. Now when you role a small ball from outside the ball will bend in its path. Here big ball is extremely heavy body (star, black hole) and the small ball is a photon (or light). Heavy bodies bends the space-time curve and causes light to bend n its path. Light and time are one and same thing. When you travel with a speed your mass increases and you bend the space-time curve. Example : If we built a train which travels with a speed close to speed of light then 1week in train would be 50 years outside the train. You see more heavy is the body more will be its gravity and more it will bend space time curve causing time dilation. Do you know ! At the horizon of a black hole time is stopped. You'll not grow any older there. Even light cannot escape from gravity of black hole Am not any expert
