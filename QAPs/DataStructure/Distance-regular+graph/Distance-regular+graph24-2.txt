What are some issues that you should know about owning a Tesla before buying one?
The jump seats in the trunk can get incredibly hot in the summer. You'll need a window tint, a collapsible shade, or a battery powered fan to make them usable on hot days. It's also a fairly new car. Minor things are not perfect. Tesla's service has been extraordinary, and fixed every issue I've had, but some small things aren't perfect. Roof rack anchor covers warped, a clip came loose in the rear left door, weird rattle in the sunroof - stuff like that. They fixed them all at no cost during service visits.
