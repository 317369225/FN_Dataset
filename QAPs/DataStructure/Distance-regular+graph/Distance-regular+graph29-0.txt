Is it possible for a plane to take off with a damaged engine?
If you damage an engine after V1 in a multi-engine plane, you go and work it out airborne. V1 is a magical speed in aviation. Among other things, this is the speed at which the decision to abort or continue has been made. Below this, the aircraft just has the ability to stop on the runway remaining. Above this, the aircraft has the ability to get airborne and climb at a certain rate, should it lose one engine. Trying to stop after reaching V1 is dangerous and should only be done if the aircraft's flying ability is seriously in question. Normally, lift-off speed is just a few knots faster than V1, but it can be very far, depending on the aircraft, runway, and load. Updated 8w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
