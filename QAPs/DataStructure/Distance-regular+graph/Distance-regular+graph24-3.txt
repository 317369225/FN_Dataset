What are some issues that you should know about owning a Tesla before buying one?
How about that 97% of current owners will buy again. Also, think about having the luxury of the equivalent of your own gas pump on the wall of your garage or equivalent. Thus you will start every day with a "full tank". Furthermore, it is the only car that gets better as it gets older. Additionally, the drivetrain is the most reliable due to very few moving parts. Thus little to no service. And should one need service they are not motivated by the need to make a profit off your problem thus the service is beyond reproach and the best. Further, many times their service is proactive and they fix things before they become bothersome. Lastly, they want to spoil you. They truly desire to make it the best car buying and ownership experience they possibly can. One more thing, you and the people who will ride in the car with you will be in the safest automobile on the planet. For these reasons and others, 97% of current owners say they will buy one again. No other company can say that. Test drive the car.
