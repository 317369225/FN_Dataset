How should I invest Rs 1 crore in New Delhi to earn at least Rs.40-50K per month passively?
We often tend to overcomplicate things. Stocks, land - forget them - They are either risky or lack liquidity for a novice. A simple Equity Mutual Fund SIP is good enough to start receiving more than 50K tax free income per month after 1 year. Since you have a lump sum amount, you will need to start via a STP (Systematic Transfer Plan). Other way is to do a simple FD. Even after paying taxes, if you get 6% returns - you will get 6% of 1,00,00,000 = 6,00,000 annually which translates to INR 50,000 per month.
