Why are the stars in the Sagittarius A* region presumed to orbit a supermassive black hole and not just the barycentre of the galaxy?
Had it been just a barycenter, then those stars would mostly experience gravity from further out in the galaxy. Their rapid orbit says that alot of mass is between them and the center.
