How do I find the degree of separation between two people on Facebook? What are the ideas, algorithms, and trade-offs? How does LinkedIn, Facebook, and Yahoo implement this feature?
You'd need to retrieve a person's friends, then the friends of those friends, and so on, until you have everyone to form a graph. You can only do this if you had unrestricted access to an API, or if you are facebook/yahoo/linkedin themselves. Then you perform a BFS on the graph, starting at the first person, and iterating until you find the second person, keeping track of the jumps until that place. This is kinda what the Dijkstra Algorithm does (also using a Priority Queue instead of a regular Queue for the BFS), finding the minimum path between two points of a graph, and in this case, the distance (or weight/cost) between a person and its immediate friends is 1 because '1 degree of separation'. For this, elements are inserted into the Priority Queue with the total traversed distance upon reaching them, and the element with the lowest total traversed distance will be in the front of the queue, so when you find the element you are looking for, it is assured that it will contain the minimum distance to it, or in this case, the 'degrees of separation'.
