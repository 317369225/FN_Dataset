What are the good ways to learn Data Structures?
I think you should start it with the book. Introduction to algorithm by Thomas H. Cormen Introduction to Algorithms This is considered as bible for its field. Don't start too slow, like giving lots of time about reading about basics data structures. GO for the implementation of data structures as soon as you come to know about it, this way you will retain the concepts for the longer time. In The starting you will have to keep patience because the speed of understanding will be slow and speed of implementing it slower, keep trying till you succeed. I have met many developers who did know bookish stuff, but if you throw one thing out of their preparation they give up.
