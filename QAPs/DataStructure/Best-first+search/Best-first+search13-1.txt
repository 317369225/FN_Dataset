What are the best xkcd comics?
Absolutely love the simplicity of this one. http://xkcd.com/221/ EDIT: After wednesday (19th Sep), one just has to include http://www.xkcd.com/1110/  (You need view the comic on the page itself. Embedding it loses the effect!) After all, it did spawn an entire Quora topic of its own: xkcd !!! Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date?
