What are 5 easy but useful algorithms in Computer Science to learn?
Here are 5 off the top of my head. I'm not saying they're absolutely the 5 most important ones. 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS): A highly useful algorithm for finding shortest paths in an unweighted graph. Can be used to answer questions like "how many connections away is person X from person Y on LinkedIn / Facebook?" or "what is the shortest number of flight connections needed to reach city X from city Y?" Dijkstra's algorithm can be seen as an extension of BFS for weighted graphs. 2. Topological Sort: Given a graph representing dependencies between tasks, topological sort gives a valid o... (more)
