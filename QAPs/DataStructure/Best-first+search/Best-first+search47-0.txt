What is the best way to perform a spiral level-order traversal of a binary tree iteratively?
Spiral level order traversal is similar to level order traversal. (Binary Tree Level Order Traversal) In level order traversal we make use of a single queue while in spiral order traversal we use two stacks. First stack('stackEven') is used to traverse the nodes at even level and second stack('stackOdd') is used to traverse the nodes at odd level. Nodes at even level are stored in 'stackEven' and are pushed in it from left to right order whereas nodes at odd level are stored in 'stackOdd' and are pushed in it from right to left order to display nodes in spiral order.
