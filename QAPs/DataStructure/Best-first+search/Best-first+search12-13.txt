What was the best Star Trek movie? What was the worst?
My favourite was First Contact, then probably the The Voyage Home (I know this gets a lot of criticism but I loved it.). I've got to agree with the post below, Into Darkness was the worst, I don't like the JJ Abdrams films but I hate Into Darknsss! 7 Views
