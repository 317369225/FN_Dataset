What is the best programming algorithm that you have ever created?
I've created an algo which computes the optimal filling of a given rectangular surface with smaller shapes.The typical problem in textile or wood industry, where you'd like to optimize the raw material and reduce the waste. Given a set of surfaces with different shapes, they have to be fitted on a bigger surface (the raw material) so that the rest is minimized. Brute force algos are O(n!) (where n is the number of shapes) and are prohibitive to compute for bigger n's. I came up with an algo based on a simple observation: if one puts all shapes in a (2d) box and shakes it, they will arrange... (more)
