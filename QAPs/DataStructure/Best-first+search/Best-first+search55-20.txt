How do I forget my ex after everything we've been through?
Originally Answered: It has been two years since I broke up with my ex. I still can't stop thinking about her. What shall I do?Here's my guess: Because your relationship with her was largely based on fantasy (I'll get shit for that from people who do online relationships, but seriously, it's not the same), you can't move on. You built up dreams about a perfect life with her with very little evidence about your actual compatibility. You're still holding on to those dreams. Let them go. Whenever you find yourself thinking about her, remind yourself that you didn't actually know whether you'd work out together in a long-term relationship. She wasn't the perfect girl for you. You haven't lost a great chance at happiness. 15.1k Views Â· 72 Upvotes
