What are some interesting startups in the education space? Why are they interesting?
AltSchool is a one year old startup which is working on a disruptive schooling model that bases itself on personalization of learning for each student and choosing the best of technology as well as teachers (not choosing between them). This is not just lip service, as they seem to be actually doing it. Great founding team. And $33m in funding from the who's who of the valley within one year of existence. Keep an eye out for this schooling model over the next couple of years. 4.6k Views Â· 17 Upvotes
