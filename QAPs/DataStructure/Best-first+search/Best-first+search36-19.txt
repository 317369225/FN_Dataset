What is the best programming algorithm that you have ever created?
I figured out a way to process real-time tick quotes from every security in every market in the world on a single server. Conventional wisdom and algorithms cannot handle this load on any real-world server, no matter the size, but with my algorithm a real world implementation at several large quote distribution companies proved out a 100x-plus performance improvement compared to traditional approaches. That’s probably the best one because it’s such a clean and neat solution and works in 100% of the use-cases. The other really cool algorithm I developed is still classified, so it will remain u...
