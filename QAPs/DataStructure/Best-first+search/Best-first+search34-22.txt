What are some of the best algorithms?
The Best Algorithms are: 1.Simplex Algorithm-used for solving linear programming problems having higher number of decision variables. 2. Djikstra's Algorithm:-Genius of the man to have devised the algorithm to devise the shortest possible sub tour based on the weights of the edges connecting the nodes. 3.AKS primality theorem:-primality testing algorithm by three IITK people Manindra Agarwal,Naresh Kayal,Nitin Saxena. 4.Duckworth Lewis Method:-continues influencing matches to a great extent on the outcome of the results. 5.Maximal flow model:designed by Fulkerson for finding the maximal flo...
