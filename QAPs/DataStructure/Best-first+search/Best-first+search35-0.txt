What are some information retrieval algorithms that you should always have a strong understanding of, and why?
Well, it depends on the context and one algorithm may not work for all the problems you are going to deal with. Some of the well known algorithms in information retrieval or search are: For Graph: Best-first Search(BFS) Algorithm: A graph algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising node in a graph. This algorithm lays the foundation for many other well known search algorithms, including but not limited to the well known, A* Search and B* Search algorithms.  See Best-first search for more info. A* Search Algorithm: Used for finding paths between nodes by employing a heuristic function. Based on "Best-first Search(BFS)", it's known for it's accuracy and speed.  For more information, see A* search algorithm. Dijkstra's algorithm: A well known algorithm that solves the shortest path problem in a graph. This algorithm is widely used in network routing protocols. For more info, see Dijkstra's algorithmFor arrays: Binary Search: a very efficient technique for finding a particular value in a sorted array . The array for this algorithm has to be sorted in ASC or DESC order. For more info, see Binary search algorithm.Some other related algorithms are maximum flow and merge sort. 402 Views · 4 Upvotes
