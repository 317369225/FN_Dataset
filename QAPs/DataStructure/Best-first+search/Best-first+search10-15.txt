What are the best travel hacks?
You can use Google Maps as a free GPS without an international data plan by making use of it's hidden offline maps feature. You can use this feature by simply zooming to a map area you want offline in the maps app and typing "ok maps" into the search box, and then this data will be available even when you don't have data connectivity. Works in both the iOS and Android apps. I also suggest "starring" places of interest since you can't search or route when offline. For routes, take screenshots of searches when you are online ( say you  have wifi at the hotel ) and use them as guides. 32.5k Views · 225 Upvotes
