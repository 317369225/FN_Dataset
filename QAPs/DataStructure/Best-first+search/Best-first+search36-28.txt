What is the best programming algorithm that you have ever created?
I had the task of rewriting the graphic line drawing code for an early graphics workstation.  What I came up with was a line drawer that could draw arbitrarily rotated and filled lines.  Midpoint in the project I realized it was actually a family of algorithms capable of transforming rectangular images into any orientation, position, and scaling, and could be embedded into another layer of itself to create dynamic animations.  It was implemented in optimized machine code with no floats, division, or even multiplication and for the simple cases was 30x faster than the C code that it was desi...
