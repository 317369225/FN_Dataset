What is the best way to learn algorithms? I want to prepare for a Google interview and I am willing to spend all of my free time learning.
Don't be like the rest of these nerds and think working at Google is like heaven. Do yourself a favor and focus on more critical aspects like business and connection gathering. People that work at Google only go for the name. You will most likely get miniscule tasks and your skillset would most likely freeze. Those months you spend studying on irrelevant fucking algorithms can be used elsewhere. Also 1 year studying means 1 year no salary. 2.3k Views Â· 4 Upvotes
