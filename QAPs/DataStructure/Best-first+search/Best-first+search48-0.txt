Is it good to train for the USA Computing Olympiad?
The USACO training website, http://train.usaco.org/ is an excellent resource for anyone who wants to become good at designing and implementing algorithms and data structures. It covers nearly a wide variety of standard algorithms: dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, depth-first search and breadth-first search, recursive brute-force search and pruning, shortest path, minimum spanning tree, network flow, Eulerian path, and probably some stuff I've missed. It also has a lot of ad hoc problems that were popular in some of the older IOIs; these require you to be more creative than simply ada... (more)
