What is the best way to learn algorithms? I want to prepare for a Google interview and I am willing to spend all of my free time learning.
If you’re looking a year ahead for an interview, you probably need to focus on enhancing your skills in a real world environment, like a JOB, rather than preparing for a particular company. If you get there and suck, what’s the point of studying for a year? You bring nothing new to Google by learning algorithms beyond standard interview questions. Google has thousands of engineers who can write complex algorithms. What sets you apart from them is what lands the job, not just code. 1k Views · 2 Upvotes
