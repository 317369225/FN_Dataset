How can solving a Rubik's Cube be framed as a graph problem?
I haven't studied the problem deeply, but just based on undergrad-level computer science, here's how you could do it: Consider a graph where: The nodes are the different possible states of a Rubik's cube There is an edge between two nodes if and only if you can get from one state to the other with a single move (You can define "single move" in different ways. The most minimal definition is probably a quarter turn in one direction of either the top or bottom, but you could include moves like half-turns, or turning the middle slice alone, without fundamentally changing the problem.) ...
