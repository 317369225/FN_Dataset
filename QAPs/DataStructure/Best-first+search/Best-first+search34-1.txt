What are some of the best algorithms?
One algorithm that is particularly important for physics (especially astrophysics) is the Barnes-Hut treecode. Typically with n-body problems you have to calculate O(n 2 )  O(n2) number of forces between particles, but with the Barnes Hut tree you can do it in O(nlogn)  O(nlog⁡n) time. This is because it splits up the grid into pieces so that you don't treat further away bodies individually but as one collective cell. Here's a visualization: You can clearly see that the cells are bigger the further you get from the origin (in this case, you would be calculating the forces on the particle at the origin, i.e. where the cel...
