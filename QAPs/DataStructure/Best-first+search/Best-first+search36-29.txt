I attacked every problem through brute force, running each possibility 10,000 times and storing the results in arrays. The first time I created a short formula that replaced 84 lines of code was the moment I felt a complete joy and awe for mathematics. It took my breath away. That tiny line of code will always be my favourite - it began a lifelong love affair with maths - the elegant and lyrica... (more)
