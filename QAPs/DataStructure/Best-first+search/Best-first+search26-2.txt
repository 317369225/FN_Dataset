What is the best way to rank your business on the first page of Google in Maps, local searches, and web search simultaneously?
Well the best way to do this simultaneously would be to create and implement a multi-level marketing strategy. The idea here is to target and improve the image and branding at the same time over all your target platforms with the same message which would create single brand image and not create any confusion. Hope this helps. 22 Views Â· 1 Upvote
