What's the best way to go about a first job search?
Choose an area of interest and ask someone successful in that field where to start, then use their name when you try a contact, then keep up the process, as you do you will find out a lot about the job and gain names you can se in interviewsâ€¦ never leave an interview without the name of a new contact. Always thank an interviewer, and never fill out an application unless asked to do so! 40 Views
