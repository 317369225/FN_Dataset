For some reason, this book is not as popular as the other algorithms books out there, but it is very well-organized. The entire set of algorithms is neatly divided into a few chapters — Graph Theory, Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming, Network flow and some other miscellaneous topics in algorithms.
