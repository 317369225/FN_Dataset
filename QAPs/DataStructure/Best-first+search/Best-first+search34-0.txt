What are some of the best algorithms?
A candidate is certainly the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor. It dates to approximately 300BC, more than two millennia before there were any mechanical (much less electronic) devices to execute algorithms. To put this in perspective, consider that negative numbers didn't gain acceptance in European mathematics until the 1700s. More recently, Dynamic programming is a general class of algorithms that continues to surprise us with its power. Many very common algorithms for problems like finding the minimum edit distance between two strings and the Viterbi algorithm... (more)
