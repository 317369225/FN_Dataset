What are the 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm problems?
1. Number theory algorithms: GCD, inverse of the number using extended euler's algorithm, fast power, prime number 2. Graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, Shortest path algorithms, all pairs shortest path 3. String pattern matching: KMP (Sometimes, it is efficient for large input size), tries 4. Segment trees: Many problems in Code chef are related to segment trees. 5. Data Structures: Array, linked list, Priority Queue using heap, unordered sets, stacks and queues, hash and binary search treeÂ  (Sometimes algorithms are based on them like palindrome check) 6. Search: Binary search, search using hash... (more)
