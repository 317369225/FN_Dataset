What are some of the best algorithms?
There is no single correct answer for this question. I am just expressing what i feel is one of the most beautiful algorithms i've ever seen. This and Dijkstra's algorithm are always the contenders of most beautiful algorithm in my heart. Strassen algorithm which does matrix multiplication, always blows my mind away. Similar to Karatsuba multiplication technique, strassen’s algorithm provides a beautiful way to reduce the number of multiplications by increasing the number of additions (since addition of two matrices is computationally easier than multiplication). Using Strassen’s algorithm... (more)
