What is the best programming algorithm that you have ever created?
I came up with a few that I can remember. The Corner-Cutting isosurface algorithm. This worked for any grid structure. Unfortunately, at the time, the Marching Cubes people were throwing their weight around. Although my algorithm produced better results for hexahedra (neatly handling the saddle and tube/cap problems), I didn't want them up my snout, so whenever the program started I cached all the hexahedral solutions rather than put them in logic. The Circle Spline algorithm. Making paths for animation uses splines, but in scientific visualization circular arcing is kind of desirable. So I... (more)
