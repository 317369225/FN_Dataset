What are the algorithms to generate a random maze that ensures there is always a path between the starting and ending point?
Your problem is essentially about obtaining a spanning tree of a grid graph. If you want to generate the mazes uniformly at random (i.e. a uniform spanning tree of a grid graph), then some approaches suggested in previous answers won't work well. For example, modifying the well known Prim's algorithm to pick a random neighbor won't give you a uniform spanning tree. There are well known algorithms for generating uniform spanning trees such as Wilson's algorithm which is basically this: Let TÂ  T be the current uniform spanning tree (initially empty). ... (more)
