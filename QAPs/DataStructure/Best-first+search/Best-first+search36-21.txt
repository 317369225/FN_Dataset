What is the best programming algorithm that you have ever created?
Not my own invention, but I extended it and provided a working reference implementation: a horizon size estimation protocol (HSEP) for the Gnutella network. This protocol makes it possible to efficiently estimate the size of the reachable shared content within a given number of hops by exchanging a small amount of data between connected nodes. I have implemented the protocol in the Gnutella client gtk-gnutella (The Graphical Unix Gnutella Client), since version 0.94. The algorithm is fairly easy, yet pretty powerful, because you obtain global information about the Gnutella network by exchan... (more)
