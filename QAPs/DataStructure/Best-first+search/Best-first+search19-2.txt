How can solving a Rubik's Cube be framed as a graph problem?
(relevant experience: cuber, software engineer, read the code for a solver once but can't find it any more) Cayley graphs are commonly used to represent Rubik's cube groups. Here is a pretty nice writeup which explains the group theory of the cube assuming very little previous knowledge: Page on Mit Pathfinding from the scrambled state straight to the solved state has an incredibly large solution space. You can simplify the problem by solving to some intermediate subgroup first, such as the group of cube positions which can be solved using only double turns. Then using only that subgroup'... (more)
