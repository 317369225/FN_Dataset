What is the best programming algorithm that you have ever created?
Given that I have been working in software performance for more than a decade it is a little embarrassing how little my job involves sophisticated algorithms. Most of the time the hard part is locating and diagnosing the problem, once you have done that the solution is normally pretty obvious. That said there is one time when I had to seriously dive into algorithms, even pulling out my text on the subject from University. I was working for a large multi-national with a half million or so staff, trying to improve the performance of the new ‘commission’ system they were developing. They had decid... (more)
