What is the best programming algorithm that you have ever created?
I've got two algorithms that I'm pretty proud of: 1) When I was at LinkedIn, I came up with a faster algorithm to find routes between members. I eventually found out this algorithm is called bi-directional breadth-first search, but I didn't know that when I came up with it. In those days, LinkedIn supported seeing profiles of people who were 4 degrees away, and doing breadth-first search out to 4 degrees took approximately O(n 4 )  O(n4) time (where 'n' was the average number of connections per user). Instead of doing a BFS out to the 4th degree, I modified our code to do a BFS out to the 2nd degree for b... (more)
