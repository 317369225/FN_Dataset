Difference between simple hill climbing and steepest hill climbing?
They're both greedy, local search algorithms, but they're greedy in different ways.  Classic hill climbing is more naïve: it takes the first step that it encounters which improves the objective function; steepest ascent hill climbing examines all possible next steps and chooses the best one.  In this way, it is analogous to the use of best-first search to traverse graphs. It is important to note that the fact that SAHC chooses the "best" next step at each iteration does not necessarily mean that it finds the global maximum.  It has the same problem of languishing in local maxima as other h...
