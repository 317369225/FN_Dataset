What's the best way to push unflattering articles off the first page of Google search results?
This is reputation management. And typically you don't "move results down," rather you position new results above them. The best practices are to use high DA properties such as Wordpress, bloggers, facebook, press releases and exact match domains to "outrank" the negative articles. Hope this helps!
