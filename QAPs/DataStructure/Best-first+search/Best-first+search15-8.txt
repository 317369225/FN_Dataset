How can one be well prepared to answer data structure/algorithm questions in interviews?
Do TopCoder, GCJ, Hacker Cup, or ACM contests. It doesn't require you to be particularly smart, but you need to be able to improvise solutions on the fly. Eventually, you'll sort of have an intuition which points you towards the correct way to solving the problem. You'll immediately sort of "know" what data structure to use, or whether its a dynamic programming problem, and you'll have to use memoization. As for your specific case? It seems like you already manage to get the solution, just not the most optimal one. When you encounter a solution that you suspect isn't the most optimal, lo... (more)
