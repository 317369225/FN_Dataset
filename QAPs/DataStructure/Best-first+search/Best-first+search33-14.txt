What are the biggest facepalm moments you have ever experienced?
A few days ago, a boy in my school(I don’t know his name) had a problem. A fiddly, high-tech problem that he couldn’t solve no matter how hard he tried: He couldn’t open his laptop case. So, like any rational person, he walked down two flights of stairs, turned left, and went to the computer technician office for technical support on how to unjam his laptop case zipper. Well, it was a technological problem. Laptop cases have technology inside them. I think someone accidently ruptured a blood vessel trying not to laugh. Facepalm. 2.6k Views · 90 Upvotes
