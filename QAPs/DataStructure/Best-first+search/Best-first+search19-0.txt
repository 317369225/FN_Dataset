How can solving a Rubik's Cube be framed as a graph problem?
We can model the Rubik’s Cube’s states as a graph where the vertices represent all the possible states of the standard Rubik’s cube (all 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 of them), and there is an edge between two vertices if you can get from one state to another with a single turn of a face of the cube. Now, we have a simple graph (commonly defined as a graph where there are not multiple edges between vertices, and no “loops”, meaning there aren’t any edges that lead to the same vertex the edge started at). To solve the cube, you start off at a given vertex (the initial state of the cube). Now, we... (more)
