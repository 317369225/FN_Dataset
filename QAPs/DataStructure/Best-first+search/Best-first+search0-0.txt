What is the difference between breadth first search and best first search in artificial intelligence?
These are the two search strategies which are quite Under Construction breadth first search a node is expanded according to the cost function of the parent node. In best first search we expand the nodes in accordance with the evaluation function.This can be understood by the given example. Suppose we are at two intermediate nodes N1 & N2.The cost function of N1 is less than that of http://N2.So the breadth first search will definitely expand N1.Now suppose somehow we have the knowledge about the cost required from reaching goal node from N1 and N2.If the sum of the costs of reaching N1 from Start node and the cost of reaching goal from N1 is more than that of the sum of the costs of reaching N2 from Start node and the cost of reaching goal from N2 , then we should expand N2 and not N1.This expansion is done in Best first search 321 Views Â· 2 Upvotes
