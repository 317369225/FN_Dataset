What is the best programming algorithm that you have ever created?
Best depends on perspective. Dynamically compressing and decompressing bitmap/framebuffer local subsections enabled relatively high performance high resolution Postscript and other page description renderings in relatively small amounts of RAM and was a big deal, back when RAM was a more significant portion of total product costs. Even more recently, it continues to improve performance by reducing memory thrashing. Optimizing compressions was tedious, though.. While not terribly elegant, this may have been my most economically impactful innovation. On the other hand, one I found more elegant ... (more)
