What will be the best place to embed a video in an article with multiple pages, in the first page or in the last page? Will it affect search engine listing?
You can embed the video in the first page. Even if you embed in the last page, Itâ€™s no problem as long as you use a attribute like page=1, page=2 etc. on the urls. 38 Views
