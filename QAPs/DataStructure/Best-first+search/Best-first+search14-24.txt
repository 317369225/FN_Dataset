What is the best way to learn algorithms? I want to prepare for a Google interview and I am willing to spend all of my free time learning.
Sorry to say but you are not the only one, there are uncountable one’s like you who can sacrifice much more than an year of their time for it. It’s good that you will prepare for algorithms for one whole year, but being bookish will not help, you have to apply your knowledge somewhere. It’s better that you make some good projects using fancy data structures and algorithms, or try competitive programming to nourish your knowledge. Also, you should have a try on some fields of computer science like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, IOT, App development, etc. 1.5k Views · 4 Upvotes
