What are the 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm problems?
1. Evaluating mathematical expressions, this can be warm up and will let you know that problems are not easy to solve nor very tough to solve. Example input will be a mathematical expression like: (A+B*C-D*(A-C)+A) and A=2, B=3, C=7,D=8, output will be the value of the expression at the given input point. Â 2. DFS and BFS, I believe graph is the most general model in computer science and problem solving, you need to have a good traversal algorithm. 3. Longest common subsequence. To understand dynamic programming, this will also make you learn divide and conquer. As Dynamic programming = Divi... (more)
