What is the best way to learn algorithms? I want to prepare for a Google interview and I am willing to spend all of my free time learning.
This really depends on how much foundation you have already had in algorithm. If you start with nothing, I’d start by taking an introduction class in algorithm. You need have a theoretical foundation in algorithm. I’ll then read and practice questions in Crack The Code Interviews. I’ll practices tech questions on Leetcode. 549 Views · 2 Upvotes · Answer requested by Ali Reda
