What are the biggest facepalm moments you have ever experienced?
This was around the time The Martian released, last year. I was having lunch with some friends at a public place, while some other people were having lunch on a different table, discussing the movie. Guy 1: Dude, have you seen The Martian? Guy 2: Haven't had the chance yet. How is it? Guy 1: You should definitely watch it. The best part is, it's based on a true story! Needless to say, I haven't come across a more facepalm-worthy incident yet. Keep in mind that these are grown men probably working somewhere, and not some teenagers. 18.8k Views Â· 519 Upvotes
