While I am still working to launch my product, a similar company has launched and beat me to market. And now is the first to market in my space. What should I do?
First to market doesn't mean you should throw the towel. There's abundance everywhere. Learn from your competitors' mistakes and great ideas. There's always room for many. Pivot. Read the 'Blue Ocean Strategy. Don't become a commodity. Make a better and different product. Use crowdfunding whenever you can. In many phrase. It forces you to make a product people actually want and will pay for. It forces you to engage with your customers. Let them help you design your product. Don't donit alone. Ask your customers. This way you're also lowering your risk. You're pre-selling :-) 167 Views
