What is the best programming algorithm that you have ever created?
I shaved off a check for every operation in the standard GJK algorithm. For those who don't know, it is an algorithm to check for collision between two convex objects. It calculates the Minkowski difference(just subtract all points from one another) between two objects and then sees if the origin lies within that difference. Â I looked at the algorithm and found that there was something intuitively wrong in it. Somehow, the spaces overlapped in such a way, that one of the checks was completely unnecessary. I had just a hunch but wanted to be completely sure. So, wrote down an elaborate ma... (more)
