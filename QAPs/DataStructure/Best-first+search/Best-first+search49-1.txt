What are some real-life examples of Breadth and Depth First Search?
*The post How BFS is used in GPS navigation was originally posted on HackerEarth Blog * There are differences in the route which I usually take and the one which GPS shows as the shortest, probably due to the algorithms used. I learned from my graph theory data structure classes that Breadth-first search is used in GPS and digital maps. I tried looking for the possible use of Algorithms (Breadth First Search real life application or A* application) used in GPS on the web, but I couldn’t find a lot of details. So here is how BFS is used in GPS Let’s first understand how GPS sees maps. Digital m... (more)
