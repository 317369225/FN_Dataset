What is the best way to learn algorithms? I want to prepare for a Google interview and I am willing to spend all of my free time learning.
I LOVE your enthusiasm but I want you to think about this: You’re going to spend the rest of your live researching / writing algorithms. Please, do yourself a favor and take this time to branch out. Put yourself in a new situation. Talk to new people and do your best to understand them. Travel somewhere new, put in on a credit card if you have to. These experiences will enrich your life AND your future work life. To reiterate: Devote time to researching your self Devote time to researching your career Best of luck in both, I’m sure you’ll do great. 1.6k Views
