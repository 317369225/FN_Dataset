What was the best Star Trek movie? What was the worst?
For me, the best  is Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. Was directed by Leonard Nimoy. Has an innovative and amusing story, some very funny dialogue, and plenty of humor. It does not try to take itself too seriously. Cannot say about the worst... I wasn't very fond of Star Trek III: Search for Spock. I did not like the plot, the replacement of "Mr." Saavik. My suspension of disbelief was stretched beyond its limits by the creation of an entire planet in minutes from a single device. 410 Views · 1 Upvote
