What is the best programming algorithm that you have ever created?
I donâ€™t know if anyone had used this algorithm before I did, but I believe, this is one of the best algorithms I have created during my career as a competitive programmer. The problem is to find strongly connected components in a graph. This is a well-known problem, but I was using approach, not listed in the wikipedia. My algorithm was to find strongly connected components by using disjoint-set data structure: // Representative of a disjoint subset. int Representative(const int node) { if (parent[node] != node) parent[node] = Representative(parent[node]); return parent[node]; }...
