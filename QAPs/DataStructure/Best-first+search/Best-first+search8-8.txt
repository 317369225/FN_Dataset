What are the 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm problems?
1. Dynamic programming. It can solve lots of practical scenarios. When we use it in reinforcement learning, it can save the value of each state in each step. 2.Greedy. Most of the time it will give you the optimal answer, but be careful with some problems like coin changes. 3.Dijkstra. I didn't implement it that much, but I used to implement it in building optimal query trees. 4.Trees. Again, they are most popularly used algorithms. Just a simple example, when you want to develop an input method app for your own language, you might want to build an alphabetic tree at first. ... (more)
