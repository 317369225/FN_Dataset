What are some of the best algorithms?
Hard to believe there is no mention of the "Particle Swarm Optimization" Algorithm. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a population based stochastic  optimization technique developed by Dr. Eberhart and Dr. Kennedy in  1995, inspired by the social behavior of birds and fish.The algorithm is very  simple but powerful. PSO can be used as a training method for  artificial neural networks or to minimize/maximize other high  dimensional functions. To understand the algorithm, it is best to imagine a swarm of birds that  are searching for food in a defined area - there is only one piece of  fo... (more)
