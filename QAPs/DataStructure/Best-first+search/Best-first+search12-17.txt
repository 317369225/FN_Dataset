What was the best Star Trek movie? What was the worst?
I'm probably going to be mainstream because Wrath of Khan was an awesome movie because it brought back a good villain in a plausible way. Worst...hmmm...I think the new ones are so divergent from the Roddenberry vision I would say they aren't Star Trek in the least. They elevate what sells for young people: lack of clothing, risque, anti-authoritarianism, big explosions. Worst that I've seen was Final Frontier. 516 Views Â· 1 Upvote
