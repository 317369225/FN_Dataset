Where can I find large datasets open to the public?
I did a blog post about open data a long time ago (http://bret.appspot.com/entry/we...), and ReadWriteWeb did a nice roundup based on all the comments from the blog post: http://www.readwriteweb.com/arch.... Since that post, there have been a lot more comments on the blog (105 and counting), so you may want to comb the comments for any ones the RWW post missed. Thank you for your feedback!
