What are some of the best algorithms?
This is necessarily just an aesthetic question, as Vignesh Venkat. I like the stackless pointer-munging mark-and-sweep for garbage collection, which essentially makes a dynamic spanning tree of a graph. I do not know what it is called. Maybe someone can tell me the name. A stack-using recursive mark-and-sweep is pretty obvious, of course. One of my earliest CS profs just mentioned that it was possible to do it without a stack, so I worked it out. It's fully generalizable, but for simplicity, let's assume a primitive LISP memory model, where everything is a binary tree consisting of dotted... (more)
