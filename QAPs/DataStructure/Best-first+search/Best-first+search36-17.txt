What is the best programming algorithm that you have ever created?
At Dolphin, we had hardware that could read and write single words of remote memory very efficiently, and transfer large blocks even more efficiently - what would later be called RDMA but this was 1996.  I was writing a network driver, part of which (running on the sender) would allocate a receiver buffer from a fixed-size pool using the single-word read/write and then use the more efficient RDMA to do the transfer.  My challenge was to let all of the buffers "flow" to a single busy sender if there was no contention, but also divide them (at least somewhat) fairly among multiple senders at ...
