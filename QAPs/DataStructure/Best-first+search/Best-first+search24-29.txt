What are some of the best ways to start a conversation with a girl?
Originally Answered: How can I start a conversation with a girl online? You said it, the answer lies in just starting and not thinking about it. Text her the same way you’d text one of your male friends. This will ensure that you don’t come across as needy. Imagine being a millionaire and people knowing about it. You would immediately recognize if someone is talking to you only to get access to your riches. Be yourself and just start a conversation without thinking what might happen. If she responds, great. If not, does it really matter that much with over 3 billion women on earth to start another conversation with? Patrick Pechmann - Dating And Relationship Advice For Men 151 Views
