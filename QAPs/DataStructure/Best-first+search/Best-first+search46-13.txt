What are some reputable companies that provide SEO services for e-commerce retailers?
There are many. I remember when I started mine, I hired not one but two companies one after another. They failed to provide what I hoped for. I still paid them. Thanks to my friend I came across Michael Words. This is the best company I have ever hired. I have been doing business with them from many years now.
