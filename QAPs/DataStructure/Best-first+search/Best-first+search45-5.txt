What are the best responses for a startup who is told "Someone else is already doing X"?
Best response: "Thanks, I will definitely look at those guys too" - ask for what they think needs to be improved at the X product. Most market leaders did something better than the guys before them. But investors won't know unless you prove them wrong. Get an amazing traction first and then let the market judge - not the investor. :) 448 Views Â· 3 Upvotes
