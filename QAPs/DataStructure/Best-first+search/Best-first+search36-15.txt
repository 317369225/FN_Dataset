What is the best programming algorithm that you have ever created?
I wouldn’t necessarily count it as a programming algorithm since it can be implemented in digital hardware, software or even I suppose in analog if you’re sadistic enough. The algorithm is related to MIMO and Beamforming in communications. Communications has the problem that it is very difficult to combat the problem of access to shared medium (often termed multiple access). There are many schemes. One scheme, TDMA, gives time slots to different transmitters therefore guaranteeing there will be no collisions. Another, caled CMDA, uses convolutional codes, where each transmitter transmits by...
