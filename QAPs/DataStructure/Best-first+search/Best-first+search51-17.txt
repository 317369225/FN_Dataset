What are the top 10 algorithms every software engineer should know by heart?
To be a competent software engineer I think understanding the principles of data structures, fundamental algorithms, and asymptotic time and space complexity are very important. I've been a systems level software designer/developer for more than 30 years and these things continue to be my guiding principles. In my own experience, mastery takes years and years of solving various computing problems, experimentation by trying different structures/algorithms, and especially by learning to apply your own variations to common patterns. Personally, I would never reduce this to the "10 that you must... (more)
