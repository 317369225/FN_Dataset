What is the best programming algorithm that you have ever created?
This is not my algorithm, but something my student Michael Otte came up with: It allows randomized path planning algorithms to be super-linearly sped up on multi-core machines, that is 10 cores are not 10 times, but 20, 30 or 50 times faster. Here is how it works: when looking for a shortest path using a random planner, and once a path from start to goal is found, there is no shorter path outside of the ellipsoid that can be created by using a rubber band of the current best length between start and goal as constraint for a pen. Sharing this ellipsoid with anybody else who also works on ... (more)
