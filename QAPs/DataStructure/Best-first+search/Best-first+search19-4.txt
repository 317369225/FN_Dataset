How can solving a Rubik's Cube be framed as a graph problem?
The graph modeling of the problem is the following: 1- Nodes are the states of the cube. 2- There is an edge between any two nodes x and y. If you can go from x to y or from y to x in one single move. Then you can get the shortest path between the current state and the initial state to the final state using any known shortest path algorithm. 1.6k Views Â· 2 Upvotes
