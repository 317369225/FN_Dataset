What are some of the best algorithms?
The class of divide and conquer (origin: latin from 'divide et impera' used in the context of imperial wars and battle strategy of dividing and conquering the enemy) algorithms are easy and intuitive to understand but are equally important and harder to think about. Binary search, merge sort are a couple of algorithms that fall in this category. The remarkable thing about this technique is that it introduces a logarithmic factor in the complexity of the algorithms instead of a linear, quadratic or polynomial factor. To understand this better, consider, an algorithm like insertion sort tha... (more)
