What's the best way to push unflattering articles off the first page of Google search results?
Google only has 10 results on 1 page (although varies some times), so if you do not want a result to show up, you need to push another page to rank for that keyword.  Give Google good reason to rank other pieces of content to rank better for that keyword(s). It all comes down to producing good content to get ranked for that keyword. 804 Views · 1 Upvote
