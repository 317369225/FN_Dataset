What's the best way to push unflattering articles off the first page of Google search results?
You can create blogging profiles on websites like Wordpress, Blogger, weebly, Tumblr etc to push down articles related searches. You can publish  fresh and unique content on these blogging sites, do not forget to add those negative search terms into the content. This thing will help those blog posts to come up on search results with that negative  search phrase. Along with these, you can use social media profiles to share your content. 307 Views · 1 Upvote
