What is the best way to learn algorithms? I want to prepare for a Google interview and I am willing to spend all of my free time learning.
Efficiently: how you can do it fast. Effectiveness: whether you should even do it. Chasing the Google job might be chasing the gold pot at the end of the rainbow, and at the end you find that there is no gold. I interviewed with Google before. The interviewer didn’t know things that I knew. They were just holding a piece of paper with perfect answers, trying to get your “intelligence” to see if you have a close to perfect answer in 20 minutes. If I am proud to be a human being in my life, “preparing and catering” to the Google interview and working for Google, will not be one thing that I am proud of. 48 Views
