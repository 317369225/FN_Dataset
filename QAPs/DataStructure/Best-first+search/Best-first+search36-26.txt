What is the best programming algorithm that you have ever created?
I wrote a balancing algorithm that was used for about 60,000 users across a Remote Desktop farm to route them evenly to each machine in the farm and also route them back to the previous machine they connected to. This avoided using a central user repository of any sort as 99% of primary visits were routed to their primary choice. This was done using the gas of each machine + username. if the primary (ordered by hash) was unavailable they would fall to the secondary machine. Very simple. Very scalable and very effective. We detected a 10% imbalance and simply changed the heading algorithmic. 128 Views Â· 1 Upvote
