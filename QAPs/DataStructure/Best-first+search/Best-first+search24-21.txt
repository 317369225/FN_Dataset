What are some of the best ways to start a conversation with a girl?
Originally Answered: How do I start a conversation with a beautiful girl?Build up the courage obviously. Think of what you'll really stand to gain and lose from this conversation. You may very well gain a new friend or companion, whereas this girl you don't know yet. If you talk to her, you really can't stand to lose anything, and her ignoring you really isn't the end of the world, because really nothing has changed. You have nothing to lose. You can smile, comment on her clothing, point out that it's funny you see each other every day and don't know each other, etc. Just strike up conversation, as long as it isn't creepy or anything, you're solid. Good luck! 6.5k Views Â· 8 Upvotes
