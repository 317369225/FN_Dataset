What are the algorithms to generate a random maze that ensures there is always a path between the starting and ending point?
There are a lot of different algorithms. The simplest ones are just different kinds of randomized graph traversalsâ€”think searching but with a random element thrown in. A graph traversal like this can be used to generate a perfect maze. Perfect is a technical term that means that there is exactly one path between any two parts of the maze and there are no loops or fully enclosed areas. Here's an example of such a maze: I actually wrote a tool to generate mazes like this in JavaScript: Mazes | jelv.is. It's fun to play with! The code is up on GitHub where you can experiment with it, follow ... (more)
