What are some of the best algorithms?
After twenty years of software development, I find the "Bresenham" algorithm to be the most versatile and powerful program.   Things like data structures, linked lists, etc. are often discussed in CS studies and are readily understood.  But it's the Bresenham that is rarely discussed in CS undergraduate and graduate studies, yet it is immensely powerful and useful throughout a software engineer's career.    The Bresenham algorithm provides a simple and variable clock-like mechanism that can be used in thousands of different computing problems from 1 to n-dimensional spaces.  For example, B...
