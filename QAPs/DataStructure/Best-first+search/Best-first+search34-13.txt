How to find the maximal matching substring of two strings in O(n) ? Suffix Trees: Suffix tree Given a string, add all suffixes of this string into a trie and you have a suffix tree. Once you have a suffix tree, some things which seem impossible in O(n) like finding maximal matching substring of two strings becomes possible. Suffix trees are awesome but a trivial construction is O(n^2). However the good part is that it can be constructed in O(n) - however I still don't understand how they do that - it's fairly non-trivial. Trivia: Suffix Tree was named the as Algorithm of the Year 1973 by... (more)
