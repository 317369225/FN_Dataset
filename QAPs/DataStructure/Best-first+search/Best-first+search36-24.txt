What is the best programming algorithm that you have ever created?
I have an interesting yarn to add. In 1972 (!) I was an undergraduate, and had a side job helping a biochem lab solve nonlinear binding rate equations— for acetylcholine and its receptor. I had been using nonlinear methods for steepest descent on the mainframe of the time, an IBM 370, but the latest equations didn’t converge, and time on the big guy was expensive. I had access to this new-fangled thing called a minicomputer— a PDP-8. I could use it overnight and on weekends, so I had lots of computing time. Now, that machine would be blown away by your Fitbit. It did less than a million inst... (more)
