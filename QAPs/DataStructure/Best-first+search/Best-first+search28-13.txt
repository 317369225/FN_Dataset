What are some interesting startups in the education space? Why are they interesting?
I work at PrepMe so +1 for www.prepme.com We have a personalization engine that figures out an optimal learning path for each student and re-asses each student as they move through a course. EduFire is great, Lily and Jon are awesome people. CarrotSticks is a great app but Dan and Pete have some new stuff they're working on outside education at this point. 2.4k Views Â· 5 Upvotes
