Java (programming language):Â Is this method for inserting a new node into a binary search tree correct?
Few things I think can be done here-: when root is null then just add new node and return by that you don't need else block. Why use 2 different pointers? parent = current is been done in both if and else block, which looks like duplicate code. I tried putting my changes here.. Let me know if it meets your needs.. public static void insert(int key){Node newNode = new Node(key);                if(root == null)                {                    root = newNode;                    return;                }                Node current = root;                while(true)                {                                   if(current.key < key )                    {                        if(current.right == null)                        {                            current.right = newNode;                            return;                        }                    current = current.right;                }                else                {                    if (current.left == null)                     {                        current.left = newNode;                        return;                    }                     current = current.left;                }            }  }
