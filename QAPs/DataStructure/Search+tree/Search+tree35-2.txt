Can a tree be a Binary Search Tree if more than one nodes have the same value?
It doesn't make sense if you are implementing it for a symbol table purpose, where every value has a key. For other purposes, you could do the following Method 1 Just do it the same way you would build a normal BST. For any node, where  element_val is being inserted, if(node.val < element_val){  /* Recursively insert in the right sub tree */}else{ /* Recursively insert in the left sub tree *//* In this case, element_val is either equal to or smaller than node.val */} When you search for an element, you do the same thing. However, this does increase the complexity of search because you will have to search all the 5's. Method 2 Alternatively, you could also have a linked list of values at each node.
