How can you find successors and predecessors in a binary search tree in order?
A fairly simple piece of code for finding inorder successor is here: Inorder successor of a node in a binary tree. Above code doesn't use any parent pointer. It works for any Binary Tree and NOT just for Binary Search Tree. If you use the property of BST, it can be further simplified. Predecessor follows similar logic.
