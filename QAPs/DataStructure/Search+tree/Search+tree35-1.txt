Can a tree be a Binary Search Tree if more than one nodes have the same value?
As Gayle Laakmann McDowell mentioned , it depends on how you implement it. It just changes the computational time of searching of desired value. If you want to know that how many values matches the desired search value. Implementing a binary search tree with duplicate nodes will cost you more time to search in the tree. Instead of that you can use an increment pointer, so whenever you insert a value which is already present in the tree, it will just increment its value. There is no need to implement the BST with duplicate value but it is good for practice purpose. You can implement anyway that makes you feel better. 1 - left < cur < right 2 - left <= cur < right 3 - left < cur <= right 4 - left <= cur <= right. But 4 can lead you to searching whole tree.
