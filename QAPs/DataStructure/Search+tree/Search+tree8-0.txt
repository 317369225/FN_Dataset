Why isn't a ternary search tree as popular as a binary search tree?
Although we feel that ternary trees should be faster as they are logarithmic to base 3 instead of base 2, they aren't usually. We have to always do more comparisons per level as compared to a binary tree. So the difference is not too high. Examples of relative magnitude are given in the link below. Apart from that, the implementation is much more difficult for a ternary tree as compared to a binary tree. Think about how much work balancing such a tree would require.
