How can you find successors and predecessors in a binary search tree in order?
I have added a blog post where i use successor and predecessor of a node in BST. Successor: Basic idea is that whenever we take a left turn in BST at a node, that node is candidate forÂ  successor. Predecessor: Whenever we take right turn a node, that node is candidate for the predecessor. Once we reach the node and it has left sub tree, right most node of in left sub tree would be in-order predecessor. For code please refer to Binary tree property: two numbers which have sum equal to given number
