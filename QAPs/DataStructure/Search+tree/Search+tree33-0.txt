What is the difference between a AVL tree and a binary search tree?
An AVL tree is itself a binary search tree wherein the canonical insert operation is modified so that at the conclusion of every insert operation, the tree is kept in balance. A binary search tree is simply a binary tree where, for each node, its left subtree contains only nodes with lesser values and its right subtree contains only nodes with greater values. That's it. Now, imagine if you construct such a binary search tree, starting with a root with the value 1. Now, all subsequent values you insert are sorted and increasing. What will you have? Not very tree like, right? An AVL tree construction ensures the balance of the tree at every insert operation. In all other respects, it's still a binary search tree.
