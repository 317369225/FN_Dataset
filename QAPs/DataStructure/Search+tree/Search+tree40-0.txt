Is Binary Index Tree and Binary Search Tree one and the same thing?
No,Binary search trees are for searching of a node by its key and updating by key. Binary search tree allows for insertion and updating of a node in O(lg(n)) time average and O(n) worst time. Whereas Binary Indexed Trees allow for range queries i.e sum of elements from node i to node j in a given array and updating a particular node or range of nodes by their index.For m queries of both types the worst case time complexity is O(m*lg(n)).
