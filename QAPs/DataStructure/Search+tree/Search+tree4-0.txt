What are some practical applications of binary search trees?
Binary trees are a good way to express arithmetic expressions. The leaves are operands and the other nodes are operators. The left and right sub-trees of an operator node represent sub-expressions that must be evaluated before applying the operator at the root of the sub-tree. See Expression Trees for more details. BST used in Unix kernels for managing a set of virtual memory areas (VMAs). Each VMA represents a section of memory in a Unix process. VMAs vary in size from 4KB to 1GB. Also want to support range queries to determine which VMAs overlap a given range. Reference Each IP packet sent by an Internet host is stamped with a 16-bit id that must be unique for that source-destination pair. Linux kernel uses an AVL tree(height balanced) indexed by IP address. Hashing would be faster, but want to avoid attacker sending IP packets with worst-case inputs.
