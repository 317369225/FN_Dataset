Can a binary search tree contain negative numbers?
A binary search tree can contain any elements belonging to the same totally ordered set.  In other words, you can line up the elements from least to greatest (with some elements possibly being equal). This doesn't limit it to positive whole numbers, or even numbers.  For example, it's not uncommon to put strings in a binary search tree (ordered alphabetically). Things you cannot put in a binary search tree are elements that can't be ordered in such a way.  For example, shapes or colors would be difficult to put in a straight line.  I mean, is green greater than blue? is an awkward question to ask, but we can certainly say that 3 > -1.
