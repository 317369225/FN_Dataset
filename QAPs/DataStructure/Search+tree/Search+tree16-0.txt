What is the difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree?
A binary tree is a tree where each node can have zero, one or, at most, two child nodes.Â  Each node is identified by a key or id. A binary search tree is a binary tree which nodes are sorted following a single rule: all the nodes on the left sub tree of a node have a key with less value than the node, while all the nodes on the right sub tree have higher value. This allows for very fast retrieval of elements stored in the tree, as each node key comparison allows discarding half of the tree. This is called binary search.
