It took me nearly 3 weeks to understand what a binary search tree is, am I stupid?
The only belief you should have is if you do not to ever want to know an answer, to a question, then it might be 'too stupid'. Binary Search Tree is not child's play. In fact, it is one of the more complex operations elements in computer processing. If you really want to hit a brick wall that has been slowly begun to crumble, try human robotics computing like Advanced Step In Innovative Mobility (ASIMO), the work of a team spanning over 15 years and is considered an early pioneer in human robotics. I think you will find that the journey in computer science can take you anywhere you want. Everything and anything can appear stupid. Clearly, small 'steps' prove it is possible to achieve just about anything. The good news is you did solve what a binary search tree is. Keep going.
