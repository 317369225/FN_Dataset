Java (programming language): Is this method for inserting a new node into a binary search tree correct?
I'm not enthused about your while(True) loop.  I'd prefer while(current!=null), but then you'd need a little finesse for the add-left vs. add-right case when you fall out of the loop.   From there, the null root case can probably be less of a special case.   Which doesn't make your code as it is wrong. Binary Trees may give you some ideas of how to do it better.   They don't have the while loop at all, using recursion instead. Any reason for you to be shy about recursion when dealing with as recursive a structure as trees?
