Can a tree be a Binary Search Tree if more than one nodes have the same value?
The answer depends more on the "search" part of the question. A binary tree can have the constraint of left <= root <= right. And it is straightforward if uniqueness is not a factor. However, the sorted order ( got from in order traversal )may or may not be in-place, depending on implementation choice.
