Which is the best sitcom: the Big Bang Theory, HIMYM or Friends?
Being a TV show enthusiast I feel I can do proper justice to this question. All three shows are sitcoms (Situational comedy). Usually sitcoms are episodic with maybe a slight background story running. The examples could be Two and a half men, Two broke girls, Modern Family, Family guy, The Simpsons and many more. The big bang theory comes under this category as well. Although it is a very high rated show, it does not engross you to keep watching it. You miss a couple of episodes, resume again, you probably won't even feel anything different. How I met your mother has an ongoing story but I felt it was too stretched out at the end. They probably should have ended after season 6. Because I felt that they completely lost the humor factor that they had after season 6 and it became more like a romcom(Romantic comedy). So I guess you know by now who my vote goes to. F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Friends was perfect. It started beautifully. Carried on an amazing plot with brilliant comedy for all 10 seasons. Never lost its touch at any point during the whole series. And ended perfectly. Apart from the sarcastic humor, the puns, ironies, the dry humor, one liners and many more types of comedy, the show portrayed parts of different genres in themselves. There was romance, drama, tragedy(light), philosophy and also Slice if life. If you haven't seen F.R.I.E.N.D S. yet, you are in for one hell of an experience of your life. Start watching it NOW. P.S. : Thank you for the upvotes. You guys are awesome. A special thanks to Sarjak Thakkar for the promotion! :D Updated 37w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
