Can anyone support or refute the 9/11 Truthers' claims that three successful airplane attacks required accuracy and skills far above those possessed by student pilots and unlikely even for experienced pilots?
Like every 9/11 question, you're only going to get morons copy and pasting other morons with more popular blogs than them. I'm not a pilot myself, but I go to a school that specializes in aeronautics and pilot training. Probably 80% of my close friends are professional pilots already, on their way to becoming professional pilots, or holders of personal pilot licenses. Any pilot that isn't trying to sell you something (like they have some key to some massive conspiracy) and will actually stick to facts will tell you that the hardest part of flying is the landing, followed by the takeoff. There's a reason that your first several "hands-on" lessons with an instructor (which I have been physically present for when my best friend was learning to fly) are simply watching the instructor taking off, letting him get into a good holding position, then taking over and flying straight until it's time for him to take back over and begin the landing approach/landing. And that's literally all the terrorists did. They hijacked the planes after they were already at cruising altitude. Literally all they had to do was point the nose at their target. And their targets (at least the main ones) were two of the largest buildings in New York City. You could get enough experience to do that in Microsoft Flight Sim. Saying that an experienced pilot would be unlikely to pull off something like 9/11 would be like saying a professional driver would be unlikely to be able to steer a car down a slightly curved road. If you think that, you're delusional or a moron, period.
