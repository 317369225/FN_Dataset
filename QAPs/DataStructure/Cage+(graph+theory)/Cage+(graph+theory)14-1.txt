Why do vegans eat mock meat looking foods?
Most countries and cultures have a rich culinary heritage, and it's something vegans and vegetarians like to participate in as well. People have been cooking for so long, they've found a lot of the best ways to eat food (as a patty, on a bun, on a stick, etc) that there's no reason for us to reinvent the wheel. It also makes it easier for omnivores to shop for us, since while veggie burgers aren't necessarily the healthiest, it's easier for someone to buy them for a cookout than grilling you some asparagus. So it's often the kindest option if you're a houseguest and don't want to put your host out, or they are lost at sea as to what you eat. Fake meat is recognizable. Â  Honestly, many people seem to understand me eating veggie burgers more than my eating lots of veggies (the usual how does that fill you up, doesn't that taste bland, where does your X come from, etc), especially if they don't eat a lot of veggies themselves.
