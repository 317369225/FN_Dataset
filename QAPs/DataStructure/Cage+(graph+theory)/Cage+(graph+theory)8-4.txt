How can I teach myself to play the acoustic guitar?
I taught myself four chords (C-Em-F-G7) and got used to playing them -- moving my fingers on my left hand without looking; practicing different strums and finger picking with my right. Seemed like those were the only chords I would ever use! But then I got the best advice, pick up a music book with songs I knew and liked. I taught my son the same chord progression. But with today's technology, he went to YouTube and viewed many videos to practice with.Â  He's turned into a mighty good player! Good luck.
