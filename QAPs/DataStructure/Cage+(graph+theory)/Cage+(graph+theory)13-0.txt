What are the necessary elements for effective game mechanics?
Approaching game design by analyzing mechanics is like approaching architecture by analyzing wood and bricks. Mechanics are just the raw materials. Much more important is the user-response to the assembled whole. Focus on human motivation, analyze the things that make existing games entertaining. Once you have a specific human response in mind, then consider what structures could be built to support that objective, and what other designers have done to achieve that response in the past.
