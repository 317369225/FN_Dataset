Being an immortal god, why didn't Shiva swallow the poison?
A great question. It looks very counter intuitive, right? Given Lord Shiva is all powerful and immortal, he could have just digested the poison instead of holding it in the throat and earning the fancy name "Nilkantha". Now legend has it that when Shiva was drinking it, Goddess Parvati, his wife, became anxious about the deadly nature of the poison and pressed his throat by her hands thus stopping it right there. But again this sounds weird - both of them were Gods and they knew each other's powers. The real answer is much deeper and significant. Shiva and Parvati's relationship is an epitome of an ideal marriage, and their lives is a perfect example of a life of a householder. Lord Vishnu and Goddess Laxmi's style is to take incarnations - as Rama, Sita, Krishna, etc - to teach humans essence of Dharma, friendship, etc, but not for Shiva and Parvati. This particular incident provides a perfect example of mutual respect, trust and dharma towards the society. Shiva agrees to "sacrifice" himself because it was dharma to save the world. Parvati selflessly supports his decision, but finds a means to "save" him. He could have mockingly dismissed her action of putting her hand because he knew the poison wouldn't affect him, but he respected his wife's actions. This is how a relationship should be - each person complimenting and supporting other such that their collective result is for the betterment of the society. One important thing to note is that dharma and karma are not just for humans, but for nature and Gods too. They lead by examples. Shiva and Parvati lives also teach us how we can we live a life of yogi while still performing our regular duties. In fact, all gender related issues today can be resolved if we all realize the essence of their form called Ardhanarishvara which reflects the equality between the two genders. Thanks Ankit for the A2A :)
