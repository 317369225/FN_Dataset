What in the scvngr list of game mechanics are actually game mechanics?
Game mechanics are the constructs that allow players to progress towards their goals; they are the actions that players take in order to progress within the game. Bernard Suits said that a game is a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles. Games aren't like real-life; they are constrained in many ways. Game mechanics represent the exception to these constraints; they are what you can do as a player in order to reach the win-state.  It tends to be in the juxtaposition of several mechanics that we find a good game experience. For example, in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, you could ‘run’ and ‘jump’ – two mechanics. But certain puzzles required that you mastered both running and jumping together – the only way to overcome certain obstacles was to master the ‘running jump’, a third mechanic which emerges from combining two other mechanics.  It could be argued both ways on many of those mechanics listed - for example number 1, achievement, could be seen as a method to progress in a game. But on its own, it's not enough. And it's so generic as to be meaningless. 'Real-time' could well be considered a core mechanic, but it doesn't make a game on its own. That playbook is kinda like the episode of South Park where they parody Family Guy writers. Take any 3 in combination and you've made yourself a game... 'Its a meta game, with urgent optimism and an epic meaning'. I think it could be a source of inspiration at some point down the line, but it's not a playbook of mechanics by my reckoning.
