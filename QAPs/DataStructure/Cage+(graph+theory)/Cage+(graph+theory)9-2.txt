What are the best books on game design fundamentals?
I have read a bunch of the books mentioned below and I would agree that these are foundational: Raph Koster, A Theory of Fun Jesse Schell, The Art of Game Design Eric Zimmerman & Katie Salen, Rules of Play I would add Bernie De Koven's The Well-Played Game as a book that should be in every game designer's toolkit. But if I were to read another game design book right now it would be the Richard Garfield's Characteristics of Games which I hear a lot of good things about. A book that is even more foundational but not directly applied game design is Miguel Sicart's Play Matters.
