Being an immortal god, why didn't Shiva swallow the poison?
Leela. You are asking why he held it up in his neck instead of swallowing? But why stop at that? You could very well ask, Why even drink? Why even poison in the first place? Why even churn the cosmos?If God is omnipotent, can't he just wish it all in a wink? Leela,  God is experiencing the world and the world experiencing God, through us, in us, as us and amidst us. Why did Rama sorrow thus, on losing Sita, is he not God? Why did Krishna agree to be bound hand and foot, by his mother? Why does Siva, not swallow the Aaalakaala? Why does Uma, arrest it in his throat? In this experiencing/leela, the God does not exempt himself and stand apart. She participates at all levels.  And plays by the rules of karma, as well. And sometimes other unrealized Gods in us, recognize such acts of the realized ones and worship them, as something to be aspired for.
