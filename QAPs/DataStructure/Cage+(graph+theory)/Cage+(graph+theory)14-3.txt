Why do vegans eat mock meat looking foods?
Part of the reason is cultural, since people are raised eating certain foods and become accustomed to them and the methods of their preparation. It is not unreasonable then for somebody who makes changes to their diet to continue to employ certain forms and methods of food preparation after eliminating an ingredient for dietary or ethical reasons. It may seem like this would make it difficult for people in certain cultures to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet, but in fact the way people eat today and the amount of meat consumed is in fact something that is a product of the last fifty years and the rise of factory farming of animals for meat consumption on a giant scale. To make food into the shape of a patty or burger is pretty inherent in the production of any food item that is being pressed down on a pan or flat cooking surface to ensure it is cooked throughout. You have different patties made out of vegetables and starches in many cultures throughout the world, so I think it is a stretch to say that this is a 'meat looking food.' In the process of becoming part of a dish or meal most meat loses any resemblance to being a product that was once a part of a living animal (with some notable exceptions being bone-on foods and a roast suckling pig spinning on a spit). I'll eat a sandwich with just some olive tapenade and veggies on them as well, without adding a slices of something on them just like a meat eater will eat a meatless (and nutritionally questionable) 'chip butty' in England. People who eat sandwiches want something that can be held in the hand, eaten on the go and contains a source of protein, carbohydrates and some greens for flavor and texture. If I put a patty made of lentils, some slices of tempeh or some brand name 'Deli Slice' on it I am not looking for a meat-like experience, I just want to have a quick bite to eat with a source of protein.
