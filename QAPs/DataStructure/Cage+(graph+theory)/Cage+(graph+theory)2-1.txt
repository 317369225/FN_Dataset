What are some ideas for a research project/paper on number theory/computer science/mathematics?
I would suggest looking at combinatorial game theory.  CGT is the theory of two-person perfect-information games like Chess or Go.  Although these games are perfectly solvable in the theoretical sense, they are practically very hard.  CGT tries to develop ways to divide games into subgames in such a way as to make a solution feasible. The classic example of CGT is Nim, but there are many other toy games that have been analyzed.   This is a field which is relatively new but still accessible to somebody without a ton of mathematical background, like other "recreational mathematics."  An ambitious high-school project could analyze a simple game (even one you make up), or try to use computer search to explore a game further than has already been done.  (A friend of mine in college did this with Domineering.) Even without doing original research, combinatorial games are an interesting field and one I think you would enjoy studying.  Although there is no direct tie to number theory, the class of Games forms a superset of the normal numbers and includes many interesting objects such as infinitesimals and "infinite" numbers.
