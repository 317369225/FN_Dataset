What are some not too mainstream but interesting and active research areas in mathematics that require (relatively) little background knowledge to reach the "on-going research level"?
One way to find such areas is to look at what NSF REU programs are focusing on. These are undergraduate research programs, so all of the topics should be accessible to somebody with three years of undergraduate study under their belt. It is, of course, possible that some of the problems are poorly chosen, but if you look at the programs that have been successful in the past, you should find some good areas. For instance, any of the areas listed at SMALL 2015 Projects (e.g. hyperbolic knots, arithmetic combinatorics, combinatorial geometry) should have some reasonable problems. Granted, undergraduate research isn't like the research that professional mathematicians do. But mathematicians tend to have extensive background knowledge, so I don't imagine that any answer to the question will escape this caveat.
