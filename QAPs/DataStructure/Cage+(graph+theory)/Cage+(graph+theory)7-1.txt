Being an immortal god, why didn't Shiva swallow the poison?
One way of wrongly interpreting Immortality is Deathless. I believe Shiva is Immortal but not deathless. Accordingly to Siva Purana, One day of Brahma has 14 Indras; his lifetime has 54,000 Indras. One day of Vishnu is the lifetime of Brahma. The lifetime of Vishnu is one day of Siva. In my opinion Shiva through a Mahadev (God of God), he is also a being with finite lifetime (which is incomparible to a human's lifetime) so which doesn't makes him vulnerable to Poison. I think all these Indra, Brahmas and Vishnus are like cells, blood and flesh inside him and our galaxy is like one nucleus for one of these cell. No wonder we say Servam Shiva Mayam (God is everywhere)and the universe is infinite. Ultimately sacrificing himself is like killing these beings within him. This is purely my opinion and I am not an Atheist. Updated 54w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
