What in the scvngr list of game mechanics are actually game mechanics?
Out of the entire list, none come across as obvious game mechanics (instead I would say it is a mixed list of 'features' and meaningless buzzwords). A game mechanic is basically a system rule - to be a complete mechanic there needs to be a cause and effect. None of the terms on this list imply anything specific enough to be considered a mechanic. The following, are most likely to turn out to be game mechanics, given more detail: 8. Chain Schedules (I'm guessing this means one event triggers another) 12. Countdown (this just needs specification of what causes the countdown and what happens when the time runs out) 18. Extinction (sounds like a condition causes a resource to run out) 24. Lottery (assuming unlimited multiple-entry, limited winners chosen at random) 40. Shell Game (if taken literally) 46. Viral Game Mechanics (more of a category for known 'standard' mechanics in the social games space) For a more detailed explanation of game mechanics: What is a Game Mechanic?
