What are the necessary elements for effective game mechanics?
Design by definition brings such things in to play that you can not approach it like an engineering problem. Yes, you can benefit from the engineering perspective but it won't take you to the final step, especially where motivation is the case. So, as Tony advised, you should put a more human centric approach here which means that start designing from the needs or wants of user not from the items/parts you have in your hand. That way, the whole you want to get in the end will be valued much more than the sum of its parts. After this theoretical "mambo jambo" (!) I will suggest you to a mashup for gamification design that I use. First, try to determine the motivation sources of your players/users by using Yu Kai Chou's Octalysis framework and then use Kevin Werbach's D6 to better detail your design. Octalysis will help you to shape the Dynamics of your design and D6 will take care of the Mechanics and Elements.
