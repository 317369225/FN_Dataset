What is the significance of the projective plane in mathematics?
Anurag Bishnoi's answer explains why finite projective planes are important, so I'll restrict my answer to the real projective plane. The main reason is that they simplify plane geometry in many ways. Conic sections Take the conic sections for example.   There are ellipses, hyperbolas, and parabolas.  They were originally defined by the ancient Greek geometers as the intersections of various planes and circular cones.  Ever since Apollonius, geometers have used double cones rather than single ones. Kepler, and others no doubt, noticed that the parabola was a limit of both hyperbolas and ellipses.  He used what we can call a principle of continuity.  (This was a couple centuries before the formal definitions of limits and continuity were made.) When you cut a cone with a plane parallel to one of the straight lines in the cone, you get a parabola.                             Images from Lane Vosbury's Conic Sections                                           at Seminole State College But if you cut a cone with a plane that cuts across the cone, you'll get an ellipse. As you tilt the plane up so that it becomes parallel to a line in the cone, the ellipse lengthens and becomes the parabola. If you cut the double cone with a plane that cuts across both parts of the cone, you'll get a hyperbola. Again, as you tilt the plane back so that it becomes parallel to a line in the cone, the ellipse lengthens and becomes the parabola. Alternatively, you can leave plane alone and tilt the cone instead.  When you do that, it's easier to see how an ellipse morphs into a parabola and then into a hyperbola. Girard Desargues (1591–1661) had the idea that these were all the same curve if you took the plane to include points at infinity.  As you morph an ellipse into a parabola, there's one point that was in the ellipse but no longer in the parabola.  That point is moved off into a point at infinity.  Parabolas have one point at infinity.  Desargues' big revelation was that there's not just one point at infinity, but a whole line of points at infinity, one point for each direction.  By studying the hyperbola, he could see that it had two points at infinity, even though it appears that the two curves that make up they hyperbola have four ends.  The two curves that come close to one of the hyperbola's asymptotes both approach the same point at infinity.  In fact, the straight line which is that asymptote approaches that same point at both ends. So, add one line of points at infinity to the standard Euclidean plane, and assert that as you go off in one direction, or in the diametrically opposed direction, you approach one of those points.  What results is the real projective plane. In the real projective plane, all conic sections are the same.  What I mean by that is analogous to the the statement that in the Euclidean plane, all lines are the same; you can perform a rigid motion of the Euclidean plane to move any line to any other line.  In the projective plane, all conic sections are the same; you can perform a projective motion of the projective plane to move any conic section to any other conic section. That's one way that projective planes simplify geometry. Duality In the Euclidean plane, any two lines either meet or are parallel. In the projective plane, any two lines meet in exactly one point.  If the two were parallel in the Euclidean plane, they'll meet at the one point on the line at infinity for that direction of parallel lines. This makes things so much simpler in projective plane geometry.  Not only do two points determine a unique line, but two lines determine a unique point.  In fact, every theorem for projective plane geometry has a dual theorem which is found by exchanging lines for points. An example, there's Pascal's theorem.  It's easy to state in projective geometry.                                       From the wiki on Pascal's theorem It says if you have a conic section ABCDEF (drawn as a circle since all conic sections are projectively the same as circles) and take the three intersections of the opposite sides, meaning where AB intersects DE, BC intersects EF, and CD intersects FA (those are the three points M, P, and N in the digram), those three intersections are collinear. It's harder to state Pascal's theorem in Euclidean geometry since special cases have to be made whenever there are a pair of parallel lines. The theorem dual to Pascal's theorem is Brianchon's theorem.                                  From Xah Lee's  Conic Sections Brianchon's theorem says that if you take six lines tangent to a conic section at ABCDEF, then the lines joining the three opposite intersections are coincident. Algebraic geometry Algebraic geometry is the study of algebraic curves, surfaces, and higher dimensional varieties.  An algebraic curve in the xy-plane is given by a polynomial equation in two variables x and y. We've just seen how the quadratic curves simplify if you take the projective plane instead of the Euclidean plane.  Higher degree curves are also easier to study using the projective plane. In order to treat the projective plane algebraically, you add a third variable z, and homogenize all the equations.  A polynomial equation is homogeneous if all its terms have the same degree.  For example,  [math]2x^3+4xy+y=10[/math]  is a cubic equation that is not homogeneous; it has terms of degree 3, 2, 1, and 0.  If you multiply those terms by powers of z to bring them all up to degree 3, you've made it homogeneous.  This one becomes  [math]2x^3+4xyz+yz^2=10z^3.[/math] The projective plane uses homogeneous coordinates.  Each point in the plane is named by a triple of numbers, such as [4,2,18], but different triples in the same proportion name the same point.  Thus [6,3,27] names the same point as [4,2,18]. A homogeneous equation in x, y, and z describes a curve in the projective equation since if one triple satisfies the equation, any other triple proportional to it will, too. See what happens when we start with the equation of this hyperbola: [math]x^2-y^2=1.[/math]  Make it homogeneous to get  [math]x^2-y^2=z^2.[/math]  Some solutions to for it are [5,4,3], which names one point, and [13,12, 5].  We can get back the original hyperbola in the Euclidean plane  if we set z to 1.  But if you take  [math]x^2-y^2=z^2[/math]  and set x to 1, we get the equation  [math]y^2+z^2=1[/math]  which is the equation of a circle.  In fact, the equation  [math]x^2-y^2=z^2[/math]  is the equation of a cone in Euclidean space, the very cone that the ancient Greek geometers studied.  Setting various nontrivial linear combinations of x, y, and z to 0 corresponds to intersecting that cone with various planes.
