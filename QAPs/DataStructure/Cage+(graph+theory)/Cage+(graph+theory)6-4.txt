Why do most women wear the wrong size bra? What are the harms of doing this?
It is very, very difficult to find bras that fit. When you find a brand or style that does, you buy as many as you can, but eventually the company changes styles and fabrics and stops making the ones that fit you and you are stuck again. Or you gain weight or lose weight. You get pregnant and nothing is the same size ever again. You can go to Paris and have custom made bras for $600 apiece but that is a very expensive choice. Ever try to find a 32DDD off the rack? So to speak. Don't get me started! Oh, the harm is that an ill fitting bra hurts your back and shoulders and leaves marks in the tight spots.
