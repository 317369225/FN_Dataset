How can I teach myself to play the acoustic guitar?
Well the first thing you'll wanna do is learn some common chords (campfire chords). You can find them here: http://hubguitar.com/fretboard/c... Hundreds of songs use those basic chords. It'll take some practice to switch between them smoothly but that should only take a few weeks at most. After you've mastered those chords, I would check out some videos online that teach you more complex songs and chords. I would suggest watching Marty Schwartz's videos on YouTube. He's made so many tutorials teaching you how to play so many songs and he makes it super easy. Not only will you be learning more songs, you'll be learning more chords and techniques as well that you can apply to many different things. With that being said, the advice I've given you is really an alternative. The best way to learn from scratch, is to probably hire an instructor so you should definitely think about it.
