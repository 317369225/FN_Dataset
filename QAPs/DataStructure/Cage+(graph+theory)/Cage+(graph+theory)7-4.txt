Being an immortal god, why didn't Shiva swallow the poison?
One day of Brahma has  14 Indras; his lifetime has 54,000 Indras. One day of Vishnu is the  lifetime of Brahma. The lifetime of Vishnu is one day of Shiva (which is also the reason why Brahma is called the god of birth, Vishnu, the keeper and Shiva, the preserver and the last one who could destroy the entirety). Also, it's not a measure of "deathlessness" but these indras which represent that he although could had swallowed the poison, 'Shakti' (Devi, Parvati, Kali, or consider any other women) with her energy (love and care) stopped the poison (effect of the ruthlessness and the harm) to the throat (a middle gateway to let not consume nor expel it to the society) since she was worried (a responsibility). This depicts how man and a women are given equality and hence also depicts the role and respect for each other a man and women should have. She therefore stopped the poison at the throat which is the reason Shiva due to excess of poison in his throat, his entire throat turned 'blue' and this avatar is called 'Neelkantha'. A man's responsibility is to take anything which is wrong and avoid it to get spread to nature (which is basically "Shakti") and a women's responsibility (Shakti) is to take care of the man and support him in every step of life.
