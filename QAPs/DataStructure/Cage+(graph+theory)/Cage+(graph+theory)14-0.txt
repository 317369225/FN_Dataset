Why do vegans eat mock meat looking foods?
Because not all people who are vegan made the switch based on whether or not they find meat, eggs, or milk "tasty". Most have made the decision for ethical reasons, followed by health and environmental reasons. Just because they've chosen to lead a conscious lifestyle doesn't mean they can't enjoy a scoop of coconut milk ice cream or a veggie buffalo wing. Some choose not to eat these mock products because they feel they taste too much like actual meat (I have found a handful of products that taste nothing like their animal equivalent, as well as many that are expert on mimicking flavour and texture). For those people, the thought of consuming flesh or other animal products is not a pleasant one.
