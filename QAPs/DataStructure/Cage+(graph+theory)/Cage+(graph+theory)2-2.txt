What are some ideas for a research project/paper on number theory/computer science/mathematics?
A2A The best way to master either Number Theory and/or Computer Science is to find a mentor that will help you negative through the literature that will culminate into a project that will lead to a paper. Number theory and Computer Science are not mutually exclusive since Number Theory is a subfield of Computer Science, see Mathematical foundations in Outline of Computer science. Lecture 4: Number Theory I in Mathematics for Computer Science would be a good starting place.
