What are the best books on game design fundamentals?
My top 3: The Art of Game Design by Jesse Schell. This is a huge and diverse resource for thinking about game design. Designing Virtual Worlds by Richard Bartle, which is focussed more on MMOs but still with some great general principles. A Theory of Fun by Raph Koster: a good examination of what might make something fun, taking a journey through board games as well as computer games. Updated 271w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
