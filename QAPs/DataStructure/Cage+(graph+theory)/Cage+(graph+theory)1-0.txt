What are some not too mainstream but interesting and active research areas in mathematics that require (relatively) little background knowledge to reach the "on-going research level"?
Finite Geometry, Spectral Graph Theory, Extremal Combinatorics, Design Theory, Coding Theory, seem to fit your description, broadly. Of course, not all research problems in these areas can be understood or attacked with (relatively) little background, but there are many interesting ones which can. Here are some surveys at research level on some of these topics: Open problems in finite projective spaces Current Research Topics in Galois Geometry Problems in Algebraic Combinatorics Dynamic Cage Survey the polynomial method in arithmetic combinatorics, incidence combinatorics, and number theory Combinatorial Nullstellensatz Updated 48w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
