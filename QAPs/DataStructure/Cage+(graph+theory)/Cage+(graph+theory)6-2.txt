Why do most women wear the wrong size bra? What are the harms of doing this?
No, most women are NOT aware that they are wearing the wrong size bra, because they have never felt a correctly fitted bra. The obvious signs of the bra being the wrong size don't feel like being the wrong size... they just feel like "uncomfortable in general" or back aches that don't seem related to the bra, or headaches, or other physical signs. I thought for years I was a 32C. It seemed to fit well enough. But it turns out I'm a 28F or G. Those are not carried in normal stores; I'd never tried one on before. Cheap bras tend to have stretchier bands, which means that a 32 band can feel approximately right in the store (it goes around me without too much extra, reasonably comfortable, etc.) whereas now that I know better, I know that a band should not be stretchy and it should be firm around me in the store with no extra at all. A stretchy band quickly stretches out; a non-stretchy band stays firmer longer. Most women think that bras should support the breasts primarily through the shoulder straps, whereas a properly fitted bra should barely use the shoulder straps. Even I, with my relatively large size, should be able to wear a strapless bra... most women's band sizes are too loose to consider that, relying instead on the straps. That puts pressure on the woman's shoulders, which is uncomfortable but difficult to attribute to a poorly-fitted bra... you just feel tired and achy by the end of the day. So the next time you buy a bra, you buy the same kind, and have the same problems, and still don't know that it's the fault of the bra.
