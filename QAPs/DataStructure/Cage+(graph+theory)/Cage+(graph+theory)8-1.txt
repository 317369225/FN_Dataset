How can I teach myself to play the acoustic guitar?
Yes many people did that, myself included. It's a long, slow road, though, especially in the days before easily available lessons on YouTube and the web. I was a pretty crappy student in general, though, and not much inclined to listen to anyone, so that's how it was.
