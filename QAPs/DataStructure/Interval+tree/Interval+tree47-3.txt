What's an efficient algorithm for finding free sub intervals when given a list of intervals and a list of occupied sub intervals?problem: given a list of intervals A (start1, end1, start2, end2...startN, endN) and a list B of subsets of those intervals(start1', end1', ...startN', endN') find the list C of subsets of A that don't overlap with B. The intersection of A and B need not be empty and all numbers in each list are integers.
