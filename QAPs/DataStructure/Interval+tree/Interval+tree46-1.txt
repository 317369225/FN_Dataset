What are different ways I can enhance my knowledge, skills, build my personality (1st year at MAIT), so I can secure a good job. What are some books and coding competitions that can help me in building my skills?
These are pretty narrow goals. Its as if FB/Google will always be an epoch. A better question would be what can I do to solve this problem or that problem. As you keep on solving problems you automatically become qualified to be employeed in great companies, if you choose to do so. You are currently just starting, and I dont know if its just me, but, seeing you aim for microsoft's internship is just disappointing. The name should not be driving you as of now- it should rather be something like, I want to work in a search engine because of so and so and... That should be the kind of things you should be targetting. Regarding the other questions, I am not too sure of compt programming, I guess the other answers cover that well. For skill building I would suggest solve real problems, make real projects, make a github account and participate in open source. Read about basics well, practise your share of toy problems and coding katas. Other than that read about industrial practises. If you want to explore more areas than norm, read some maths, machine learning etc. Books in particular: SICP, Javascript the good parts, Cormen (justify your efforts), Programming pearls, Beautiful code, C++ by bruce eckel, TDD by examples. I can fill in more depending on your interests. (These books are in no particular order) All the best.
