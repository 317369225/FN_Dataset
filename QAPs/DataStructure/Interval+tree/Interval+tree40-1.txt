What is the best algorithm to find the maximum number of 2D points (from a given set) an axis-aligned rectangle of a given size can enclose?(size of rectangle a,b, number of points n, and the x,y coordinates of n points are given)
First of you can solve it in one-dimensional case using modified interval tree. In this tree you will save the following information in each node: 1) How many points will a interval of given length cover if it starts at the right end of the node's interval. 2) Maximum of 1) of all sub nodes. You can update this structure in O(log n) time each time you add a point. This leads to a solution in O(N log N) case in 1-D case (worse than optimal), but in 2-D case you can create 2-level tree. In which nodes contains subtrees for the other axis and a node in the tree inside a node contains the following information: 1) How many points will a box of given size cover if it's top edge is specified as the right end of this node's interval and right edge is specified by the parent's node's interval. This leads to a solution O(n log^2 n)
