What types of technical questions are asked in developer interviews?
Technical Interviews generally occur at 3 different levels. When you are just out of college (Under grad), at that time its very rare that you are selected for any particular team. Sometimes even the role is not specified while you are being interviewed. However that can be negotiated after you have been selected in the interviews. In such interviews the focus is mostly on generic algorithmic questions. The aim is to test your problem solving aptitude When you have some year work or you are passing out of masters then you are generally recruited for a particular team/role in the organization. In these interviews there is a mix of algorithmic and your expertise specific questions. The third level is when you have worked in the industry for the last 8-9 years. There your experience and your resume speaks more than any technical interview that you give. There the questions generally asked for to find out how well you would gel in with the company's work culture.As I am just out of college and have been selected in Google through my campus interviews I am best suited to discuss about the first category. Most of the selection process has two levels. A written round and a set of one-to-one interviews.
