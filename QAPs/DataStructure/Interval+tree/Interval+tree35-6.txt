From candidate side e.g. the way CV (resume) was presented, the way the candidate carried the technical/non-technical discussion ) (Algorithms/Coding is the most common one) (Algorithms) e.g. Sorting Approaches,Searching Approaches,Brute-Force Approach,Greedy Approaches,Task Scheduling Algorithm,Huffman Codes,Longest Common Subsequence,Naïve String Matching,Rabin-Karp Algorithm,NP-Completeness Algorithms,Red-Black Trees,B-Trees,Graph Traversals,Hash Tables and much more... (Coding) e.g. Partition The Array Of Balls,Adding Two N-Bit Binary Integers,Trie Data Structure To Store Words,Algorithm To Do Wild Card String Matching,Compress String,Convert A BST Into A Linked List,N-Ary Tree,Graph’s Breadth First Traversal,Shuffling A Deck Of Cards and much more...
