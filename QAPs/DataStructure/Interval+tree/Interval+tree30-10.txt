What should I expect in a Software Engineer interview at Google and how should I prepare?
Hi, I recently appeared( and cleared ) an interview to Google(SWE) position. And I asked the same question you asked. The first thing to understand it that, you might be a great match to their profile -- you might know more about their products and technology, but with my experience I have come to know that all that matters is that you are `smart`. To judge that, companies have tactically used rigorous Algorithm tests as interviews. The jist is -- you might be awesome, but you need to clear a rather stiff algorithm test to get through. If you are a fresher then it matters all the more. I religiously followed Algorithms by Cormen, perhaps the best treatise on introductory techniques. I would suggest you to go through the core topics: Sorting Graph Algo. Dynamic Programming Red-Black Trees and Application Hashing Note that, just reading them is not enough -- you should thorough yourself with all questions in between and most importantly at the back. Once you are done with the book, you'll find that about 50% of interview questions are just sub parts ( typically the tough subparts :P ) of very standard Cormen problem sets. It helped me clear the interviews, hope it helps you :)!
