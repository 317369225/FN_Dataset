Can someone be expected to code interval trees in an interview with a big tech company?Insert, update, query operations for interval/segment trees are pretty difficult to code. Would you be expected to code it in a interview with companies like Palantir or Facebook or Google?
While you may not be explicitly asked to code a Segment Tree, but there may be a question where the most efficient way to go is by using a Seg-Tree. And in most of the interviews, you will be required to code your solution once you have discussed your algorithm with the interviewer. What I mean to say is that if you end up using any one of these"fancy" data structures as part of your solution, then you must know how to implement them in code. A typical example that comes up in interviews is the "Stabbing Query" problem (Segment tree - PEGWiki) which can be solved by using a segment tree.
