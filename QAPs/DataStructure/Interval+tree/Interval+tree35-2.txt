What types of technical questions are asked in developer interviews?
Originally Answered: What are the questions asked in coding interviews?Coding interviews are usually 1 hour where you get to answer 1 to 2 technical questions. Questions often test core computer science topics as well as a topic relevant to what position you're applying for (i.e. backend or frontend engineering). Here are the topics that cover 99% of questions I've seen: Core Computer Science Topics Arrays and Strings Linked Lists Stacks and Queues Trees and Graphs Recursion and Dynamic Programming Sorting and Searching Object Oriented Design Scalability and Memory Limits (Big O) Depending on the position, you most likely will get questions on related to specific languages or environments. Areas of Interest HTML and Javascript C and C++ Java Networking (WWW, HTTP) Databases Threads and Locks Here are some prototypal questions I've seen: Examples Write a method that validates an XML document Create an iterator for a Binary Search Tree Implement Math.pow Write a basic internet crawler Implement a maze and write a solver for it I keep a log of every interview question I've been asked. So far I've had 78 questions either via phone or in-person. For me, the trickiest problems require strong knowledge of the programming language you're writing in and a good understanding of when to use certain data structures. It's also easy to forget edge cases like null pointer exceptions or off-by-one errors. I find it useful to write down all the possible cases where there might be issues before I start solving the problem. Hope this helps!
