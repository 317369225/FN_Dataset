What types of technical questions are asked in developer interviews?
It depends on the company that you are applying for...If you are aspiring for the start-ups, be ready for taking a tough road ahead... If it is for well-established tech giants, there are already enough books available in the flipkart and amazon...like Programming Interviews exposed, cracking the coding interviews... If it is for services industry, prepare for the question from each phase of the SDLC as well as Agile... Basically, Questions ranges from Fundamentals, scenarios, advanced topics, design, design patterns, deployments, technology, frameworks, machine architecture and the way compiler works, virtual machine works etc... etc... Its always good to be strong in one programming language atleast, to solve the problems given to you during the interview....
