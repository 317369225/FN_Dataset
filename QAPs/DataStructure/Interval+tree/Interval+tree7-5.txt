What are the real world applications of some advanced data structures?
Okay, let me add one more to this comprehensive list of advanced data structures and their real life application. I was doing a bit of research on the artificial intelligence algorithm that's used by EA Fifa game and came across this amazing data structure called "R-Tree".  R-Trees are specifically used for spatial-access-methods - for e.g.  to efficiently handle spatial queries such as how far two points differ, or whether points fall within a spatial area of interest etc. I'm quoting the below example from wikipedia: A common real-world usage for an R-tree might be to store spatial objects such as restaurant locations or the polygons that typical maps are made of: streets, buildings, outlines of lakes, coastlines, etc. and then find answers quickly to queries such as "Find all museums within 2 km of my current location", "retrieve all road segments within 2 km of my location" And upon some more digging into what I was looking for, I figured out that EA uses R Trees to put those 10 players in different sections and to maintain their movements and the overall field density so it gives us a "distributed" sense. Typical implementation in java could be found here: JSI (Java Spatial Index) RTree Library
