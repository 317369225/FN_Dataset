What are some sources (books, etc.) from where I can learn about Interval, Segment, Range trees?I tried using the internet but found nothing useful.
There is this nice tutorial in TopCoder about Segment trees(along with an implementation) and also about Range Minimum Query for which Segment trees are very useful. Link: Algorithm Tutorials Once you understand how segment trees work, you can try your hand at solving some problems in on OnlineJudge pertaining to Segment trees. Atleast, that is how I learnt segment trees :) The following is a small list of problems from SPOJ that can get you started- http://www.spoj.pl/problems/GSS1 http://www.spoj.pl/problems/GSS3 http://www.spoj.pl/problems/KGSS http://www.spoj.pl/problems/HORR... http://www.spoj.pl/problems/FREQ... http://www.spoj.pl/problems/MULTQ3 http://www.spoj.pl/problems/LITE- (requires understanding of lazy propagation technique) These are some problems that I remember as of now. Hope it helps-
