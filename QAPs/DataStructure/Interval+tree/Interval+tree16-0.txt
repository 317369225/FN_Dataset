What is the best known algorithm to list all the intervals among n intervals that overlap with a given query interval?Assume k is the number of intervals that overlap.
Interval trees can actually solve this problem in O(k+lgn)  time.  The confusion comes from the fact that there are actually multiple variations of interval trees, each of which is optimal for different queries and operations. The following PowerPoint slides discuss three such variations: http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~sahni/c... The interval tree variation that solves your problem efficiently is described as "Version 1" in those slides.  Note: A requirement of "Version 1" is that the list of intervals must remain static (i.e., no insertions/deletions after the initial construction). A similar variation is described here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Int... Updated 28 Dec 2014 • View Upvotes
