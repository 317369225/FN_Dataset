Given a set of intervals, is there an O(nlog(n))  algorithm for finding the interval which has the maximum number of intersections with other intervals?
Build an Interval tree (construction is \Omicron(nlgn)  which gives you the ability to do intersection queries in \Omicron(lgn)  time. Then you query n intervals. For a  total complexity of \Omicron(nlgn)  . Updated 26 Jun 2014 • View Upvotes
