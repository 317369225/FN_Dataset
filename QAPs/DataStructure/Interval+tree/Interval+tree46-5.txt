What are different ways I can enhance my knowledge, skills, build my personality (1st year at MAIT), so I can secure a good job. What are some books and coding competitions that can help me in building my skills?
Sorry to disappoint you, but I am not of the computer science department. True, students over here are running after marks, and gaining knowledge is a tough task. I can only suggest you how to do that for my branch, mechanical engineering, but not for computer science. But still if you want someone who can answer well, contact Arushi Arora. She's currently an intern at microsoft.
