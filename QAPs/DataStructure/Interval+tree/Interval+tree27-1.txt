How does Emacs work under the hood?Infinite buffers, kill ring etc. Also does Emacs use a Rope data structure under the hood for text manipulation?
It doesn't use ropes - Stavros mentioned the gap buffer.  The kill ring is basically just a list.  It has its own elisp file defining it (ring.el IIRC) One reason it would be difficult for emacs to use ropes or cords is that in emacs, text can have properties and these are stored in an interval tree associated with the buffer text.  Ropes would not capture this structure, so when edits updated the ropes (simple & cheap) the interval tree would have to be updated as well, and that's not simple or cheap.  That said, there exists at least one tree variant that allows an ordinary tree (as ropes have) to support intervals cheaply.  (Name escapes me, it's something like "auxilliary tree" or "height tree") While I haven't dealt with the display code much, I believe it also assumes a gap buffer structure and would require serious rewriting to use ropes.
