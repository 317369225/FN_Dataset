What are the real world applications of some advanced data structures?
I want to talk about one awesome in-memory data structure which is not yet discussed in this thread JudyTree is the efficient in-memory data structure which is fast and consumes less memory Judy has two main strategies: use a 256-ary tree, compressed and designed to require one (at most two) secondary cache misses per tree node lookups A (CPU) cache-line fill is additional time required to read from RAM when a word is not found in cache. In todayâ€™s computers the time for a cache-line fill is in the range of 50..2000 machine instructions. Hence a cache-line fill should be avoided when fewer than 50 instructions can do the same job. * Judy is generally faster then a hashing method and popular forms of balanced binary tree * Judy is cache - concious because its designed to avoid cache-line fills wherever possible * Judy tree is more memory-efficient than almost any other competitive structure useful link: A 10-MINUTE DESCRIPTION OF HOW JUDY ARRAYS WORK AND WHY THEY ARE SO FAST
