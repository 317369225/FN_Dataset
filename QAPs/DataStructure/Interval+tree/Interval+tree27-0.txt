How does Emacs work under the hood?Infinite buffers, kill ring etc. Also does Emacs use a Rope data structure under the hood for text manipulation?
Emacs is free software so you can study as much of the code as you'd like. If you Google [Emacs internals], you'll find a lot of good material, e.g., XEmacs Internals Manual. If you're interested specifically in the buffer structure, it has a simple data structure called a "Gap buffer". It is a contiguous sequence of bytes with one clever trick: it is divided in two parts by the "gap". All insertions/deletions happen at the gap. When the gap moves, text is copied to the other side of the gap as necessary. Since almost all operations in Emacs buffers happen near one another -- and usually sequentially in the buffer -- there is an acceptable amount of copying.
