What are some problems that computer science graduates can solve with ease, but a self-taught programmer would probably not be able to?
This answer comes from just my personal experience Being able to program in over a dozen languages... IDK if this is exactly true because it depends on the resources available to the self-taught programmer.  But at University there are a lot more facilities, machines and resources for picking up literally dozens  of languages. Being able to do hardware design and development.... You can easily go right across the building and work with the EE department friends of yours to build an awesome machine from the ground up with stuff just laying around. A far as the stuff you mentioned, I think you can find practically everything outside of a CS graduate environment.   What really sets the CS student apart are the facilities (s)he has for building things, the raw talent they are around 24/7 and the total immersion into the field of study.
