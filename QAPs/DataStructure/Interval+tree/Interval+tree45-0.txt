What are some advanced data structures that one needs to be familiar with?After being familiar with the most common data structures such as queues and linked lists what are some really good data structures that would help build well optimized code.
Hash Tables are perfect for code that requires frequent look-ups. I've used them very often, and many of my friends also use them whenever they need to. They're great. Edit: A more advanced data structure that serves a similar purpose as hash tables is a bloom filter. These are used in place of hash tables for larger problems because bloom filters are very space-efficient. The downside is that these data structures have a higher probability of saying that an element is part of the bloom filter when it really isn't (a.k.a a false positive) Updated 2 Jul 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
