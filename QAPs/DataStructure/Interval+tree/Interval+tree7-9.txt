What are the real world applications of some advanced data structures?
My personal favorite is the HyperLogLog[1] and related HyperLogLogPlusPlus.  The general class of LogLog data structures utilize probabilities and clever encoding scheme to estimate cardinality of huge sets in very small memory.  The initial claim to fame is that you can count 1 billion unique elements in 1.5 kilobytes of space.  These data structures are fast, easy to serialize and deserialize, and support union and intersection operations.  Stream-Lib is an open source (java) implementation of HLL and other interesting data structures.
