What are the real world applications of some advanced data structures?
Rope - A relatively lesser taught data structure in undergraduate computer science courses. According to wikipedia a rope, or cord, is a data structure composed of smaller strings that is used for efficiently storing and manipulating a very long string. It is used extensively in text editing programs.[1] I am surprised no one mentioned Fibonacci Heap created by the famous Tarjan. It is known for its reduced amortized time complexities which are better than binomial heaps.[2] It can be used to make Dijkstra's more efficient which in turn leads to more efficient network optimization.[3] I have only read about Gap Buffer which is an alternative data structure to ropes. I have not come across any of its implementations. According to wiki it is used in the Emacs text editor.[4] [1]Rope (data structure) [2]Fibonacci heap [3]http://www.cs.princeton.edu/cour...
