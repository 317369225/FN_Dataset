What should I expect in a Software Engineer interview at Google and how should I prepare?
I'm going to paste here the best advice I received, from a friend who works at Google as a Level 5 Engineer on the Google Search Team. I followed the advice, and it worked. :) Heard google is coming to campus, so I decided to give some idea about our interview process. I am sure most of you will be knowing about the interview process already .. Google Interview Process : 4-5 rounds. First 2 are almost similar. Later rounds are more difficult. Most questions are basic data structures, algorithms, coding your solution, discussion about complexities (time, memory) and basic computer fundamentals. Interviewers like clarifying questions e.g. if working on some string do we consider all unicode strings [ Trie will go crazy in such cases]. Come to a working solution and iterate over there, rather than taking much time and coming with perfect solution. You should be able to write code on what you think. Use good function names, variables names, and check boundary conditions. If you don't do well in one question, don't panic try better for next question. But don't say to the interviewer 'I don't know this question, ask something else' :) While writing code, mix algorithm style writing. e.g. // int a = max element in heap. [Complete it when interviewers ask for it] In General no puzzles will be asked. So don't waste time on those. For software test positions, questions will be based from testing too-- think-- how to break something. e.g. to test gmail login you may put whole page in user name or password, leave empty fields, just put password, different case, extra space etc.   If you are not allowed for written test based on your GPA score, ask a senior staff to recommend. Google always respects staff recommendations.    Some common areas :   1. Hash, BST, Linked List, Array, Sorting algos, Searching, String search etc.   2. Linux, deadlocks, compilation, networking may be asked. But for new grads it will be mainly data structure, coding, and algorithms.   3. For software test positions, read about unit test, regression test, load test etc. Google for 'Google interview questions' you will get plenty of them online.   These are just guideline and don't scold me if they ask something else and nothing out of these :) So prepare well, hope to see of you at Google.
