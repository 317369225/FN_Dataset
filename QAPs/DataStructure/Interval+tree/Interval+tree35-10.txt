What types of technical questions are asked in developer interviews?
There's such a wide array of questions, and it really depends on the job that you are interviewing for, because they typically ask questions that deal with the technologies that you would be working with if you got that particular job. Some interviewers are extremely well prepared and just have a list of questions they go through.  Some are more ad-hoc and are looking for someone smart and who's a good fit for their team.  It really varies. That's why interviewing as a programmer is so tough and why prep work is critical so that you can get multiple offers. Here's a great site to help in the process: http://programmerinterview.com/
