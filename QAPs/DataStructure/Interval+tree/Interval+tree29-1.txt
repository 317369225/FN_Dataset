How do you become highly proficient in Algorithmic Coding?I am coder without a background in Computer Science. But want to learn a lot in this field. Any books that a new-bi can read ? How to get started and get the fundamentals really strong ?
In terms of books, Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein is an excellent textbook (and is the standard book for college algorithms classes).  It is a great place to start learning about algorithms.  There is a lot of advanced material, so as a first pass, it is good to focus on the core stuff, such as algorithms for sorting, graph algorithms, and basic data structures. Of course you also need to practice the algorithmic techniques you are learning.  There are many sources of good problems online.  TopCoder is a great source.  Personally, I have enjoyed working on Project Euler problems (http://projecteuler.net/).  These are more mathematical in nature, but many do require algorithmic insights.
