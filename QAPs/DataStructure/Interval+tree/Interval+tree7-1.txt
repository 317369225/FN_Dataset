What are the real world applications of some advanced data structures?
I've used range query structures in a real-world auto-completion library cpp-libface. You can read about how it is used here: A very fast approach to auto complete (or search suggestions). I'm also planning to use a cross between a BIT and a segment tree (i.e. a binary [bit based] segment tree) to implement free-lists efficiently. Some thoughts on your (and my) thoughts. nessDB uses some cache-oblivious data structures to implement efficient external memory indexing. The unix sort command uses external memory sorting to sort input using a fixed amount of main memory (RAM). bzip2 (or any block based compressor) may use Suffix Arrays to efficiently locate regions of overlap. Additionally, it also use the Burrows–Wheeler transform to make text more compressible. I've also used Suffix Arrays to compute the delta between 2 genomes. genome-diff-compression. Check http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~rezaul... for a bunch of techniques that can be used to greatly speed up edit distance computation (and hence DNA alignment) by using cache-oblivious and cache-efficient dynamic programming(DP) techniques. This is where DP meets Divide & Conquer. Order Maintenance is used in online dating :D Of course, there are many more, but these are some that come to mind immediately.
