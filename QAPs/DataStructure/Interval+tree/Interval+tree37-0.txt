What is the solution to the question Give Away?Give Away The basic brute force is obviously out of time limits.
Interval Tree with some data structure as node, that contains all elements in its interval. O(NlogN)Â  memory Data structure must handle queries "number of elements >= c" and update an element. Some randomized BST can be used, for example treap (cartesian tree) For each query we will answer in O(logN) time for O(logN) nodes, total O(log^2 N). Maybe it can be solved in O(logN) time with persistent interval tree, but I am not sure.
