What are the real world applications of some advanced data structures?
This answer talks about a data-structure specific to video encoding technology. Most of the video encoder segregate the input frames into smaller square blocks of pixels, usually a multiple of 4x4 and then encode them one by one. This is true for all video codecs. Most standards simply divide the frame into blocks depending on whichever costs less. This is how it looks: Here all blocks are of same size, but there could be an intermix of different sizes. HEVC(high efficiency video coding) or H.265 standard uses a somewhat unorthodox scheme for dividing the frames into blocks. The frame is divided into blocks which could be divided into smaller sub-blocks and same is true for the sub-blocks. This forms a recursive block structure, or a quad-tree structure, of square blocks covering the entire image. The largest block could be as large as 64x64 pixels and the smaller could be as small as 4x4. A good encoder uses the quad-tree block structure to tessellate the frame in such a way that the easy to decode area have larger undivided blocks and the finer areas have blocks divided into sub-blocks which, depending on how hard a frame region is, could be further divided into smaller blocks. This is how it looks: The quad-tree scheme is complicated but results in better compression without compromising the video quality.
