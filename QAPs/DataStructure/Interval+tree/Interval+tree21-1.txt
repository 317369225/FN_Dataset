What major factors distinguish advanced and elementary data structures?In other words, what makes stacks, queues, linked lists, hash tables elementary, and what makes B-trees, Fibonacci Heaps, and van Emde Boas Trees advanced?
There are not only two categories, although for practical reasons curricula make a separation based on complexity for purposes of limiting the size of texts and the content of courses. In general, more advanced data structures are made out of more primitive or "elementary" data structures. Also, in some cases, an advanced data structure might support primitive operations that are conceptually more difficult for students, for example due to asymmetry, or due to complexity of the algorithm that implements the primitive.
