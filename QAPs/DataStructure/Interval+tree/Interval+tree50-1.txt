What are practical uses of computational geometry algorithms?
Wherever you can use geometry to solve a problem or the problem is geometric in nature. It also deals with some advance data structures like range tree, segmentation tree, k-d tree, interval tree and many more. These data structures can be used to solve many problems efficiently. Just have a look on few problems given in the two links below, these problems can be used from the game you are playing, to the anything you want to buy online to google map, to the security systems and many more...
