How do segment trees solve the Stabbing Problem (all the intervals containing a given point)?Where is it possible to find reference for an implementation of segment trees solving the stabbing problem? The stabbing problem asks to return all intervals (from a predefined set) containing a given point. Corner case: intervals of only one point [a, a]. Conditions: any given interval [a, b] has 1 <= a, b <= n where n is given.
