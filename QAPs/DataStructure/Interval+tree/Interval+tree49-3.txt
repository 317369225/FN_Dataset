Where can I find topic wise algorithmic problems?I'm a newbie to algorithmic problem solving. What I want is to go through a particular algorithm and solve some good amount of problems related to that algorithm so as to gain a good grip over algorithmic problem solving. Is my procedure correct?
There are many problem classifiers available. One that I know of is Virtual Online Contests I would also recommend doing some course on algorithms as it will give you some structure to study the material Some available courses are Introduction to Algorithms
