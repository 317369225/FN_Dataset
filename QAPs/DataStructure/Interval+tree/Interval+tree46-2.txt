What are different ways I can enhance my knowledge, skills, build my personality (1st year at MAIT), so I can secure a good job. What are some books and coding competitions that can help me in building my skills?
I have graduated from MAIT in 2013....and i admit that i wasted 4 precious years.... i was in IT(2009-2013) batch.... i am currently doing M.Tech CSE from IIIT Hyderabad.... if you really want to excel in Computer Science field ... just make sure of one thing.... do not read those IPU author books...those katson books won't help you in the longer run.... keep this aside.... to master this field... indulge yourself in competitive programming.... initially you will face a lot of problems but gradually you will start liking it.... 1. to start with read geeksforgeeks and narsimha karumanchi( greedy approach, dynamic programming, binary and ternary searches, BFS, DFS, graph algorithms, arrays, strings, trees).... will take around 3-4 months for this..... 2. then you can join spoj.... go with spoj classifier and start doing problems... do at least 150-200 problems which will take around 6 months.... 3. after u develop some confidence... start participating in online contests on hackerrank, hackerearth, codeforces, topcoder.... 4. when you finally reach this 4th step you are through... the top CS companies will be waiting for you... btw i am on step 2.... best wishes....
