What are different ways I can enhance my knowledge, skills, build my personality (1st year at MAIT), so I can secure a good job. What are some books and coding competitions that can help me in building my skills?
Thanks for the A2A. Firstly, you need to wait for a reply once you send me a message. :) I am really busy with my internship and am not visiting Quora so often. Anyway, focus on building your overall personality rather than just the technical part. We here at Microsoft are constantly told to build an overall personality rather than just work on our technical skills. Our managers here say, "Anyone can be taught how to code, but, no one can be taught how to be smart." Involve yourself in different NGO's and extra curricular activities inside and outside college. Do not build your resume, build yourself! And, coming to the selection process for Microsoft, well, most of the top coders from the college didn't make it past the general aptitude/logical reasoning written exam. Lesson to be learnt here: build a sharp brain! Not a programmed one. The interviews are technical, but, they ask you what area of Computers you are fluent in, and they'll question you on that only. Lesson to be learnt here: Focus on knowing one thing really well, and for the other things, keep some knowledge. The human brain cannot possibly learn all the computer science related stuff. That's why we have computers! For the subjects, do make sure you are confident about Algorithms and Data Structures. They are hot favourites in technical interviews. For your training after the second year, try and get an internship in some software firm where you actually work and get some hands-on experience. Do not join any course training, it won't be beneficial. Hope it helps! :) If anything is left unanswered, please comment and I'll answer it :) Updated 8 Nov 2014 • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Anonymous
