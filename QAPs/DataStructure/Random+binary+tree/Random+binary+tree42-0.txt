What properties have to have a decision tree in order to be considered a CART?
These are some properties of CART trees: - CART is a binary tree, there are also other binary trees but not all of them, like ID3,C45,See5 - CART uses multiple times numerical and nominal features (C45 uses a nominal features only once) - CART uses surrogate attributes for treating missing values; other trees implements different strategies, like random splits, weighted splits, ignore missing - CART does pruning using CV, others like C45 uses some confidence intervals over the error estimator - due to the fact that CART can use same feature as a test multiple times, is not possible to write simple rules, thus it is usually the rule extraction is not performed on a CART tree I think there are also other things, but I do not remember right now.
