How can we generate a random number with equal probability in the range [1...n] s.t., it doesn't belong to the invalid set of numbers  S ={xi | 1<= xi <=n and i [math] \in [/math] [1...k] and k<n}  using O(k) memory; provided we can call random function only once?
You need a source of randomness. Your function needs to draw on something from its environment that you trust to be random and uncorruptible. Some key generators ask the user to move the mouse and, once they have moved it enough, they draw on that (supposedly) random movement to choose random numbers. Others use the computer clock. I heard once that system temperature was used. Anyway, you get the idea.
