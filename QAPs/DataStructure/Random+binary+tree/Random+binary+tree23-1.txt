What are the real world examples of binary trees (not search tree)?
Thanks for the A2A. Real world example (on daily basis) of binary trees which I could think of is 1: family tree. 2: any decision you make (For ex if you want to go to movie- here would be binary tree :                                       go to movie english movie                                            hindi movie which sort of movie(adventure, etc)               which sort of movie(adventure, etc) so on and so forth) Practical applications are mostly covered here so I wouldn't reiterate the whole thing. Please let me know if I fail to understand your question or if I missed out something while answering.
