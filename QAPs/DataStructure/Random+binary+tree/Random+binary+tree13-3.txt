What computer science knowledge/concepts do Silicon Valley software engineers (Google, Quora, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) use on a daily basis?
Yes, everything you mentioned is important. But one can't remember all those all the time. You'll have to remember the basics of all those and know how and where to apply them. There is no point remembering everything and reinventing every time. So, there are only these couple of things which will come handy: Googling - It is not just going to Google and typing a question as you speak. Queries to the search engine should be focused, with as less keywords as possible. Copy+Paste - Most of the algorithms and data structures are available in the net. You should know where to copy from, and where to paste. (You should not be copying a GPL code into your closed source project and end up in trouble later). You should also know how to customize the code to suit your requirements.
