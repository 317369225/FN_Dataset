IIT Placements & Internships: How should one prepare for the microsoft written tests? Considering the fact that i am a novice at programming
First round will be aptitude test. Basically C++ class /  C pointer related concepts will be asked. They will sort  mostly 50  from this round. Next round will be coding . Microsoft question for  coding round will be very simple. For a good programmer it wont take for than 30 mins though they provide 1 hr. You can practice those type of questions on Page on Leetcode . There will be two questions. One related to data structures mainly linked list or binary tree and other one general very basic. After that there will be on paper coding round again the questions will be simple. Mostly a brute force or dfs or bfs or dp related stuff. Then there will be two or three interview round which willl be most easiest part. See previous questions on Page on Careercup . Microsoft selection process in my college was random. Many deserving students didn't make to second round and even coding question was so easy that it was very much luck than  anything else. See geeksforgeeks , leetcode and careercup .It will definitely help you.Almost every question were from these.
