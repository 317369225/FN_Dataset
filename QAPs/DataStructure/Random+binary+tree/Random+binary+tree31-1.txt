Can someone help me write a problem for printing a binary tree in vertical order in Java?
Use a TreeMap rather than a Hashtable. TreeMaps are collections which sort by the value of the key.  Hashtables are unsorted so when you iterate over them you will get the results in random order, they are also a less efficient implementation. Specifically when you print for(Integer i : ht.keySet()){             printList(ht.get(i));         } You will get the integers in a random order. Add a System.out.println(i); in the loop to see the order. Replace every instance of Hashtable<Integer, List<TreeNode>> with TreeMap<Integer, List<TreeNode>> and see the difference.
