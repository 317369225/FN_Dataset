What is the logic for cracking the '2048 puzzle'?
The basic idea behind beating this game is to keep the number nucleating in one of the four corners. One can get through until 512 just by tapping up and right keys randomly (Combined with a little intuition you can get through even higher scores ) repeat this algo until you cannot use either of up or right moves,then look for down or left move , choose the one which does least damage i.e which produces least gap between the corner and the highest number repeat until you get to 2048,with a little practice you can even get up to 4096 i was able to solve it in less than using the above method and i think anyone can.
