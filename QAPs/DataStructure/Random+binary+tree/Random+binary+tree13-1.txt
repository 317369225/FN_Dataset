What computer science knowledge/concepts do Silicon Valley software engineers (Google, Quora, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) use on a daily basis?
Build a small real web app you want to use, or mobile app of your own. That's practice. Class pizza-ordering-system projects dont cut it. Skills? Should take you 3-6 months to become fairly proficient / productive / employable, and perhaps an year to build some in-depth knowledge. Choose ONE of the following and become really good at it. Ignore the others. 1. Learn Javascript / Node.js, Mongodb, REST. Build an express.js / mongodb based web site. OR 2. Learn Python, django, mysql. Build a web site using these. OR 3. Learn Objective C, build a small mobile app and deploy to your iPhone (from app store) OR 4. Learn Android APIs, build a small app and deploy to your android phone Concepts you need to know: 1. one programming language (preferably javascript or python today or ObjectiveC / Android Java if targeting mobile), 2. one database (mysql or mongodb today) including SQL, 3. how the web and internet works (basically the lifecycle of what happens from the moment you type a url, and the page appears in the browser). Besides this, you should know just the high level concepts of data structures / algorithms, and things like threading (you will learn more later as you work). If you want to be good, you should also know how computers work. Really great books are - simple and pictorial, and yet detailed and memorable: How Computers Work (9th Edition): Ron White, Timothy Downs: 9780789736130: Amazon.com: Books How Networks Work (7th Edition): Frank J. Derfler Jr., Les Freed: 9780789732323: Amazon.com: Books How the Internet Works (8th Edition): Preston Gralla: 9780789736260: Amazon.com: Books These books will put you ahead of 90% of engineers out there as far as conceptual understanding goes. Again learn by building a simple real world site / app that you actually expect to use.
