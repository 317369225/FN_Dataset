What are some programs every programmer should make at least once?
If you want to learn a lot, write a compiler. You'll learn Parsing and lexing. Assembly. You'll become more familiar with whatever architecture you choose. You'll learn about calling conventions. Optimizations! You'll learn how to reason about the semantics of a program and perform transformations. How to detect "dead code" (code that can be removed), detect loop invariants, register allocation and spilling... Doing all these things will give you a better of understanding of what kind of optimizations compilers are able to make, which will help you when you need to micro-optimize some performance-critical code. Of course, it's a fairly ambitious project to take on without direction. Probably best to find a course online or at a university.
