Why aren't skip lists used more often instead of balanced trees?
As far as efficiency is concerned skip lists are comparable to balanced search trees and has a simpler implementation as well. However there are the following negatives (IMHO) that make them not as frequently used as trees (or even hashes): skip lists take more space than a balanced tree. I think a skip list takes 4 pointers per node on an average, which is twice as much as a tree. skip lists are not cache friendly because they don't optimize locality of reference i.e. related elements tend to stay far apart and not on the same page. lack of available implementations. There are far more optimized tree implementations than skip lists. Updated 173w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
