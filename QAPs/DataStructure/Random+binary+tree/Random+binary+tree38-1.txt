Do you need to know discrete mathematics to learn algorithms?
Yes. Developing algorithms requires knowledge of certain subtopics of "Discrete Mathematics", but many people learn and understand these concepts without taking a formal course in DM. If you are learning algorithms, you are already applying discrete mathematics. For example, logic functions (such as if/then statements), recursion, counting techniques and relations (think databases) are all subtopics of DM but many people, especially those who tinker with programming, have some understanding of these topics without necessarily being aware of it. I think it's best to learn algorithms concurrently with discrete math so you can apply as you learn. You might find that taking a discrete math course is just formalizing a lot of stuff you already know or are familiar with.
