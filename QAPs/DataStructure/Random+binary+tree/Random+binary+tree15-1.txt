How are input files generated for problems on different online judges by problem setter?
I have set programming contest problems before and I will try to answer this question. Depending on the problem, the test case generation process might be might be very easy or very difficult. First, all possible corner cases are considered. We try to think what kinds of solutions the contestants might come up with. After the corner cases are out of the way, stress tests are created. These stress include huge input data. This is to test whether the solution uses an efficient algorithm. Many times corner cases and stress tests are combined.Â  After all these are done there are usually some random tests to compensate for some corner cases that might have been missed during the first step. Now that we have decided the test cases, the generation is very simple. A program in written (usually in C++) to do this. For more information you can read Codechef Problem Creation.
