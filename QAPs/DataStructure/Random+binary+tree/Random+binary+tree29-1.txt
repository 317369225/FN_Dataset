What are some frequently asked interview questions in cs/it branch? (With answers)
Q. How will you find if there is a loop in linked list ? Traverse linked list using two pointers (fast and slow).  Move one pointer by one and other pointer by two.  If these pointers meet at any node then there is a loop.  If pointers do not meet then linked list doesn’t have loop. boolean hasLoop(Node start) {     Node slow = start;     Node fast = start;     while(fast != null && fast.next != null) {         slow = slow.next;                 fast = fast.next.next;           if(slow == fast)              return true;     }     return false;  }
