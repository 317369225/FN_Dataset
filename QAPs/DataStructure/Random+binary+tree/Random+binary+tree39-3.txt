What are some programs every programmer should make at least once?
Command Interpreter Software Engineering is the act of making small-solid-compact components that can be reused to increase the productivity of yourself, your team, or others that might use the software (be it end-users or not). An important program would be a command interpreter that takes in a Text file as input. The important concept is to allow someone that doesn't program like you do, to be able to do more than they can by themselves. Example: is LOGO the drawing turtle (Logo (programming language)) More complicated Example: Natural Language Processing ... In a way, Software Engineering is like Karma. If you help others, others will help you. In general, everyone will better appreciate the "context" of which everyone else see the world. Thus enabling the developer to communicate well with others, explain ideas, or increase the productivity of the team. Updated 131w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
