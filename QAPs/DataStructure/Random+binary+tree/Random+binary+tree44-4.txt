What about Python makes it an increasingly popular language for scientific computing and data science?
By comparing with other programming tools of the same kind, we can see clearly the advantages and disadvantages of Pyhon.   Advantages: 1. Python is a more standard programming language with simpler method of coding than R language. Code written in R language is rather elusive for beginners, unless you are experienced in using it. 2. Python performs much better. And though R’s library function runs faily well, its self-programmed loop code runs several times slower than the code written in Python. When big file data are involved, the speed would be slower by order of magnitudes. I can’t help thinking how on earth the R’s interpreter is programed. Python is also an interpretive language, but it is much faster in processing data. 3. Python is a more universal programming system than R language, which can be used not only in handling data computing, but also some tasks like system management, WEB service, etc.   Of course R has advantages over Python. Mathematicians love R languages because it can be used to make mathematical statistics. In this aspect, R is the only choice (except the chargeable SPSS). Both R and Python’s pandas provide class library for structured and semi-structured data computing. But they are not real professionals in this field. esProc is the best player. Its table sequences provides much more powerful object function than data frame, and supports cursor-style file computing which performs as good as Python and much better than R.
