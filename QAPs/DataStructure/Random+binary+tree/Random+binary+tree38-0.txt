Do you need to know discrete mathematics to learn algorithms?
It depends largely on the algorithm, but a background in discrete mathematics is invaluable in trying to understand why an algorithm works the way it does. A few special areas: Graph theory allows you to work with complex data structures, most notably trees (red-black trees, splay trees, B-trees...). Recursive relations gives you a better understanding of how recursion works mathematically. Combinatorics allows you to analyze algorithms for efficiency and develop heuristics. Asymptotic analysis lets you get upper and lower bounds on the runtime of an algorithm. Even better, understanding these things allows you to create cool solutions like the A* search algorithm, a widely-used pathfinding algorithm. So while you don't need to take discrete, you probably should.
