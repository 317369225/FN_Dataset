Memory Management (computer programming):Â What is the heap?
If you're talking about the Data Structure, a heap is like a binary tree with the condition. A[Parent] <= A[i] In case of a min heap A [Parent] >= A[i]], in case of a max heap A heap looks something like this. Shown below is a max heap. Operations supported A heap supports the following operations: Heapify: Takes an array and converts it to a heap. Insertion DeletionThe cool thing about a heap is that unlike most binary trees it doesn't have to be implemented with linked lists and pointers. A linked list can be implemented with an array. It is named so because it looks like a heap of random objects.
