Is "invert a binary tree" a good question for Google to ask in a technical interview?
Asking someone to invert a binary tree isn't a terrible question, but it isn't a great one either. It's a fairly straightforward application of recursion. I'm not sure what such a question really tests, in terms of either coding ability or algorithmic problem solving. A better problem in my view -- and one which was quite popular at Google until I got it banned by blogging about it -- is this one: Retiring a Great Interview Problem. The bigger problem is testing coding at a whiteboard. I suppose that the attitude at Google and other companies is that this is what everyone does, so candidates should comply or "get over themselves". My own view is these companies should get over themselves and take a more enlightened approach to interviewing. Allow candidates to code using keyboards, just like they will if they get jobs. And ideally under more natural conditions, such as being given homework or even time to themselves onsite. Whiteboard coding interviews are archaic.
