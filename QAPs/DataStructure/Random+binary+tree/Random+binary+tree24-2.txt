To what level or how much programming do i need to know to become a data scientist?
Data science seems to start with a basic background in programming. You'll get all of the basic data structures in the process, but it's not really central to what "data science" is (whatever it is). You're going to need to gain experience in statistics and databases, to start. (Not just data structures, but the ins and outs of how actual databases actually work. You should genuinely know at least one database system and what makes it different from the others.) It helps to have experience in machine learning and data visualization. It also helps to get experience in some of the Big Data tools, like Hadoop and MapReduce.
