What about Python makes it an increasingly popular language for scientific computing and data science?
I think a lot of important things have already been said by others. Scripting languages like Python/R are preferred over conventional object oriented languages like Java/C++ in Data Science for many reasons like Rapid prototyping, available large number of tested and awesome libraries/packages for any kind of analysis, etc. I would like mention few things which i felt when I started coding in Python. I used to do all data analysis in R, but one day I thought I should try python as well as there is so much buzz in the community about it. I observed the following things: It was highly easy for me to switch to python having R background whereas vice-versa is not true Commonly used things in R have already been implemented in Python: Pandas, ggplot, numpy, scikit-learn... Data Science is not only about running models and as a matter of fact that is merely 30% of the most critical work. But the most time consuming task of ETL(Extract Transform Load) either from Database, Server, Flat files or through APIs is handled much better and in an easier manner in Python When playing with Big Data you can easily integrate Python with Hadoop or Pig (UDF) which helps you taking your analysis to next level Although Python has come a long way but I feel people in Data Science community will always have a soft corner for R no matter what.
