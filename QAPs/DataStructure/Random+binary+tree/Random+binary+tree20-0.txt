What are the main data structures layman's explanation (Array, Stack / Queue, Hashset / Hashmap / Hashtable / Dictionary, Tree / binary tree, Heap, Graph)?
Array is a linear data structure whose values can be randomly accessed by a sequential and numerical index. Stack is a linear data structure whose values can be added (push) and deleted (pop) from the top of the structure. Hash is a linear data structures whose contents can be randomly accessed using a non-sequential and potentially non-numeric index called a key. Graph is a non-linear data structure composed of vertices and edges that connect them. Tree is a graph data structure that has a start (root) and branched out from there. There is a clear parent child relation between the vertices. Heap is a tree data structure whose keys are ordered in a consistent manner across the heap. This is called the heap property.
