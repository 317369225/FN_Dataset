What are some frequently asked interview questions in cs/it branch? (With answers)
1) K largest elements from a big file or array. 2) Find a triplet a, b, c such that a2 = b2 + c2.  Variations of this problem like find a triplet with sum equal to 0.  Find a pair with given sum. All such questions are efficiently solved  using hashing. 3) Binary tree traversal questions like left view,  right view, top view, bottom view, maximum of a level, minimum of a  level, children sum property, diameter etc. 4) Convert a BST into a DLL and DLL to BST in place. 5) Vertical traversal of a Binary Tree. 6) Lowest Common ancestor in a Bianry Search Tree and Binary Tree. 7) Implement a stack with push(), pop() and min() in O(1) time. 8) Reverse a linked list in groups of size k. 9) Given two numbers represented by two linked lists, write a function that returns sum list. 10) Rotate a matrix by 90 degree. 11) Some stack based questions like stock span problem, next greater element. 12) Some Dynamic Programming problems like maximum  sum subarray, maximum sum subarray such that no elements are  consecutive, edit distance, assembly line scheduling. 13) Check if a Binary Tree is BST or not. 14) Remove duplicates from a string, do it in-place. 15) Given a rotated array which is sorted search for an element in it. 16) Print last 100 lines of a big file or big string. 17) Clone a linked list with next and arbit(or random) pointer. 18) Connect nodes at same level. 19) Run length encoding. 20) Detect cycle in a linked list. 21) Given a sorted array of size n. Each element in array is unique  and lies from 1 to n+1. Find the missing element. Write code and test  cases for the same.
