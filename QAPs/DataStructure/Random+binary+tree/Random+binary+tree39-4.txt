What are some programs every programmer should make at least once?
Disclaimer:  my standard for what constitutes a good programmer is likely a bit higher than most.   In no particular order: server/browser/proxy - you'll learn about some of the lower levels of the web. This is arguably the most important thing you can ever program. optimizing compiler - you'll understand what to and not to care about when programming in C a good garbage collector - you'll understand why garbage collection is so wonderful malloc - you'll understand why malloc is so hateful a shell - you'll really learn about processes and handles Distributed Raytracer/Password cracker - you'll learn at least a little bit about distributed computing and how to take advantage of embarrassingly parallel problems drivers - knowing how to do this comes in very handy. scripts for your editor - what use is a programming environment if you can't program it? a makefile - you'll only ever really need one of these (if it is good), but you should really know how it works.  lambda calc interpreter - you'll learn how to parse things well, and what the lambda calculus is.
