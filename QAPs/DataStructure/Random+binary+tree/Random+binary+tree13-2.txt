What computer science knowledge/concepts do Silicon Valley software engineers (Google, Quora, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) use on a daily basis?
All of those things are good, but what's important about them isn't necessarily the nitty-gritty details of how to implement them, but rather the details about knowing which ones to implement when.Â  Knowing how to code a red-black tree isn't important (it's generally a bad idea to do it yourself any ways, the implementation in a good library is almost certainly better than anything you might write,) but being able to look at a problem and determine which data structures or algorithms will best solve your problem is key.
