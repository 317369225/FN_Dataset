What about Python makes it an increasingly popular language for scientific computing and data science?
1. Libraries: scikitlearn, SciPy, NumPy, Pandas. 2. Good, flexible, general purpose language. Readable with limited boiler plate. 3. Data Science is not often building large systems, sidestepping the reasons why it's not always a good production language 4. iPython and iPython notebook 5. Passable visualization toolkit in matplotlib 6. Lack of competition. R is the other language that brings most of these elements together (with slightly different strengths and weaknesses). Beyond that, no other language really provides a fully functional environment for data science.
