What are some data structures implemented based on statistics / probability?
Sketches and Locality Sensitive Hashing are both good examples. Sketches are a counting data structure based on a random projection of a stream of input data. They are used to create low-memory approximations to common counting applications. The bounds/motivation for the algorithms are taken from probability and statistics. The seminal work for this field was this paper for computing frequency moments: http://theory.stanford.edu/~mati... Similarly locality sensitive hashing is based on similar statistical foundation also derived from hashing but used for nearest-neighbor search. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loc...
