To what level or how much programming do i need to know to become a data scientist?
Data science should start with curiousity when you face a bunch of data. Â I think to know high school level math is very recommended to start creating a meaningful program. I am a self-taught programmer and I started learning data analysis by reading some statistics and basic math. A recommended book that really helps me is: "Data Analysis with Open Source Tools" (Phillip K. Janert) The book explains about how you should deal with data and choose appropriate analysis for your data. The author also provides the reader with Python code for exercise. For programming language, you can use any programming language but I recommend you to start with Python or R, since they are really suitable for data analysis. If you would like to fine the big idea about data science, you can visit STRATA official page of O'Reilly: Data Analysis, Data Mining and Data Management Hope it helps! Cheers, Sunu .W (Japan)
