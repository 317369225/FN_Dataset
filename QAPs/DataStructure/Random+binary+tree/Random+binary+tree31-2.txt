Can someone help me write a problem for printing a binary tree in vertical order in Java?
Vertical order traversal of Tree shown below will be Print data present at Line 1 ( 4 ) Print data present at Line 2 ( 2 ) Print data present at Line 3 ( 1, 5, 6 ) Print data present at Line 4 ( 3 ) Print data present at Line 5 ( 7 ) We need to identify, which node will be part of Line 1, Line 2, Line 3 and so on, How to do that? If you observe, then there is a close relation between each line from root. If somehow we find out, which nodes fall in column -2, column -1, column 0, column 1 and column 2, then our task is done. From the above image, we can see that, Root node is at scale 0. With the reference from Root node which is at distance(column) 0, we will calculate the horizontal distance of each node at left(Negative) side and right(Positive) side. From the above understanding, can we say, If two nodes have the same Horizontal Distance from root, then they are on same vertical line.
