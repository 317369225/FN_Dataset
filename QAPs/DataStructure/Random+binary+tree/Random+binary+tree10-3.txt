Is "invert a binary tree" a good question for Google to ask in a technical interview?
The bottom line is that nobody - outside of the candidate, the interviewer and the hiring committee actually know exactly that question was asked or how it was presented. If the entirety of the question was - "Write code to invert a binary tree. Go!" - then yeah, that's pretty much a horrible interview question. On the other hand if the question was presented (as I expect it was) more like "Write code to invert a binary tree. By "invert" I mean take a binary tree like <insert example input> and convert it to a binary tree like <insert desired result>" then it could be a reasonable question. I've actually seen interview packets with what I _think_ is the question that was asked and it's a pretty reasonable interview question with follow-up questions for people who nail the initial problem. Is it my favorite question? Probably not. But it's also not obviously horrible (unless you believe that all coding interviews are horrible). Â [Note - I'm not going to give details about the actual question because I don't want to screw over interviewers who use the question] As Gayle said already - nobody that wasn't directly involved in the hiring decision knows why the candidate was rejected. It might have been this one question, but was more likely a combination of many factors.
