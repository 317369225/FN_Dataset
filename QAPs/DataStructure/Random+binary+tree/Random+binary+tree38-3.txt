Do you need to know discrete mathematics to learn algorithms?
Well yes you at least have to understand some basic components of it like truth tables perhaps and basic logic. The actual creation of algorithms is really more algebraic and discrete mathematics is a subset of algebra. But don't take my word for it, I'm some random guy on the internet. Just google binary search, interpolation sort, merge sort, Dijkstra's algorithm, binary trees, linked lists, and all the mental confounding that results from that. (Linked lists and binary trees are data structures not algorithms). These are pretty introductory algorithms and while its not totally required you know then by heart understanding them well will make you a much more conscious and logical programmer.
