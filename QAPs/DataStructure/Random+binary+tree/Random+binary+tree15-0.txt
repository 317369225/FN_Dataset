How are input files generated for problems on different online judges by problem setter?
Having set many* problems I think I qualify to answer this question. *Problem setting by darkshadows A problem is as easy to solve as difficult it is to generate test data for it. So, generating good test data surely requires good amount of efforts and logic. Here step by step I'll try to explain the procedure: First step is to write down a data generation plan which is basically how we are going to build the data. We write down all corner cases and specific methods of input generation, keeping in mind a few wrong/inefficient solutions. We also might need to generate particular cases breaking wrong solutions. For example, this is the data generation plan that I had written for this problem: Shortest Path in Binary Trees 30 test files ie. 3*10^6 cases.10^6 cases where 1 <=i,j<=1000 ie. every pair.5*10^6 cases where i<=100 and 10^8<j<10^95*10^6 cases where 10^8<i<10^9 and 10^8<j<10^95*10^6 cases where i,j complete random100 cases where i==j.5*10^6 -200  cases where i<=100 and 10^9-100 < j <10^9100 cases where i==1 and j==2**k Next comes the implementation part. You try to write a generalised code for each input file. I write codes which when run generate all input and output files in current folder after validating them. Also, almost all experienced problem setters use https://code.google.com/p/testlib/ to generate input files. It has various features like random number generators and validators etc. Idea is to write a test generator which is a program that run on any compiler anywhere will generate same input output files.
