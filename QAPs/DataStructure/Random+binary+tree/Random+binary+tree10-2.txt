Is "invert a binary tree" a good question for Google to ask in a technical interview?
It's an unbelievably simple warm-up question.  My warm-up question is even easier, and it stumps most people, especially those with PhDs.  It's fine. Also, "90% of our engineers use the software" is a gross exaggeration.  Maybe 50% use  some form of Mac, and it's most likely a laptop that they use for meetings and reading email at home.  Even then, the vast majority of them are not installing any extra software on their laptops, aside from a few pre-compiled optional applications that Google makes available.  It would be very generous to say that maybe 1% of Google engineers have used Homebrew. Google looks for generalists that can solve problems, using computers if necessary.  People that have memorized a bunch of APIs and package repository tricks are not that useful.
