What exactly is a Huffman coding tree?
It is one of the lossless compression method. Loss less means that there is no loss of data in compression nor while retrieving the original data. In this algorithm, The character that occurs the most, gets the smallest code. Huffman coding tree is built in order to calculate these codes. Huffman coding tree is a binary tree. From a text, character and their occurrences are calculated and are sorted in increasing order. First two nodes, i.e, characters with lowest frequency are removed from the list and combined in one node and their frequencies are also added. Then that node is placed in the least and list is sorted again. (This can be done efficiently by using insertion sort) This process is repeated until only one node remains. This is the root of the tree. And, Every node with a character is a leaf. The nodes that are formed in between are middle nodes. Every left path is assigned a value "0" and every path on right is assigned value "1". When you read the path from root to leaf or leaf to root, you get the binary code for that particular leaf node(i.e that particular character). Hope this helps. All the best!
