If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?
Ignorance is certainly a bliss while knowledge is power. Having said this I understand from where you are coming. Normally when we haven't used some of the concepts in our day to day life, we don't realize the importance of it. And one day, we encounter a problem, where our traditional methods fail but since we don't know what we don't know, we face a hard time. Consider this, you just started Facebook and you got 100000 early users. You  have around 10 shards that store user data. You being smart, spread your data across servers using as usual (key%server count) philosophy. Now your manager comes to you and says that some shards are crashing and/or load has increased so some shards need to be added. In this real world situation, you will realize that in fact ignorance is not bliss. You will google stuff around this or you will hurriedly reach out to your friend who knew what he didn't knew & read about algorithms well in advance. He will save your life by introducing you to something called 'consistent hashing'. You will then realize that it would have been great had you known this concept early. In the same way, someone comes to you and talks about building something for scheduling jobs optimally. Now, you being an avid data structure and algorithm enthusiast/practitioner, realize that you are dealing with a problem where the content of data (aka job) might influence the storage and retrieval of the data itself in the container so you automatically think about priority queues. I can give tons of example like this where the amount of work you did, because you were ignorant about the concepts, could have been significantly reduced if you knew those concepts first hand. In summary, its not 'IF' you can do the job which is important but its about 'HOW' you do it... And that 'HOW' comes from being curious about 'WHY'... Updated 104w ago • View Upvotes
