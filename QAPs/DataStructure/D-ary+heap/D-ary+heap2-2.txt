How do the astrological Houses work?
The astrological houses are mathematical divisions of the sky (into 12 segments, or houses) at the time of birth. There are different systems for calculating the houses, and these systems are often named after the person who created them. E.g. Placidus, and Regiomontanus are two different house systems, or ways of dividing up the sky. When an astrologer looks at a horoscope for the time, date and place of your birth, they will look at a bunch of things, and 'house placement' is one of them. For instance, planets in some houses are 'stronger' than others. If you had your Sun in the 1st House, just before sunrise, then your ego (Sun) would be much stronger than if it was in the 6th house. That's because the 1st house is an Angular house, and the 6th is a Cadent house. A planet in an Angular house is 'louder' than one in a Cadent one. But this is only the tip of the astrological iceberg. There is a whole lot more to houses, but at least this might give you a bit of insight.
