What's the best sentence ever formed?
"Mr. Watson, come here -- I want to see you." This sentence was spoken into a machine in a Boston laboratory on March 10th, 1876, by a brilliant man named Alexander Graham Bell.  It changed not only his future, but the future of millions. Bell's assitant, Thomas A. Watson heard that sentence, even though he was not in the room. He had heard the sentence, although somewhat muffled, through the speaker of the first working rudimentary telephonic device, in the next room. Notably, Watson was the recipient of another momentous phone call later in life.  He received the very first trans-continental phone call, placed from New York City to San Francisco in January of 1915.  Hello, Frisco, Hello (actually, I've cheated a bit here - the above picture is of the first call placed from NYC to Chicago, somewhat earlier)
