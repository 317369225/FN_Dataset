How will we know that we have found the Higgs boson?
TL;DR: After seeing something that resembles the Higgs boson qualitatively, the actual verification will require measuring several different predictions and making cross checks.  These cross checks are related to the different couplings the the Standard Model Higgs Mechanism predicts. Michael Betancourt and Leo C. Stein give fine answers for the qualitative discovery of something looking like a Higgs boson.  I've laid out some of the details in a post [1].  What we're looking for in more detail is the following. There are several couplings that are important Vector Boson Couplings: The coupling of the Higgs boson to the W and Z bosons (e.g. h W W) Fermion Couplings: The coupling of the Higgs boson to fermions (e.g. h top top, h bottom bottom, h tau tau) Gauge Boson Couplings: The coupling of the Higgs boson to photons and gluonsThese are listed in order of importance for the Standard Model description of the Higgs mechanism.   There are numerous futuristic measurements we would like to make, but these are the basic ones.  For instance, measuring the Higgs self coupling would be very useful. Vector Boson Couplings The Higgs coupling to the W and Z are the hallmarks of the Higgs mechanism and what ultimately  tell us that the Higgs boson is the source of electroweak symmetry breaking.  No other particle can couple like the Higgs boson to vector bosons. Fermion Couplings The Higgs coupling to fermions is very important for the gauge structure of the Standard Model and due to precision measurements at LEP, measuring these couplings are similar to measuring the vector boson couplings. There are many particles that can couple like the Higgs boson to fermions, therefore, it is slightly more ambiguous than the coupling to vector bosons. Gauge Boson Couplings The couplings of the Higgs boson to photons and gluons do not arise at tree-level in the Standard Model and proceed through the one loop quantum effects and many particles can contribute to this process, so while the Standard Model makes a prediction, it is easily altered significantly.  Additionally, many hypothetical particles couple identically to the Higgs boson to photons and gluons, therefore, only measuring these couplings will not discover the Higgs boson. Measuring These Couplings: Now we can cut and paste these couplings together to make processes that the LHC can see.  There are two early discovery channels: [math] gg \rightarrow h^0 \rightarrow \gamma \gamma[/math] [3] [math] gg \rightarrow h^0 \rightarrow Z Z [/math] [4]Now you can see that the first of these channels only uses the couplings to gluons and photons and therefore can be faked (rather easily) by alternative new particles.   The second of these channels uses the HIggs coupling to ZZ and therefore is a critical test of the Higgs mechanism. Now as I described, these coupling of the Higgs boson to gluons is not a tight prediction of the Higgs mechanism, therefore the overall rate of Higgs to ZZ could be altered (up or down) and still have it be the Higgs mechanism. Additionally, if there are undiscovered particles that the Higgs could decay into, this would dilute the Standard Model rate. The concordance of the Diphoton channel and the Golden channel (ZZ to 4 leptons) is evidence of the Standard Model's implementation of the Higgs mechanism. But ultimately we need to test the coupling to fermions directly and measure other production modes other than gluon fusion [2] to really directly measure all of the parameters. Bottom Line for December 2011: What we have seen so far, is that the different rates for the above processes seem to be in rough agreement with the Standard Model and the tentative observation of the HIggs to ZZ boosts credibility that it is the Higgs boson rather than some other type of particle. However, the quantitative correlation of all the different channels is the next step and we will have much better results by the Moriond conference in early March (still using the 2011 data set).  By the end of 2012 we will have definitive Higgs discovery with multiple cross checks.
