How do atheists explain how the world was created?
It's a bit like asking, "What sort of sandwiches do atheists prefer?" The one doesn't entail the other. Atheists who are also rationalists, which is a large chunk of them, but certainly not all of them, will tend to follow the current consensus of scientific opinion on this (or pretty much any other) subject. But there are atheists who aren't up on their science. And there are atheists who might have more controversial ideas about the origins of the universe. I'm sure there are plenty of atheists who don't have any clear idea about the origin of the universe. And that's fine, too. You'd be surprised how little it comes up in work-a-day life.
