Where did the Sun get its energy to burn itself?
The energy that the sun releases is the result of the exothermic nuclear fusion reaction as catalyzed by gravity. But the question remains: what is the source of that energy? The heat from a burning log is the result of an exothermic chemical reaction, but that is not the source of the energy released. The source is the energy from the sun which was captured by photosynthesis and stored in the molecules of the log as chemical potential energy when the log was a living tree. The source of the energy released by a burning log is thus the sun. So, what is the source of the sun's energy? In other words, where did the energy originally come from that is being released by the fusion reaction in the sun? This is the deeper question being asked. The answer is that this energy has its source in the expansion of the universe and nucleosynthesis in the first three minutes after the birth of our universe. In particular, the expansion of the universe happened so fast that the quark gluon plasma could not complete the reaction of finding the lowest energy state - Iron nuclei - but instead stopped at mostly Hydrogen nuclei with some Helium and a small amount of Lithium mixed in. That allows stars to extract energy by facilitating the conversion of these lighter elements to Iron.  If the quark gluon plasma had very slowly expanded and cooled there would not have been any lighter elements in the universe.
