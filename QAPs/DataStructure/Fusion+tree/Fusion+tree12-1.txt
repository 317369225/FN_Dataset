What are good progressive rock and post-rock bands that I should listen to?
May I suggest some vintage King Crimson and U.K.? Crimson's lineup for Red and Lark's Tongues in Aspic include the incomparable Robert Fripp, Bill Bruford and John Wetton. These albums from 1973 and 1974 have some harder, crunchier offerings that might appeal to your sensibilities if you like Porcupine Tree. U.K was a British super group whose eponymous album featured Eddie Jobson (Jethro Tull), John Wetton (King Crimson), Bill Bruford (Yes) and Alan Holdsworth—one of the most innovative fusion guitarists yet to grace this planet. This concept album is a bit more ethereal and restrained than the Krimson albums, but in my humble opinion, a must have. U.K.: U.K. (full album) King Crimson: Red But wait, there's more! As a parting bonus, I leave you with Brand X Unorthodox Behavior. Sure, genre wonks will tell you this is technically fusion, but there's such great action on this album and it's perhaps Phil Collins' finest hour. The drumming on Nuclear Burn alone is mind-boggling. John Goodsall is such an underrated guitarist and other bass players only wish they were Percy Jones.
