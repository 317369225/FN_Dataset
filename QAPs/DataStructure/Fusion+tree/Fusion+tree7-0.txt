What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the theory of evolution (in all of its aspects) to be true?
Common descent is the necessary and sufficient condition for evolution to be true (in the scientific sense). Rationalwiki has an excellent, detailed article on the evidence (overwhelming evidence, I should specify), for common descent: http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Com... The most salient points are DNA and RNA codes (I would include the presence of pseudogenes, endogenous retroviruses, chromosome fusions, within this general genomic category), anatomical homology, and the fact that when phylogenetic trees are built from morphology or anatomical features, and separately from genomic studies, the trees are basically the same. Little adjustments here and there are made for some species, as more data is gathered. In reality, not even the famous "fossil rabbits in the Precambrian" would overthrow evolution (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/P...). The reality is that if a certain type of religious fundamentalist thinking did not exist, this type of questions would not exist either. This is not how scientists, religious or not, think. I recommend reading about Francisco Ayala, for example (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/F...).
