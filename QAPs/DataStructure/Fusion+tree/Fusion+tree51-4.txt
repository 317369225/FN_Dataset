Will humans ever colonize Mars, our solar system, or the entire universe? Or will they go extinct?
Yes, we will colonize mars... Yes, we will colonize our solar system... The entire universe?  No.  The reason I say no is that the universe is expanding at such a rate that we could never physically reach the rest of it, even if we were traveling the speed of light toward the "edge" of that expansion.  The farthest galaxy we have photographed is 13.3 billion lightyears away from us... If we were to travel the speed of light, a speed that is not possible to exceed, it would take us 13.3 billion years to get there.  Not to say the human race won't be around in 13.3. billion years, but there's no chance we can ever reach the end of the universe.  We WILL, however spread as far as we can.
