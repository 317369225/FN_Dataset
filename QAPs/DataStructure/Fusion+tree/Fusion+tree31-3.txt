What are some interesting things to do/see in New Orleans?
A quiet, but memorable visit:   Lake Pontchartrain -- if you have a car. Drive out to the Point where you can see the sailboats return at dusk. Ride the streetcar to City Park from the Riverwalk. Visit the African American Museum in Treme -- it is a complex of old buildings and furniture. Some art. If it's open, try to get into the Free People of Color Museum on Esplanade Avenue. Snug Harbor for jazz music. Frenchman Street in general for music: Reggae lover, look for Higher Heights at Café Negril People watch at PJ's
