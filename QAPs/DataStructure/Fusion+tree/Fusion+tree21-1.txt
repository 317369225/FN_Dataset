I listen to Porcupine tree, Pink Floyd, Scale the Summit, Opeth, Tool, Dream theater. What similar bands would you suggest I should listen to?
If you like Porcupine Tree, you might like a band from Poland  called Riverside  EDIT: As an afterthought I'm adding to my suggestion a group from the UK called Gomez. They are a bit more like the Beatles than the bands you cited, but Gomez does have some progressive elements in their music
