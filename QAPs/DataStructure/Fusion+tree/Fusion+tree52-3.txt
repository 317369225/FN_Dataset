What are the best restaurants in Seattle's International District?
My two favorites are House of Hong and Tamarind tree. House of Hong is Dim Sum in the old style, with a large dining room, food carts, fish swimming around in aquariums, and paintings of the Great wall of China in the background. The food there is great and it is surprisingly cheap. Tamarind tree is great too, as someone has mentioned. It is a bit tricky to find as it is hidden back behind a parking lot, but worth searching out.
