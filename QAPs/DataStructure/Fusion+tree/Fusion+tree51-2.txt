Will humans ever colonize Mars, our solar system, or the entire universe? Or will they go extinct?
This isn't an either/or question! While I believe that we will eventually colonise other planets, that won't stop our race eventually becoming extinct; if nothing else the heat death of the universe is an ending we cannot see a way to avoid (although to be fair, we have a long time to find one!) While it is true that we have evolved to exist on Earth, it is worth remembering that our distant ancestors dwelt underwater; that didn't stop either plants or animals from colonising the land. We have already learned the basics on how to survive for short periods in vaccuum; contrary to what you would expect, it is better to breath out so as to empty your lungs of air beforehand (the air is going to blast out into space anyway, so the goal is to avoid taking damage from the airblast). Surviving vaccuum is very practical short term, and is a useful survival trait in a damaged spacecraft, so expect humans to get better at it over the next million years. And that's before considering genetic engineering! Close to the sun, we have unlimited solar energy. Comets mean incredible supplies of metal for construction, plus ice to provide air and water. The primary advantage of Mars is the soil - IIRC a mix two parts Martian soil plus one part human sewage is expected to be an ideal farming soil, with the acid of the soil disinfecting the sewage. Colonising space will be difficult, dangerous and expensive - just like every other colonisation project in human history! And sadly, there will be failures. But it will happen.
