What do you recommend for someone who wants to explore jazz music for the first time?
There are many roads to jazz, but there is one proven gateway: This album is at once familiar and exotic.  On first listen it comes across as the coolest background music ever, but the more you hear it the more you discover the kind of subtleties and depth that simple lounge or "chillout" music won't bear.   It's a primer on what "improvising over a progression" means; understanding that Davis did not give the players sheet music, but "charts" showing the chord sequences and modes to be used, and that these recordings went from existing only as these sketches to its final, perfect form in only two days, gives a glimpse of what jazz can be.  From here the possibilities are endless.
