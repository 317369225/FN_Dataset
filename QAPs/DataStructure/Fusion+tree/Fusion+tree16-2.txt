If an Earth-ending asteroid were 50 years away, what are plausible ways to create an ark-ship?
UPDATE: Thanks to Mark A. Mandel It turns out that the information shared in the videos below is a bit outdates and new infirmation that came to light recently (which I was not aware of) eliminated the possibility of asteroid impact. Source: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/new... But I think as far as the question is concerned, my answer remains more or less the same. That is, finding out a way to deflect asteroids instead of building a 2012 (film) style ark or a Wall-e style spaceship. ORIGINAL: Turns out there is a very real possibility of an asteroid big enough to wipe out west coast of North America hitting the earth in 2036. Check out the video. The best course of action, I think, is to figure out a way to deflect it. This is how it can be done.
