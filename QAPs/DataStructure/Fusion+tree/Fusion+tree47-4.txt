If the earth was the center of our solar system with the sun orbiting around it, how would that affect life on earth?
Since you need to keep the barycenter of the earth-sun system deep within the earth this places limits on the mass of the sun and the distance. Maybe you could make an artificial sun thats maybe moon or asteroid size using another kind of power source but thats probably not possible with current physics. The intensity would need to be almost the same as the sun of course Seasons due to axial tilt. I dont know if you could convincingly simulate that all over the earth by varying the orbital inclination of the sun If the earth has no rotation the coriolis effect that affects winds would be lost. So the rotational speed of the earth has to be near current values. Since the length of the day needs to be the same, you need to find an orbit for the sun which - taking into account the rotation of the earth - looks like 24 hours. With orbital mechanics I doubt you could do that. Maybe an artificial powered trajectory where the sun flies in an orbit much faster than 24 hours but in the same direction as the earth's rotation so when they add up it looks like 24 hours. The moon is a problem. To avoid pertubating the orbit of the moon places limits on the mass of the sun and the distance. Unless you make the moon have a powered trajectory to correct for it
