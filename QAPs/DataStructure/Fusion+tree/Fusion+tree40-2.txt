Why hasn't there been a single prominent or influential civilization which has come out of Africa (except Egypt (held areas of Asia Minor), Carthage (held Spain), the Berbers (held Spain))?
The Moors of northern Africa conquered Spain and remained in power for 700 years till around 1100. "The Moors however built splendid palaces, with much evidence remaining today, and their capital was Cordoba - thought to have been the most civilised city in Europe around the 10th century. The mosque at Cordoba became the second most important Muslim place of worship after Mecca, with a roof supported by 800 pillars of alternating red and white stone. The Moors further developed agriculture, and in particular, irrigation, by channeling water to where it was needed- many of these systems are still in use today. They also introduced citrus fruits, figs, pomegranates, sugar cane, cotton, silk and rice." The History And the Age of The Moors in Spain: How The Moors Civilized EuropeÂ  - The History of Africa
