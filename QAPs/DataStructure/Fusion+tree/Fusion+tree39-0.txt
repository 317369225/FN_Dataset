If you have unlimited power and wealth to create or do anything, what will you create? What will you do?
Personally, it's been a dream of mine to open a hosptial, similar to Hershey Medical Center in PA, but it would only focus on neurology. It would have a huge physical therapy room with all the equipments tha are best for paralyzed patients. This is the Lokomat. It is a robot assisted walking therapy. Robot-assisted walking therapy is a form of physical therapy that uses a robotic device to help a person whose ability to walk has been impaired as a result of stroke, spinal cord or brain injury, neurological or orthopedic condition, learn to walk again. - http://www.ric.org/conditions/sp... These are robotic legs. It's the same concept as the Lokomat, but the patient isn't supported. I also want adult stem cell therapy available, quite similar to the one I take. Information can be found at - www.neurogen.in I want all sorts of therapy available, including the ones mentioned above, aquatic therapy, psychological therapy, and maybe even yogic therapy. I want the worlds best doctors, surgeons, dietitians, and therapists. The best thing of all, I want it to be free for the needy. I want children who are below the age of 18 to get free treatment, as long as they need it. I'd like to personally fund it.
