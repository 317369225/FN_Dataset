If an Earth-ending asteroid were 50 years away, what are plausible ways to create an ark-ship?
Given a 50 year time horizon it would probably make more physical and monetary sense to launch a spacecraft with a(or many) large, long lasting robotic propulsion system(s) to land on it and fire.  A kick in a particular direction over the decades could hopefully make enough of a change in the asteroid's orbit that it would miss us.    There are organizations that are trying to figure out the logistics of interstellar space flight right now:             100 Year Starship: http://100yss.org/             Centauri Dreams:  http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?...     But if you wanted to take a lot of people in 50 years:     1.) There would be no where for us to go.      I do not know how long it would take to make Mars habitable, but it             would not be 50 years.    2.) I do not see how the technology to support a growing population of        thousands of people indefinitely with artificial life support could be              created in such a short time.   However; later this month, The European Space Agency's spacecraft (Rosetta) is going to deploy a lander (Philae) on a comet (Comet 67/P).  This should be the 1st time we have landed a craft on a comet.  At least it is a start!
