How will the world end?
My namesake wrote: Fire and Ice Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice. From what I've tasted of desire I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate To say that for destruction ice Is also great And would suffice. Will we devour ourselves in fire through war? Will nature cast down fire upon us? Or will it be ice?  Not necessarily literal ice, but a cooling of energy - the long slow slide of entropy to decay. A million variables, many of which we manipulate today, guide our final fate.  Will we find a way off planet so that Earth's fate is not our own? Or will we stay here and fill up all available space and use up all resources until we collapse under our own weight. Or will technology advance to the point where a misuse of technology, accidental or intentional will destroy us, maybe by ripping space apart... ...or unleashing pandemics that we can't stop. My money is on us getting too big for our britches and causing our own demise.
