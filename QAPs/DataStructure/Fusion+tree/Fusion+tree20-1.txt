As of 2015, what component is the weekest/slowest part of smartphones, that slows everything down?
I'd honestly say batteries and charging. Far too many people are tethered to chargers because their batteries don't last. Processors, RAM, screen resolution, storage and so on are always increasing. Batteries never seem to improve.
