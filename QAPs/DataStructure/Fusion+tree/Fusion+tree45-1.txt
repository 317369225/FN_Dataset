What is the process of dependent origination?
In brief the main process of dependent origination as it is used in Buddhism is as follows. There is a sound (wave of air) and a functioning ear (meaning the ear works and the brain processes the electical signals). When the sound hits the ear and is processed and we become aware (we can also hear but due to our mind having focus on something else we don't notice) there is consciousness of the sound. At this point the notion 'I hear' can rise. This hearing 'I' is only present the moment there is consciousness of the sound. It (I) does not exist independent of the sound. When the sound is not present there is no notion 'I hear'. When there is no seeing there is no notion 'I see'. When there is no thinking there is no notion 'I think'. This I exists only depending on consciousness of 'something' (even if this something is classified as nothing or undefined). The Buddha used easier examples (for example death exists depending on life) to illustrate the point but in the end dependent origination is all about this 'I-making' that is happening based on consciousness.
