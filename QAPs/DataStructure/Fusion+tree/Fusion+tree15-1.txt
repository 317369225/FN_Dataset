Why is there no self in Buddhism?
Not-self (Sanskrit: anātman, Pali: anattā) is best understood within the context of the Buddha’s teaching on the 5 aggregates (Sanskrit: skandhas, Pali: khandhas). Rather than focus on the “self”, the Buddha suggests we see ourselves as a composite of elemental aggregates shared among other sentient beings and the universe. It’s a teaching likely designed to quell our narcissism, and open our minds to a wider—more interconnected—view of existence. Updated 67w ago • View Upvotes
