What contemporary music band do you like the most and why?
Apart from the ones already mentioned, I like four more. 1. Maroon 5 tops the chart. Adam has something different in his voice. Their songs just get stuck in my head at least for few days whenever I listen to them. They are not my all time favorite but they cheer me up whenever I am bored. I particularly like "Payphone", "One more night", "Wake up call", "Never gonna leave this bed", "Won't go home without you" and a few others. One more night - Maroon 5 2. Lady Antebellum - Sweet sweet voice of Hillary Scott and Charles Kelley. All three of them are amazing artists. If you don't know what I am talking about just listen to songs like "Need you now" and "Just a kiss" by Lady Antebellum. The music is soothing to ears. Need you now - Lady Antebellum 3. Fun - Oh how much I love Nate Ruess. I think he is one of the most talented artists in music industry right now. And no matter how hard you try you will never be able to copy his voice. He has a big mouth and he take full advantage of it. Everyone knows about songs like "We are young" and "Just give me a reason (even though it featured only Nate and not Fun)". I also recommend people to listen to songs like "Carry on" and "Some nights". Carry on - Fun 4. Gym class heroes - All rock and roll. It's party time guys and gym class heroes are knocking at your door. The first time I listened to "Ass back home" I could sense myself tapping my legs. "Stereo hearts" is another amazing song by them. I would love to listen more of their music. Ass Back Home - Gym Class Heroes.
