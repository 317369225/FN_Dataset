What happens when a bowler throws the ball to the batsman at the speed of light?
The batting team is awarded an extra run and a Free Hit for a bowl "faster than allowed speed limit". As per the amended rules, a bowler can bowl at the speed of light only once in an over. Exceeding this, the umpire can ask the bowler to forgo rest of the over and penalize the player.
