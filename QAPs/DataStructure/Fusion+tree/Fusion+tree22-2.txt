To what extent did the structure of Proto Indo-European influence Western ideas about grammar and languages?
My impression was PIE was transitional between even earlier agglutinative origins, and the extreme morpheme fusion of the classical languages. Our ideas of what's classy are from the classical cultures. Nobody remembered PIE and in fact there's a great deal we don't know about it. Yes, you can say those languages are descended from PIE, but they also had several thousand years to absorb other influences. One major IE influence on our thinking is not directly from the ancients, but from the 19th century reconstruction of IE, which left Western linguists focused on the tree model of mostly independent divergence from a root, helped by geographic dispersal. Trying to apply this model to other families like Sino-Tibetan has sometimes been much less successful.
