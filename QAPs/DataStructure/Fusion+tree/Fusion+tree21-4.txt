I listen to Porcupine tree, Pink Floyd, Scale the Summit, Opeth, Tool, Dream theater. What similar bands would you suggest I should listen to?
You seem like to be a lot into Progressive rock , Guitar dominated songs maybe ,since you mentioned Scale the Summit. I have almost a similar taste. So, I would give you what I listen to : Pink Floyd : Rush Porcupine Tree : Blackfield, Steven Wilson Solo albums (Raven who refused to sing , Grace for drowning etc.) , STORM CORROSION (Steven Wilson and Mikael's Project), Oceansize (Effloresce - you NEED to listen to this) Opeth : Katatonia(Listen to Brave Murder Day) , Bloodbath (If you want something superheavy maybe) DreamTheater : Amogh Symphony, Motherjane (can't think of more) Tool : A perfect Circle Scale the Sumit : Plini, Animals as Leaders, Cloudkicker, Intervals (maybe trying getting into dent if you haven't already ? ) Well, wrote the artists on the top of my head . Will update this answer soon. Hope you like what you read and hear , eventually. Cheers !
