What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the theory of evolution (in all of its aspects) to be true?
If mutations did not occur (but they do) If organisms could not reproduce (but they can) If offspring did not have heredity (but they do) If the environment had infinite space and resources (but it doesn't) Evolution is amazingly well-understood. We watch it happing, we study how it happened in the past, we use it to modify species for our benefit, we use it in medicine to create antibiotic courses and to curtail disease spread, we simulate it to solve tricky engineering problems. Evolution is a fact. The only way it would not be true is if we lived in a different universe in which is was not true (but we don't)
