Is it possible to further explain E=MC^2?
The equation tells us that energy and mass are the same thing, and how much energy is contained in a given mass, or vice versa. In other words, mass is really very tightly packed energy. For example, replacing M = 1 Kg in the equation means that E = 90000000000000000 Joules, which would be the average house energy bill for 4 million years. That's why nuclear weapons can do so much damage from little material. Einstein must have spent a great deal of his life explaining his most famous equation. Thankfully, though, someone recorded him explaining it. The recording is old, and that, together with Einstein’s accent, sometimes makes it difficult to hear the words properly. This is a transcript of the recording: "It followed from the Special Theory of Relativity that mass and energy are both but different manifestations of the same thing - a somewhat unfamiliar conception for the average mind. Furthermore, the equation E is equal to mc², in which energy is put equal to mass, multiplied with the [by the] square of the velocity of light, showed that very small amounts of mass may be converted into a very large amount of energy and vice versa. The mass and energy were in fact equivalent, according to the formula mentioned before [E = mc²]. This was demonstrated by Cockcroft and Walton in 1932, experimentally."
