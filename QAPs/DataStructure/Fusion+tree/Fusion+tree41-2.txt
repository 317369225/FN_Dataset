Since there is no "self", what's the motivation for us to prolong our lives or take care of our health?
No-self is a concept. A tool. You use a hammer to pound in a nail, because it works best. But the tool is not the thing to be accomplished. A house is a house, not a collection of hammers. The concepts of no-self and emptiness do not mean that you have no physical form, or that feelings are unreal. These things are almost *too* real, and when we attach or become averse to them, we obscure understanding by identifying ourselves completely with form or feeling, and forgetting all else. As such, no-self is a useful way to developing awareness of a 'self', which is rooted in but not wholly form or perception. It is a vantage point that leads to an expansion of understanding, but just as standing on a cliff looking down on a valley doesn't make the valley less real, no-self does not eradicate being. You are defining yourself as a hammer. Come back and build the house.
