How will we know that we have found the Higgs boson?
tl;dr We'll know when various "bumps" in the data are unlikely to be due to statistical variations in the background. First let me explain how "discovery" is canonically treated in particle physics.  Deeply rooted in frequentist statistics, orthodox physics can test new theories only in the narrow confines of hypothesis testing.  Here one judges not the validity of the new theory but rather the failure of the old theory by asking how unlikely an observation is within the realm of the old theory (known as the null hypothesis in statistics).  For example, when a new model is "discovered" with 95% significance what is really meant is "if we could repeat the measurement 100 times, in only 5 of those repetitions would the old model have produced data consistent with our observation and that's just too unlikely for us to continue to support the old model". To complicate matters further, physicists don't quote explicit probabilities in such statements.  Instead one hears of so many [math]\sigma[/math] -- these refer to the integrals of the standard gaussian distribution [1].  One [math]\sigma[/math] is the integral of a centered gaussian from minus [math]\sigma[/math] to plus [math]\sigma[/math], or ~67%: two [math]\sigma[/math] is ~95%, three [math]\sigma[/math] ~99%, and so on.  "Discovery" in physics is arbitrarily set at 5[math]\sigma[/math], a ridiculously high significance from a statistics perspective [2]. In the case of the Higgs boson one first searches in regions of phase space where a model with a Higgs would produce a different signal than a model without one.  The Higgs-less model is then tested and if any anomalies are too large to be explained by statistical fluctuations the old model is rejected in favor of the Higgs model [3]. Once a Higgs model has been "discovered" the searches become a matter of inferring the parameters of that model, such as the mass, charge, and spin of the Higgs boson and its couplings to known particles. Lastly I'd like to note that there is another approach to discovery coming from the Bayesian perspective.  Here one can compare the new and old models and formally ask "which of the two models is more consistent with the data".  This approach even admits a systematic procedure for incorporating model errors.  Unfortunately this philosophy is rare in the particle physics community -- it's hard to change established orthodoxy, after all. [1] It's physics, everything is always gaussian, right? [2] This is largely a consequence of bad approximations in physics.  If the assumptions in the model are incorrect or if systematics, which cannot be incorporated into hypothesis testing in any meaningful way, are large then the significance is biased.  Physicists have kept increasing the discovery threshold in order to prevent these effects from leading to too many false discoveries.  The consequence is that, while new models that are correct will be confirmed eventually, the rejection of the current model will require much more data than would otherwise be necessary. [3] In modern particle physics the significance is determined through Monte Carlo replications, a process much more robust to model assumptions and systematic errors at the expense of huge computational resources.
