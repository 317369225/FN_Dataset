Why do people celebrate and glorify Halloween if it is a holiday that encourages evil?
The children are being prepared for government jobs. OK, that was a snide comment. Halloween was originally a Celtic festival (basically celebrating the harvest), which the Xtians co-opted into All Hallow's Eve (the night before All Saints' Day), which itself may be based on the Roman Lemuria (festival) which is when the evil spirits were driven out of houses. So the costumes and such can be taken to either represents saints rising from the dead to go to their 'just rewards' evil spirits being driven out of houses (and thus the 'trick or treat' to keep them from coming into your home), etc. Of course given the commercialization it's all pretty much a muddle today.
