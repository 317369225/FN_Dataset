Computer Engineering: Which Indian college do you recommend for a school student who is good at mathematics and programming?
If you're interested in pursuing a career in research in Mathematics or Theoretical Computer Science, then you should consider a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science at Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI). The undergraduate courses can be found here: Chennai Mathematical Institute The core coursework is focused more towards Math than Computer Science. However, right from the first semester itself you can take optional courses that interest you. Students also have the option to credit courses from the nearby institute CMI collaborates with, Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc). Courses at CMI and IMSc are  of the highest quality in both Math and TCS. The professors (most of whom are also very active researchers) often offer courses which are close to their current research interests. In some of the TCS courses, we cover really advanced (and exciting!) stuff. For example, on a course  'Advanced Data Structures'  (webpage) , here are some of the topics we covered: Self-adjusting data structures and competitive analysis. Splay trees, Tango trees; Fusion trees; Van Emde Boas trees; Link-cut trees. Data structure lower bounds. Dynamic graph problems: connectivity, shortest paths. Suffix trees and arrays. At CMI, you would also be among some of the smartest young students in the country. On average, we have a batch size of 20 students in Math and CS, who have to clear a difficult entrance exam to get in. Out of these, we would usually have about 2-4 IOI/IMO medalists, and 5-7 students who have cleared the national-level Informatics/Mathematics olympiads. Such a high concentration of really smart people creates an amazing environment  for learning. Updated 160w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Prakash Deivakani
