If an Earth-ending asteroid were 50 years away, what are plausible ways to create an ark-ship?
I would go with placing enormongous jets in the Antarctic to veer the Earth's course to dodge the proverbial bullet. And probably trigger some massive cataclysm on Earth due to an ungodly change in trajectory, thus killing us anyway. Hum... Sounds counterproductive. Now, that's a fact.
