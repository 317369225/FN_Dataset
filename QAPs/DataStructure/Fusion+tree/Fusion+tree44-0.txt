What does prison smell like?
Great question. Prison smells like the corpse of a dead animal used to house the lost souls of unwanted men. San Quentin was built in 1852, so that's over 150 years of neglect, corrosion, and decay mixed with the fear, oppression, and loneliness that comes with incarceration. Prison reeks of thousands upon thousands of men from diverse cultural, ethnic, and hygienic backgrounds confined to endure a hostile environment plagued with dehumanizing factors. No amount of false bravado in the form of rusted steel weaponry or tattoo-inked war paint can hide the smell of the guilt and shame that oozes defiantly from the pores of caged and wounded animals in search of redemption. It's possible to smell the blood in the water and taste the acrid tension in the air as the sharks circle to inflict the irony of prison yard justice on an outcast among castaways. Over time, it has become very necessary to desensitize myself to the nefarious odors of prison life. Whether it comes from the blood, sweat, and tears that stain moldy mattresses and prison blues, or the garbage and filth that litters that catwalks and gun rails of the cell blocks, no one can escape the fact that the foul air we breathe is a reflection of the foulness we've manifested in our lives. The only way out is by trudging our way through the stench of tear gas, riot gear, and smoke grenades. In a prison this old, there is no amount of bleach or disinfectants that will ever make it smell clean again. I hope to one-day walk out of these iron gates and dive head first into the Pacific Ocean. Immersing myself and finally being able to cleanse the smell of prison from my skin and ultimately my soul.
