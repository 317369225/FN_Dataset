What do you recommend for someone who wants to explore jazz music for the first time?
I can only speak personally, but my musical evolution from rock music fan to someone who also loves jazz began with European progressive acts in the 1970s.  Bands like Yes, Camel, Genesis and King Crimson used more challenging time signatures and progressions (hence the name of the genre) than standard rock groups.  Once I began to thirst for more challenging music, jazz was just a natural realm to explore.  The next step for me was jazz fusion.  Jeff Beck's album 'Blow By Blow' (1975) was a crucial stepping stone.  Frank Zappa's stuff was pivotal as well.  Then a friend introduced me to Weather Report.  WR was the most significant bridge for me from fusion to let's say, pure jazz.  Around 1976 I went on a serious Blue Note bender.  Lee Morgan, Art Blakey (drummer!) and Miles Davis really captured my musical imagination.  I also got into the ECM label of jazz performers at this time like Gary Burton (vibes!), Keith Jarrett and Eberhard Weber.  From this point I began to explore the real challenging stuff like Ornette Coleman's adventures in 'Free Jazz'.  Coleman's 'Dancing in Your Head' totally nailed me. I required an evolutionary process here.  If you'd have played 'Dancing in Your Head' for me when I was in high school I wouldn't have gotten it.  It would have been so much noise to me.  I'm not saying everyone needs to go through such a process, but I suspect many do.  It's a bit of a musical leap from a typical rock tune to an intricate piece by the likes of ol' Miles, Thelonious Monk or Charles Mingus.  But it's a journey worth taking.  Investments in jazz music can pay rich dividends.
