What would happen if all the water in the ocean was replaced with deuterium oxide?
The size of the ice caps (melting point 4 degree C) would suddenly increase and more of our planet would record snowfall. Tea and coffee would be perceptibly hotter (boiling point 101.4 degree C) and might scald your mouth. All the weights and standards would have to be revised (density 1.106 g/ml). Above all, your body weights would register an increase despite your strict regimen. What else?
