Since there is no "self", what's the motivation for us to prolong our lives or take care of our health?
I think you have confused some concepts in Buddhism. The three hallmarks of all conditioned experience are anicca (impermanence), dukkha (unsatisfactory, stressful, causing suffering), and anatta (not-self). The three poisons are greed, aversion, delusion. When the three poisons are eliminated, that is, by definition, nirvana. Not-self is not the same as no-self. You are experiencing dissociation. This is what happens when mindfulness meditation is not coupled with metta meditation. Wisdom and compassion must be cultivated together.
