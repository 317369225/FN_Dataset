To what extent did the structure of Proto Indo-European influence Western ideas about grammar and languages?
Not very much.  As Joachim Pense points out, Latin had a major influence on how Western approaches to grammar developed; at that point most of your points seem to answer themselves, no?  I'll add that there is no final step in the grammaticalization cycle: It's a cycle precisely because it goes around.  Isolating structures get grammaticized, and then start to lose their phonological independence. Then they become affixes and clitics and the like, in an agglutinating way.  Then, these start to lose their independence, and so forth.
