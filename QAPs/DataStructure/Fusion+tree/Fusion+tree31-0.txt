What are some interesting things to do/see in New Orleans?
Get a bike and explore Uptown, Magazine Street, the lower garden district, French Quarter, Marigny, Bywter and Treme. Listen to WWOZ and pick up the Gambit or Offbeat to find shows; or go to the Spotted Cat or Donna's and see what's playing. Eat po-boys at Verti Marte, and Jambalaya at Coops. Drink at Molly's, all while riding your bike. Updated 201w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
