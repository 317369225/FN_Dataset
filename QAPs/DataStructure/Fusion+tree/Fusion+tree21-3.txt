I listen to Porcupine tree, Pink Floyd, Scale the Summit, Opeth, Tool, Dream theater. What similar bands would you suggest I should listen to?
If you want to stretch your mind a little you should listen to the Mahavishnu Orchestra, particularly the first two records, The Inner Mounting Flame and Birds of Fire. These jazz-fusion records were hugely influential in their day (early '70s) and inspired many progressive rock guitarists and drummers.
