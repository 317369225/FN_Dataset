What does prison smell like?
I had to think on this question for a while, mainly because I'm housed in the dorms of San Quentin, not the cell blocks. If you've ever been to a zoo, that gives you some idea. One minute you're walking around, not smelling anything in particular; the next minute, you catch a whiff of primates flinging feces. Other than not smelling anything in particular, the most common smell in the dorms is gastrointestinal. As for the cell blocks, it's been a long time since I've been housed there. In San Quentin's North Block - a more static population - I remember the air being stale and sometimes humid. There's no distinct smell except in the evenings when those who forgo the state's offering in the dining hall cook their own meals. In West Block, the population is far more dynamic people move in and out all the time. Yet, the predominant smell was funk mixed with filth. Maybe that's changed, but it's still my lasting impression. All communications between inmates and external channels are facilitated by approved volunteers since inmates do not have access to the internet.
