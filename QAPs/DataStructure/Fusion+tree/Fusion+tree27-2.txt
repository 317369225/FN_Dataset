What makes every Opeth song equally legendary?
I would like to credit an unsung hero here : Martin Mendez..(apart from the stellar musicmanship of Mikael) Obviously, the songwriting is very nice, laced with groovy guitar layers, the right amount of drum work with some haunting lyrics.. but something that takes the songs higher up a notch is the bass work. I mean if you have heard songs like Hope Leaves, they will almost make you feel jealous of the bass guy.. it's just so melodic, tight and... right! Martin has been through a number of Opeth years now and he is pivotal in cementing the other genres of music Opeth is known to venture into like fusion or acoustic jazz. I just love the tone of his bass in the songs and I think one can attribute it to the sound engineering too. Secondly, Opeth like Porcupine Tree(not necessarily following them, but still PT has had a big impact on their sound according to Mikael) is dedicated not just to create music but rather to create an artistic experience for the listener that adds completeness to their sound and makes it awesome! And third, they are not scared to go out of their whatever-brand-of-metal-people-think-they-play metal genre and try out different things to add value to their songs. Let's hope the legendary stuff just keeps coming in.
