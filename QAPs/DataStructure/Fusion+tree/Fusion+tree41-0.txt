Since there is no "self", what's the motivation for us to prolong our lives or take care of our health?
This is not the removal of the concept of self at all. It's nihilism, sorry to say that. And it's causing you stress since you feel out of control, unable to find a direction. Experience stress and you've missed the goal. The three marks are: it's not mine to keep, it will change, it does not give satisfaction. You think you have hit the right thing with 'no self' yet you did not remove the part that removes the 'no satisfaction' part. It's fake, it's counterfeit. When you experience stopping of self identification (which is prior to full insight in no-self) you will be relieved, a burden will be gone. As you see I used three different descriptions for the three marks. It might help you see the error.
