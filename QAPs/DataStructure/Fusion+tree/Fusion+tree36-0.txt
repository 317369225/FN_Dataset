Suppose you had a very large amount of electricity from a source that does not produce carbon (e.g., fusion). What process would you deploy to remove CO2 from the atmosphere?
plant more trees. OK, so if your electrical energy was pelntiful and cheap (or already paid for) then the obvious thing to do it to First:  replace all the electricity from coal-burning and shut down the coal plants. Convert all other coal burning plnts (smelters etc) to electric. Second replace all the gas fired electrical plants THird, ban all gasoline cars and move to all electric rechargable cars. That will reduce a great deal (80%) of the CO2 generation. But that still leaves CO2 in the atmosphere. The most effective ways to get rid of CO2 are ocean abosrbtion and plant photosynthesis. collecting CO2 is likely to be difficult. It would take a huge amount of electricity to filter the world's air and seperate the CO2 for treatment. The it takes a large amount of energy (again, it's free electricity we are talking about?) to break down CO2 into Carbon and Oxygen.  About the same energy we got from combusting the Carbon in the first place.
