How will we know that we have found the Higgs boson?
There are several Higgs decay channels ([math]H\to\gamma\gamma[/math], [math]H\to bb[/math], [math]H\to\tau\tau[/math], [math]H\to gg[/math], [math]H\to WW[/math], [math]H\to ZZ[/math], etc.) The standard model predicts the rates and the branching ratios (how often the processes occur relative to each other) very precisely. An excess of events that is seen in many independent channels can be tested for consistency with the standard model by looking at these rates and branching ratios. Below is a plot (taken from http://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesi...) showing the branching ratios as a function of higgs mass: Caveat: I am not a particle physicist; read their answers.
