What are some interesting facts about chemistry?
Every year on October 23 from 6:02 am to 6:02 pm, chemistry students and chemists celebrate Mole Day in honor of Avogadro’s number (6.022×10^23), the number of carbon atoms in 12 grams of carbon. There is about 1/2lb or 250g of table salt (NaCl) in the body of an average adult human. One inch of rain is equal to 10 inches of snow.

The human body contains enough carbon to produce graphite for about 9,000 pencils. Copper is the only metal that is naturally antibacterial. Tabletop "volcanoes" can be created using 'Vesuvian Fire' compound Ammonium dichromate. Graphite can be transformed into diamond by applying a temperature of 3000°C and pressure of 100,000 atm. The element Californium is often called the most expensive substance in the world Gallium is a metal which melts on palm of the hand, due to its low melting point (29.76 °C) Mosquitoes like the scent of estrogen, hence, women get bitten by mosquitoes more often than men do.
