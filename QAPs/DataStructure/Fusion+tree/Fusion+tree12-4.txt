What are good progressive rock and post-rock bands that I should listen to?
Progressive Rock: Dali's Dilemma Attention Deficit Argent Yes Uriah Heap Liquid Tension Experiment Jethro Tull Somnambulist The Soft Machine Rush Fates Warning Dream Theater (though they border on Prog Metal, so here's some Prog Metal too. ) Symphony X Adagio Spiral Architect Pain of Salvation Ne Obliviscaris Arabesque Some might be repeats but I distinctly recall at the time of my posting that there was a distinct lack of Dream Theater.  I know they push a little heavier sometimes, but their roots are in Progressive Rock.  Post-Rock: Salvatore Amiina Bark Psychosis Butterfly Explosion Lateduster Junior Blue Lanterna Pure Reason Revolution Yume Bitsu The Octopus Project Winter Equinox Several of those border on Indie Rock or Shoegaze, but they have progressive elements.
