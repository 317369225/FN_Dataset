If the earth was the center of our solar system with the sun orbiting around it, how would that affect life on earth?
Have you ever tried to balance a bowling ball on top of a chopstick? That is the gravitational situation you are describing. In the bowling ball example, the situation would very quickly end with the bowling ball on the floor. That is because the scenario really wants to reach a stable energy state. All scenarios, in fact. That is why planets orbit stars and not the other way around. Actually there is a bit more to it, as planets form from junk left over after stars are mostly formed, but that is the idea. Regarding your specific wonderings - there would be no seasons, no day, no average temperature, and no liquid water, because Earth would quickly be annihilated.
