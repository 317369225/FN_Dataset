Why do people celebrate and glorify Halloween if it is a holiday that encourages evil?
Halloween is not a "holiday for evil". Unfortunately, church peeps love to blow things out of proportion as much as gossip magazines do, although for slightly different purposes. It used to be said that on Halloween night the gates of the otherworld opened and things from beyond came into the world. (in other parts of the world, the 1st of November is the Day of the Dead, people go to cemeteries and remember their dead and everything) Now, what's there in the spiritual world? Well... good stuff. And evil stuff. Loads of demons and bad spirits which will hurt you if they can. Luckily, traditional evil is kind of stupid, so it can be tricked by people putting a mask on. If it's an 'evil' mask, then demons think you're one of their own and leave you alone. If anything, I'd say that this is a "holiday for outwitting evil".
