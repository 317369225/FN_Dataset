As of 2015, what component is the weekest/slowest part of smartphones, that slows everything down?
Batteries. In 'god game' type video games (such as Civilization), there is something called a 'tech tree'. You discover technologies to move up the tree towards higher technical sophistication. Sometimes though, there is an enabling technology that sits before a big branch, and without this technology you cannot advance at all. Writing, metalwork and computers are all such enabling technologies; once you have then, your tech tree options grow considerably beause they enable lots of other semingly unrelated technology directions. If you move away from video games and look at our tech tree, then one of the major things we are missing is a high energy density portable source, or to put it simply 'we don't have good batteries'. The closest we have of the required energy density is petrochemicals, but this technology cannot be made small enough for wearable technology, and isnt suitable for many applications for a number of reasons. Â If we had such a power source, not only would phones be much faster but we immediately enable lots of other things such as; Cybernetics; wearable prosththetics and even human-implanted power sources, that allows a completely new field of electronics/'wetware' Fully autonomous robots Efficient space propulsion and compact power sources for off-world habitation, allowing us to colonize the solar system far easier than current. Makes solar energy very viable, and potentially the only input power source we need, forever... and if we need more, a high density energy storage medium makes things like fusion power generation much more feasible. So its not just phones; batteries are a big enabling technology generally; we are like a disgruntled kid at christmas when it comes to power sources - someone forgot to buy the batteries!
