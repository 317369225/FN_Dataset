What makes every Opeth song equally legendary?
That's a very subjective judgement! What I can say is that: 1) Most of their songs last at least 5-6'. Every song is a story in itself. They succeed in making every one of them very consistent (there's a theme, then variations on that theme, then eventually it comes back to that theme) so that you have the sensation to have really travelled a long road! 2) They use quite "epic" chord progressions. They don't just do "power chords", they usually play the whole minor chord, which enriches their harmonies and make their music more "impressive", almost baroque. Furthermore they use chord progressions that are similar to those of folkloric traditional songs which gives this mysterious, unique touch to their music. 3) They have a true, consistent artistic vision. They have a concept between each album, they pay a lot of attention to their artwork, the lyrics, the type of sound and "texture" they want to make in their music. 4) Their music have long instrumental parts. They can make an epic keyboard or guitar solo, they can change the tonality of the song, they can switch to acoustic guitar or piano. This leaves space for imagination and dream. 5) The instruments/musicians. Mikael Akerfeldt has a very deep voice and with a very musical sensibility. It's super impressive in live (he also has a subtle swedish accent when he speaks english). They use very good quality guitars (Paul Reed Smith). They have a keyboard player that uses very 70s-like organ sounds which gives a really cool atmosphere. 6) They're insanely heavy in live. They're like semi-gods from Scandinavian mythology or like Vikings in a war boat :)
