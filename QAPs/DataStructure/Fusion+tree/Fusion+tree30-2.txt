It's 2150 and society has collapsed. What happened?
Ugh.  Do I have to? I'm bullish on humanity.  Baring something really bad, we're resilient and creative enough to survive with our current level of technology.  There are certainly things that can do us in: hyper vulcanism, asteroid impacts, solar flairs or rogue singularities could all exterminate us and we'd likely never be able to survive any of those events.  The only semi-likely thing to happen is of our own hand and NO not the "we use up all our resource" trope, but the release of an extremely virulent plague that devastates so much of humanity that all societies collapse.
