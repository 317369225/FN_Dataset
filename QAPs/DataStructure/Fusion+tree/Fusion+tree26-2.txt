What are some interesting facts about chemistry?
Water is also a rare substance that when it is a solid (ice) it floats on top of its liquid form.   If you pour a handful of salt in to a glass of water, the water  level will go down.   Water has the highest surface tension of any liquid with the exception of Mercury.   Water has the highest specific heat capacity of all liquids   Water is a universal solvent. "dissolves more solids that any other liquid"   Solids can skip the liquid state and move straight to a gas through sublimation   Another amazing thing is Helium in super fluidity state. It will climb out of its container because, it has zero viscosity. This happens when you cool helium close to absolute zero.     http://www.bpc.edu/mathscience/c...   http://www.pdhcenter.com/courses...
