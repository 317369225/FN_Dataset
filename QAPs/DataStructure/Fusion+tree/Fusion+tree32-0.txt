Why should atheists be given leave on religious holidays?
If it's a public holiday the "leave" should be given freely and to all people equally regardless of their belief system.  Re:  "If atheists are not comfortable with the concept of God," You're stretching.  Atheists can only be accurately described as not holding a belief in a god, that's not.  Not one single other thing can be attributed to atheists as a group.  Not one.  Period. Nothing.  Comfort, is your assertion.  Moreover, atheists aren't a hive group, stop referring to people as a "them".  Humans are individuals Re:  ". . .why do they happily accept holidays named after Gods?" For the same reason that I happily have weekends off when both days are named after religious things.  For the same reason I happily call the months of the calendar what they are even though many are named after deities.  You, fretting about religious connections is about you, not atheists.  The reason I happily accept paid days off is because they're fucking PAID DAYS OFF.  I'd take the goddamned paid days off if they were named after Stalin or King Leopold II.  Why would I care?  THEY ARE PAID DAYS OFF. Who's with me?  Stalinfest 2015!  Leomas 2016!
