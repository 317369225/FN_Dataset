What do I need to know going into this Super Bowl if I haven't watched any of the games for either team this year?
Keep saying, "Denver needs to establish their running game to keep pressure off Manning.  But Wilson needs to pass early to get his running backs through the line."  Neither is really true.  But some version or other of the first statement has been repeated steadily for 50 years.  So the second statement makes you sound really sophisticated. You need to keep Velveeta and Salsa microwaving away together, so you can always point to a mouth full of dip when challenged.  You need to watch really closely just before the game starts to get which jersey color goes with which team (jerseys are the tops).  Then you won't groan and swear when "your" team scores a touchdown. And you need to remember that most everyone is there for the drinks and food.  So don't talk too much during the game.
