If the earth was the center of our solar system with the sun orbiting around it, how would that affect life on earth?
Since this can't be done without messing up our understanding of physics, let's just point out that what you describe was the understanding of reality for millennia. Indeed it is well known that Galileo was placed under house arrest for doubting this old understanding, and he was not forgiven by the Catholic Church until 1992. During those millennia (and for some millions of years before that) the seasons continued, the length of day was essentially the same, global climate was similar with a few fluctuations, and the oceans were much as they are now. That is the shift in perspective makes no practical difference to what is happening in reality. On the other hand if you want to change what happens in reality, then you have a lot of work to do to describe your new reality before anyone can produce reliable predictions from it. The description given is insufficient to answer the questions posed.
