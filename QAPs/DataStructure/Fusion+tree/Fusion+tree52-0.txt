What are the best restaurants in Seattle's International District?
These are my favorites: Tamarind Tree: Vietnamese Fusion, it is hidden behind a parking lot but it is a gem in the rough!  Get the Tamarind Tree Noodles with a condensed milk lemonade! tamarindtreerestaurant.com/ Thai Curry Simple: Amazingly delicious thai curry hole in the wall. It's cheap too! www.thaicurrysimple.com Samurai Noodle: Their ramen is to die for!  I dream of it when I'm not in seattle. Get the pork broth, you can thank me later! samurainoodle.com Oasis Bubble Tea: I think it might be the best bubble tea place in the west coast of the US!  Get an avocado + blueberry mix with bubbles.  Great place to come on a weekend night and feel like you are no longer in the US but somewhere in Taiwan.
