Why hasn't there been a single prominent or influential civilization which has come out of Africa (except Egypt (held areas of Asia Minor), Carthage (held Spain), the Berbers (held Spain))?
I actually had a hard time believing this was a real question, and not someone just trolling. ... there aren't a lot of African civilizations which made progress in art, philosophy, science, math, progress of religion or culture...Are you serious? Then I realized you were referencing Wikipedia. The proper question would be: "Why is there such a dearth of information relating to African civilization(s) on Wikipedia, and why is the information that is there collated so badly?" To establish if "there (has) been a single prominent or influential civilization from Africa" lets start with this: King Mansa Musa of Mali named richest person of all time "...his shocking wealth came from his country’s vast production of more than half the world’s supply of salt and gold...” I'll just give quick examples for each of your points For art: Igbo Ukwu- "hundreds of ritual vessels and regalia castings of bronze or leaded  bronze that are among the most inventive and technically accomplished  bronzes ever made" Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History For science: "In 1706 a slave, Onesimus, explained to Cotton Mather how he had been inoculated (against smallpox) as a child in Africa" Cotton Mather For math: African Fractals For religion: Ile Awo Orisa For philosophy: Ubuntu (philosophy) For culture: Obelisk returned to Axum: SMDH that I even need to do this.
