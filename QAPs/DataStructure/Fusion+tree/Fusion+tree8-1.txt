What are some of the most mind-blowing facts about Kolkata?
The fact that Kolkata has been home to 5 Nobel Laureates is by far the most gratifying and amazing fact I have come across. They are: Sir Ronald Ross (1902, Medicine) Rabindranath Tagore (1913, Literature; first Asian to win the Nobel Prize) C V Raman (1930, Physics Mother Teresa (1979, Peace) Amartya Sen (1998, Economics) I believe this is the highest of any mainland Asian city (barring Tokyo and Kyoto). Now, that is something to be immensely proud of. Source: List of people from Kolkata List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation
