If the earth was the center of our solar system with the sun orbiting around it, how would that affect life on earth?
You would need first to decide what law(s) of nature you want to violate to make this happen. Because the mass of the Sun is so much greater than the Earth's you would need an entirely different law of gravity to justify having the sun (and the other planets) revolve around the earth.   Or different laws of motion.  You cannot really make the Sun smaller than the earth since it would then not be able to generate energy via nuclear fusion. But if you are free to arbitrarily set aside rules of nature, then it would have quite an impact on everything from how trees grow, to the feasibility of airplanes.
