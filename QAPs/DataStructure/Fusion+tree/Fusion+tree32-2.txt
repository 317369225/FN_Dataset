Why should atheists be given leave on religious holidays?
A funny thing happened while I was starting to answer this question. I just realized that I don't actually know how many of my friends - including some very close, personal friends - actually, truly believe in God (or hold any other particular religious belief). We celebrate tons of holidays together, including officially religious ones like Christmas - and it just hasn't come up. That's how little religion has to do with our holiday celebrations. We want to be with each other and have a good time. Why would I not happily accept the time off to spend with friends and family however we please? The fact that the holiday is religious is, at that point, essentially a historical footnote - a piece of trivia. I'll bet you didn't wonder why non-Christian couples celebrate Saint Valentine's day.
