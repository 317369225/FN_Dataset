If an Earth-ending asteroid were 50 years away, what are plausible ways to create an ark-ship?
To stay in the spirit of the question, I'll take this to mean that you're describing an asteroid on the scale of a Ceres, at approximately 300Miles or 450KM  in diameter, so the diversion simply wouldn't work, even given 50 years. (say a Rogue planet came through and passed close enough to pull Ceres into an orbit headed our way). This way we're out of options except for leaving. We could even go so far as to say a rogue planet, itself, was headed our way, something larger than earth itself, making ideas of diverting it or earth out of the question of feasibility, as even the gravitationally disturbance of a near miss of such a planet could doom earth. I'd say the first step is to treat this like a World War II economy, with as much economic activity as possible diverted to the effort, with the beneficial distinction that all nations work together, rather than separately. Clearly this might exclude nations so caught up in their own cultural trifles, but no time to worry about them. At which point I think we go STEM education all the way. I like some of the other ideas, particularly William Ewing 's idea of building O'Neill cylinders. I think the only way we are going to succeed at saving a sizable percentage of the population is to build some form of a Space elevator. This would require upping the production of carbon nanotubes dramatically. So I think that would be one of the many initial parallel tracks with a parallel focus of research. This project would have to occur along the equator to gain the full advantage of the geosynchronous satellite, which limits the facilities locations to being in South America, Africa and Indonesia.  In general, Europe and Africa would focus their efforts on the African space elevators, the far east and Australia/New Zealand areas would focus their efforts on the Indonesian space elevators and North and South America would focus their efforts on the South American Space Elevators. Projects should probably proceed in parallel on sites chosen for maximum stability and minimum weather variance. Regarding weather, wind turbine should be placed near each site so that weather variance can be offset ny active stabilization coming from the power generated by the turbines. The Indonesian Stations should probably also be running tidal power systems. In regards to power systems, with the earth doomed, Nuclear power needs to get a stronger green light for earth's quick sprint to the finish line, and environment concerns that have more than a 50 year horizon should be abandoned in favor of powering the construction of the initial space elevators, and ultimately the full space stations. Inflatable structures should be used around the elevators to enable the building of massive protective zones around the space elevator cables. By having the structures be pressurized, rather than free standing, the material needs would be greatly reduced, and the potential sizes of the structures greatly increased. All (or as close to all as geo-politics allows) money formerly devoted to defense should be devoted to gearing up the R&D efforts. World Fusion efforts should declassify and combine forces. Genetic engineering should proceed with the goal of vastly improving the economies. The idea of keeping primitive people in the dark should be abandoned, and people who are trained as missionaries should be purposed to let these indigenous populations know that this world is going to end. Computer resources should be devoted to materials science and advanced molecular self-manufacturing, along the scales of automation that trees do naturally now. The idea is that we keep the elevators sending material up constantly, and the Geosynchronous outpost would be a location of non-stop materials assembly into space station structures. The idea of finding another habitable planet will be put on hold, for now. The arks (yes, more than one, many more) will instead need to be designed to be a permanent homes, but built on scales like we've never before imagined. As a result, a whole set of research projects that need to be spearheaded on earth aimed at producing permanently habitable space stations. Fusion Power needs high focus, because Fossil fuels, and probably even Fission power just won't cut it given both the confines and the huge needs of our eventual homes. Sustainable living research, along the lines of Biosphere 2, solving the problems of providing a full cycle ecosystem Biomimicry of Tree-like growth processes, but under computer design, and in materials beyond wood's capacity, possibly even bio-growing our carbon nanotubes and graphene sheets via photosynthesis. And this is along with the research we need to do to get the space elevators off the ground (literally) Mass Production of extremely long carbon fibers Massive inflatable structural architectures. Laser based power systems to push cables upward. And there will need to be re-engineering and organized on massive scales. Supply lines need to be optimized to go from raw materials centers to the space elevators assembly areas. Huge irrigation projects need to be undertaken to build cities and infrastructures around the projects, with possible desalination and distillation efforts involved to use sea water. *** After-thought addendum - The space arks themselves *** Several people answered about the need to find a new world, later. I'm going to contend that a set of arks, well-built, would be a better permanent residence, once fusion power was mastered, than earth itself is. So I think the plan isn't an ark, but a new, space-faring way of living in which we build enormous space stations, building the original scaffolds, and seeds, from materials lifted from earth, but filling out the space stations, possibly even after the impact destroys earth, from the materials available in the asteroid belt. So the concept is that these structures will, ultimately, be massive, on a scale that would eventually give us more usable land and ocean mass than the earth does now. So how do we build them? The same research I mentioned above into inflatable materials to build super-massive earth structures would also apply to the scaffolds used to build the space stations. The idea of using inflatable superstructures to build the early scaffolding of the space structures would greatly simplify a lot of the material requirements. This would facilitate the building of enormous superstructures on the ground while requiring minimal material. These structures could be rolled up like a bicycle inner tube, highly compact pre-inflation. And then inflated, once they in place up at the geosynchronous satellite. And since that satellite will be above the 23,000 mile basic orbit, they can use minimal active prolusion to be set free, slingshot like, off to the asteroid belt though carefully aimed to specific locations. As to how much air is needed, we live on the 21% partial pressure of oxygen. Plants don't do much with the nitrogen in the air (which is 78%) mainly just using the 1% CO2. One big savings would be to reduce the air pressure of structure from the sea level pressure here on earth, to 22%. This would reduce the tensile strength requirements of the scaffolding materials to handling 4 lbs per square inch rather than 15 in the non-weight bearing portions. With early successes at building super-massive superstructures, we could mine much of the material needed from the asteroid belt, rather than from the earth itself. And that could also act as a fall back plan should the space elevator approach fail some critical physical or technological limitation, that is, the building of massive inflatable super-structures that will act as scaffolds to be built up from the more gravitationally available material in the asteroid belt, might help to give us both super large, space cannons, and hyper-light rocketry. Ultimately, with the asteroid belt's material at our command, we could have many independent O'Neil cylinders that would have, in total, far more surface area to walk on than the earth has now. However, instead of walking in a situation where between yourself and the center of earth was 35000 miles of planetary layers, you'd be walking on a self-repairing (thanks to the Tree-like nanotechnology) floor that separated you from outer space by about 100 feet of material, the last 5 feet of which would contain the hydrogel like material Nasa researched for making meteorite impacts non-destructive (see comments). The interesting aspect is that, once this is underway, and we've began to master fusion, we could begin to be independent even of the sun itself, meaning we'd be well positioned to survive whatever happens to the solar system. A couple of points on power. An enormous amour of power, now, is used to generate light a night, heat when it's cold, and cold when it's warm. And a lot of our caloric needs come from fighting gravity, keeping warm, and breathing. Breathing in a 22% pressure, pure oxygen environment, and running at below earth's gravity levels might greatly reduce our initial needs while we master our new homes. *** end of addendum *** While this seems daunting, possibly far fetched, I have always been amazed at the speed with which World War II galvanized so many nations to achieve such amazing things, unfortunately for such a decidedly destructive purpose. And what the US was able to do in the 1960s, culminating with landing someone on the moon in an era when pocket calculators were out of the reach of the ordinary person, and computers were owned only by large companies, governments and universities. I actually think we could pull this off, if we had to, and save almost all of the able bodied people around the world. The Manhattan Project happened in a couple of years. The US space race in only 10, and this with technology and world-wide communication abilities that would embarrass a middle-schooler. And there will be a huge freeing up of resources if we don't have to be so much in fear of each other. I've always thought that the biggest impediment to our success in the world is that we've organized so much of it so that it is man verses man, and so little that it is man verses nature. I'm glad we don't have to do this, because there's a lot of great non-STEM things going on in the world, and war time economies are not fun. But I think it's something we could do if we had to. That's what we're really good at, as a species, doing what absolutely positively must be done, when we are given no other choice. Updated 59w ago • View Upvotes
