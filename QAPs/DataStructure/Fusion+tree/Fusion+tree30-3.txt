It's 2150 and society has collapsed. What happened?
Everyone was watching the seismographs, the thermometers; no one looking at themselves. That was the real mistake. There's a thing, called a tipping point, happens when a boat gets too top-heavy, too unbalanced, it tips over and everyone drowns. I think we always knew that humanity had a tipping point, but we kind of ignored it. More senseless gun rampages, more horrific child abuse, more wars, cannibalism, more - everything. All the tell-tale signs of a species going crazy. Then one day it just happened. The hateful thoughts of seven billion hate filled people, just hit the tipping point. Maybe it happened when the seventh billionth and one starving child was born into a shithole and bayoneted one second later. Maybe it happened with the last thought of a shitty Madison Avenue account Exec having a fatal heart attack in the back of a yellow cab driven by a Moldovan in the shitty New York heat and humidity. But all these thoughts made a bridge to something, and Something bridged back.
