If the earth was the center of our solar system with the sun orbiting around it, how would that affect life on earth?
Maybe you could do it without violating any laws of nature by adding another sun.  The two stars circle around each other, and the Earth is at a, what do you call it, a LaGrange point between them.  The radius of the circle they describe would have to be more than the 92 million miles, or we'd heat up too much.  Gravity wouldn't change appreciably, but the seasons and daylight would. Of course, it wouldn't be "our solar system."
