Why is there no self in Buddhism?
Citta, cetasika, rupa, nibbana Only these four exist. Citta and cetasika are namma (mind and mental phenomena). Rupa is rupa (physical body). Nibbana is the state of being free from arising (birth) and falling away (death). Here the answer is birth and death. Self means to control. One is incapable of keeping oneself from aging and death. This body (metaphysical body) is subject of arising and falling away, the process that happens constantly. Birth is followed by aging and death and respiration is cycle (samsara). Consciousness arises with feeling Upaya Sutta: Attached Consciousness is not constant. When there is nothing to hear, hearing consciousness doesn't exist/happen. When there is something to hear (a sound), hearing happens. Hearing is conditioned by sound. Hearing doesn't last, it falls away instantly. [Some monks in Mahayana schools meditate on sound to understand anicca and anatta (I think).] Seeing... Tast... Touch... Smell... Thought... All these six senses (five physical senses) can be watched/observed to understand anicca and anatta. No self is called anatta. Atta is self so anatta is no self. Suñña Sutta: Empty The Longer Discourse to Saccaka This is a debate on atta anatta. Access to Insight Search Results Read this too about Baka Brahma BUDDHA'S EIGHTH GLORIOUS VICTORY
