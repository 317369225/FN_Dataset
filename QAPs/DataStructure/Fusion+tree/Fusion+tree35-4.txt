Why do people celebrate and glorify Halloween if it is a holiday that encourages evil?
Hallowe'en in America has nothing to do with glorifying evil. Hallowe'en was always an excuse for kids to dress up in costumes and get free candy. I was about to say what Marcus Geduld already said: that Hallowe'en is inspired by the old Samhain festival does not mean we are worshipping Druidic deities. My own example: The Greek basis of the word "gymnasium" was "nudity." That does not mean anyone works out in the nude in a gymnasium in America. For the kids, Hallowe'en was always fun. That is really all that needs to be said.
