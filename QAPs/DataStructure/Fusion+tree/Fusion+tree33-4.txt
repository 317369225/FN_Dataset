What are five odd or generally-unknown facts about outer space?
1. A human body generates more energy per volume than the nuclear fusion from the core of the sun which burns at millions of degrees! Sun's core generates 276.5 watt/m^3!  That is similar to an average living room light per volume of a washing machine! 2. A star far far away can potentially end all life on earth at any given day.  A collapsing massive star can potentially cause gamma ray burst energetic and focused enough to blow away our atmosphere when hit. 3. Olbers' paradox: If the universe is infinitely large and infinitely old, entire sky would be as bright as the sun, unless laws of physics over large distances is somehow different. 4. When you look at a picture of tilted spiral galaxy, the image from the far side of the galaxy is when it was several hundred thousand years younger than from that of the near side. 5. There is gravity in space.  Astronauts in orbit seem to be in zero gravity only because they are "giving up" to earth's gravity and are constantly falling towards the earth, but with enough lateral velocity to miss it.
