What do you recommend for someone who wants to explore jazz music for the first time?
Fusion began in the 70's and has not aged well. It did serve as a stepping stone for some rock fans (myself included) to transition into jazz listeners. However, much of music we call fusion from that era now sounds more like disco than jazz, and what is called fusion nowadays is often more formulaic than creative. One exception is Weather Report. Very creative stuff. I would start with a recording like "Mysterious Traveler." Quirky, but ultimately great. I would second David Durham's response on other suggestions as well. Especially since you have already discovered bands like Porcupine Tree, a better transition to jazz might be progressive rock artists. Understand that complex music of any sort requires some time commitment. Two or three listens are not enough. This is true for much jazz as well as most progressive rock. Once you grasp it though, you are much more likely to love this music forever, unlike most 3-chord pop/rock tunes that you will wonder why they moved you at all. Once you get what's going on, you're sure to agree that the percussionists on prog rock and jazz recordings tend to be far superior to most rock/pop. I expect this will inspire you to new heights in your playing. In short, it's an investment in time that you will be glad you made.
