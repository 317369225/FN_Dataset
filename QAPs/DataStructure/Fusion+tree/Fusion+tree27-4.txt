What makes every Opeth song equally legendary?
Every time I have heard an Opeth song, I have identified with at least one element in it. If not the lyrics (which are beautiful poetry in themselves), then the incredibly intelligent chord progressions, or solos that invoke a pleasurable sense of melancholy, if I may describe it that way. Very few musicians can move the listener to tears, and Opeth has done that to me (Black Rose Immortal). I've drawn strength in overcoming social anxiety listening to 'Hours of Wealth'. I suppose what I'm trying to say is that each different song reveals the talented genius that is Opeth in it's own way. I for one cannot pick one particular song out because the end of each song is like a slight pause for breath, until the next one begins and I can drift away in it again..... In the rays of the sun I am longing for the darkness.
