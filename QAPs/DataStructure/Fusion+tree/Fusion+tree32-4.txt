Why should atheists be given leave on religious holidays?
The same reason American Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Scientologists, and every other non-Christian still gets Christmas off. It's just the reality of having a pluralistic and open society that nevertheless celebrates only the holidays of one particular religion as legal holidays! Atheists basically just accept that they will always live in a mostly religious society. We view the holidays as quaint, longstanding traditions. There's no reason for hostility toward such things.
