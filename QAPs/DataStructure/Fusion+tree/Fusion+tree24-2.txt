Suppose for the sake of argument that gods do not exist. What would atheists expect to see in the universe as evidence of their existence?
If we're talking about a very removed, deist sort of god, I wouldn't expect anything to be different. I don't think there's any way to contrast a universe with such a god from a universe without one. If we're talking about a "designer" god, I'd expect Earth life to seem more designed. I know that to many people, life does seem that way, but if you really study Biology, you learn how many sub-optimal "decisions" Natural Selection made, such as plopping a big (needless) blind spot in the human eye (which isn't present in the eyes of some other animals). Many evolved traits are simply good enough to work—they don't show signs of being crafted by an elegant and efficient designer. Updated 109w ago • View Upvotes
