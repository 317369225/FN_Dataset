If you have unlimited power and wealth to create or do anything, what will you create? What will you do?
If I had unlimited power and wealth, I would create a library that would digitise and translate every work ever published into every language in the world, end all censorship and enforce universal literacy in the native tongue. That would make the major works of poetry and literature (and the Sciences) accessible to the people whose lives they would change the most. Scientists and Engineers often disparage the Humanities in their ability to change lives. But if the people of Burkina Faso or Sierra Leone have real access to the works that brought about the Western Enlightenment, it is likely that their cultures will undergo a sea change. The importance of the ideas of life and liberty is yet to be seen in some societies and is often dismissed as a "Western Notion". These ideas must come to a West African and be talked about in a West African language for them to take hold in West Africa. With universal literacy, this child-soldier would have to be in school and learn why his end goal is not important enough to sacrifice his childhood. Better still, he might be able to actually find a better non-violent path to his end goal. If this child-slave could read William Blake and the like, he might be able to assert (to others who could read the likes of William Blake) that his skills are better used elsewhere. Better still, his ideas could bring about a West African Enlightenment.
