Stony Brook is an excellent university, as far as algorithms is concerned , with a lot of reputable algorithms/theory professors along with lots of algorithms courses (both basic and advanced). 1. Steven Skiena: is a very famous professor who is the author of many algorithms books such as The Algorithm Design Manual and Programming Challenges. etc. He teaches computational biology which provides a rigorous treatment to  string algorithms. 2. Michael A. Bender's: Professor Bender works in diverse areas including external memory algorithms, large datset algorithms etc. He teaches algorithms (CS 548) and advanced algorithm (CS 638) courses. He is the one of the best lectures at SB.   3. Rezaul Chowdhury: Professor Rezaul heads the theory and experimental algorithms group at SB, teaches parallel programming course CSE 613 4.http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~jsbm/: Professor Jeo is a famous professor in the field of computational geometry. There are other professors which work in theory and algorithms !
