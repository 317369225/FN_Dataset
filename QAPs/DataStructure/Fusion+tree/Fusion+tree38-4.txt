What are the essential progressive rock albums?
I suppose this could be a long list, but some of my all-time favorites: Genesis: Selling England by the Pound, Lamb Lies Down on Broadway Yes: The Yes Album, Close to the Edge Gentle Giant: Octopus, Glass House, Power and the Glory King Crimson: Larks Tongue in Aspic, Red, Discipline Soft Machine: Third Hatfield and the North: Rotter's Club Caravan: Land of Grey and Pink UK: First Album (self-titled) Bill Bruford: One of a Kind Tangerine Dream: Phaedra, Rubycon Edgar Froese: Epsilon in Malaysian Pale Synergy: Electronic Realizations for Rock Orchestra PFM: Chocolate Kings Ashra: Correlations I'm not sure if Pink Floyd qualifies as a prog band but I would include Atom Heart Mother and Meddle. Same for Mahavishnu Orchestra, but I would include recordings by the original line-up.
