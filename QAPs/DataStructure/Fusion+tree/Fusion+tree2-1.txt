How does Harvard's CS 224 (Advanced Algorithms) compare with MIT's 6.854 (Advanced Algorithms)?
I took 6.854 at MIT exactly ten years ago as an undergrad, and it was a great class (David Karger is an excellent lecturer). This is the first offering of CS224, so I can only compare with the vision of the course that I have in my head. In many ways the courses are logistically similar (pset-based, a final project, and student scribes), and both try to cover diverse set of topics within algorithms. Probably two differences are: (1) 6.854 is slightly more pset-heavy than I plan for CS224 to be (6.854 I think typically has around 12 psets, whereas I wouldn't go beyond 8 or 9). There's some tradeoff to this: (downside) less practice on psets with the techniques in class, but (upside) more time to be creative with final projects. and (2) the exact selection of topics will be different. For example, in about an hour I'll cover fusion trees, which are not covered in 6.854 (though are covered in 6.851). Prof. Karger covers external memory and cache-obliviousness, which I probably won't cover in CS224 (though they were covered last year in CS229r). As the term progresses, we'll continue to see some differences in topic selection.
