Which university is better for Masters in Computer Science - Rutgers or Stony Brook?
Looking at you interests specifically, I would definitely recommend Stony Brook. Full disclosure, I am a Masters student at Stony Brook. I have a close friends who's currently doing his Masters at Rutgers, so I have a very good idea of how different both programs are. From my talks with my friends at Rutgers, what I've learned is that, the place is pretty good for a PhD, but not so much for Masters. The course are more theoretical. As a Masters student you must "master" the use computer science tools (Algorithms, Programming Languages, Concepts of Operating Systems, Networks, Security etc.) and learn ways of making your own tools. You may but are essentially not supposed to participate in very heavy research. Stony Brook is brilliant for this. Again, I feel that placements are better at Stony Brook. The reasons may not necessarily be that we have better or more firms that do campus recruiting (which I feel we do). We do have pretty good students, this is how we're different. A decent proportion of our Masters students have excellent work experience. The effect is that this trickles to the entire batch and makes you work harder and learn more. Our courses and assignments are also more practical and more "Real Worldly"  This is where Rutgers is lacking. Having said that, our Masters intakes are much larger (>100) compared to Rutgers (~30) which makes things like course selection and class sizes a bit bothersome.  But I do like Rutgers campus a lot more than I like Stony Brook. Living is cheaper over there too. As a  Masters student, for algorithms you can hope for working with Skiena or Rezaul (Bender takes only PhD students) and for Security we have Long Lu and R Sekar amongst others.
