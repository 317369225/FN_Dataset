What contemporary music band do you like the most and why?
Here are my Last.fm's stats: So, if you define a contemporary band as one which performs live concert today, my top picks would be Maroon 5, Muse and Radiohead (in that order). These are the tracks/concerts that got me hooked onto 'em: Muse - H.A.A.R.P. Concert Muse is incredible at live concerts. I still watch this concert on full volume and the experience is just amazing. Matt's experimentation with guitar and vocals is the band's USP. Their best track, as per me, is Supermassive Black Hole. Muse is a perfect combination of loud and soft music. Maroon 5 - Never Gonna Leave This Bed / Out of Goodbyes A girl friend (not girlfriend) of mine from abroad introduced me to Maroon 5. I love their boyband-ish charm and their melodious songs. Adam Levine's voice and style are unique. Radiohead - No Surprises This track is one of the best single by any contemporary band. It's one of those pieces that you can hear again and again and still not be bored at all. I love the lyrics and somehow feel connected to the song. Other than this one, my favourites are Fake Plastic Trees and Karma Police. Overall, I'm one of those who feel that contemporary music lacks the depth that was in the music before. Bands like these prove me wrong, and I hope more such bands come to the fore. If you can recommend any contemporary bands for me to check out, please leave out your suggestions in the comments. :) Thanks for the A2A.
