How will the world end?
“The planet has survived everything, in its time. It will certainly survive us.” ― Ian Malcolm (Michael Crichton), Jurassic Park Let's be clear. The planet is not in jeopardy. We are in jeopardy. We haven't got the power to destroy the planet - or to save it. But we might have the power to save ourselves.” ― Ian Malcolm (Michael Crichton), Jurassic Park We give ourselves too much credit when we believe we hold the world's destiny in our puny hands. Even if we blow ourselves up, life will go on. It may not be the same ever again but then - nothing ever is. The World to me refers to everything in existence. It will survive us, it will survive a Big Crunch and it will survive a Big Freeze. The minute we accustom ourselves to that fact, we can learn to appreciate our fleeting lives, which are but dew drops in a cosmic ocean, to the fullest.
