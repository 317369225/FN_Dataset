What are the best restaurants in Seattle's International District?
Probably one of the best HK BBQ house in Seattle's International District is Ton Kiang BBQ Noodle House (http://m.yelp.com/biz/ton-kiang-...).   The BBQ meats are crispy on the outside, juicy inside, and just the right layer of fat. It's got that small HK dive feel (positive!).  Check it out, eh?!
