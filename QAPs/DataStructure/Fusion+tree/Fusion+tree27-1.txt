What makes every Opeth song equally legendary?
I have been listening to opeth for at least 10 years now. For me, its firstly similar to reading a long-form article rather than the listicles that we have on the internet. Not only does this make their music more worthwhile and serious, its much more engaging. But I think the ingredient to epicness lies in the perfect combination of death metal and acoustics, growls and melodic singing, silence and noise, tension and resolution. In songs such as 'The drapery falls' they take you on a journey from one part of the brain to the other. Its explosive yet mellow.
