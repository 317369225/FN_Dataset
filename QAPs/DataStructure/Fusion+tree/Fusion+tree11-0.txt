With C++14, why would you still need to use Boost libraries?
Boost contains many things which aren't yet in the standard library and are more expedient than other alternatives. In my current product I used Boost.Spirit.Qi - a Domain Specific Language for recursive descent parsers that looks like EBNF adapted to C++ operator syntax. Boost.Date_Time - arithmetic, input, and output for dates and times. Boost.Serialization-serialize objects for persistent storage or transport.
