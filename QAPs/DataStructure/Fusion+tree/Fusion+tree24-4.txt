Suppose for the sake of argument that gods do not exist. What would atheists expect to see in the universe as evidence of their existence?
It depends on which God. Assuming it's the God that's described accurately in the Old and New Testaments, I'd expect not to be able to build high buildings, airplanes, or space stations without being struck down like in the Tower of Babel. I'd expect to see miraculous healing, God showing up and talking to some people, and one or more prophets like Elijah who come to make it clear that their God is real (Bible Gateway passage: 1 Kings 18:23-39 - New International Version). I would expect prayer to be answered as the bible says it will be, as in Matthew 18:19. Instead, we tend to get claims of miracles without the miracles themselves, disclaimers that are added to the biblical claims, or reasons why God clearly can't do what he was supposed to have done before because it would violate free will. Or something.
