Why do people celebrate and glorify Halloween if it is a holiday that encourages evil?
I like it because I get to see neighborhood kids and others out having fun.  I'm happy to contribute to their happiness.  I give good chocolates. "And others," includes, "kids," form a couple of colleges near our home.  They wait till the little kids are done and then they come around.  I'm happy to see them. And it's OK if the, "others," include kids from other neighborhoods.  Sixty years ago, all our neighbors, even those with no kids, were great when I was going around trick-or-treating.  My friends and I always had a ball.  I like the continuity of continuing the traditions. And there are parties.  We had parties when I was a kid and now we go to adult parties.  Again, good traditions.
