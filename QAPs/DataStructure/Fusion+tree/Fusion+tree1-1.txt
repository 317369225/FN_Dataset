Computer Engineering: Which Indian college do you recommend for a school student who is good at mathematics and programming?
Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata I would recommend this institute to any of the graduate student who wants to pursue research. Absolutely fantastic professors. Now I won't claim to know about each of the departments over there, but I was in Machine Intelligence Unit for 2  months and by the end, was in awe of it. Edit : I didn't notice "school student" part. ISI Kolkata offers just 2 undergraduate courses, Maths and Statistics. Computers might not be a major part of their curriculum.
