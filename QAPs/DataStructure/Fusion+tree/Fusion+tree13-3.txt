What are the top five things you want to change in this world?
1. Norms of the Society: When deciding the law \ norms for the society, people need to understand the difference between their personal preferences and what is good for the society. Basically the maturity to not stick to their personal opinions on to others. 2. Letting go of Nationalism \ Patriotism: A country should be considered as just a seat of their culture and a convenient way for organizing \ management. Profit of a country at the cost of others should not be justified as part of reality. No other way to clean up Realpolitik. 3. Preserving the Diversity: Diversity of the languages, culture, art has to be encouraged and preserved instead of getting washed away by the majority. 4. Preservation of the Environment: Need I say anything. The fate of humankind lies here. It should be a HUGE concern for anyone. Pour money in to renewable energy sources, preservation of ecosystem, endangered animals etc .. 5. Uniform Infrastructure Development Across the World: More often than not, the infrastructure \ economic development is not uniform, irrespective of whether one sees across the country or the world. I wouldn't mind to even a world government if it can achieve it. This IMO would expose different perspectives to everybody - which by itself will solve many a problem. UPDATE EDIT: An honorary 6th point (just couldn't resist) - Media for the populace, which doesn't focus on the sensational news but which throws light on the realities of issues with minimal bias. The way internet is doing now, but organized in a better manner. Updated 111w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
