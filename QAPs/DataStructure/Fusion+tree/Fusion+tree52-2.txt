What are the best restaurants in Seattle's International District?
My usual go to spot is Phnom Penh Noodle House. I love it for the traditional Cambodian cuisine. Great place for some noodle soups, rice dishes and stir fries. Try the #2 Twin noodle soup with egg and rice noodles. Phnom Penh Noodle House For dim sum I prefer Jade Garden, but get there early to avoid very long waits. Jade Garden A (better, cheaper imo) alternative to Din Tai Fung dumplings is Pings. A family owned, cozy restaurant with some awesome selections of dumplings. Pings Dumpling House - Seattle, WA And for a late night choice, I'm usually at Purple Dot. Baked spaghetti and fried rice goodness. Purple Dot
