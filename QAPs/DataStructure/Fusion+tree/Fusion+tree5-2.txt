What happens when a bowler throws the ball to the batsman at the speed of light?
For instance i will keep aside how the hell will ball reach a speed of C or 90% of C. I totally believe the question is hypothetical and needs to dealt with as it is. If you throw a ball from a point A to the baller (point B) what happens normally is, the light from ball at point A reaches to the baller at point B before the ball can reach itself. And the same happens at everypoint of the flight of ball between A to B. In this special case, the light from ball at point A will reach the baller at same time with the ball itself. So as the photon at anytime of the flight between point A to point B. In short the baller will see the ball at every point from point A to point B instantaneously making a long streak. And then Its gone. simple.
