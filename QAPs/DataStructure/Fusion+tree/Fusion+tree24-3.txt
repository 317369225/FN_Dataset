Suppose for the sake of argument that gods do not exist. What would atheists expect to see in the universe as evidence of their existence?
In the Carl Sagan novel, Contact, the protagonist discovered something remarkable within the constant pi (3.14159...). Very far from the decimal point, she found a sequence of numbers that stopped varying randomly but was instead a sequence of 1s and 0s whose length is a product of two primes numbers, indicating a 2-dimensional array. When she plotted it on her computer screen, she gets a perfect circle. Of course since pi is infinitely long, there should be no reason why such a sequence shouldn't exist. However, it was the fact that the sequence showed up so early, a near statistical impossibility, that was mystifying. What's even more mystifying is that pi is not some sort of physical constant, it's a mathematical constant that can't be adjusted at all and has no reference to reality. It is purely an abstract concept. We can imagine advanced alien species that can accomplish tremendous feats altering the physical universe, but something that inserts a message inside something as abstract as Euclidean geometry would be god-like indeed. Of course this is all fiction, and no sequence of 1's and 0's has been found in pi (yet). If something like that were to happen, I'd start having doubts about my atheism.
