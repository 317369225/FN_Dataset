What happens when a bowler throws the ball to the batsman at the speed of light?
neitheer the bowler nor the batsman would be able to see the ball. The reason for the batsman not being able to see the ball and the reason for the bowler not being able to see the ball are different. The bowler cant see the ball as the light rays emitted by the ball is travelling away from him at the speed of light. The batsman cant see the ball because the response time of our eyes is much higher than the minimum required for capturing images at such fast speed. In other words the "Frames Per Second" of human eyes is so less that the eyes cant detect objects at pretty high speed. And, we all are aware that nothing can acheive the speed of light!
