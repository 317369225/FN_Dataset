What are some interesting things to do/see in New Orleans?
The food is one of the most interesting parts of New Orleans. Antoine's is a well-known establishment of New Orleans that has been there for quite some time. On the newer side, there is a restaurant called The Green Goddess which always has interesting items on their menu (I once tried a port there from 1912!). Everyone raves about the beignets at Cafe du Monde but the coffee is also quite legit. Brunch at The Court of the Two Sisters is lovely with their live band. Make sure you try some po' boys!! I had a fusion one with Korean shortrib in it. One thing that can also be fun is to take a cooking class while in Neew Orleans and learn how to make some of the favorite local dishes. If you walk around at almost any time of the year, you can find jazz bands playing too. We went to a bar to here the Pfister Sisters sing and it was rather enjoyable. The Audubon Zoo is a nice, free park with plenty of wildfowl. Nola is also well known for its cemeteries but these are often not near major tourist places. Mardi Gras World is a place to visit if you don't go during Mardi Gras itself. Actually, one of the things that we did that I enjoyed the most was a swamp tour of the Bayou. During the airboat tour we got to see young alligators and the famous Spanish moss draping over the branches of nearly all of the trees. And, if you're a fan of the occult, make sure to check out the voodoo scene!
