What is the process of dependent origination?
Here is a view within just one aspect of life. The self is co-extensive with everything, AND functioning locally. It is the AND that perplexes people. Just look at a tree to see the And. You see the tree, yet not the roots, nor the biome with which it is both in competition, and symbiosis, nor the soil and its history, and the geological, and biological processes that created that soil, in that place. You do not see the femtosecond quantum coherence reactions that plants use to combine water, CO2, and sunlight to create sugars, nor the UV rays used by the leaves in photosynthesis, or the fusion process in the sun that creates the UV, not the history of the sun in the galaxy. Yet, those aspects are also the tree. When we breathe the oxygen, or use the products of the tree, we also become an aspect of that tree, and everything it involved. You can use this form of opening for any aspect of life. The apples, or other fruit you eat, and the oxygen you breathe, become part of you, and are aspects of everything else.
