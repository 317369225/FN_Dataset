How will the world end?
We'll build space elevators, then orbiting space ships. We'll realize that the world is only capable of holding maybe a hundred billion people, whereas orbiting space ships built from the same material could hold 100 times that, so we'll mine the earth's materials converting them to space ships. We'll do the same with Venus, Mars and Mercury, as well as the asteroid belt and the moons of the outer planets. We'll siphon off the hydrogen from the outer planets in order to power fusion reactors, and we'll roam from this solar system, through the galaxy, and then the galaxies of space, not in one world, but in many self sufficient, self sustaining craft, craft that don't need the sun for energy, don't need a world for land, don't need a large mass for gravity. The Earth is a fairly small, insignificant place. Wondering how it will end will one day seem like wondering what was the fate of the trees left behind by the first upright walking humans. We don't need the trees any more, and don't lament that later generations may have used those particular trees as fire-wood, but grew more at will, and better materials still. When it comes to planets, we are still the equivalent of tree-dwellers of old, needing nature's pre-provided shelter. But we'll grow up and build our own more efficient, more tailored to our needs shelters of the future. As habitats go, the earth is a nice one for primitive species, but it's not our permanent home.
