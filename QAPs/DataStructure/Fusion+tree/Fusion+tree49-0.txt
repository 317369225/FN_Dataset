Is it possible to further explain E=MC^2?
This relationship is simply describing how much pure energy is "contained in or condensed in" ordinary matter.  If you look out your window and see sunlight striking the leaves of a tree, know this: the sunlight and the leaves are "made" of the same thing: energy.  In the case of the leaf, the energy is in the form of matter (protons, electrons, neutrons) and in the case of sunlight it is in the form of photons. Protons, neutrons, and electrons can all be converted back into photons through suitable nuclear reactions (fission, fusion, antimatter anihilation) and the amount of energy released is directly proportional to the amount of mass destroyed.  E=MC2 states that there is an incredible amount of energy locked up in tiny amounts of mass.
