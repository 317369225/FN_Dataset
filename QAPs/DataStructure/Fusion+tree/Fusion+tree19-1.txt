What are some time-series classification methods?
Some of the most popular techniques include: Hidden Markov Models Dynamic Time Warping Recurrent Neural Networks Dynamic Bayes Nets Constructive induction of temporal features. Extracting prototype examples. Applying relational learning techniques. You may want to check out the literature survey of my PhD which was exactly on this topic (http://sites.google.com/site/wal...) for a more complete discussion -- pages 30-54. It's a little out of date -- it's almost 10 years old now. For more up-to-date information, it might be worth checking others who have cited my work (http://scholar.google.com/schola...). Yoshua Bengio also has a great text that covers the application of neural networks to time series classifcation (http://www.amazon.com/Neural-Net...) In 2005, the Machine Learning Journal had a special edition on time series classification approaches, edited by Eamonn Keogh, who himself has done research in this area. It is well worth seeking out.
