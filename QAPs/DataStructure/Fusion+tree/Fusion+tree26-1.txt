What are some interesting facts about chemistry?
Look at a redwood tree. Essentially that entire thing is made of air and water. The sprout from the seed draws in air and water from the ground, rips the molecules apart, using sunlight for power, and then weaves them into this huge, sturdy and ridiculously complex organism. The exact same carbon that makes up charcoal and pencil lead can be rearranged to form some of the most expensive objects in the world (diamonds) some of the strongest material in the world (carbon nanotubes) and some of the most promising exotic material in the world (graphene sheets).   The only difference in all of these is how the atoms are arranged. A ten pound chunk of pure botulinum toxin, if evenly distributed, would be enough to kill every person on earth. Every weed and blade of grass we see around us performs chemical reactions every day that the brightest minds in the world still can't replicate. Not exactly chemistry, but... the sun is the second hottest place in the solar system. The hottest in in Long Island.  Seriously, the Brookhaven National Lab operates a fusion reactor that produces temperatures hotter than the center of the sun.
