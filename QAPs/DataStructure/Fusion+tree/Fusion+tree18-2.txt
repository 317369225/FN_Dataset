What do you recommend for someone who wants to explore jazz music for the first time?
Almost everyone who has answered this question is correct (Dave Durham) I've only included a few other suggestions. Brian Blade - a newer take on the classic jazz style. Steve Gadd - one of the greatest all-around drummers of all time. and with other great drummers Dave Weckl and Vinnie Colaiuta: Hopefully, these will help out a little as well.
