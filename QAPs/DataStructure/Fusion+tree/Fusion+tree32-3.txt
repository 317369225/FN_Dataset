Why should atheists be given leave on religious holidays?
I declare myself to be a Lazyist, an adherent to the religion of Lazyism. Lazyism is a religion weak in beliefs (which is good because I don't like having weird beliefs) and strong in practices. One of the important practices is procrastinative meditation. I believe it is a holy duty of my religion to have at least three extra weekdays off every week to spend in communion with my fellow Lazyists, smoking top-quality marijuana and watching some combination of Dude, Where's My Car? and re-runs of old cartoons while eating Doritos. What? You don't want to give me leave on religious grounds to pursue my spiritual practices? HOW DARE YOU INFRINGE MY RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, YOU MONSTERS? Now, you say that Lazyism is just a made up religion and that it has no factual basis in reality. Apparently this makes it different from all the other religions which aren't made up at all. I guess I'll have to practice my procrastinative meditation on only officially sanctioned religious holidays like Christmas. I will have to put up with this tremendous affront to my religious freedoms.
