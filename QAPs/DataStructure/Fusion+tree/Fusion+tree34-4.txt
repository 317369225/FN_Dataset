What contemporary music band do you like the most and why?
Apart from some of the bands that have been already mentioned, I have two: Poets of the Fall For Maarko Saaresto's unique voice and their beautiful compositions. Poets of the Fall- Cradled in Love Florence and The Machine - Florence Welch's soulful voice puts me in a trance, every single time. And every song in their Ceremonials album is a masterpiece, to say the least. Florence and the Machine: Never Let Me Go.
