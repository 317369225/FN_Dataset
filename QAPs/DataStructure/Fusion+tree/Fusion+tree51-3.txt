Will humans ever colonize Mars, our solar system, or the entire universe? Or will they go extinct?
The answer depends greatly on two things: - Our ability to propel vessels much faster than we can now. - The discovery of abundant fresh water on other planets. Farmable soil is a huge, huge bonus, but if we can figure out propulsion and water, we might be able to fake the rest. Mars has ice, so there's a good chance of having a colony there at some point. Europa is also ice (and is believed to have liquid water beneath the ice) so we could conceivably colonize the moons of Jupiter too.
