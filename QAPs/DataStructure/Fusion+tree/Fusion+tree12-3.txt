What are good progressive rock and post-rock bands that I should listen to?
You might want to check out The Alan Parsons Project,  a British progressive rock band, active between 1975 and 1990. Behind the revolving line-up and the regular sidemen, the true core of  the Project was the duo of Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson. Woolfson was a  songwriter by profession, but also a composer and pianist. Parsons was a  successful producer and accomplished engineer. Almost all songs on the  band's albums are credited to "Woolfson/Parsons". Here's an Instrumental called "Where's the Walrus?". It will give you an idea about their music. Alan Parsons was the audio engineer of Pink Floyd's "The Dark Side of The Moon" in 1973. Updated 5w ago • View Upvotes
