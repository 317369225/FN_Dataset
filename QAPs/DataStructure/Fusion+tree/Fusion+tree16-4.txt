If an Earth-ending asteroid were 50 years away, what are plausible ways to create an ark-ship?
Id suggest the spacestation as in the program the 100. We have and are working on stores of seeds flora and fauna in the aim to prevent extinctions to species caused mainly by us. In facilities designed with the aim of surviving even direct hits by our most powerful nukes they should withstand even extinction sized asteroids providing its not a direct hit. EDIT Yep an attempt to deflect ofcourse is first priority but been thinking in the far to many extinction possibilities apk asteroid is both the least likely and probably the easiest to prevent with enough warning ofc. Consider: 1 us through the current ignore global warming trend and the possibility of nnclear war. 2 methane gas thats currently frozen technically related to gw but can have other causes like the gas currently in oceans. 3 two words yellowstone park its over due. 4 disease and bacteria that EVOLVED immunity to our medicines, take that creationists lol sorry couldnt resist. Id include man made bio hazards here too. 5 mega tsunami. 6 mega earthquakes. 7 major solar flares. 8 gamma ray burst. 9 problem with our magnetosphere we think its in the process of reversing in some areas the field is very weak already and we have no clue how bad it could be. Im sure ive missed many (i suffer from memory aphasia suggestions will be apreciated) but the ones ive mentioned could end up leaving earth unhabitable, contrary to popular beliefs the universe is a hostile and dangerous place and the earth is indifferent to us. Mars could also be viable short term since we plan to launch a manned mission in less than 20 years. But fact is 99.999999% of us would die we just dont have the technology or infrastructure to save more than a handful its why we need to get a colony on mars or the moon asap. Not just asteroids we try to avoid thinking about it but the universe is deadly and so is humanity. Updated 66w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
