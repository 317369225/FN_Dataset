Can SolidWorks be used to design organic looking items such as tree branches, vines, petals, flowers, etc., for 3D printing?
Hi, I'm one of the people who writes the T-Splines kernel. Organic modeling in CAD is what I do all day long. You really can't do organic modeling in vanilla SolidWorks. Dassault has an organic modeling kernel, but they seem unwilling to gut their high-end market by offering this feature in SolidWorks. The high end product is Catia Imagine and Shape. They are using Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces. They have some slick stuff for handling the star points, but they also inherit some limitations because they're limited to regular subd surfaces. I'm aware of one company that sells a subd modeling plugin for SolidWorks. They are also based around CC subd surfaces, with the ability to generate NURBS from them. I used to follow them more closely a couple of years ago (they were a direct competitor before Autodesk acquired T-Splines). They weren't as strong back then, but they've been working on it for years, so have no doubt improved. I believe you can use them to import subd surfaces from other applications as well. You can take a look at their stuff here: http://www.npowersoftware.com/Ne... The products I work on compete with SolidWorks. We use T-Spline surfaces for modeling, which can do stuff that regular subd surfaces can't do (local detail and a cleaner system for interfacing with NURBS, for example). We have a plugin for McNeel's Rhinoceros, and T-Spline surfaces are natively integrated into Autodesk Fusion 360 (the "Sculpt" tools). Autodesk Inventor also has a restricted implementation of T-Splines, which they call "Freeform." Another viable way of doing organic modeling is to create your model using a product like Maya, Modo, 3DS Max, or any other subd modeler. Save the model to an OBJ file, and then import it as a T-Spline surface. This workflow has been used for some pretty amazing results with plants, animals, figures, and so forth.
