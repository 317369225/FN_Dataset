What do I need to know going into this Super Bowl if I haven't watched any of the games for either team this year?
The Broncos have a high powered offense (#1 in terms of yards and points) while the Seahawks have the #1 Defense in terms of yards allowed. So it's a very good defense going against a powerful offense. The Broncos are led by Future Hall of Famer at Quarterback Peyton Manning with a myriad of offensive weapons Wide Receivers (Demaryius Thomas, Eric Decker, Wes Welker) Tight End Julius Thomas, and Running Back Knowshon Moreno. The Seahawks are led by Cornerback Richard Sherman who is a great cornerback and also tends to have alot to say. It also the first time in 20 years both #1 seeds from the AFC and the NFC made the SuperBowl.
