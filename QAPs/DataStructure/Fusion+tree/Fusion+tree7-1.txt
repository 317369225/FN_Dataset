What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the theory of evolution (in all of its aspects) to be true?
There needs to exist a population of organisms... Which reproduces itself... And which reproduction is imperfect from time-to-time... And there needs to be some limit on resources available to sustain this population. Given these conditions, evolution is inevitable, saving only that the limit on resources may be so severe that the population of organisms will be entirely wiped out - this is, in fact, the fate of most species. If we want to see this in action, we can create simulations. You can even write computer code this way, by setting parameters for success (such as speed of execution, accuracy etc), and then letting a population of algorithms mutate in random ways, promoting only the best to the next round. In the natural world, it is obvious to see (and has been verified many times) that populations of organisms do exist, that they do reproduce themselves and that reproduction will be imperfect from time-to-time. Perfect biological systems are vanishingly rare, as are situations where resources are effectively infinite. The limit on resources creates the "parameters for success". If a new predator is introduced, natural selection may favour those organisms with faster reflexes. If the climate changes, natural selection may favour those organisms with thicker coats - and so on.
