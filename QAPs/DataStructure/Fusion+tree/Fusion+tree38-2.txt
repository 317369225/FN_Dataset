What are the essential progressive rock albums?
I'm going to name a few that are a bit 'under the radar' here in the States. The Snow Goose - Camel For Your Pleasure - Roxy Music Sufficiently Breathless - Captain Beyond Trilogy - Emerson, Lake and Palmer Live - 801 Self titled debut for UK. Here Come The Warm Jets - Brian Eno My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts - Brian Eno and David Byrne
