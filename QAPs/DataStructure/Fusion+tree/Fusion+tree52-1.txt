What are the best restaurants in Seattle's International District?
My favorites are Green Leaf, which has an extensive menu of Vietnamese soup and noodle dishes (and more) made with great fresh ingredients, and Szechuan Noodle Bowl, which has the best dumplings in town (get the ones with spicy sauce).  They're next door to each other near 8th and Jackson.  I also love Sichuanese Cuisine at 12th and Jackson for their dry-cooked chicken and Sichuan chicken.
