What would happen if all the water in the ocean was replaced with deuterium oxide?
Plants are affected much quicker than you would expect. The heavy-water would cause a an irreversible collapse of the chloroplast due to the changes in the water and the leaf would shrivel in about 30 - 60 minutes. I was at ORNL looking at the effect of different light intensities on Arabidopsis thaliana leaves and we found that anything above 50% D2O caused an extinction of light capture capabilities of the leaf and our neutron scattering experiments showed a collapse of the chloroplast (similar to an osmotic imbalance between the inside and outside of the chloroplast). So, no, plants would be dead in a few hours... not a few years.
