If you have unlimited power and wealth to create or do anything, what will you create? What will you do?
t Money & power together is a powerful combination & unlimited to boot! While I cannot even fathom what this would mean, and while neither can buy true happiness, there are some things money can buy... 1.Using my money, I would fund all drug researches & make medicines free for the needy and available at a marginal cost to those who can afford it. This would make primary health care available to a lot more people & the over-all health of the world would improve. My power would keep a check on the drug cartel and see to it that only the truly good medicines are made & there is a proper check on the ones that are simply pushed out by the drug mafia. 2. Using my power, I would get rid of "all" the corrupt politicians in my country (would probably need to use a considerable amount of wealth as well!) & we could start afresh! (maybe start with all of the Congress and many from the BJP!) - good governance would be a nice way to start... 3. Having weeded out the worms, I would literally get India cleaned up! Like make it squeaky clean...that would be tough, but with money & power, nothing is impossible! 4. There is no dearth of institutions that really do a whole lot of good in the country, but funds are needed to make the difference. This is where I would come in. 5. Artificial limbs, transplants, surgeries, basic medical aid - all these are next to impossible for the poor - this charity that I do today in a small way, I would be able to do without thinking about "how much"! 6. I am not so unselfish as to not use this money for my own family - I would be able to visit my son whenever I wanted or have him come over whenever he wished! My hubby and daughter could buy all those jets that they desire for their aeromodeling hobby & of course, the plot of land next to ours to make the hangar! 7. But I would leave the OP with a thought... Thanks for the A2A Sotonye Anga
