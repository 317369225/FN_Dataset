How does Harvard's CS 224 (Advanced Algorithms) compare with MIT's 6.854 (Advanced Algorithms)?
I've taught 6.854 about 15 times.  When I took CS224 (25 years ago) it was a completely different class.  But looking at the CS224 syllabus, I'd say these are very similar classes, probably with at least 60% overlap.  They both share a core of data structures, combinatorial optimization (max-flow), linear programming, approximation algorithms, and online algorithms.  224 does cover assorted randomized algorithms that I teach instead in 6.856 (Randomized Algorithms); I instead spend time on computational geometry, external memory algorithms, and min-cost flow. At this point in the curriculum, the space of interesting algorithms to cover is far larger than can fit in one course, and that's fine: the goal of these courses is to give enough exposure to algorithms to let you pick up any other ones by yourself, and both courses seem equally suited to that goal.
