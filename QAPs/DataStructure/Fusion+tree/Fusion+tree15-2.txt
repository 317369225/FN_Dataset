Why is there no self in Buddhism?
Self very much exists in Buddha's teachings - but 'not from its own side'. It exists in a flexible, constantly changing way, not as a pure, true 'thing'.   Nothing exists 'from its own side' - self is a thing, and therefore... it fits the rule.   What this means is this: everything that exists in a significant way exists as such because some mind or other thinks it is significant. So, I love cabbage; John hates cabbage. For me, the nature of cabbage is 'lovely thing'. For John, the nature of cabbage is 'awful thing'. Cabbage has no nature 'from its own side'. The raw matter of cabbage exists whether John or I view it, but it doesn't matter to any sentient being (if we assume there are no slugs or caterpillars!).   Now apply this to your own self. Does it exist on its own, or in relation to other selves? If it exists only in relation to other selves (as it does), and if the view of my self that I have is very different to the view of my self that my mum has, the bus driver has and my friend has (as it is), then there can not be a 'true' self, separate from all other things. My self is a 'dependent arising'.
