What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the theory of evolution (in all of its aspects) to be true?
The theory of evolution is true in the broadest sense, so it seems that the conditions for it to be true have already been met and as far as we can tell only require the most basic forms of life and an environment that can sustain it. The only issues are in the details which are small enough that any new discoveries won't take the entire theory down. It is possible that we could have discovered that mutations weren't in fact random, but "guided" in some way - say that in the lab, DNA was shown to be more likely to mutate one way over another regardless of environment - or that evolution had a "direction" that was stronger than the natural selection process, but so far nothing like this has been found.
