What contemporary music band do you like the most and why?
Choosing one would be extremely hard for me. I am listing only the ones I really love, in no particular order. EDIT (16 Feb 2013): I've linked multiple songs for each band to show what they sound like. 1. Radiohead Reason: experimentation with new music styles, and how they always make awesome music. It would be wrong to point out one of their songs and say that it's how they sound like, because their music has evolved a lot over time. Here is a timeline of their songs to give you a glimpse at this evolution: Creep - Pablo Honey (1993) Karma Police - OK Computer (1997) Everything in its Right Place - Kid A (2000) All I Need - In Rainbows (2007) Lotus Flower - The King of Limbs (2011) 2. Muse Reason: Live performances. Here's one of their recent live performances at iTunes festival: and this is what their songs sound like: Madness - The 2nd Law (2012) Supermassive Black Hole - Black Holes and Revelations (2007) 3. Daft Punk Reason: Random Access Memories. This is what Daft Punk used to sound like: One More Time - Discovery (2001) Get Lucky (feat. Pharrel Williams) - Random Access Memories (2013) Instant Crush (feat. Julian Casablancas) - Random Access Memories (2013) 4. Foo Fighters Reason: Dave Grohl, and all those Grammy albums. Everlong - The Colour and the Shape (1997) The Pretender - Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace (2007) and here's one of their songs that I like very much, but it's not that famous: Walking After You - The Colour and the Shape (1997) 5. Green Day Reason: Nostalgia for Dookie, American Idiot. Basket Case - Dookie (1994) Boulevard of Broken Dreams - American Idiot (2004) Wake Me Up When September Ends - American Idiot (2004) 6. Coldplay Reason: I like their sound. Paradise - Mylo Xyloto (2011) The Scientist - A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002) Yellow - Parachutes (2000) 7. Linkin Park Reason: they keep producing great music. In The End  - Hybrid Theory (2000) Numb - Meteora (2003) Burn it Down - Living Things (2012) 8. Imagine Dragons Reason: Night Visions is the only album I've listened to in a long time, where I ended up liking many tracks the first time I've listened to them. Demons - Night Visions (2013) Radioactive - Night Visions (2013) It's Time - Night Visions (2013) Honorable Mentions: Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, OneRepublic, Maroon 5, Arctic Monkeys, Arcade Fire, The Killers. I haven't had the time to discover their albums yet. All that being said, if I was forced to choose one based off how much I like one/more of their albums, my immediate answer would be Radiohead (or anything by Thom Yorke). Here's one really good solo single 'Analyse' by Thom Yorke that I like: My choice might change in the future depending on the new bands I discover. So, I will update the list whenever I can.
