Why is there no self in Buddhism?
Okay sure. Let's say that you are your brain.  But every atom in your brain is swapped out after a period of time, maybe seven years or so.  So does this mean that you are no longer yourself after seven years? Okay so maybe you're not your physical brain but you're what it contains.  Memories, preferences, skills etc.  But memories are forgotten and new memories are created all the time. Preferences change.  Skills come and go.  So I ask again: who are you really? Buddha's point was this: there is no unchanging element that you can point at and call "you".  You are like a wave in the ocean: clearly visible, but lacking a specific and enduring identity.  The wave moves, changes, merges, splits, and one day disolves completely.  But the ocean remains.
