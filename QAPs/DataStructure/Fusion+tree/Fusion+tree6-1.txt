Where did the Sun get its energy to burn itself?
Gravity! When things fall together, they speed up. When a cloud of gas collapses, it gets hotter. If it's big enough, eventually the middle of the gas cloud is hot enough and dense enough that nuclear fusion will happen. Nuclear fusion of light elements into heavier ones is exothermic, meaning it releases energy, and makes the middle hotter. That energy is what keeps the cloud from collapsing any farther. So, fusion makes the sun shine for billions of years, but you have gravity to thank for holding the sun together in order to turn on nuclear fusion. Stellar physics is actually modeled in detail. It requires details of nuclear physics, gravity, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, radiative transport, chemistry ... and the models of stellar structure agree with what's measured in nature. The primary observational tools are measurements of the light from stars, their spectra, and even how stars oscillate. Looking at millions of stars allows astrophysicists to see how stars of different masses, compositions, and ages emit light, all in agreement with the models. Looking at oscillations of individual stars lets them measure the internal structure, again in agreement with models. For a graduate (or advanced undergraduate) level introduction, look at the book Stellar Interiors by Hansen, Kawaler, and Trimble. Updated 134w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
