What do you recommend for someone who wants to explore jazz music for the first time?
Love the question.  When I think of jazz drummer I always think Spike Jones.  Insane stuff, but not very mainstream.  Check out Joe Morello's work with Dave Brubeck: When you're talking about jazz drummers you HAVE to talk about Buddy Rich, considered by some to be the best drummer ever: Can't forget Art Blakely: Gene Krupa's work give's me shivers: And Elvin Jones: There are so many great jazz drummers, and so much really amazing jazz music.  I envy the journey you're about to take into some of the best music ever.  Enjoy!
