Are technological innovations necessary to combat climate change or do we already have the tools?
Yes, innovation is required. Whether the technology currently exists to fight climate change is not enough. The technology must also be economic for fast, widespread adoption. Renewable energy is currently not widely adopted because it has a hard time competing economically with fossil fuels. Most of the solar energy that hits solar panels is not converted to electricity (less than 20% is). If innovation could increase the conversion to 60% while dropping manufacturing costs, that would make it more economic than fossil fuels in many applications. The free market would take over and no government subsidies would be required for broad and rapid adoption of this technology. Until more economic solutions are found, real change will continue to be slow. Updated 167w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
