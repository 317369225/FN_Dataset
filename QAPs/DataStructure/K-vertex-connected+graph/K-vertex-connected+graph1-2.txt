Is there an algorithm that finds subgraphs of a graph such that each node in a subgraph is connected to at least k other nodes of that subgraph?
I am just going to take your question at face value. You are given a graph with V vertices and E edges, and you want to find a subgraph such that each vertex in the subgraph has degree >= k. There is actually an efficient algorithm to solve this problem. Instead of asking which vertices should in in your subgraph, you can ask yourself, which vertices shouldn't be in your subgraph? The answer to that is pretty obvious. Vertices with degree < k will never be in your subgraph. Therefore, you can remove all of them. After doing so, you will get a subgraph. Do all remaining vertices have degree >= k in the subgraph? If yes, then you have found your subgraph. If not, then there are some vertices in the subgraph with degree < k. Using the same reasoning as before, they shouldn't be in your consideration, so you can remove these vertices. You can keep on doing this recursively. If you remove all vertices in the end, then no such subgraph exists. Otherwise, well you have found your answer. You can simulate this process pretty easily in O(VE lg V) time. All you need to do is: 1. Check the vertex with minimum degree. Let's call it x. 2. Does deg(x) >= k? If yes, output the graph you currently have. 3. If no, remove x from your graph and decrement the degrees of its neighbours. Go back to step 1.
