What is the minimum number of edges one needs to reverse in order to have at least one path from vertex 1 to vertex N, where the vertices are numbered from 1 to N?
Are you trying to solve Chef and Reversing from the August Codechef contest? Now that the contest is over, I'll give an actual solution for the problem. From the given graph, you can construct a graph where each edge in the original graph corresponds to two edges in the new graph, an edge in the same direction with a length of zero, and an edge in the opposite direction with a length of one. You now want to find the shortest path between the two given vertices in this graph, and that will be your answer. Updated 76w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
