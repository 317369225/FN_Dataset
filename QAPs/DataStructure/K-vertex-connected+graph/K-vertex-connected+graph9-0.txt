What are some of the most interesting Feynman diagrams?
This is really Giordon Stark's find, but... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tad... In quantum field theory, a tadpole is a one-loop Feynman diagram with one external leg, giving a contribution to a one-point correlation function (i.e., the field's vacuum expectation value). One-loop diagrams with a propagator that connects back to its originating vertex are often also referred as tadpoles. For many massless theories, these graphs vanish in dimensional regularization (by dimensional analysis and the absence of any inherent mass scale in the loop integral). The physics of tadpoles and the word tadpole was invented by Sidney Coleman. The editor was not satisfied, but he changed his mind once Sidney Coleman proposed spermion instead.[citation needed] Both words are derived from the shape of the Feynman diagram: a circle with a line interval attached to its external side. Tadpole diagrams, in this sense, first appear in the above-mentioned article by Coleman and Glashow, Physical Review v. 134, p.B671 (1964).
