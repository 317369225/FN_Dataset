What are some examples of seemingly easy math problems that are actually very difficult?
When the numbers we are multiplying are separated by 2 (example 7 and 5), then multiply the number in the middle by itself  and subtract one. (6*6 - 1 in this case) For Example : 5×5 = 25 is just one bigger than 6×4 = 24 6×6 = 36 is just one bigger than 7×5 = 35 7×7 = 49 is just one bigger than 8×6 = 48 8×8 = 64 is just one bigger than 9×7 = 63 Multiplying by nine hen you are multiplying by 9, on your fingers (starting with your thumb) count the number you are multiplying by and hold down that finger. The number of fingers before the finger held down is the first digit of the answer and the number of finger after the finger held down is the second digit of the answer.   Multiply Up to 19X19 In Your Head Say you need to multiply 15X13 1.) Always place the larger number of the two on top in your mind (15 in this case) 2.) Add it with second digit of the lower number (15+3 = 18 - Lets call it A) 3.) Subtract the lower number by its second digit (13-3=10 - Lets call it B) 4.) Now Multiply A with B (18*10 = 180 - Lets call it C 5.) Now Multiply second digit of both the number (5*3 = 15 - Lets call it D) 6.) Add C & D to see your answer (180 + 15 = 195)
