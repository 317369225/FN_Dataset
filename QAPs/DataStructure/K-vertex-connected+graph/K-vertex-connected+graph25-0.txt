Can a almost Hamiltonian cycle be a NP-complete problem?
I haven't heard the term before, but I'll define a cycle to be almost Hamiltonian if it includes a constant fraction of the vertices. In fact I can prove that finding a cycle of length at least n/k in a graph with n vertices is NP-complete, for any constant k. To show a problem is NP-complete, we must show that it is both in NP, and NP-hard. To show a problem is in NP, we typically show that we can check a proposed solution in polynomial time. Here, a proposed solution would be a cycle of length at least n/k. To check it, we would simply check whether each edge in the proposed solution is present in our graph. Next we show that our problem is NP-hard. The natural reduction is from the original Hamiltonian cycle problem. Suppose that we can determine in polynomial time whether there is a cycle of length at least n/k in a graph G with n vertices, for some constant k. Now take a graph H with m vertices, for which we want to find a Hamiltonian cycle. Then for each vertex v, add k - 1 new vertices, each connected only to v. Let n = km be the size of our new graph G. By assumption, we can determine whether G has a cycle of length at least n/k = m. This cycle cannot include any of the new vertices, because each of them has only degree 1. So it must include every vertex that was in H; that is, we can determine whether there is a Hamiltonian cycle in H! Note that we have only increased the size of H by a constant factor, so if our running time is polynomial in the size of G, it will also be polynomial in the size of H. To conclude, if we could solve the almost Hamiltonian cycle problem in polynomial time, we could solve the full Hamiltonian cycle problem in polynomial time. Thus the almost Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-hard.
