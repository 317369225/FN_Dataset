Given a matrix with non-negative real entries, how can you algebraically prove that it has a non-negative eigenvalue?
As Douglas Zare indicates, this is more of a topological property than an algebraic property.  There is a simple topological proof following from the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. Suppose A is an [math]N\times N[/math] matrix with non-negative components. Let X by the set of unit vectors having only non-negative components.  This set is homeomorphic to a closed ball in [math]R^{N-1}[/math].  If A maps some vector in X to the zero vector, then A has 0 as an eigenvalue.  Otherwise, let [math] f : X \to X [/math] be [math] f(x) = Ax / ||Ax|| [/math].  The Brouwer fixed-point theorem says that there is some fixed point [math] x_0 [/math] of [math] f [/math], and so [math] x_0 [/math] is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue [math] ||Ax_0|| [/math]. It is harder to come up with an algebraic proof of this because algebra does a much poorer job of capturing the properties that make it true (in particular because the matrix can have complex eigenvalues).
