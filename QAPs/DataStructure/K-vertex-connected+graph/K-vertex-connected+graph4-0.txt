For a 2k-edge-connected loopless graph, can we show that it has a k-edge-connected bipartite subgraph? (This subgraph must contain all the vertices of the original graph)
I'll show that there is a bipartite subgraph [math]H[/math] such that every vertex in [math]H[/math] has degree at least [math]k[/math] The key insight to notice in this problem is that if a graph is [math]m[/math]-edge connected, it's minimum degree [math]\delta(x) \ge m[/math] (since removing fewer than [math]m[/math] edges connected to a single vertex shouldn't disconnect this vertex). Hence for all [math]v \in V(G)[/math], we know that [math]deg_{G}(v)\ge m[/math] Now coming back to the original question, we can easily see that if a graph [math]G[/math] is [math]2k[/math]-edge connected, then every vertex in [math]G[/math] has [math]deg_{G}(v) \ge 2k[/math]. And if a bipartite graph [math]H[/math] is [math]k[/math]-edge connected, then every vertex in [math]H[/math] has [math]deg_{H}(v) \ge k[/math] So, it suffices to prove the following result Claim Let [math]G[/math] be any loopless connected graph, such that [math]deg(v)>1[/math] (for all [math]v \in V(G)[/math]), then there exists a spanning bipartite subgraph [math]H[/math] of [math]G[/math] such that  [math]deg_{H}(v) \ge \frac{deg_{G}(v)}{2}[/math] Note that this immediately implies the statement I set out to prove i.e. that H has minimum degree at least [math]k[/math]. Proof First we can easily see that there must exist a spanning bipartite subgraph of [math]G[/math]. Now let [math]H[/math] be a spanning subgraph of [math]G[/math] with the largest number of edges (and hence degree), and let the bipartitions of [math]H[/math] be [math]H_1[/math] and [math]H_2[/math]. I claim that [math]H[/math] has the property that  [math]deg_{H}(v) \ge \frac{deg_{G}(v)}{2} [/math] Suppose for the sake of argument, that this is not the case. Let [math]x[/math] be any vertex which violates the property. i.e. [math]deg_{H}(x) < \frac{deg_{G}(x)}{2} [/math] Without loss of generality, lets say [math]x \in H_1[/math] Now, take [math]x[/math] and move it into [math]H_2[/math]. Let's call the resulting graph obtained [math]H'[/math] By making this change we now have [math]deg_{H'}(x) \ge \frac{deg_{G}(x)}{2} [/math] But with one important difference. The number of edges between the two partitions has increased. In particular it is, [math] e(H') = [/math] [math]e(H)- deg_{H}(x) + (deg_{G}(x) - deg_{H}(x))[/math] And this means, [math]e(H') = e(H) + deg_{G}(x) - 2*deg_{H}(x) > e(H)[/math] This contradicts our assumption that [math]H[/math] has the maximum number of edges between its partitions. Note that the above proof implies that every vertex in a maximum sized spanning bipartite subgraph of a loopless [math]2k[/math]-edge connected graph must have minimum degree at least [math]\lceil \frac{2k}{2} \rceil = k[/math]
