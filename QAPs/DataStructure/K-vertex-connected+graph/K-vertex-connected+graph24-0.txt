What are some of the great projects implemented using the concepts of Graph Theory?
Here are a few applications that come to mind. Google Search uses pagerank as an important quality signal. The Facebook news feed uses something similar called edgerank to rank the information from your friends. Facebook recently launched Facebook Graph Search. String segmentation is a natural language processing problem which occurs in languages like Chinese. It's frequently tackled as a shortest path problem. Google Navigation and Google Directions on top of Google Maps uses some very efficient planar graph shortest path algorithms. Real time strategy games like Starcraft use fast pathfinding algorithms like  A star to route units on the map. Compilers use graph traversals to find code dependencies. Graph coloring algorithms are used when optimizing the code for parallel uses of the CPU registers. CPU layout design problems are modeled as graph problems. Like Erik mentions, memory garbage collection strategies may use graph traversals. Inventory allocation in web advertising can be written as a network flow problem. Stable matching algorithms are used to match residents to hospitals and kidneys to donors. (stable matching won the nobel prize in economics in 2012) Hamiltonean paths and Euler paths occur in the Gene Sequencing problem. Data replication problems frequently use minimal spanning tree algorithms to keep the bandwidth use down. Most big data processing pipelines involve a series of interdependent steps that can be modeled as a directed acyclic graph. Some image segmentation problems can be modeled to be equivalent to finding the minimum cut in a graph. Updated 144w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Daniel Mirilli and Kiko Guanabakoa
