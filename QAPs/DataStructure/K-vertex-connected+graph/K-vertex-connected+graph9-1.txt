What are some of the most interesting Feynman diagrams?
One of the most famous ones I have come across is called the Penguin diagram. They represent quark interactions via a W or Z loop. According to Wikipedia, they are important for understanding CP violation in the standard model (I don't know much about the technical details). Photo credits: Wikipedia The story of how this name came to be is a part of particle physics folklore. CERN theorist John Ellis, who came up with this, took part in a game of darts in a bar with the current Harvard Physics Chair Melissa Franklin. They had a bet - whoever lost would have to include the word "penguin" in his/her next paper. After losing the game, and smoking some illegal substance, John had a sudden flash - his diagrams looked like penguins! Still curious? The detailed story is available here - The march of the penguin diagrams and Penguin diagram :) The tadpole diagram (or spermion) has already been mentioned by Alex K. Chen in his answer to this question. Its nomenclature is also hilarious! Read his answer for the story. There are others, like the sunrise/sunset diagram (two loop irreducible correction to the scalar particle propagator in [math]\phi 4[/math] theory), or the wigwam diagram (Born scattering approximation for the self-energy of electrons moving in an impurity potential), and then there are aÂ  few which we (me and my fellow graduate students) named - like the bow-tie or the Samurai diagram. But personally I find the penguin diagram the funniest! PS: I made minor edits (the last answer was not very coherent and had atrocious grammar in some places).
