What are some examples of seemingly easy math problems that are actually very difficult?
Ramsey numbers!! You are hosting a party. Every pair of attendees is either a pair of friends or a pair of enemies. A group of people are said to be mutual friends (enemies) if each pair in the group is friends (enemies). How many people do you have to have at the party to guarantee that you have 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual enemies? The answer to this question is 6. (More on how to show this later.) Any group of 6 people will either have 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual enemies. To set some notation let's agree that [math]R(3,3)=6[/math], where the first 3 denotes the number of friends and the second 3 denotes the number of enemies. Then [math]R(k,j)[/math] is the number of attendees you will need to guarantee either [math]k[/math] mutual friends or [math]j[/math] mutual enemies. Ramsey's Theorem can be used to show that [math]R(k,j)[/math] is finite for each [math]k,j[/math]. However, calculating the exact value of [math]R(k,j)[/math] has only been done for a few special cases. Let's look again at [math]R(3,3)[/math].  Consider placing a point in the plane for each person at the party and connecting the points between each set of friends with a red line and the points between each set of enemies with a blue line. Consider the following collection of 5 people or points. You can check that no collection of 3 points forms a triangle with all the same color sides. Thus, at this party, there is no collection of 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual enemies. We must have that [math]R(3,3)>5[/math]. How can we actually prove that the true value is 6? Take any graph of 6 vertices where all edges have either been colored red or blue. Pick one of the 6 vertices and consider all the edges extending from this vertex. Since there are 5 other points, there are 5 edges extending from the vertex. At least 3 edges must have the same color. Let's say that at least 3 edges are blue. Now consider the 3 points at the end of these blue edges. If any of them are connected by a blue line then these two points and the first point form a blue triangle, and so we would find 3 mutual enemies. The only other option is for none of these three points to be connected by a blue line. Then these 3 points are all connected by red lines. Thus, they form a red triangle! Three mutual friends!We have shown that any party with 6 people must have 3 mutual friends or three mutual enemies, and so [math]R(3,3)=6[/math]. It probably seems like similar arguments could be made to find other [math]R(k,j)[/math] values. It turns out, that it's not so easy. The number of graphs with [math]n[/math] vertices who are each connected by a single red or blue edge is [math]2^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}[/math], and even though many of these are easily checkable or removable by symmetry arguments, the number of graphs grows so fast that without a strong theory to remove many of these graphs, we can't even design an algorithm to check all the graphs of a certain size. It has been shown that [math]R(4,4)=18[/math]. Note, this requires producing a graph with 17 vertices where there are no groups of 4 vertices mutually colored red or blue. There are [math]2^{17*16/2}=8.7...*10^{40}[/math] graphs with 17 vertices, and so there is no chance to run an exhaustive search on a computer to find such a graph. Once we have this example, we still have to prove that every graph with 18 vertices has the required properties. Even more interesting is that [math]R(k,k)[/math] is still unknown for all [math]k>4[/math]. It is known that [math]R(5,5)[/math] is between 43 and 49, but we can't yet find the exact value. The famous Paul Erdos had a wonderful comment on these numbers. "Suppose aliens invade the earth and threaten to obliterate it in a year's time unless human beings can find the Ramsey number for red five and blue five. We could marshal the world's best minds and fastest computers, and within a year we could probably calculate the value. If the aliens demanded the Ramsey number for red six and blue six, however, we would have no choice but to launch a preemptive attack." -As quoted in "Ramsey Theory" by Ronald L. Graham and Joel H.
