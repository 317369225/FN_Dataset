What are some examples of seemingly easy math problems that are actually very difficult?
It depends on what you mean by seemingly easy. If you mean easy to comprehend the question, but difficult to get the answer, then I think Fermat's Last Theorem takes the cake. Fermat's Last Theorem: There exists no solution in positive integers a, b, and c satisfying the equation [math]a^n + b^n = c^n[/math] for any integer value of n greater than two. It is so easy to understand the theorem. But it took 358 years and deep, arcane mathematics to prove.
