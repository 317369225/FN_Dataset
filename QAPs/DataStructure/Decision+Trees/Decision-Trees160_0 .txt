How reliable is to use a decision tree for mining opinions/projection based on survey results?I think it depends on the rationality you expect of the decision making process : your tree will be based off a training set, and highlight a certain logic process in the survey answers that leads to a given person having this or that opinion. If the people you surveyed follow a certain logic in forming an opinion, and the answers they gave provide a window into that logic, the algorithm will identify it when trying to reduce the entropy of the results in each step. The problem is, if there is no logic to how this particular opinion is constructed by people, or you lack key data (let's say you are trying to predict people's stance on an ethical choice, and the survey didn't ask about their religious beliefs, you might not be able to discern an otherwise obvious pattern), you might end up having a tree that does not reflect the reality, just the mathematically efficient way to reduce the entropy in your set. As for efficiency : a few years ago I was testing a simple recursive decision tree using Shannon's entropy on this Car Evaluation Data Set. Using a small 50 cars training set and generous pruning still led to 73% accuracy in predicting the other 1700 cars' ratings. 272 Views  View Upvotes
