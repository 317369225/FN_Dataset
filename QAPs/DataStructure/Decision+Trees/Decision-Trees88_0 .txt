Does poker have a deeper "decision tree" than chess?tldr: no Finding the best action in poker is a very different process to finding the best action in chess because poker has hidden information and chess doesn't. Nearly all techniques in poker involve traversing game trees to calculate expected values, though often the results of these traversals are cached. Because you don't know what your opponent holds and what board cards are to come poker trees are much much wider than those of chess, but probably shallower. 365 Views  View Upvotes
