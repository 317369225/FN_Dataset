How can I implement decision tree model, other than using bunch of if-else statements?Such that it can be more efficient and/or readableA very general way is to have a generic tree data structure in which you store, for each node, the identifier of the thresholding variable and the threshold value, along with pointers to subtrees with the same information. Then you only need to implement the if-else test once, to be called once at each level of the tree. 344 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Alkindi Rizky
