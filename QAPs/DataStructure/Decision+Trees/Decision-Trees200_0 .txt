Can decision trees be used to find latent variables attributes of a sample?Not really. However, there is one approach which works well if you have huge amounts of data that I have occasionally seen used, which is: Generate lots of combinations of attributes (e.g. differences between attributes, products of attributes, ratios of attributes etc). Basically, these are latent attributes. Build decision trees using them. If a latent variable is used a lot in the decision trees (especially near the root), you know it is useful as a discriminant. However, you really need lots and lots of data to do this -- otherwise, the decision trees will overfit. When I worked with Ross Quinlan (author of C4.5), he had a rule of thumb that was at a bare minimum to build a reasonable tree was: 5 * number of attributes * number of values each attribute could take (for continuous values, you adjust for the precision you care about). So for example, if you have 32 attributes and each attribute takes on 16 values, you need at least 5 * 32* 16 = 2560 examples. If you for example, look at products of two attributes, there are 32*31/2 = 496 product attributes. So now all of a sudden, you need 39680 examples. Do products, ratios, sums and differences, and you need ~160,000 examples. 405 Views  View Upvotes
