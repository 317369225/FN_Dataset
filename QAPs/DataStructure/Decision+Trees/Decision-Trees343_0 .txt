What are the differences and similarities between decision trees and logistic regression?Trees can look at interactions in ways that logistic regression cannot (at least, not without a lot of difficulty). More precisely, they can examine initeractions that occur differently in different subsets of the data. On the other hand, logistic regression gives a much clearer sort of formula for predicting the probabity of a response at a certain level, given the independent variables. 840 Views  View Upvotes
