lower bind for comparison algorithm - check whether permutation be odd or even hint : show that if you know the parity of the input permutation then you know the entire permutation , and so you can sort the list . in more detail , the information that you have at any leaf of the decision tree can be represent as a partial order on the element . show that if this partial order be not linear then it have a linear completion which be a odd permutation and another linear completion which be a even permutation .
