What are some of the pros and cons of expectation-maximization (EM) against boosted decision tree (BDT) in machine learning applications?How did you end up picking these two algorithms? These two are different in so many aspects like EM is unsupervised while decision trees(boosted or any other form of ensemble or even un ensembled ones) are supervised.EM is used for clustering while other is used for classification. One can't really compare apples with oranges. 289 Views  View Upvotes
