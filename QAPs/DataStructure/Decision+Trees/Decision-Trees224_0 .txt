Why hasn't decision tree been generalized or modified a bit to replace neural network in history? They are really similar in structure.I am sorry I cannot add the reasoning due to word limitations. Please seen the comments for the detail.A decision tree (DT) has nodes and a neural network (NN) has nodes as well but the similarity ends there. The nodes in a DT can be complex thus a node in a DT can actually be a neural network. Think of a tree structure as a supporting framework in which you can add anything and make it as complex as you want. A DT represents decision making processes whereby there are multiple options (paths) at every level and every decision made affects the final result. This is a general representation, you can actually have deep learning systems as decision nodes for pruning out some not so promising paths. Thus DTs are not like algorithms that you can implement right away they are just a supporting framework for other algorithms. Those nodes you are referring to in DTs are abstract, they are application dependent. A NN on the other hand is a learning algorithm with an ensemble of processing nodes whereby each node is specifically implementing a weighted sum of inputs with a single out that goes through an activation function to induce non-linearity. Thus DTs and NNs are not similar, one is just a supporting framework whereas the other is an actual algorithm that can be implemented. NNs can be used as decision nodes in a DT but not vice versa. Hope this helps. 339 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Zhi Zeng
