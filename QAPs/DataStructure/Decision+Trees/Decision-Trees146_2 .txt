What is the difference between a decision tree and a flow chart apart from how they are drawn?Thank you Walter. After this question I did study about both these techniques in details. Here are my thoughts about it. They are expansion of what Walter stated in his last para. In a decision tree, a flow of activities are not considered. Only decision making points and it's outcomes (and their decision points and their outcomes etc) are considered. This is helpful in taking quick decisions for a fairly medium complex problem. A flow chart is conventionally a set of activities which may or may not involve decision making at all. A flow chart, as the name suggests, in principle depicts the sequence of the activities to be carried out in a particular process. A flow chart can be used to depict the sequence of activities in any size of the process. Advance techniques of flow charts (like swim-lane flow charts) are available to map highly complex processes. 1.4k Views
