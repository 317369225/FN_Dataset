term for most degenerate tree with two child on every inner node i ve see this type of tree call a <em> comb </em> . but this isn t such a widespread term that you can use it without define it . technically , a nested datum structure where every node have one child that s a leaf , with the list always on the same side , be a <em> list </em> . when the last node have two leave the one that s not on the usual leaf side be not a special null marker , it s a <em> improper list </em> . but this terminology work for datum structure , it sound strange when apply to a decision tree .
