I have read that I can use decision trees before constructing a logit regression for the purpose of credit scoring. How do I choose variables to analyze with decision trees if I have over 300 of those to start?I'm new to decision trees so please tweet the question as one from a dummyShort answer Rank the variables with a simple measure and take only the best 5 for the building procedure of trees. Problem I understood the problem as following, please correct me if i am wrong. A dataset with 300 Variables and one dependend variable is given. The dependend variable is define as 0 no default within one year and 1 default within one year.The question is how to use trees with so many variables, i.e. how to perform feature selection. Useful advice Before you do any analysis make sure to separe the set in at least two parts, a training and a validation part. You can train the models and perform all the decisions on the training part and when you made your decision test it on the validation part. Long answer A very simple approach is to perform a univariate (one-dimensional) analysis of the variables with the response variable on the training set. E.g. use the colAUC function in R. Then simply take the best 5 variables, and use your decision tree on them. Now test the result on new data ( the validation sample). Should perform quite bad, but you got at least a starting benchmark :). 115 Views
