How do decision trees for regression work?Classification makes sense--you get the nodes for each category. But wouldn't you have a ton of nodes if you want a real-valued answer?The difference is mainly at the leaf nodes. For regression, you need to compute an average, or more complicatedly a linear regression at each leaf node from samples in that node. These averages/linear regression are kind of 'local' and hence are expected to model the data better than a single global regression. 919 Views  View Upvotes
