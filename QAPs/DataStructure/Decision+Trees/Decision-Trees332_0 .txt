What is an example of a dataset where the greedy approach to constructing a Decision Tree would not construct an optimal tree?An optimal tree is defined according to this paper (in the introduction): Page on mit.edu The greedy approach would be to split at each node using whatever test maximizes Information Gain (Information gain in decision trees), or some other test which is locally optimum.Imagine a dataset with 3 binary columns a,b,c and a binary label a l Choose a and b randomly uniformly independently Let l be a xor b. Let c be equal to l 60% of the time randomly. The optimal tree will split on a and b But any greedy tree will split on c first and will then need to split on a and b. The greedy algorithm is of depth 3 uniformly but the optimal tree is depth 2. 335 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Anshuman Radhakrishnan
