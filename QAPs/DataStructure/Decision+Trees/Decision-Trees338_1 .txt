How can we say there is "an interaction" between variables in decision tree?Though I'm not sure of what you exactly meant by 'interaction', presumably if the decisions are probabilistic at the end of the tree you can call that some sort of interaction. Otherwise if you're looking for 'interaction' in between leaves, that may arise due to dependency amongst variables. 210 Views  View Upvotes
