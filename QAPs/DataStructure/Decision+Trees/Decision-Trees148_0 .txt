What would be a simple decision tree for improving noise reduction in hearing aids?This is not something that you would typically use a decision tree for directly; the output of a hearing aid is a continuous signal, so you'd typically use a signal processing approach to reduce noise (e.g. focusing spectrum on human speech frequencies). These signal processing algorithms are called filters. But you could use a decision tree to select which filter is appropriate in a particular situation. For example, you could detect that the person was in a car and then switch to a filter better suited to being in a car (e.g. eliminate low frequency car noises). The way you'd do this is: Record samples of each of the situations you want to build a filter for. Apply some feature extraction to the signal (in this case Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients). Train a decision tree on this. At runtime in the hearing aid; you run the decision tree over the input and choose the appropriate filter. 389 Views  View Upvotes
