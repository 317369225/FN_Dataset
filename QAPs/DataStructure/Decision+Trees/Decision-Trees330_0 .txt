Can I have multiple splits in CHAID decision tree?I have seen examples that only provides two splits from each nodes.Most CHAID algorithms use two way splits. You can get a n-way split from n-1 two way splits and using only two way splits is much more tractable than using n way splits. Nevertheless, I have seen some tree algorithms that use multiple way splits from a single node. However, I think even these may be doing the math as two way splits and then showing them as n-way splits if appropriate. 355 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Changhee Kang
