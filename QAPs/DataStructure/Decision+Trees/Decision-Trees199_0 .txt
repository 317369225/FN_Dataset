Is there a Java library for a decision tree that accepts numeric values?I'm looking for a Java library for decision trees which accepts numeric attributes and classes/grades. Weka's J48 deals with discrete attributes but doesn't accept numeric ones.Weka's M5P can handle both numeric attributes and numeric class. It's based on a very similar algorithm to J48, except that each node is a linear regression model fit to the input attributes. REPTree is also in Weka (Reduced Error Pruning) and it also supports numerical class features. For REPTree, each node is a numerical value. 1.1k Views  View Upvotes
