What is an intuitive explanation of a decision tree?Decision tree is a hierarchical tree structure that used to classify classes based on a series of questions (or rules) about the attributes of the class. The attributes of the classes can be any type of variables from binary, nominal, ordinal, and quantitative values, while the classes must be qualitative type (categorical or binary, or ordinal). In short, given a data of attributes together with its classes, a decision tree produces a sequence of rules (or series of questions) that can be used to recognize the class. Let us take an example.The training data is supposed to be a part of a transportation study regarding mode choice to select Bus, Car or Train among commuters along a major route in a city, gathered through a questionnaire study. The data have 4 attributes which I selected for the shake of clarity. Attribute gender is binary type, car ownership is quantitative integer (thus behave like nominal). Travel cost/km is quantitative of ratio type but in here I put into ordinal type (because quantitative data need to be split into qualitative data) and income level is also an ordinal type. Based on above training data, we can induce a decision tree as the following: The attribute “income level” is not included in the decision tree because based on the given data attribute “travel cost per km” would produce better classification than “income level”. 494 Views · View Upvotes
