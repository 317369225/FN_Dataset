A random forest is a collection or ensemble of decision trees. A decision tree is built using the whole dataset considering all features,but in random forests a fraction of the number of rows is selected at random and a particular number of features are selected at random to train on and a decision tree is built on this subset. Similarly a number of decision trees are grown,each will probably have a different subset since it is being randomly selected and hence each decision tree will be different,and each tree will vote for a particular class and the class which gets maximum number of votes is the predicted class. You can get an idea of the mechanism from the name itself-"random forests".A collection of trees is a forest,and the trees are being trained on subsets which are being selected at random,hence random forests. You need to set the parameters like how many 107 Views  View Upvotes
