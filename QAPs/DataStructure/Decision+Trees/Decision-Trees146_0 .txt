What is the difference between a decision tree and a flow chart apart from how they are drawn?These are very different tools. A decision tree shows the costs/benefits, conditional and joint probabilities of events occurring based on a stream of decision choices made. Back when I inherited my father's mines, there was a no family member trying to take control of my father's mining company. I drew out a decision tree illustrating every decision I would have to make and the probabilities that I felt of what actions would be taken by the interloper. It proved very useful in warding him off at least cost. (I had been teaching decision tree analysis as a Professor at West Point!) A flowchart is a prescription of what needs to be done in what order to solve a problem. It often a basis for putting something together or for writing a computer program. whereas a decision tree has probabilities and costs or benefits, a flow chart has none of these. It completely deterministic. 3.3k Views  View Upvotes
