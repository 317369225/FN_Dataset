How do random forests and boosted decision trees compare?The other answers here do a good job of saying why Boosted Decision trees usually do better. However, there are a few areas where I've found Random Forests to have advantages. The main one is that the training can be highly parallelized. Each tree (and subtree) can be trained on independent hardware. This allows you to Scale it to massive data that you would have to subsample for other techniques, and you can use it for online training where additional data is constantly streaming in. Anything under the Terabyte level it might not be worth it, though. Source: Decision Tree Random Forests 6.3k Views  View Upvotes
