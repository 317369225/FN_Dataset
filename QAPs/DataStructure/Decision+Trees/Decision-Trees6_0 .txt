Does the Adaboost and GradientBoost algorithms make use of decision tree ID3 ?Boosting algorithms are independent from the type of underlying classifiers/regressors. They treat it as abstract decision functions with a metric of performance. You can use ID3, C4.5 or CART or whatever, it doesn’t matter, because boosting methods don’t specify even the form of implementation for the basic classifier. Technically, it doesn’t even have to be a tree, it just so happens that they are the best fit for the role of “weak classifier”. Think of them as about black boxes with their own inner method of computation that doesn’t concern you once it works, because if you substitute a C4.5 tree with an equivalent CART tree, it won’t matter. Depends on the implementation of the boosting trees library, some of them allow you to specify the base algorithm before training. 923 Views · View Upvotes
