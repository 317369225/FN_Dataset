Is there a way to add random feature subsampling at each node of a rpart and J48 decision tree in R?For the rpart and J48 decision trees in R, can I develop each node of the trees with just a randomly selected subset of features instead of the entire feature space? Is there any way to do it in R? Or do I have to write the code for the decision trees from scratch in some other language?Hi Thanks for the question. I don’t know about J48 but with rpart you can define splitting functions. The rpart function has the “method” parameter where you can define your own splitting functions. If you download the source of rpart, in test folder you’ll find usersplits.R with examples. Here’s one: alist <- list(eval=temp1, split=temp2, init=temp3) where temp1, temp2, and temp3 are three functions you’ll to define to implement a user defined splitting function: eval is used to assign the label (e.g. assign by majority), split is the actual splitting function and init is a function to preprocess the node data (e.g. remove NAs). Then to compute the model with: fit1 <- rpart(income ~population +illiteracy + murder + hs.grad + region, mystate, control=rpart.control(minsplit=10, xval=0), method=alist) and then to apply use predict. So yes, you can define any splitting function you want without going to another language. Here is another source that may help you. https://cran.r-project.org/web/p... Hope it helps. 55 Views
