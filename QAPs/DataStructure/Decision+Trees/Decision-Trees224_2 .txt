Why hasn't decision tree been generalized or modified a bit to replace neural network in history? They are really similar in structure.I am sorry I cannot add the reasoning due to word limitations. Please seen the comments for the detail.At first I thought this makes no sense, they are different. But interesting .. The thing about decision trees is they are human readable. You can see how the algorithm comes to a decision. Neural nets are opaque. You don’t get to see how the algorithm decides on a path through the network. You might construct a decision tree with a bayesian probabilistic network. Deep Neural Nets use Bayesian probabilistic methods so in that sense they have converged somewhat. Would it make sense to construct a neural net with rules as nodes? How would that work? Output layers have labels so you could create a rule based on that output. A set of deep nets to construct the rules for a decision tree seems very reasonable. Would be surprised if people are not already trying. It’s common to use output from one machine learning technique as the model / input for another. I am an entrepreneur, engineer and innovate. My startup is my life.
