Is it possible to convert a script to a decision tree?If the question is: can any script be converted to a decision tree, then you can see the answer is no under the assumption that the decision tree must be finite. E.g. a counter incrementing loop that returns its counter on each iteration with nonzero probability or keeps going with nonzero probability would require an infinite decision tree. 277 Views  View Upvotes
