How does a decision tree automatically pick up the effect from the product of two independent variables?Such that one does not need to specify X1*X2 explicitly. Just feeding X1 and X2 solely to the model is enough.Here's a rough layman's description of how decision trees work: Start with all the observations in one big node. For each variable, look at all the splits of the variable and see which one makes the best split. Use that to make two nodes. Repeat the above for each of the two nodes and so on until some criterion for stopping is reached Prune back the tree so that bad splits at the bottom are removed The usual interaction X1*X2 is not included anywhere. Indeed, you might get X2 involved only in one branch of the tree and not others. There is no way to write this in standard notation and it is not the product of two variables. 587 Views  View Upvotes
