How can I implement decision tree model, other than using bunch of if-else statements?Such that it can be more efficient and/or readableA decision tree is nothing more than a collection of nested if-else statements :-). If-else statements are very efficient — they get compiled into pretty compact machine code; and it is unlikely that there is anything more efficient than if-else statements. If-else statements are also readable. 423 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Alkindi Rizky
