why doesn t decision tree work in case find minimum in this case , the trivial lower bind $ \ omega -lrb- n -rrb- $ hold , because you can not tell the minimum until you have see all the value . -lrb- by a simple adversary argument , it can take $ n\/2 $ comparison before the minimum value be process . -rrb- the information-theoretic bind -lrb- decision-tree height -rrb- always hold . but it be not always tight .
