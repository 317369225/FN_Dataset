Is Scikit-Learn Decision tree algorithm, as a supervised learning model for a mixed data-set of numeric and categorical features, good choice?I have a dataset of 6000 samples each has 35 numeric and categorical data. I thought of applying one-hot-encoder on the categorical data, then apply decision trees algorithm on the whole data-set. Is decision tree a good supervised learning model choice? Is Scikit-learn is a good library choice?You can transform your categorical features to numerical features using one-hot encoding and then use decision trees. That will give you a better performance. check : 4.3. Preprocessing data 14 Views
