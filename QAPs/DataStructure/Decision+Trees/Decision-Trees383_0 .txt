I am learning how to implement a C4.5 algorithm. I came across a scenario where a number of instances for 3 attributes are the same and non-repeating, which results in same max gain-ratio. How should I select the attribute for splitting?Two possible solutions: Choose the split randomly. This sounds foolish, but given the results shown on bagging and random forests, randomness is not always a bad thing. This is what I would probably do. Choose based on global information gain of the attributes (i.e. the information gain at the root of the decision tree). So for each attribute measure the global information gain (not just at that particular node), then split on the attribute that has been shown -- knowing nothing else -- to be the most discriminative. Theoretically, you could still have a tie, then you might go to random. A stronger theoretical foundation here, but not clear that in practice it would lead to a huge difference in accuracy. 451 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Sandeep Das
