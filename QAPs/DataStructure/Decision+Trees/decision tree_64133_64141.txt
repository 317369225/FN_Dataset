ternary decision tree for the lower bind of comparison sort with 3-way comparison the proof would be exactly the same , use a ternary tree -lrb- where each internal node have <em> three </em> child -rrb- instead of a binary tree . a ternary tree of depth $ d $ have at most $ o -lrb- 3 ^ d -rrb- $ note , so a sort tree would have to satisfy $ n ! = o -lrb- 3 ^ d -rrb- $ , which imply that $ d = \ omega -lrb- n \ log n -rrb- $ .
