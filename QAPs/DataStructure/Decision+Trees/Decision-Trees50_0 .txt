Is there a way to do multilabel classification on decision trees using R/Python?Multilabel classification (ordinal response variable classification) tasks can be handled using decision trees in Python. Scikit-learn has the following classifiers. DecisionTreeClassifier() which can do both binary and ordinal/nominal data classification. This is a supervised machine learning algorithm, so you'd need your training and test data set up in such a way that the multiple labels or classes are identified there. Reference: sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier - scikit-learn 0.17.1 documentation Ensemble classifiers: RandomForestClassifier() which can do binary, ordinal and nominal classification. Also supervised.
