How can ID3 or C4.5 decision trees be used for time series classification?One approach that I use a lot is to first classify your training period time series into periods of interest / periods not of interest, for example, trending states vs non trending states in a stock price series, or maybe brain activity when awake vs brain activity when asleep, i dunno. Then this problem decomposes into looking at the features of a time series and classifying it into one of these different classes and the regular C4.5 concepts of information entropy etc start to apply. 1.2k Views  View Upvotes
