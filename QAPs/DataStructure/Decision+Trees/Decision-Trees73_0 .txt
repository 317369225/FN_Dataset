Can a decision tree be defined as an ensemble of decision stump learners?No. In general, there are always functions that a depth-(k+1) tree can represent that an ensemble of depth-k trees cannot (as long as k < d, the dimension of the input). Say you're learning an ensemble of depth-1 trees. Each tree can only look at one input variable, so the function they represent can necessarily be decomposed into a factor for each input variable: f(x)=ϕ 0 (x 0 )+...+ϕ d (x d )  f(x)=ϕ0(x0)+...+ϕd(xd) . An ensemble of depth-k tree can only represent non-linear factors of at most k variables at a time. So for example, an ensemble of depth-1 trees can never represent the XOR function, which can easily be represented with a depth-2 tree. 153 Views · View Upvotes
