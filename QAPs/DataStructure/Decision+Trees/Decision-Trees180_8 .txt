What are the advantages of logistic regression over decision trees?Are there any cases where it's better to use logistic regression instead of decision trees?Advantages: Logistic Regression is slightly faster. Can be turned into an online algorithm. Logistic Regression is less complex. Logistic Regression is easier to inspect. Use logistic regression over decision trees, when: - Their performance is equal (Occam's Razor). - The additional accuracy of decision trees do not weigh up to increased complexity of implementation of the model. - The user/owner of the model demands a logical and easy to follow explanation for its predictions (regulatory institutions and some project managers). 2.9k Views  View Upvotes
