Is it true that an SVM classifier will always work better than probabilistic (say Bayesnet) and tree classifiers (J48/C4.5) doing text classification, say spam e-mail classification?"Always better" ? That violates the "No Free Lunch" or the "No Free Hunch" theorem in Machine learning. SVMs have high predictive power, thanks to the incredible math behind them. As, SVMs avoid overfitting, they are very powerful. But, in text analysis, typically, the data is high dimensional and if some form of kernels had to work well, it has to be a linear kernel. Decision trees overfit in most of the cases and therefore robust ensemble classifiers could do well. As random forests work on subspaces, thus circumventing the curse of dimensionality in text analysis, they have a high chance of doing well. Having said that, in unsupervised problems, techniques like kmeans clustering with "cosine similarity" distance metrics are used. Finally, the effectiveness of classifiers heavily depends on the data! 366 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Abhiee Dhadse
