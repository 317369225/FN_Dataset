What are the differences between ID3, C4.5 and CART?ID3, or Iternative Dichotomizer, was the first of three Decision Tree implementations developed by Ross Quinlan (Quinlan, J. R. 1986. Induction of Decision Trees. Mach. Learn. 1, 1 (Mar. 1986), 81-106.) CART, or Classification And Regression Trees is often used as a generic acronym for the term Decision Tree, though it apparently has a more specific meaning. In sum, the CART implementation is very similar to C4.5; the one notable difference is that CART constructs the tree based on a numerical splitting criterion recursively applied to the data, whereas C4.5 includes the intermediate step of constructing *rule set*s. C4.5, Quinlan's next iteration. The new features (versus ID3) are: (i) accepts both continuous and discrete features; (ii) handles incomplete data points; (iii) solves over-fitting problem by (very clever) bottom-up technique usually known as "pruning"; and (iv) different weights can be applied the features that comprise the training data. Of these, the first three are very important--and i would suggest that any DT implementation you choose have all three. The fourth (differential weighting) is much less important 6.6k Views  View Upvotes
