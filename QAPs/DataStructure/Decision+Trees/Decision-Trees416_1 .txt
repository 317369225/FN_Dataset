How do decision trees for regression work?Classification makes sense--you get the nodes for each category. But wouldn't you have a ton of nodes if you want a real-valued answer?Originally Answered: How are decision trees adapted for regression?The main difference between a regression tree and a classification tree is the how you measure the "badness" of a node. There are various ways to do it for both regression and classification trees. For regression trees, you could use sum of squared error (like OLS regression) or median absolute deviation (like quantile regression) or some other function. 557 Views  View Upvotes
