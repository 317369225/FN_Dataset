standardize datum for neural network you can distinguish between the following type of datum -lrb- <a href="https://martin-thoma.com/mustererkennung-klausur/#merkmale" rel="nofollow"> source </a> , see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/level_of_measurement" rel="nofollow"> level of measurement </a> for something similar -rrb- : for neural network , ratio scale feature make most sense . you can sometimes change you view on thing to get it , but most of the time you can not simply transform a ordinal scale feature to be ratio scale . two trick for you example come to my mind : you might also think about transform the country to something more meaningful for you problem -lrb- e.g. membership in a organization like oecd -rrb- . you could also combine different classifier . so you could use the `` bad scale feature '' for a decision tree and feed the result into a nn .
