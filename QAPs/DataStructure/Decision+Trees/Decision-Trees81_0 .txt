What is difference between Gini Impurity and Entropy in Decision Tree?Two metrics for choosing how to split a tree. Gini measurement is the probability of a random sample being classified correctly if we randomly pick a label according to th distribution in a branch. Entropy is a measurement of information (or rather lack thereof). You calculate the information gain by making a split. Which is the difference in entripies. This measures how you reduce the uncertainty about the label. See: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/... 738 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Chun Qhai
