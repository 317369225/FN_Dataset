How can I express a mathematical expression for a decision tree?I have a simple decision tree, somehow, I thought about how I should express my decision tree model in a mathematical form. What is the way to express the mathematical way to a decision tree model?Decision trees give way to piecewise-linear decision boundaries. Each daughter node splits it’s associated attribute into regions. A decision tree has a parent node in which the attribute space is not partitioned. As it grows subsequent daughter nodes, the decision boundary becomes a more and more complex linear partition. The decision boundary can be mathematically represented as a heaviside function with conditions on attributes. 362 Views · View Upvotes
