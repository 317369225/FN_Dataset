What is a quadratic decision tree model of computation?The quadratic decision tree model was mentioned in the research paper  "A Lower Bound to Finding Convex Hulls" by Yao(1979). It refers to a ternary decision tree, with each internal node containing a quadratic test f(x 0 ,y 0 ,x 1 ,y 1 ,⋯,x n−1 ,y n−2 ):O  f(x0,y0,x1,y1,⋯,xn−1,yn−2):O where f may be any polynomial of degree at most 2. 167 Views
