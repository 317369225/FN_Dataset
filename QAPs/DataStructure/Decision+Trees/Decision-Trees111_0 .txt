What the pros and cons of using a combination of boosting + decision trees vs some other approach in a classification problem?From what I've seen it seems like it yields a very accurate classifier, but I wonder what are the potential drawbacks?Gradient Boosting Trees are very good models. Based on my business and Kaggle experience it's usually hard to find a single classifier that outperforms GBMs. The drawbacks are: 1) Harder to tune than other models, because you have so many hyperparameters and you can easily overfit. 2) Lack of interpretability, compared to linear classifiers. All you get are "variable importance" stats, but you do not have a straightforward way to study how variables interact and contribute to the final prediction. 3) Not very speedy to train or score. 603 Views  View Upvotes
