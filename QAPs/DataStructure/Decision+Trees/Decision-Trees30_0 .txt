What is a good measure of "how certain" a decision tree's prediction is for a specific input?Aman Mathurâ€™s answer already gives a pretty good idea on how to evaluate confidence in prediction in decision trees. I will add one important point: Popular Decision Tree learning algorithms such as C4.5 goes on to split the nodes until the entropy at each node becomes zero, i.e. each node contains data points from a single output class, unless pruning is applied. In practice, pruning is almost always applied. It is a method to elude overfitting. Some methods only define a threshold for entropy and others erase some nodes and search for better generalization (post-pruning). In this case entropy is the measure of confidence. The higher the entropy the lower the confidence since entropy is the amount of surprise in the outcome 204 Views
