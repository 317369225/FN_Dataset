What is your favorite decision tree algorithm?Well since it is free, fast and brings in a few advanced notions such as re-using features plus post-pruning, I'd raise a toast to the C4.5 algorithm. I'll add a disclaimer that I do not have strong feelings about the choice of DT algorithm at present since the use of ensemble techniques is more fruitful, in my experience, when trying to squeeze more precision and accuracy out of a decision tree. 498 Views  View Upvotes
