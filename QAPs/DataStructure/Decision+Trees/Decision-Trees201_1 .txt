Is there an EM algorithm for decision tree classifiers?Well I don't think you can use EM algorithm with decision trees. But there are techniques to handle missing values in decision tree, Check out c4.5 algo(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4....). It is extension of ID3 algorithm. Weka(http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/w...) uses c4.5 algorithm(http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/w...) for decision tree classification. 313 Views  View Upvotes
