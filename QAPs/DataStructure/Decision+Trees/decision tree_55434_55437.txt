how to handle miss continuous attribute value in id3 -lrb- iterative dichotomiser 3 -rrb- ? i would like to propose paper about id3 and it s successor , generally about <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.478.7825&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" rel="nofollow"> decision tree algorithm </a> . use mean , median , mode etc. be very tempting and it work to some degree , but of course the outcome depend on value insert to miss -lrb- na -rrb- datum . mean have nice property in many statistics that it just act like miss value , but increase weight of other one -lrb- since it change nothing , other value be count with +1 \/ n weight -rrb- . <br> but in decision tree the effect be bigger , change the classifier , so there be one big idea - apply all possible miss value : - \/ . there be also three easier technique : the last one should yield the best result , but it be not always possible , and still these be not exact value . if you can predict the most probable value and replace missing one - this be the best way to do it .
