How does it impact the ability of a gradient boosted decision tree to identify and rank predictive factors if some of the variables being evaluated are highly correlated?Decision tree breaks the [sub-]tree on one variable per split. If two variables, X_i and X_j, are largely correlated, the tree would keep picking splits over one or the other, depending on which of those two separates the data slightly better at this particular time. Gradient boosted decision trees, much like simple decision trees or random forests of any kind, are not designed to identify or rank variables. In fact, they are doing pretty bad job when attempted to be used that way. 694 Views  View Upvotes
