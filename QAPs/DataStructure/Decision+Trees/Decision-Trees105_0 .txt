Are Binary Decision Trees any better than N-ary decision trees?Are Binary Decision Trees any better than N-ary decision trees? - What are the advantages and disadvantages? - When should I use one over the other? Let's say the application is building a tree for a machine learning algorithm that will make a classification/labelling based on a X number of features.n-ary trees are unstable in most cases and overfit easily. the main disadvantage of binary trees in pure form is their sensitivity to slight changes in data.Other algorithms like logistic regression do not suffer from such problems. Having a n-ary tree worsens the instability problem even more. Since there is no free lunch and no method is superior or inferior to other methods, there is surely a dataset where such methods would perform well. Nevertheless even in such cases I would go for SVM rather then n ary tree. 234 Views  View Upvotes
