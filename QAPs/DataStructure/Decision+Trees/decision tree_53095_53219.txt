what to do when the information gain on decision tree be 0 for all possible split ? you be ask how to resolve tie . the answer be : resolve the tie arbitrarily . in other word , randomly pick one of the attribute . as far as you can tell at this stage , they be all equivalent . be this optimal ? no . but the id3 algorithm be already not claim to be optimal . it be a greedy algorithm , which mean we make the best decision we can at each stage , use only local information , without try to predict they future impact . the benefit of this approach be that you get a algorithm that be very efficient at compute a decision tree . and , while it might not output the optimal decision tree , experience suggest that the result decision tree be often still very good in practice .
