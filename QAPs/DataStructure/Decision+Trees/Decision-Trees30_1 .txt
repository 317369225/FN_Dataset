What is a good measure of "how certain" a decision tree's prediction is for a specific input?While constructing a Decision Tree, the splitting attribute is typically chosen by calculating which one minimizes entropy which requires the probability of the different target labels.. Thus, it is possible to store these probabilities at every node, including the leaf nodes, which can be a good metric for "certainty" of prediction. It's also advisable to store the size of the subset of data corresponding to every leaf node, which can be used to model "certainty", (if there is more data at a leaf node, you'll be more certain of the probabilities stored there). This can be modelled by Smoothing the data at every leaf node. 94 Views  View Upvotes
