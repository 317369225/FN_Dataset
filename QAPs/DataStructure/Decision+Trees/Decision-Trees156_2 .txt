What are the disadvantages of using a decision tree for classification?Related: What are the advantages of using a decision tree for classification?William has an excellent example , but just to make this answer comprehensive I am listing all the dis-advantages of decision trees. 1. Decision Trees do not work well if you have smooth boundaries. i.e they work best when you have discontinuous piece wise constant model. If you truly have a linear target function decision trees are not the best. 2. Decision Tree's do not work best if you have a lot of un-correlated variables. Decision tree's work by finding the interactions between variables. if you have a situation where there are no interactions between variables linear approaches might be the best. 3. Data fragmentation : Each split in a tree leads to a reduced dataset under consideration. And, hence the model created at the split will potentially introduce bias. 4. High variance and unstable : As a result of the greedy strategy applied by decision tree's variance in finding the right starting point of the tree can greatly impact the final result. i.e small changes early on can have big impacts later. So- if for example you draw two different samples from your universe , the starting points for both the samples could be very different (and may even be different variables) this can lead to totally different results. 2.6k Views  View Upvotes
