How do I make a clickable decision tree using html?I want to start off with 2 or 3 nodes at the top. When you click on a topic, I want to reveal or expand into other nodes. So, I don't want the whole tree visible until you have gone all the way through the tree and made all decisions. Is there an easy way to do this using html? I'm a html beginnerOK, a simple version of something like can be pretty easy. You'll need to know a little Html, Css and JavaScript (jQuery, because I'm lazy). First, the html. You need a tree structure. You might use UL tags for this, but I'm going to use DL because I think that's more semantically correct. <dl class="decision-tree"> <dt>Topic 1</dt> <dd> <dl> <dt>Subtopic 1 - 1</dt> <dd>[...]</dd> <dt>Subtopic 1 - 2</dt> <dd>[...]</dd> <dt>Subtopic 1 - 3</dt> <dd>[...]</dd> </dl> </dd> <dt>Topic 2</dt> <dd> <dl> <dt>Subtopic 2 - 1</dt> <dd>[...]</dd> <dt>Subtopic 2 - 2</dt> <dd>[...]</dd> <dt>Subtopic 2 - 3</dt> <dd>[...]</dd> </dl> </dd> <dt>Topic 3</dt> <dd> <dl> <dt>Subtopic 3 - 1</dt> <dd>[...]</dd> <dt>Subtopic 3 - 2</dt> <dd>[...]</dd> <dt>Subtopic 3 - 3</dt> <dd>[...]</dd> </dl> </dd> </dl> Then we'll need a little CSS to hide the sub topics at the appropriate time. dl.decision-tree dd.collapsed { display:none; } Then finally, some JavaScript to make the magic happen (you'll need to include a reference to the jQuery library in the head section of your page). <script> $("dl.decision-tree dd").addClass("collapsed"); $("dl.decision-tree dt").click(function(event) { $(event.target).next().toggleClass("collapsed"); }); </script> Note: that if you don't have JavaScript available the "collapsed" class will never be applied to the DT's, so the entire tree will be visible and your information will still be navigable for the small percentage of users and browsers that refuse to support JavaScript. You could improve this example in various ways, like maybe by adding a "+" icon next to the DT which changes to a "-" when the subtopics are expanded. Here's a JSFiddle of the working code. Note, I've added a 3rd level subtopic under topic 1-1 to demonstrate how you can keep nesting as much as you like.
