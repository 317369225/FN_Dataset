Why hasn't decision tree been generalized or modified a bit to replace neural network in history? They are really similar in structure.I am sorry I cannot add the reasoning due to word limitations. Please seen the comments for the detail.Decision trees have been neck-and-neck with neural networks up until recently when deep learning approaches have pulled away for some applications. They’ve been modified extensively with things like bagging, random forests, adaptive boosting and most recently gradient boosting. Their structure isn’t similar at all. Both of them can be represented as graphs connected by edges, but if that’s the criteria then probabilistic graphical models are also similar in structure. If you look at other properties, like the number of connections, then decision trees and neural networks are very different. 245 Views · View Upvotes
