In Binary Decision Tree there 2^(k-1) -1 possible split for categorical variable with k values, how is the optimal split selected?In the case of regression, where the target is continuous, you can apparently order the categorical values by average value of the target, and consider only splits that are prefixes of this ordered list, and always get the optimal split that way. That involves just k−1  k−1 evaluations. See section 2.3 of the Google PLANET paper [1]. For a categorical target, I am not aware of an optimal heuristic of this sort. Some implementations will simply consider only one-vs-rest splits. In Oryx 1.x the heuristic we implemented was like the one above, to order the classes but by entropy of the target categorical variable [2] . Footnotes [1] http://static.googleusercontent....
