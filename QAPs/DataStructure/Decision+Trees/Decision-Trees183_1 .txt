Can someone compare different decision tree algorithms?The most famous decision trees are ID3, C4.5 and CART. Can someone compare these different algorithms?Sure. There are many criteria to compare the performance of these models, if the aim is to classify the case (in most problems, it is), after using these algorithms and introducing the model, one can calculate sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, error and other kind of criteria to assess the model performance in predicting the true class. Also cross validating is a very popular choice.  There are some other categories called ensemble trees like: random forest, bagging and boosting, you can compare them like this (or any other machine learing algorithm for classifying purposes). 1.6k Views  View Upvotes
