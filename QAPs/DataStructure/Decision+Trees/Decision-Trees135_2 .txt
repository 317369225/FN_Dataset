What is preferred among clustering, classification or decision trees to analyse emergency text messages and to decide on dispatch recommendations for officers in crises scenarios?Sorry, but you seem to be severely confused between the basic concepts of machine learning. You do classification, when you have the class labels available. You do clustering when the class labels are absent. Decision tree is a type of classification which generates if-then-else rules. I suggest read some chapters of a machine learning book then you may develop a better understanding of what you actually want to do. Nobody can offer a solution, unless the high level problem is clear in your head. The problem you are dealing is basically 'online learning/prediction of text data'. This is very different from traditional clustering and classification because you would have to update your model parameters as you encounter new messages. 179 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
