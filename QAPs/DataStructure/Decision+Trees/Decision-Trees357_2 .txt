What are some practical business uses of decision trees?Decision trees can be seen as a way to summarize the structure found in data. Sometimes (when combined by bagging or boosting) they can provide outstanding performances. When the structure found in data is simple a single decision tree is enough. And practice shows that a large quantity of data found by observing natural phenomena has a simple structure. However the performance provided by decision trees is not the most useful feature of this kind of model. The most useful feature is the fact that the models can be understood by humans. Basically a fitted decision tree ca be seen as a set of rules which contains simple clauses (e.g age > 20) put together into a large conjunction (e.g if age > 4 and age < 5 and weight < 10kg than child_class = underweighted). The rules can be easily understood and can provide intuitions which are not always obvious by a simple inspection of data. Thus, sometimes decision trees are use as a method to understand the data and not to predict. Due to its obvious construction the decision trees have started to be used at a fairly large scale together with other models like logistic regression, linear regression by a ot of practitioners of various sciences which are not usually experts in machine learning or statistical inference. Another usage which is based on the same reason (that the model can be interpreted with ease) is when you want to get a model which can be interpreted by your clients. I am thinking at some scenarios like when you want to build a model which can be executed as an SQL query or when you want that your clients to be able to understand why you offered then some suggestions (in order to avoid that your clients believe your have some hidden reasons). 336 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
