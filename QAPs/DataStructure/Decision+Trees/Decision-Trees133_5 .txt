What are the advantages of using a decision tree for classification?Related: What are the disadvantages of using a decision tree for classification?I think the answers by William Chen, Abhishek Ghose and Peter Flom cover most points. Besides these, I recently encountered one interesting usage of decision trees that some might find useful.( This is very much related to high human-interpretability of the framework as highlighted in the answers here). They provide for a fast integrity checking-tool to figure out if your Data providers have fudged the data that they are peddling. Let me explain. In my experience as a Data Scientist, I often deal with data procured from data providers in the enterprise domain. On one such occasion, I was attempting to regress upon a revenue related parameter, given a set of expense metrics. It turned out that the regression error was too damn to close to zero, which implied that we had chanced upon, what turned out to be a simple and intuitive rule engine the data provider had used to generate the fake revenue data variables, based on hunches and thumb rules prevalent in the domain. BUSTED! The point is, many fraudulent data providers out there trying to sell fake data do employ rule engines (read decision trees) to churn out the fake stuff, and it is always a good idea to run a quick check to ascertain the quality of the data you are paying for. A quick DT check is now a firm first step in our pipeline for such dataset procurement ventures. 3.7k Views  View Upvotes
