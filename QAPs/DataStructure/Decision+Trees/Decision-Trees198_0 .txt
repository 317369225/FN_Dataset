Are decision tables/trees (e.g. Drools) efficiently applicable in high-performance apps - e.g. low-latency algo trading or realtime bidding for ads?Any examples of low latency implementations of decision tables would be much appreciated - both commercial and freeYes. Decision trees/rules are very fast to compute, since it's a bunch of comparisons, and perhaps averaging/voting in the case of forests. The number of comparisons is very small, even for big trees (generally O(log n) the number of nodes in the tree). Microsoft uses decision trees as part of its Kinect system and they claim a 2ms computation time for 2000 different inputs with 3 depth 20 (i.e. up to 1 million nodes each) trees: http://research.microsoft.com/pu... They use a GPU based implementation described in this paper: http://research.microsoft.com/pu... 994 Views  View Upvotes
