When was the decision tree approach discovered?Decision tree is a well known tool for AI based topics. But does any one know when and how it was discovered ?Here is a youtube video from one of the creators of decision trees about their creation. The lightbulb moment came with a statistician, Jerome Friedman, was working with a computer scientist about nearest neighbor finding data structures. The algorithms were optimizing finding neighbors based on by picking splitting conditions that separated data well into different sub regions. He realized that he could do classification by optimizing splitting different classes apart for these nearest neighbor trees and then bam, you have decision trees. 2.1k Views  View Upvotes
