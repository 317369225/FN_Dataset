How can I find a real step-by-step example of a decision tree pruning to overcome overfitting?I have found this link but it is not very descriptive. I am looking for something which shows how each step of pruning is done. http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~eib...There is more than one way to perform pruning. The particular figure you have provided is an example of Quinlan's Reduced Error Pruning. Roughly this is how it works: Keep aside a part of the dataset for post-pruning of the tree. This is different from the test set and is known as the pruning set. For a subtree S of the tree, if replacing S by a leaf does not make more prediction errors on the pruning set than the original tree, replace S by a leaf. Perform step 2 only when no subtree of S possesses the property mentioned in 2. Because of 3, you need to proceed in a bottom up manner - so that if there is a subtree of S, say S', that can be replaced by a leaf, then it must be replaced by a leaf first - so that after replacement, S does not have any subtree with this property, and can go ahead and potentially replace S if needed. In the diagram, note that the pruning happens bottom-up and left-to-right. Every node notes the number of samples it misclassifies in parenthesis. For ex in fig 3.3 (a), the node in marked in red misclasssifies one example from the pruning set: ​ Misclassified example in the pruning set: ​ Starting from the bottom its easy to see that node 3 can be made into a leaf since it makes lesser errors (on the pruning set) than as a subtree - as a subtree the classification happens at nodes 4 and 5, and 5 makes one error; node 3 by itself makes no errors. Same goes for 6 and 9. However, 2 cannot be made into a leaf since  it makes one error, while as a subtree, with the newly-created leaves 3 and 6 it makes no errors. Final tree: ​ For more details you may want to refer to the paper "Simplifying Decision Trees" by Quinlan. 1k Views · View Upvotes
