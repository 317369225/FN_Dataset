What are the advantages of using a decision tree for classification?Related: What are the disadvantages of using a decision tree for classification?Here are some good things about trees. Other binary classifiers may share some of the traits, but I don't know of any that share all of them. Easy to understand and communicate to others: The dendogram makes sense very quickly to any intelligent person. Able to find odd interactions. Suppose you are predicting voting behavior (Democrat/Republican) and you have data on education, income, sex and age. If income only matters for people who are highly educated (e.g.) trees can find that. You could look at all interactions in a regression, but even with only 4 variables and only 2 way interactions, there are 6 interactions; as number of variables and the complexity of the interactions increases, the number of possible interactions grows rapidly. Also (see 1) a 4 way interaction in a regression equation is much less intuitive than a 4 level tree Make minimal assumptions. Of course, trees aren't perfect: They can be unstable, they don't always perform well; some believe they require very large samples to be useful and while the output is visually appealing it can be hard to translate into text. 2.1k Views  View Upvotes
