What are the advantages of using a decision tree for classification?Related: What are the disadvantages of using a decision tree for classification?I think the biggest benefit of binary decision tree is speed: * You always look at one variable at a time, tree building is fast. * Classification is super fast: you run some boolean comparison, presto magnifico you're done. A three layer perceptron gives equal benefits, except perhaps it can be more compact for multiple classifiers. The biggest downside of these methods is that you of course do not want to underfit/overfit. I don't know a good way other than trial-and-error and training sets to prevent overfitting. You can make a good guess, like don't make groups of fewer than 4 points, but it's still guessing. So it's simple and fast, but like any club, you can hit the data too hard and make a mess. SVM would be more like the scalpel in this analogy. 1.6k Views  View Upvotes
