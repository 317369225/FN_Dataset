Does Decision Tree assume variables are all independent as it is a nonparametric method?Decision Tree is non parameteric because it does not assume a functional relationship between outcome and features as is required by Linear Models for example. It actually performs a fairly simple algorithm of greedily finding best splits in the data so that entropy is maximized in the split as measured using the outcome. No assumption of independence is required for this. Though interpretation might be faulty since dependence/correlation between features could by intrepreted as an interaction effect. This will not effect prediction. 178 Views  View Upvotes
