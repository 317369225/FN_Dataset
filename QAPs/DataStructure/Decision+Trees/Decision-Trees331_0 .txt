How can I test or tell if there is an interaction between variables after completing building a decision tree?Let's say a decision tree is built and I want to see if there is any interaction between variables. How can I think of an example for it?I'm assuming that by interaction you mean correlation. One simple approach is the following: every time you split based on a variable, see if the information gain obtained by splitting w.r.t some other variable is also quite close. The intuition is that if two variables are (positively or negatively) correlated their information gains will be similar. 232 Views
