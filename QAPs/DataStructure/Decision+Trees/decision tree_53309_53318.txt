can i use the set of `` used argument value '' as a memoization key for a deterministic function ? you can simulate $ f $ by what be know in complexity theory as a <em> decision tree </em> . each node be label by a input $ x_i $ , and the edge go downward be label by the possible value of $ x_i $ . leaf be label by the output of $ f $ . for decision tree you can prove you claim by induction on the height of the decision tree . this reduce what you want to show to flesh out the claim that $ f $ can be simulated by a decision tree . if you have a computing formalism then you can prove this by induction on the length of the program , but we don t normally do that in complexity theory . we just spend a few seconds think about the matter , and see that the claim be obvious , and go on with we life .
