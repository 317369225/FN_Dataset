What are the differences and similarities between decision trees and logistic regression?These are two different approaches. Trees explain interactions well and generalize beyond known areas quite bad. Logistic regression generalize really well but has problems with interactions. Decision trees are collection of rules like if your age is larger then 12 and lower then 18 you are called a teenager. So if you are 11 and 11 month or 1 years old, for the tree it is the same and you are still not a teenager. Logistic regression uses a logistic link to connect the output and input. E.g. with every year of age your probability increases to be called an adult. This is similar to one sided rules, like up from 45 people are called adults. Two sided rules like the one above with beeing a teenager cannot be directly represented with it. A simple trick helps here. Just divide your variable in two parts around number 15 to obtain two effects. One effect between 1 and 15, there with increasing age you are more likely to be called a teenager. Anothet effect between 15 and 100, there you got an opposite effect. There are some more models which bring these two approaches even closer together.Here you can read online about trimmed or wibsorized regression, cubist and fuzzy logic. 329 Views  View Upvotes
