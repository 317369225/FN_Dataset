Do you think 50 small decision trees are better than a large one? Why?I think the group of small trees have a better chance of producing better predictions. In this case, you should actually avoid using very large trees when using the decision tree algorithm. Why? Because while large trees would result in smaller resubstitution error, it might actually produce worse generalization error compared to the smaller trees. In this case, larger trees would suffer from errors due to variance errors and also noise. Another factor is the usage of many small decision trees. In this case, I believe that you're basically talking about tree-based ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Trees right? Statistically, combining decisions from several different models using an ensemble method might actually reduce the variance error of the model. Regarding this, I think you should read more about how generalization error could actually be decomposed into bias, variance, and errors due to noise. 106 Views
