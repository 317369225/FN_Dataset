what be the difference between parse and decision tree ? a decision tree be a algorithm for compute a function , in you case the truth value of the formulum . in you setting , each internal node of the decision tree be label by a variable , and it have two child ; you go to the left one if the variable be false , and to the right one if it be true . leaf be label by true or false , and this be the return value . for example , one decision tree for $ a \ land b $ be as follow . the root be label $ a $ . its left child be a leaf label false . its right child $ x $ be label $ b $ . the left child of $ x $ be a leaf label false , and the right child of $ x $ be a leaf label true .
