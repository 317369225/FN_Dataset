What are the differences and similarities between decision trees and logistic regression?They are very different. The major similarity is that they both are models for classification, and neither is restricted to binary classification. Decision trees assume that features are categorical or will try out randomly generated thresholds of numerical features. Logistic regression assumes that all features are numerical. It will assign a multinomial distribution to each point. When making a prediction, you would typically predict the class which has the highest probability. This model can also be interpreted as a probabilistic model, where you could take uncertainty on your predictions into account. 301 Views  View Upvotes
