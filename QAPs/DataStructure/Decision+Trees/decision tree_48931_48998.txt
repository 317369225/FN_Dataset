explore and interpolate a function use machine-learning ? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_algorithm" rel="nofollow"> genetic algorithm </a> can be use for this purpose . in some case the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fitness_function" rel="nofollow"> fitness function </a> evaluation be somewhat `` expensive '' . part of the difficulty be encode some kind of measurement of `` interesting region '' and this metric would somehow have to quantify measurement over multiple function evaluation ie a single function evaluation be not enough to `` notice a trend '' . ie : the algorithm learn to explore the region of space where the gain of knowledge be greatest and later you call it <em> `` find most salient feature '' </em> . this statement be problematic because it be generally hard to mathematically quantify <em> `` where the gain of knowledge be the greatest '' </em> or <em> `` salient feature '' . </em> one possibility to formalize \/ quantify it be to consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/entropy" rel="nofollow"> `` high-entropy vs low-entropy '' </a> for which there be a large body of theory . you problem be also somewhat split along the line of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supervised_learning" rel="nofollow"> supervise </a> vs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unsupervised_learning" rel="nofollow"> unsupervised learning </a> so that a area to further analyze wrt you problem . a recent major case of successful application of ml in physics be the <a href="https://higgsml.lal.in2p3.fr/" rel="nofollow"> higg machine learning challenge </a> and incorporate many of the idea you mention . in this case particle track behavior be predict by the ml algorithm and it automatically learn about noise vs signal in the datum . win algorithm generally use <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0408124" rel="nofollow"> decision tree </a> as describe in the paper .
