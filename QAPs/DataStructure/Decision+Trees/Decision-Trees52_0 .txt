Can a trained classification algorithm be visualized as a visual decision tree? If yes, how?Newbie question: we've been doing classification using 10 features in a dataset. We would like to open the brain of this magical algorithm and visualize even if roughly, how this happens, with some sort of decision tree.Only if the algorithm is a decision tree. Different algorithms work in different ways, for instance the way an SVM creates boundaries cannot be mimicked by a decision tree. Even random forests that are an ensemble of trees cannot be visualised with a decision tree. You can visualise other things, like the relevance of each feature but not the decision process of the whole model. The point of visualisation is to better interpret the model. Model interpretability is one of the topics that creates more questions among inexperienced data folks and non data folks. It is hard for most people to understand how we trust a black box algorithm. Remember that interpretation may not be the most important aspect. If it is, you should pick an algorithm that is highly interpretable. But it is often the case that you will want more "raw power" than interpretability. In those cases what you want to visualise is your model's behaviour. Interpreting it may be completely irrelevant. Hope this helps! 407 Views  View Upvotes
