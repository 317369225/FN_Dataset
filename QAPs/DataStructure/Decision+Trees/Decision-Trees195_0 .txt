How can ID3 or C4.5 decision trees be used for time series classification?I investigated this in my PhD thesis (see https://sites.google.com/site/wa... for the thesis itself and demonstration source code: https://sites.google.com/site/wa...). In my thesis I propose two approaches. First approach Divide each time series (regardless of length) into a number of windows (say 5 -- eg. if training example A is 45 samples long, divide it into times 1-9,10-18, etc. Training example B is 60 samples long, divide it into 1-12 etc). Compute statistics, say the mean and gradient, for each of the windows. Feed this into a learning like C4.5 or ID3. You can determine the optimal number of windows for a data set by cross-validation. Upsides: This worked surprisingly well for such a simple algorithm (testing on sign language and ECGs). This was meant to be my "baseline" learner, but I had unwittingly set myself a high bar. Downsides: the learnt concepts are not very comprehensible. Works well for "trending" data, does not work well for data with rapid changes, or where events happen at different times. Second approach Create "primitives" that you might look for in the data (e.g. peaks, plateaus) etc that can be characterized by parameters (e.g. peak height, plateau level). Cluster these primitives to find templates. For each time series, check for the presence/absence of these templates to construct a feature. Then feed this into C4.5. Upsides: Allows you to include background knowledge via primitives. Produces semi-comprehensible descriptions (e.g. if you have a peak early, then a plateau it is class A). Downsides: Tricky to get right -- choosing the right primitives, getting the clustering to work. 3.4k Views  View Upvotes
