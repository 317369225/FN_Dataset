Is a decision tree just a fancy name for a sequence of if-else-if-else -if-else statements?Decision trees are quite similar to nested if/else statements. But there are some differences too. Similarities They both: Make decisions. Can be represented as a tree structure. If you are asking if you can just think of a decision tree as if if were really a bunch of nested if/else statements, the answer to that is yes, because the basic structure is the same. They are both basically a hierarchy of decision points. Since you are already familiar with nested if/else statements, you probably find that comparison helpful. Differences However, decision trees: Are a conceptual model that represents the outcome of possible decisions. Were invented outside of computing for use in making business decisions. Focus on modeling probability of outcomes and costs of resources. Have no side effects and are used to compare the value of various outcomes. And if/else statements: Are a representation of an algorithm, that is, steps how to accomplish something. Were invented for use inside programming languages. Are used to model any type of program decision and are usually deterministic. Have side effects and do not yield a value for each if/else branch taken. In machine learning Your question is tagged machine learning. That's appropriate, since machine learning is used to automatically learn how to construct the best decision trees for a given data set. That isn't true of if/else statements as such. Decision trees versus flowcharts Decision trees are also sometimes compared to flowcharts, but flowcharts are more general than if/else statements or decision trees.
