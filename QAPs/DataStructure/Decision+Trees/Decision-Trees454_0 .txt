What is the C4.5 algorithm and how does it work?It is an statistical classifier based on id3 algorithm used in machine learning. It works on the concept of information entropy. The training data is a set of classified samples having p-dimensional vectors defining the attributes of the sample. C 4.5 generates a decision tree where each node splits the classes based on the gain of information. The attribute with the highest normalized information gain is used as the splitting criteria. Some base cases are also described. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C... http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I... 795 Views  View Upvotes
