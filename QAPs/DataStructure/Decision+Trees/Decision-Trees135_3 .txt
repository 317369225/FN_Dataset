What is preferred among clustering, classification or decision trees to analyse emergency text messages and to decide on dispatch recommendations for officers in crises scenarios?Use a single Decision Tree. For cases where a person's life might be in danger, and making the wrong choice has enormous consequences, the most important aspect of the classifier should be whether you can determine exactly why it is making a given decision. This is similar to what they do in hospitals for triage. So a single decision tree will give the best insight into what is actually going on. 139 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
