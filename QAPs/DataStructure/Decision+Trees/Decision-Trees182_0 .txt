Decision Trees: How do you prune a CART?From the leaves. Or, better yet, while you are training it. Typically you will set a parameter limiting at least one of: the number of leaf nodes, the maximum depth, or the minimum number of data samples required for a node. Depending on the implementation you are using, it may not support all of these options. I usually find the requirement for a minimum number of samples per node to be necessary to prevent over-fitting. The maximum depth required is dependent on the complexity of your problem. The number of leaf nodes is pretty closely related to the maximum depth, which is why many implementations will only have one of the two as a parameter. 757 Views  View Upvotes
