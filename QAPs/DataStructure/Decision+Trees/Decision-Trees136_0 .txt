Regarding machine learning, unless I'm using some relatively simple algorithm like logistic regression or decision trees, how can I know which variables are important in my model?Did you mean important variables in data ? One of the ways is outlined below: Build a decision tree classifier using one of the Decision Tree algorithm (ID3 , C4.5) to. Use 'Information Gain' at each level, to decide the best attribute to split on. Information Gain identifies attributes which lead to classify data into homogenous subsets and thus lead to most decrease in entropy. One of the hypotheses of the decision tree (ID3 algorithm) is that important attributes lie near the root, and their importance decreases as one goes down the tree. So once the decision tree is trained, you can thus identify the important variables in your data. 213 Views
