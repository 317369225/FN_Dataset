Is boosted decision tree different from gradient boosted decision tree?Boosting is a general strategy of building ensemble of classifiers by training next estimator so that is tries to compensate errors made by previous estimators. Gradient boosting is a particular (extremely popular) variation of boosting that minimises some loss function with respect to model outputs by training next model in ensemble to approximate its negative gradient. So gradient boosted decision tree is a particular type of boosted decision tree. 56 Views
