Is there any relationship between coefficient in linear regression and information gain in decision tree?I am just wondering if there is any relationship between coefficient in linear regression and information gain in decision tree. The reason why I am wondering is that the coefficient explains the amount of information that an independent variable explains the dependent variable, as far as I know.As Peter Flom mentions, there is no real relationship between the two except that they measure, in some way, the effect of a given input on the output in a regression. They make completely different assumptions. Linear regression has one line with multiple coefficients to describe the relationship between the inputs and the outputs. Trees break the input space into hyper-rectangles (different for each tree, in, e.g., a random forest) based on the output variable via information gain (or Gini, etc). There’s no real relationship between the two except that the input variables define the output variable. How they do this is, again, complete different. 89 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Simon Kang
