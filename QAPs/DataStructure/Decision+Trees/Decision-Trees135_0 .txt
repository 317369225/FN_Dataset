What is preferred among clustering, classification or decision trees to analyse emergency text messages and to decide on dispatch recommendations for officers in crises scenarios?Your three options are not exclusive, nor are the complete. A decision tree is a kind of classification system and clustering is often used as a feature extraction method for classifiers. For text classification, you should start by encoding your training data as a binary vector with one position for every word in your corpus that has frequency more than some cutoff (should >0 to take all known words, or as high as 5 or 10). Add one extra position to handle all unknown words encountered in the future. Then you need to build a classifier. You need to decide what sort of output you need, but I would guess that taking all combinations of required actions as independent answers would work. Thus, you might have dispatch ambulance, dispatch patrol, dispatch ambulance and patrol as three separate actions. Then train your classifier. Algorithms to try include logistic regression with L1 and L2 regression (AKA Lasso), SVM, random forests and gradient boosting machines (GBM's). At the beginning, you should have held out some calls to use as evaluation cases. At this point you can use these to evaluate your accuracy. You may want to cycle back around to test alternative feature extraction as well. Candidates including using word pairs and using a program like word2vec to convert words to a fixed, low dimensional representation.
