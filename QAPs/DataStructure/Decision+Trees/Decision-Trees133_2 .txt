What are the advantages of using a decision tree for classification?Related: What are the disadvantages of using a decision tree for classification?I agree with Peter Flom that one big advantage: they are easy to understand. Particularly a naive binary decision tree is easy for anyone to code, visualize, manipulate, and explain. More advanced classifiers, clustering, and machine learning may be more accurate for large data sets, but the advanced algorithms can't be easily visualized or manipulated. 6.2k Views  View Upvotes
