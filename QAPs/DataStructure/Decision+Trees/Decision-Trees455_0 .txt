Are decision tree algorithms artificial intelligence methods?YES. As you know, Artificial Intelligence is a broader class which includes Machine Learning. At a basic level, Machine learning is about predicting the future based on the past. For instance, you might wish to predict how much a user Alice will like a movie that she hasn’t seen, based on her ratings of movies that she has seen .This means making informed guesses about some unobserved property of some object, based on observed properties of that object. The ﬁrst question we’ll ask is: what does it mean to learn? In order to develop learning machines, we must know what learning actually means, and how to determine success (or failure). The decision tree is a classic and natural model of learning. It is closely related to the fundamental computer science notion of "divide and conquer". 867 Views · View Upvotes
