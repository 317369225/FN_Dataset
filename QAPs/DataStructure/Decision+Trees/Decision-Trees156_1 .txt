What are the disadvantages of using a decision tree for classification?Related: What are the advantages of using a decision tree for classification?Interpretation: Decision Trees will never give you the right answer, it will give you many possible answers. Change the root node of the tree to start with a different variable and you will probably get a different tree. Which one is correct? Significance: Change the significance level (even a little), or the size of the bins and you will get different trees. Change the random seed and it changes as well. Repeat the process for another sample (or even subsample) and you will get another tree. Do enough permutations on your own, and you will get the tree you want! Multiple comparisons: Tree algorithms generally use chi-square test to determine significance of any particular split. But even before that has been determined, the algorithm has tried many combinations of variables to get the 'best' split. That, coupled with a tree with many levels and branches can lead to an over optimized result, or many false positives due to multiple comparison: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mul... 3.4k Views  View Upvotes
