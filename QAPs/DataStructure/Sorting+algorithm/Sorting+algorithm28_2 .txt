How does randomized quick sort perform better than the standard quick sort algorithm?Why should anybody care about a sorting method that is not optimal (has more than linear growth)?Quicksort runs in quadratic time in the worst case. The exact inputs which result in this behavior depend on how pivots are chosen. Choosing pivots at random lets you ensure an expected time regardless of the characteristics of your input. This means that using non-randomized pivots can be a security vulnerability. An adversary can craft an input that consistently results in this worst-case behavior, making it easier to run a denial-of-service attack on your server. This is an important practical concern on server-side software that deals with any sort of user input.
