Why does the stability of a sorting algorithm matter? Are there advantages to using stable sorting algorithms?A stable sort doesn't affect the ordering of items equal in that key. A non-stable sort may rearrange items for its own convenience. You want stability whenever you sort on multiple keys, because that's generally handled with a Radix Sort: Sort by each key from least significant to most significant. Most people see that as digits in a number, but it's more often used for sorting databases. For example, if you want to sort your work e-mail contacts, you probably want them sorted by name within each company. So, you sort them by name, then by company. If you didn't sort by company with a stable sort, the names are no longer in order. Libraries and some book stores sort books by genre and then author, though physically manipulating books is different. Basically, the upshot is that, if there's a chance that someone is interested in ordering data in multiple keys, you want a stable sort.
