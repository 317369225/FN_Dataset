Can multithreading improve sorting algorithms' performance?Only if sorting algorithm can be parallelized or has steps which can be run in parallel. For example, in quicksort, two recursive calls can be run in two separate threads and the calling thread can wait for two threads to finish. Think about insertion sort. I do not think it can be run in parallel (correct me if I am wrong). Parallel Sorting Strategies
