Which sorting algorithms have the least best case complexity?I think count sort is the best sort available if you can declare an additional array of size of maximum number available in the array. It sort an array with complexity O(n). The disadvantage is the waste of memory. Otherwise randomized version of quick sort is better. It avoid the worst case (previously sorted array) in 99.99% times. ie, the worst case occur in 0.01% case. If you have a computer which supports parallel programming, then merge sort is the better choice. But you need to write the code that support parallel computing.
