Which sorting algorithms have the best case time complexity?Haris Ali You might be confused about the most/least complexity, considering your answer at Which sorting algorithms have the least best case complexity?. Maybe you mean that insertion sort has the most worst case time complexity (which is ). The best case is when the input array is sorted, and the algorithm does nothing, and the time is .
