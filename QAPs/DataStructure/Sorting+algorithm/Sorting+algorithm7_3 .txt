What would be the best sorting algorithm to solve TSORT question in codechef?Turbo Sort I tried quicksort but my time limit still exceeded. I tried creating a binary search tree and printing the in order traversal still i exceeded the time limit What would be the best sorting algorithm for such a large input?It's not a large input and the time constraints are pretty loose. Actually, sorting a million numbers is a routine step in many problems on CodeChef and Codeforces. Those have harder time constraints too - 1 second is common. I'm pretty sure that you are being slowed down by I/O. If you're using Java, use BufferedReader instead of Scanner, and PrintWriter instead of System.out. If you're using C++, don't use cin and cout. Use printf and scanf. On a 3.5 GHz computer, my Java solution using quicksort runs in .33 seconds. Of these, only .08 seconds are spent in sorting. If I use Scanner and System.out instead of fast I/O, it takes 3.5 seconds: almost all the time is spent in doing I/O. CodeChef uses very fast machines, so these timings should be in the ballpark.
