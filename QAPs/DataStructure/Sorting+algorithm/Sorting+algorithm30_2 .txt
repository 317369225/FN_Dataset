Why are CS majors especially fond of sorting algorithms?该网页不存在附加信息...Let me give another insight. I agree with the rest and also, in some languages sorting is the stemming term to name computers. So, for instance in Catalan, French and Castillian, the word to name computer is "ordinador", "ordinateur" and "ordenador" respectively. Thus, giving "order" was the main objective and activity for computers from the very first moment. So much that it gave name to the machine in some languages. In other words, order is to computers like water to life... Not only. I have been working on sorting for years and it still surprises me. It is among the nicest and most challenging topics in CS. I guess this is true for most computer scientists and they like explaining algorithmics based on sorting. See What is the most efficient way to sort 4TB on a single machine with 4GB of RAM?
