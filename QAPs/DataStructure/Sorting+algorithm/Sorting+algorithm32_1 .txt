How is the cocktail sort algorithm faster than the bubble sort algorithm?Since, in the implementation of Cocktail sort, we use two loops one to go forward and the other backwards, I think it should take exactly the same time as bubble sort.It's not. It has the same asymptotic worst, average and best case performance.
