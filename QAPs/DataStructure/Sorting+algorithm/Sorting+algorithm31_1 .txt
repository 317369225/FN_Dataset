Is there any sorting algorithm which is in place, stable, and has linear runtime?Counting sort would almost meet these requirements for a small number of discrete values (for example, a million ints between 1 and 10). It wouldn't be stable, but it wouldn't be meaningfully unstable: you're just counting how many 1's, 2's, etc. you have and when you're done replacing all the items in the original store.
