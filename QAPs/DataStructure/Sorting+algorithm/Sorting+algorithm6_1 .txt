Is Java and Python's sorting algorithm broken?Proving that Android’s, Java’s and Python’s sorting algorithm is broken (and showing how to fix it)You don't really have to take their word for it. You can run their code yourself and check: sorting a sufficiently large array (filled in a particular way) with Arrays.sort() throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. In Python's case, the same logic error existed but due to a difference in the size chosen for the auxiliary data structure, it was not feasible to reproduce. Both the Java and Python teams treated the bug report as valid and took steps to correct the problem. The Java patch basically bumps up the size of the auxiliary data structure, rather than fixing the logical error. You can find the patch here: http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~lpri... The Python patch fixes the underlying error, as identified by the linked article. You can find that patch here: https://hg.python.org/cpython/re... Tim Peters acknowledged the problem and makes a compelling argument here (Issue 23515: Bad logic in timsort's merge_collapse) for fixing it correctly.
