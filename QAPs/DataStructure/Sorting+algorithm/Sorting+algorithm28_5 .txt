How does randomized quick sort perform better than the standard quick sort algorithm?Why should anybody care about a sorting method that is not optimal (has more than linear growth)?The key here is the randomized version has O(nlogn) expected total number of comparisons. The deterministic version doesn't enjoy this property, as is widely known.
