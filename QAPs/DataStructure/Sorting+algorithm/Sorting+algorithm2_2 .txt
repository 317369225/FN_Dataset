In programming contests, which sorting algorithm is best?As there are many sorting algorithms, how can I determine which sorting algorithm is best? When I should use a certain sorting algorithm? I am using C++.I agree with all the answers that say to use std::sort, which is the default to use if you need to sort all the items in your list, and stable sorting is not required. If you need stable sorting, use std::stable_sort. If you only need to sort the first N items, use std::partial_sort. And if you only need the Nth element, with elements before it being less than it (but not in any particular order), and elements after it being greater than it (but not in any particular order), use std::nth_element.
