Is there any sorting algorithm with running time log(n)?"A fundamental limit of comparison sorting algorithms is that they require linearithmic time – O(n log n) – in the worst case, though better performance is possible on real-world data (such as almost-sorted data), and algorithms not based on comparison, such as counting sort, can have better performance."
