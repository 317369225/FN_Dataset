What does it take to come up with a new sorting algorithm?It is even possible now? Or is that all the sorting algorithms have already been discovered/developed and there is non left to be now?Thanks for the A2A. While there is a considerable possibility that some highly-non-intuitive sorting algorithms are still around the corner, waiting to be discovered, the more important question is sorting what ? As the nature and scale of data evolves, new algorithms come into existence. Nature of data - there are improvements in sorting a particular datatype, say strings.Page on Tufts Scale - efficiently sorting elements when all data cannot be loaded into memory at once - External sorting. [External sorting] New algorithms come as need arises, but eventually, one fact remains - any comparison sort cannot run better than O(n*log(n)); n is the number of distinct data units that are to be sorted and can be compared in O(1).
