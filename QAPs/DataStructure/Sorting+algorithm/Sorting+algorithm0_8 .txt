What is the fastest sorting algorithm?I checked out the Wikipedia page for Sorting algorithm. The best sorts are Quick Sort, Heap Sort and Merge Sort. Most say that Quick sort is the fastest, but Merge Sort has the time complexity of O(n log n) and so does Heap Sort, even with the worst case. So, actually which sort is the fastest?The choice of fastest sorting algorithm, in a manner depends upon the data you wish to sort and the data-structure itself. Quicksort is one of the the most popular (!fastest) sorting algorithms. This is mainly due to 2 reasons: 1. It's average time complexity is O(n log n). 2. It's an in-place sorting algorithm.
