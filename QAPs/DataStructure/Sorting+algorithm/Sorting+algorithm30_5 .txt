Why are CS majors especially fond of sorting algorithms?该网页不存在附加信息...I think it might be because sorting is one of the most generic and efficient pre-processing that you can do on a dataset, which would make other operations easier. For example- you can search for an element in this sorted set by binary search. Or you can find the intersection or the union between two sorted sets in linear time. Please note that the sorting won't even require much extra space if you use in-place sorting like heapsort. This is both time-efficient (O(nlogn)) and space efficient (O(1)).
