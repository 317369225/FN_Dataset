What would be the best sorting algorithm to solve TSORT question in codechef?Turbo Sort I tried quicksort but my time limit still exceeded. I tried creating a binary search tree and printing the in order traversal still i exceeded the time limit What would be the best sorting algorithm for such a large input?When you have numbers in a very small range, you can use Counting sort to sort them in O(N). In this particular problem, all integers are in [0,10^6]. Keep an array of size 10^6 to count the number of times each integer appears. Once the counts are updated for all integers in the input, just print all numbers i from 0 to 10^6 as many times as they appeared in input. Solves the problem fast enough to be accepted.
