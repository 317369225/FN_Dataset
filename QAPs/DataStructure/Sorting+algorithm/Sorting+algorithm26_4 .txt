Which sorting algorithms have the least best case complexity?It depends on lot of factors. 1. Size of input. => Quick sort 2. How well is it sorted. => Insertion sort 3. Can your system allot more space for sorting to function. => Merge sort 5. What pattern does your input follow? => Odd-Even sort (Brick) Last, my favorite 6. Do you use a GPU for doing ordinary computation? => Merge sort in parallel computation.
