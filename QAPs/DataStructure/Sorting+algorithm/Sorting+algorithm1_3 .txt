Is sorting algorithms a closed topic?Looks like I was wrong in my comment above. It appears there are some recently invented and widely used algorithms: Although many consider sorting a solved problem – asymptotically optimal algorithms have been known since the mid-20th century – useful new algorithms are still being invented, with the now widely used Timsort dating to 2002, and the library sort being first published in 2006. - Sorting algorithm They are not always better than older algorithms (they are even worse in most cases), but they can be more preferable in specific scenarios.
