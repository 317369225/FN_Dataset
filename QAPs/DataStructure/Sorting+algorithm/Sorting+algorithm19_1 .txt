What are the asymptotically fastest parallel sorting algorithms?I found it interesting that bitonic sorter has O(log^2 n) best, worst, and average case performance; I never learned much of parallel sorting algorithms other than merge sort in school.This question has been discussed in detail on Stack Overflow. Check this Which parallel sorting algorithm has the best average case performance?
