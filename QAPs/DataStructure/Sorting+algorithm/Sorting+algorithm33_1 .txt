What does it take to come up with a new sorting algorithm?It is even possible now? Or is that all the sorting algorithms have already been discovered/developed and there is non left to be now?A new algorithm ? - Piece of cake! (assuming a reasonable imagination) But if you want something useful and better than any prior algorithm for the same problem, this is tough. Among other things, you need to have an excellent understanding of prior algorithms, why they work, how they are implemented and evaluated, how they perform in practice, and when each of them is appropriate. You also need to find a good opportunity for improvement -- in many cases, existing algorithms match lower bounds, which limits further improvements. In any case, don't bet on sorting (even if you target some unusual distribution of input data, and even if you use a GPGPU or a distributed system). In my experience on editorial boards of top CS/CE journals, I had to deal with paper submissions that claimed new sorting algorithms, where authors obviously did not bother to read even the textbooks they were citing and only evaluated proposed algorithms on 3 examples --- very uncool. As for getting a PhD in Computer Science, this usually takes more than 3 years, and you may still not develop an entirely new algorithm that someone else would find useful. It is more common to reuse existing algorithmic blocks in some new way, tweak and/or extend them. Another avenue is to find a new problem, where your algorithm would be first -- this is generally easier, but you need to keep track of new developments that create a need for new algorithms.
