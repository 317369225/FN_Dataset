Is there any sorting algorithm with time complexity less than n*logn?Yes , Their exist well known counting sort which is non-comparison based sorting technique , has running time of and space of , where is # of elements in data structure and Max,Min elements belongs to data structure itself. Important point to note here is that we should be aware of range in data structure to efficient utilization of space. Edited: Another is Radix sort which has time complexity of where is base of input numbers # of element in integer array and is the # digits is maximum number in array in worst case.For example if base is 10 then maximum possible value of =, thus time complexity of radix sort is ).This looks more than the time complexity of comparison based sorting algorithms for a large k but if can fix the maximum value of <= for some positive integer then complexity looks like , which still looks greater then comparison based sorting algorithms so possible value of for which radix sort works a linear is .In other words, we can sort an array of integers with range from to if the numbers are represented in base .
