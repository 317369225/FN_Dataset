Which is the best sorting algorithm for large data?该网页不存在附加信息...Any algorithm that promises n * log(n) time and uses less extra space is good . Merge sort is one example which takes the minimum asymptotic time i.e. n * log(n) and takes O(n) steps . NOTE : It is a proven fact that a sorting algorithm cannot take less than n * log(n) time if the array contains arbitrary entries . If the array entries come from a limited set then algorithms like counting sort can sort the array in order n time .
