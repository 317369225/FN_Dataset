How does randomized quick sort perform better than the standard quick sort algorithm?Why should anybody care about a sorting method that is not optimal (has more than linear growth)?When ever the partition is such that a percentage of elements go to one side and remaining percentage go to another side or the best case that is each time we have equal partition On both side .we get logarithmic efficiency(just for example take an array and send 10% of total elements to one side and 90% of total elements to other for each partition), this what happens in randomized Quick sort most of the time,so each time we run our randomized quick sort we get different running time , In normal quick sort we fix the pivotal element so we have partion which is not in fixed ratio ,so in worst case in each partition we can have one element on one side and rest on other there by having n^2 running time
