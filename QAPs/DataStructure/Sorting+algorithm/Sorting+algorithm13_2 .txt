Which is the best sorting algorithm and why?Quick Sort is considered as the best sort. As it takes O(nlogn) in average case runtime and o(n^2) in worst case runtime. At the same time, other sorts like merge sort takes O(nlogn) runtime in average as well as in worst case. So the reason is that quick sort considered to be as the best sorting algorithm as in average case quick sort is not equal to merge sort mathematically for example for some merge sort may takes 10000nlogn at the same quick sort will take only 2nlogn, asymptotically they both are equal. In the case of array when merge sort is applied it may take 0(n) space wheresas efficient implementation of quick sort will take only O(logn). Worst case O(n^2) will only arise when you give wrong input such sorted list of elements. But in real time scenario, worst case of quick sort never occurs
