What are the most important sort algorithms?The most basic sort algorithms are - (all having time complexity ) Insertion sort Bubble sort Selection sort Most used (in almost all practical purpose) sort algorithm Quicksort (worst case time complexity however average case time complexity) Merge sort (Used in many DataBase implementations; worst case time complexity ) Finally a non-comparison based sort - (all of the above algorithms are Comparison sort) Radix sort (worst case time complexity ) (Other honorable mentions are Bucket sort, Heapsort, Bead sort, Pigeonhole sort, Timsort (sorting algorithm for sorting Objects in Java) and finally Dual pivot quick-sort (Java 7's algorithm for sorting array of primitives)).
