What is the fastest sorting algorithm?I checked out the Wikipedia page for Sorting algorithm. The best sorts are Quick Sort, Heap Sort and Merge Sort. Most say that Quick sort is the fastest, but Merge Sort has the time complexity of O(n log n) and so does Heap Sort, even with the worst case. So, actually which sort is the fastest?Dual pivot quick sort which has 0.8nlogn swaps to make as opposed to nlogn swaps of quick sort. For comparison both take nlogn time, but dual pivot as reduces time taken by reducing number of swaps. It is used in Java.
