What would be the best sorting algorithm to solve TSORT question in codechef?Turbo Sort I tried quicksort but my time limit still exceeded. I tried creating a binary search tree and printing the in order traversal still i exceeded the time limit What would be the best sorting algorithm for such a large input?I encountered exactly the same problem with JAVA. I implemented QuickSort myself and it exceeded the time limit. I tried to use BufferedReader instead of Scanner, BufferedWrter Instead of System.out.... . All failed. Finally, I tried to use Arrays.sort() instead of my QuickSort. Sadly, it just worked. It turns out that Array.sort() uses "Dual-Pivot Quicksort" algorithm which is "typically faster than traditional (one-pivot) Quicksort implementations."
