Why does the stability of a sorting algorithm matter? Are there advantages to using stable sorting algorithms?You can find more technical details about stable sort elsewhere. But the way I think about stability in sorting is it also optimizes over the total distances all the elements travel (with some overhead). So if travel distance is not negligible when shuffling elements around then you probably need stable sort.
