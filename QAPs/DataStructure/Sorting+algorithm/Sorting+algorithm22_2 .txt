Can somebody explain me the stability of sorting algorithms?Why is quicksort and heapsort called unstable and how can we make unstable sorting algorithms stable? And why do we even classify sorting algorithms as stable and not stable?You can ask wikipedia or google. They know pretty much everything. Stable sorting algorithms maintain the relative order of records with equal keys (i.e. values). That is, a sorting algorithm is stable if whenever there are two records R and S with the same key and with R appearing before S in the original list, R will appear before S in the sorted list. Category:Stable sorts If you are using quick sort, then the sorting of 1,2,4,66,3,2,46,2 might not necessarily give you : 1,2,2,2,3,4,46,66 Note that the three 2's( 2,2,2 ) have equal value, but they are different( bold/underlined/both ). Quick sort might end up giving you : 1,2,2,2,3,4,46,66 Unstable sorts might not preserve the order of the elements with same values.
