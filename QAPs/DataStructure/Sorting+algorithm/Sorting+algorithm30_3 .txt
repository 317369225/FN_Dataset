Why are CS majors especially fond of sorting algorithms?该网页不存在附加信息...I wouldn't say it's the students, but rather the curricula that find sorting algorithms useful pedagogical tools to introduce students to formulating problems, devising solutions, and evaluating their space and time complexity. Sorting is a great CS 101 topic because it's a problem we all encounter as humans in our real lives (sorting our CD collection alphabetically for example). Contrast that with more complex problems like network flow, primality testing, or efficient Fast Fourier Transforms. Every young mother has had sort her children's laundry, but few have had to work out a breadth first search on the back of an envelope.
