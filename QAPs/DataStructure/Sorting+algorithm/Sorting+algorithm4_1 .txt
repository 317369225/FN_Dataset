Which is the best sorting algorithm for large data?该网页不存在附加信息...Take a look at the following paper which is about Merge sort Two-way replacement selection written by members of Data Management Group. DAMA-UPC. The idea is that the best algorithm would be Merge sort for the type of data you are talking about but each batch (or run in the paper) needs to be as large as possible to reduce the merge phase. Thus, depending on the data distribution, we need to use batch sorting algorithms that adapt to the distribution, and this is what "Two-way replacement selection" does, securing the largest sorted batches for a given amount of memory. In the case you need the paper or more information on the algorithm, or even the program we used, please, contact me at larri@ac.upc.edu.
