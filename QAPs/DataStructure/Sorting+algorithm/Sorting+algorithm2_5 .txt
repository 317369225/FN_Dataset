In programming contests, which sorting algorithm is best?As there are many sorting algorithms, how can I determine which sorting algorithm is best? When I should use a certain sorting algorithm? I am using C++.Had a long history with researching sorting algorithms. My conclusion: 12 #include < algorithm >  sort ( v, v+N ); ^ Coolest algorithm ever, also nice cause of implementation speed.
