Which is the best sorting algorithm for large data?该网页不存在附加信息...You shall be better suited to use any of the O(nlogn) sorting algorithms, but keep in mind that each of them have their own strengths. Quick Sort is normally found to be faster than most since it has a lower constant, but then it does have a worst case of O(n^2) and it is not a stable sort either. You can use Heap Sort since it has only O(nlogn) for all cases, but its not a stable sort either. Merge Sort may be a less faster than Quick Sort, but its asymptotically same as Heap Sort. Also it uses a lot of memory, O(n). So which sorting algorithms you need to use, shall depend on a variety of factors and even your input. So I suggest you run a couple of tests using some test data, and select your pick.
