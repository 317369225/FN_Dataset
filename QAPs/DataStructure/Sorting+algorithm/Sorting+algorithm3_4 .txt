What is the best manual sorting algorithm?For example, if you had a stack of papers that you wanted to sort alphabetically, what would be the most efficient way to do it? What if you were okay with them being off by one or two from their sorted position?I believe that the easiest way to sort a stack of papers for humans is using bucket sort with two buckets and repeating the sequence for each bucket until there are between 5 and ten elements left in each bucket. Then using "hand" sort, this is holding the pages in one hand and using the other to introduce each new element in between those already sorted.
