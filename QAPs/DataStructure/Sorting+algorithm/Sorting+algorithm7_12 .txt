What would be the best sorting algorithm to solve TSORT question in codechef?Turbo Sort I tried quicksort but my time limit still exceeded. I tried creating a binary search tree and printing the in order traversal still i exceeded the time limit What would be the best sorting algorithm for such a large input?Do it with merge sort or heap sort but if you are using c++ then don't use cin,cout.You will get AC.
