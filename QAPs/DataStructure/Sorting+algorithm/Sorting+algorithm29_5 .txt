How would you explain the various sorting algorithms to a six year old?I would forbid all discussion on sorting algorithms and act embarrassed and upset if the topic came up, and explain sorting is something that "only adults" do. I would monitor their TV watching to make sure they only watched shows with with violence and gore, but nothing with computer science. I would call all the parents of my kid's friends and make sure no sorting was going on in their houses. Then I would store a bunch of sorting textbooks in the back of my closet, I'm sure by the time they were 10 they'd know every word of those textbooks, backwards and forwards.
