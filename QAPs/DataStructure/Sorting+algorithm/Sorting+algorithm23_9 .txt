Which sorting algorithm has a time complexity of O(n)?Variations of such sorting algorithms - Radix sort - Radix sort efficiency is O(dn) for n keys which have d or fewer digits Counting sort Both of these sorting paradigms make some assumptions about the input data. Without any assumptions about the input, it is not possible to perform the sort operation with less than O(n.log(n)) comparisons.
