What is the fastest sorting algorithm?I checked out the Wikipedia page for Sorting algorithm. The best sorts are Quick Sort, Heap Sort and Merge Sort. Most say that Quick sort is the fastest, but Merge Sort has the time complexity of O(n log n) and so does Heap Sort, even with the worst case. So, actually which sort is the fastest?I am sorry but there is no fastest algorithm that's why you can find various implementations. Each implementation has strengths and weaknesses. You need to start stressing each algorithm to figure them out. For the simple case try the simplest one you can comprehend better. While increasing your dataset you will realize that each algorithm has different memory requirements or even worse the architecture of the machine that will execute the final code massively affects code performance (CPU CPI is not constant). So either you choose and verify that a simple merge-sort algorithm is good enough for your case or you should specify limitations - special conditions that will help you choose a more specialized sorting algorithm.
