What is the fastest sorting algorithm?I checked out the Wikipedia page for Sorting algorithm. The best sorts are Quick Sort, Heap Sort and Merge Sort. Most say that Quick sort is the fastest, but Merge Sort has the time complexity of O(n log n) and so does Heap Sort, even with the worst case. So, actually which sort is the fastest?TimSort which is a combination of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort. Python uses this as its default sorting algorithm. The wiki page (Timsort) explains it nicely.
