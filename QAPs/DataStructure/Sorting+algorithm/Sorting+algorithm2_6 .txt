In programming contests, which sorting algorithm is best?As there are many sorting algorithms, how can I determine which sorting algorithm is best? When I should use a certain sorting algorithm? I am using C++.This is a quite complicated question, I will try my best to answer this.. I think there're 3 metrics you should valuate: 1. Memory: This one determines whether to use the external sorting or not. External sorting is used for large data set, which stores the temporary data on disk, rather than the memory. 2. Data Type: If the data you wanna sort are quite simple and in a small range, you could use radix sort algorithm, which is much faster than the others in this case. For example, sorting RGB value of pixels. 3. Stability: If you have learned the algorithm courses, you should know that the data "priority" might change after doing some of the sorting algorithms. For example, you have 3 elements, A, B, C, and the struct of each type is 1 struct Elem {int val;}; What you're going to do is sort A B C by their val attribute. So, if A->val = B->val > C->val then the result could be B A C, which changes the sequence of {A, B} If you don't want this happen, you may use some stable ones, such as merge sort.
