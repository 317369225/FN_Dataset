In programming contests, which sorting algorithm is best?As there are many sorting algorithms, how can I determine which sorting algorithm is best? When I should use a certain sorting algorithm? I am using C++.Whenever the range of your data (the difference between the largest and smallest elements) is less than say, about 5 million, use counting sort which works in time but requires memory. If there are n <= 5000 elements, use bubble sort, which is easier to write but takes time. In all other cases, or when the items to be sorted are non-integers, use quicksort, which takes time. P.S : In C++, use quicksort every time you can for ease. It's only a single line of code.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 #include <algorithm> #include <cstdio> using namespace std; int array[5005], n; int main(){  scanf("%d",&n);  for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) scanf("%d",&array[i]);  sort(arr + 1, arr + 1 + n);  return 0; }
