What is the fastest sorting algorithm?I checked out the Wikipedia page for Sorting algorithm. The best sorts are Quick Sort, Heap Sort and Merge Sort. Most say that Quick sort is the fastest, but Merge Sort has the time complexity of O(n log n) and so does Heap Sort, even with the worst case. So, actually which sort is the fastest?It is time I published my sort routine. For strings it was 3 to 4 times faster than singleton quicksort. anyone know a good place to publish such things?
