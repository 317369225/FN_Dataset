What is the fastest sorting algorithm?I checked out the Wikipedia page for Sorting algorithm. The best sorts are Quick Sort, Heap Sort and Merge Sort. Most say that Quick sort is the fastest, but Merge Sort has the time complexity of O(n log n) and so does Heap Sort, even with the worst case. So, actually which sort is the fastest?Under special conditions, it is possible to sort in O(N). For example, if you know exactly which elements appear in your array. In this case, you can literally count the number of times each element appears and spit this into the array. Another case where this is useful is if you know the range of the elements (although this is not O(N) and is instead O(range + N - 1)). For example, if you know that the range is from 0 to 10000 and n > 1000, then it is actually faster to do this than use a standard O(nlogn) algorithm, since 1000log1000 ~ 10000.
