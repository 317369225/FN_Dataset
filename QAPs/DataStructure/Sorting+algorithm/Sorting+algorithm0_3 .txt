What is the fastest sorting algorithm?I checked out the Wikipedia page for Sorting algorithm. The best sorts are Quick Sort, Heap Sort and Merge Sort. Most say that Quick sort is the fastest, but Merge Sort has the time complexity of O(n log n) and so does Heap Sort, even with the worst case. So, actually which sort is the fastest?M2C here, the fastest sorting algorithm ever devised is the Quantum Bogo Sort. It has best, worst and average running time of O(n), Yes you read that right, O(n). It's simple, suppose you want to sort a pack of cards in order ( Clover, Diamond, Heart,Spade) and cards within the same suite are ordered A-10,J,Q,K The quantum Bogo Sort algorithm goes like this 1. Take the pack of cards 2. Throw it up in the air 3. Collect the cards 4. Check if they're in Order  If yes, You have your required answer  else, the universe is destroyed along with its notion of time Suprised? Angered? How the fudge cake is this even an algorithm? Take a look at the definition of an algorithm from your favourite DSA textbook, (I'd suggest you take a look at the real bible of DSA, The Art of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth. If you don't have it, Cormen is good enough ;) ) Turns out, by definition, Quantum Bogo Sort is a valid algorithm. Of course, it does assume that there are multiple universes and we have enough energy to destroy an entire universe. Assuming that we do, this algo will work in O(n) time all the time P.S. Try taking a look at BogoSort or BogoBogoSort, it has a time complexity of O((e-1) n! ) Funny things Quantum mechanics can do!!! P.P.S I get that this is not the answer you were expecting, but technically speaking it is the fastest "sorting algorithm"
