Which sorting algorithm has a time complexity of O(n)?Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort gives you O(n) {best case scenario}. Considering worst case scenarios O(n*log(n)) is the best suited which can be achieved using : Merge Sort or Heap Sort. For any Complexity related questions refer : Big-O Algorithm Complexity Cheat Sheet. Hope it helps.
