Quicksort: What is the quick sort algorithm?Quicksort algorithm is a divide and conquer algorithm which sorts the given sequence in place meaning that it doesn't require extra storage as we need in merge sort. The basic idea is dividing the sequence(for convenience I'll say array) into 2 sub-array around an element(a particular element of the given array) which is called the pivot such that elements in lower sub-array less than the pivot element and elements in higher sub-array is higher than the pivot element. [code] quicksort(A,p,q)  if(p<q)  then r = partition(A,p,q)  quicksort(A,p,r-1)  quicksort(A,r+1,q) [/code] typical Initial call is quicksort(A,0,n) // n = length of the array [code] partition(A,p,q)  x= A[p]  i=p  for j=p+1 to q  if ( A[j] <= x )  i=i+1  swap( A[i], A[j] )  swap( A[p], a[i] ) return i [/code] Explanation: suppose the array is 7 11 14 6 9 4 3 12 Here x=7 (the pivot) run the quicksort module recursively. and similarly the remaining sub-array would be sorted and hence the whole sequence. Analysis: The partition module runs in linear time. Worst case analysis is O(n^2) but if we use clever partition then it can be optimized. The given partition module is good for array having distinct elements and for duplicate entries original Hoare's partition algorithm is good. Hope this would help.
