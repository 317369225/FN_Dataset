What is the fastest sorting algorithm?I checked out the Wikipedia page for Sorting algorithm. The best sorts are Quick Sort, Heap Sort and Merge Sort. Most say that Quick sort is the fastest, but Merge Sort has the time complexity of O(n log n) and so does Heap Sort, even with the worst case. So, actually which sort is the fastest?quicksort is O(nlogn) on average and O(n2) in the worst case. At the same time, other sorting algorithms are studied which are O(nlogn) in the worst case (like mergesort and heapsort), and even linear time in the best case (like bubblesort) but with some additional needs of memory. That's why quick Sort is more faster than any other.
