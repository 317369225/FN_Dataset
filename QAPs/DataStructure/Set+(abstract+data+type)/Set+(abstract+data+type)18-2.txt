Many languages support the concept of abstract data types. However, languages seem to have various levels of implementation of this concept. Why do you think these different levels or categories exist?
The idea of an abstract data type is to prevent the user seeing what is inside your implementation. The less they see, the more portable the code will be. However sometimes it is helpful to see what is inside to carry out some action not anticipated by the library writer. So the question is how to control the access using friends or some such technique. Because there is no definitive answer, different languages will work in different ways.
