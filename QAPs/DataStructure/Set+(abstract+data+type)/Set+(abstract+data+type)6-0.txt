What is Redis?
The official answer would be: http://antirez.com/post/redis-ma... Yet what really matters is not what Redis is, it's what you make of it. You could see it as a simple key/value store. You could see it as a (soon-to-be) distributed NoSQL (mostly) in-memory consistent database. As for me, I tend to use it as a means to achieve persistent shared memory between independent processes in the same machine. In other words: a way to turn processes into pause-able threads with an infinite life length. If you have a specific problem and wonder wether Redis can help, you should ask the Redis Google Group: http://groups.google.com/group/r...
