Can a FAT based file system be modified to support multiple references to a file (i.e. aliases) by using the same FAT block sequence in directory table entries?
To organize and store the data on hard drive, a computer system uses a file system as a method in its underlying structure. It is a set of abstract data types that are implemented for data retrieval, storage, organization, etc. It is not possible to modify FAT based file systems for multiple references to a file. In fact, when a reference was deleted the file would be added to free space and possibly reused. This would result in two different files sharing space with any write to one corrupting the other. Secondly, if you try o have directory items, which point the same FAT record, a standard check disk utility will likely give an error. Such a claim could work if the file system was immutable. For example, if it was written to an unwritable medium (e.g. CD). The DOS FAT File System stores all information about a ﬁle in a single structure inside a directory, except the addresses of disk blocks that contain ﬁle data. Disk block numbers of all ﬁles are kept in a File Allocation Table (FAT). Since the link information and ﬁle container information are bound together in a single structure, this ﬁle system does not support multiple links to a single ﬁle. It does not support symbolic links either, though it could have. MS Windows supports shortcuts that are similar to symbolic links.
