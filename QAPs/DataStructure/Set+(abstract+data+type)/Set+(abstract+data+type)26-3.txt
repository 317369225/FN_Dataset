What are data structures and algorithms?
Data structures are different methods of organizing and storing your data. Examples would be arrays, hash tables, linked list, etc. Algorithms is a step by step guide/instructions to solve problems or do calculations. You should try to expose yourself to the Church Turing thesis, which defines algorithm. Examples would be sorting algorithms, search algorithms, etc.
