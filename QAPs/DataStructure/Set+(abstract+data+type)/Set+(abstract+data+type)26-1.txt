What are data structures and algorithms?
Data Structure  A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.Data structures can implement one or more particular abstract data types(ADT), which are the means of specifying the contract of operations and their complexity. AlgorithmIn simple words "an algorithm is a set of sequential steps to accomplish any task". Or in other words we can say "An algorithm is an outline, the essence of a computational procedure, step-by-step instructions." @http://doubtpoint.com/doubt/1347... Updated 19w ago • View Upvotes
