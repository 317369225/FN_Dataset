Did Steve Jobs often send mass emails to Apple employees? If so, what were they about?
Steve's emailing to the whole company was infrequent. The emails themselves were always brief, focused and sometimes you sensed there was a smirk behind them. The classic company wide email was around 2006. "Team, it turned out that Michael Dell wasn't perfect at predicting the future. Based on today's stock market close, Apple is worth more than Dell. Stocks go up and down, and things may be different tomorrow, but I thought it was worth a moment of reflection today. Steve." And it was funny to me at the time because I was working for Apple in Austin, TX and knew for a fact Apple was a far, far better company than Dell in too many ways to list.
