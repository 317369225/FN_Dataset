Did Steve Jobs often send mass emails to Apple employees? If so, what were they about?
In one of the books, I came across the an email Jobs sent to all employees. Dell and Apple were long time competitors and CEOs of both companies often exchanged extreme critics publicly. Jobs said "Dell products were un-innovative beige boxes" and when Apple was going through rough times after Steve was fired Michael Dell said "The best thing to do for apple, was to shut down and return the money back to the shareholders " After Steve jobs returned to Apple and brought it back to it's glory, in 2006 the share price of Apple exceeded Dell's share price. Steve Jobs sent following email on that day: Team, It turned out that Michael Dell wasn't perfect at predicting the future. Based on today's stock market close, Apple is worth more than Dell. Stocks go up and down, and things may be different tomorrow, but I thought it was worth a moment on reflection today. Steve.
