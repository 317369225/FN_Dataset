What are data structures and algorithms?
First, I'm going to make sure that you know that data structures and algorithms are 2 different things but are definitely related. I am going to start with the definition of an algorithm. In my first ever computer science class that I took, the professor gave us a very good definition of algorithm that has stuck with me since. He said that an algorithm is a finite set of instructions to solve a problem in a finite amount of time. An example of an algorithm in real life is a recipe. A data structure is defined as a specialized format for organizing and storing data. They consist of a container and a set of operations that can be done on the container. A very good example of this is a list. The actual list is the container that holds the things. For the sake of the example lets consider a grocery list. This list holds the things that you need to buy from the store. In order to make the list useful you must be able to add and delete things from the list as well as reference things that are contained in the list. These are the operations. In computer science, when you are implementing an operation on a data structure, you use an algorithm. If you have an array-based list and you want to add something to the start of the list, a basic algorithm could be to move all elements up one index then store the element that you wanted to add in the first index.
