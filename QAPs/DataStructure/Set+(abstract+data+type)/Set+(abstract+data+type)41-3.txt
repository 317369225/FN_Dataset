Did Steve Jobs often send mass emails to Apple employees? If so, what were they about?
Not very often, maybe two or three per year max; sometimes they were about something trivial like some new Pixar movie launch that weekend and he wanted to share the news, sometimes to announce a few extra paid vacation days to staff on Thanksgiving (moved to Christmas for European staff) as a reward for a hard-working and profitable year or, sadly, to announce his sick leave period and appoint Tim as interim CEO. In 10 years I got maybe 20-25 emails from Steve and addressed to all staff, no more.
