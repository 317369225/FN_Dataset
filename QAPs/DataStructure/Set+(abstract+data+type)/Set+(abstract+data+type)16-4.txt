Should I study programming/coding while at college or study something else and do coding in my own time if I want to be a programmer?
While it's certainly possible to learn just about everything associated with a computer science degree (in fact, most degrees) on your own, it's a lot harder to convince an HR screener (who probably doesn't know a whole lot about programming) to pass your application through to a hiring manager without a degree. They have no way to learn what you claim to have learned or that you learned it thoroughly, whereas your GPA gives a basic sense of it.  "Well, they can just look at my enormous list of personal projects," you might say, but the question you need to answer is what would motivate them to spend that much time on your application. There are exceptions.  If you have a specific job in mind, it might be more worthwhile to have a degree in the company's field.  For example, if you want to program at a media company, there's a chance you'd do better with a communications or journalism degree to get in the door as someone who knows your end users better than a typical programmer might. But generally, it's an uphill battle to get an interview without the right degree, so I wouldn't recommend it.
