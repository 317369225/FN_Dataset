What is an algorithmic problem that is easy to solve in Haskell but difficult to solve in Python?
Being able to describe things as an infinite space that you selectively explore is one of the more obvious strong points of Haskell's non-strictness. I really liked the first solution in Chris Done's Waterfall problem article Twitter waterflow problem and loeb but the later solutions are cute too :) Ed Kmett's automatic differentiation library is pretty compelling as well, I think.
