What is the definition of an "Object Oriented" language?
The Idea of "pure" object oriented refers to the language which is made up of just  objects and classes. And within the language, all accesses are done through 'Message Passing'. A Pure Object Oriented Language has     -Data Hiding/Encapsulation     -Inheritance     -Polymorphism     -Abstraction     -All data types are objects. When Java highly  spread worldwide some MS rooted resources told the rumors that JAVA is not a 'Pure Object Oriented Language' since it contains Primitive Data Types (int, long, double...) and wrapper class, theoretically, that is right but theoretically. I don't totally agree with the idea since Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction meets the genuine requirements of OO. That is what it's all about,indeed Best Regards
