What is the difference between CSE 373 and CSE 332 at the University of Washington, aside from the majors' distinction?
CSE 373 and CSE 332 is almost identical material. None of the material in CSE 373 is 'watered down' as some people might expect. Besides the fact that CSE 373 is only 3 credits and has no quiz section, the only major difference the fact that CSE 332 dedicates 3 weeks to dealing with parallelism and concurrency whereas CSE 373 spends more time on abstract data types. Most notably, CSE 373 goes more in-depth on the implementation of the disjoint set data structure and has more time for review of basic data structures (ex BST) whereas CSE 332 moves at a slightly faster pace to be able to make sure there's time at the end of the quarter to cover concurrency and parallelism. Personally, I have only taken CSE 332, but I would imagine policies and lecture are about the same. Hope this answers your question!
