What are the applications of set theory in computer science?
Na√Øve set theory (as opposed to axiomatic set theory) is widely used in computer science and is a central part of the underlying mathematical language. Here are some examples that many undergraduate students in computer science will come across. Data structures should be thought of as implementations of sets with particular focus on efficient implementations of set operations. In database theory, the notion of a relational database is that of seeing a database as a relation over sets. In formal language theory, a language is a set of strings and the study of operations on languages is central. Some of these are the usual set operations of intersection, union and complement, while others are particular to sets of strings (language concatenation and Kleene star are well-known operations on languages). In programming language semantics, semantic domains are sets with structure (typically complete partial orders). And algorithms for solving set constraints are useful in e.g. the study of type inference for programming languages. Axiomatic set theory becomes useful in certain parts of computability theory and in the study of logic in computer science, but these are not the kinds of topics that undergraduate students are likely to encounter.
