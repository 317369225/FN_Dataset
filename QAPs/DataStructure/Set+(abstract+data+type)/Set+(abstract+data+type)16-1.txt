Should I study programming/coding while at college or study something else and do coding in my own time if I want to be a programmer?
YES.You can do coding during your free time. Rather than learning to code, try solving problems. I realized this after my college. I do learn programming languages in my college. But the better part is to fit the programming language to solve problems. Take some of the online coding sites and work on your leisure time. Try pulling your friends also into it. Group activity is more fun. Happy learning! Good luck for future programming!   Thanks to  Quora for suggesting me this question :)
