Did Steve Jobs often send mass emails to Apple employees? If so, what were they about?
My second favorite example from Back In The Day: Date: Thu, 01 Nov 2001 12:25:25 -0800 (PST) From: Steve Jobs <sjobs@apple.com> Subject: Monsters, Inc. Just a gentle reminder that Pixar's newest movie, Monsters, Inc., opens this weekend. I hope everyone can go see it this weekend.Â  It's a gem. Best, Steve I no longer have a copy of my favorite, but I think the year was 1998. The gist of it was, "Wow! We're doing so well that we've actually triggered profit sharing. I didn't even know we *had* profit sharing."
