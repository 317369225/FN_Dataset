What specifically does Palantir do?
Engineering talent arbitrage. Palantir hires and tries to keep motivated the smartest engineers they can find (they have an infamously difficult interview process to get through). They then place them into other companies directly to help solve valuable problems for those companies on a project basis. The reason these other companies work with Palantir is that they would never have a chance of hiring and being able to manage exceptional engineers themselves (in particular financial and government organizations). This is the most succinct explanation of what Palantir really does. Updated 65w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
