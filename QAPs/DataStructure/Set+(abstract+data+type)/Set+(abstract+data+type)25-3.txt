Object-Oriented Programming: In layman's terms, what is the difference between abstraction, encapsulation and information hiding?
It's hard to provide a layman's explanation with code.  ;-) Abstraction is simply generalizing a set of concepts or objects and then sticking a label on it.  If you go to the kitchen, empty a cupboard into a box and label it as "Dishes", that's an abstraction. The box itself represents an encapsulation, but doesn't require the label. Information hiding is a bit stronger.  Now, something is going on inside of the box, but you can't tell from the outside how it's happening.  A car, for example, hides all of the information about how it actually operates from the casual driver or passenger.
