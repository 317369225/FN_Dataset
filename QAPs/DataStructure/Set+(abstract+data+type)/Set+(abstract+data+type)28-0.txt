Is data abstraction applicable in C language?
Yes.  C has the base Data types, and C structs and typedefs allow the full range of data abstraction that other languages allow.  It may not be as nice as OO abstractions, but the C approach fully qualifies as "data abstraction". Also, you can implement many types of dynamic abstractions in C, using the simple fact that C lets you shove bits-sets of strange and arbitrary size into unformatted blobs of memory easily and efficiently.  This allows abstractions of the type needed to manage networking packets, file systems, or database engine data to be handled very easily in C. Since C++ has the same property, you can do this in C++ too...
