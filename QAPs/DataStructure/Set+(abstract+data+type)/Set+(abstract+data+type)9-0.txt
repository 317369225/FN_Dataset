Why is rope data structure not made part of standard C++ library?
Standard C++ library (or for that matter library of any other language) do not support "data structures", they support "abstract data types" Standard language libraries provide "abstract data types" like "set", "map", "vector", "list", with pre-defined operations, time complexity guarantees on the operations, but never (or rarely) specify the details of internal data-structures. A user of standard language libraries is needed to know of only the "abstract data types" and the operations defined, and not of internal details/data-structures of the implementation. The practical set of everyday utility "abstract data types" do not need "Rope". Is is available as and SGI extension Rope
