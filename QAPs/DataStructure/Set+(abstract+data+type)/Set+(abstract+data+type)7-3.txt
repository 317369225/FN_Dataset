What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
That no computer system is truly secure. Anyone who's had some exposure to the subject of computer security will know that Security is an extremely complex and difficult topic and one that must be considered in every aspect of a system's development, right from the very start. It takes only one careless error, or one unforeseen set of circumstances, for all this work to be undone. Most corporate leaders have no idea of the complexity involved in creating a highly secure system and would never allow their organization to spend the time and money required to produce one, regardless of the importance of the data involved. On top of these technical and political challenges, no system is ever more secure than the people authorized to interact with it, people in roles often subject to tremendous wage pressure (think of all the customer-support positions outsourced over the last decade). In short, no one who has spent much time working on computer systems would ever trust one. Updated 10w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
