What are the ways to implement a discrete math concept in programming language?
Using Abstract Data Types is the best way to abstract the notion of Graphs or any other discrete structure such as Trees, Sets, Hash tables etc. in a programming language. When I was taking a Discrete Structures course in college we implemented them in Java. Of course you can do the same in other programming languages such as C, C++, Python etc. Our professor was nice to not make us a buy an expensive book so we used this free and really good book by Clifford A. Shaffer: http://people.cs.vt.edu/~shaffer... Like anything else, you will need to understand the theory behind these data structures to be able to write efficient program implementations. Knowledge of Discrete Math helps a lot. So I recommend going through the book I linked above and doing all the exercises. After you're done with it, I recommend looking at Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS. Updated 79w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
