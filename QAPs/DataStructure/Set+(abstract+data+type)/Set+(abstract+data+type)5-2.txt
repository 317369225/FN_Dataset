In the context of Java, is it correct to say that an interface is an abstract data type and a class is a data structure?
Not exactly. An abstract class is an abstract data structure. An interface contains only methods. There is also a subtle differences between an interface and a pure abstract class (with no field, just methods). The difference is that if you build a program against a library that exposes an interface, any change to the interface will invalidate the reference to the interface. An abstract class can be changed, as long as the referenced method still exists. Doesn't matter often, but remember. One day it will save you hours of debugging!
