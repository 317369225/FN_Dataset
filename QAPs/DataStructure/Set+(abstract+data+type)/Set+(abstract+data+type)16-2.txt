Should I study programming/coding while at college or study something else and do coding in my own time if I want to be a programmer?
Anyone can learn to code by memorizing a bunch of syntactic sugar from books or the internet. What sets apart top programmers is a deeper understanding achieved through knowledge of algorithms, complexity, abstract data types... etc. Even knowledge of compilers amd computer architecture can play a significant role in furthering your programming abilities. This can all be achieved without attending university of course, but good universities know what's important for you to learn and will guide you along the right path, something hard to do on your own, so if you want to dedicate your life to programming a degree in computer science seems like a viable option. But honestly if you set out to learn all of this and practice programming rigorously it is achievable on your own. It comes down to your own ambitions really!
