Should I study programming/coding while at college or study something else and do coding in my own time if I want to be a programmer?
I faced a similar choice when entering college. In the end, it came down to this realization: It's easy to learn poor coding. If you have multiple interests, say coding and history, you could major in history and practice coding on your own time, or major in computer programming and study history on your own time. Which one makes more sense? These days there are more and more resources for learning programming available online, and you see plenty of stories of successful programmers reaching great heights just by teaching themselves. As wonderful as this is, such stories are the exception to the standard. The ability to program is still a skill that employers want to be able to verify quickly. With most, you won't get to prove your skills through a programming test, etc, until you've passed a screening process that looks for validation of your background -- i.e. a degree. So unless you plan on focusing on a career in whatever alternative subject you would study, you'll probably find that it's easier to pursue other interests on your own time, and study programming in school.
