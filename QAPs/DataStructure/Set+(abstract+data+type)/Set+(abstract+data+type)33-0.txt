Which programming language is good to learn OOP?
I would suggest Smalltalk, for starters. I know there are popular notions that C++, C#, and Java are OOP, but C++ is not an OO language, and I don't really consider C# and Java to be OO, either. I say they fall into a class of languages that enhance abstract data types. There are other languages that are either full-featured OOP (Andrea Ferro mentioned CLOS--Common Lisp Object System), or allow you to experience something like OOP, but are farther from the concept. IMO they require one to be comfortable with OOP principles to really use, and would be like jumping into the deep end of the pool for a beginner. As Andrea says, Python might be a good candidate for bridging between what's popular, easy to learn, and what gets a few ideas of OOP across, but I haven't used it, so I can't give an opinion on it. (I'd suggest Ruby by the same criteria.) A modern version of Smalltalk is Squeak. There are free books available online that introduce the Smalltalk language, and OO concepts. For using the Squeak environment, there's a good book called Squeak by Example, which you can get for free. You can find Squeak either at Squeak Smalltalk, or you can use it online. I talked about that at Where's the best place to learn Smalltalk online? Even though it's not a popular language, I found Smalltalk easy to learn, and once learned, a joy to use. It has a very small set of reserved words. The main challenge is navigating its class library, which is large. A book on it will likely help narrow down what parts of the class library are more important for a beginner to learn.
