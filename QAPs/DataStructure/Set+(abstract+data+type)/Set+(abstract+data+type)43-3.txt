What specifically does Palantir do?
I used to work at Palantir, but I do not represent the company in any way.  I think it is interesting that one of the newer domains they are focusing on is cyber security: http://www.palantirtech.com/gove... The following description from that link is a good description of what their tools provide in all the domains that they work in: "It [Palantir] is the environment in which a team of investigators builds up an interactive repository of incidents, entities of interest, historical cases, and more, all contributing to the organization’s corpus of analytical knowledge. As more information is added over time, this knowledge stockpile structurally improves the capability of a computer network defense or cyber intelligence organization." Two points I would highlight: "team of investigators builds up an interactive repository of incidents, entities of interest, historical cases, and more" -- It is interesting to compare and contrast this description to other tools the enable collaborative integration of information such as wikis or Quora. " this knowledge stockpile structurally improves the capability of an ... intelligence organization" -- This hints at the broader idea of "facilitating human-computer synthesis".  That theme is one of the points discussed in this letter that was written by Palantir's CEO, Alex Karp: http://www.palantirtech.com/abou...
