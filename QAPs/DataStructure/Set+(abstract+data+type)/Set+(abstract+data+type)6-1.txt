What is Redis?
I think the wikipedia article is clearly written. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red... Redis is an open-source, networked, in-memory, persistent, journaled, key-value data store. It is written in ANSI C The Redis data model is in its outer layer, similarly to other structured storage systems, a dictionary where keys are mapped to values. One of the main differences between Redis and other structured storage systems is that values are not limited to strings. In addition to strings, the following abstract data types are supported: Lists of strings Sets of strings (collections of non-repeating unsorted elements) Sorted sets of strings (collections of non-repeating elements ordered by a floating-point number called score) Hashes where keys are strings and values are either strings or integers The type of a value determines what operations (called commands) are available for the value itself. Redis supports high level atomic server side operations like intersection, union, and difference between sets and sorting of lists, sets and sorted sets. Updated 257w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
