Why is the seemingly obvious proof of the four colour theorem wrong?
ETA: The basic problem, after all your edits, is this: all you have done is proven that statement (1) "If, in any and every map, no more than four “countries” can all touch each other, then only four colors are required to color any and every map" is at least as strong as the four color theorem.  Can you prove (1)?  If not, you don't have a substantial proof of the four color theorem. (This is addressed, not quite in so many words, in the second half of my answer.) I'm not educated in the complexities of this mathematical area of study, but I can say this: it's easy to prove that five regions don't require five colors, but much harder to prove that any number of regions don't require five colors. "It seems obvious that if three of the colours are touching, then the fourth colour that touches all three must encircle them and allow the use of one of the three isolated colours. What am I missing here?" First, the fourth color doesn't have to encircle the other three in order to touch them all. Red, green, blue, pink are all touching each other, but none of them encircle the other three. It is true that any four mutually contiguous regions forming a simply connected 2D space must have at least one enclosed region (in this case, red is enclosed by the others), and that would be sufficient to prove the thorem, except...are you really sure this is the only reason a fifth color could be necessary?  What if the pink region didn't border the same red region as the green and blue regions, but instead a different region that had to be red because it was touching different green and blue regions...and so on. Now it's possible for a region to border red, green, blue, and pink, requiring a fifth color. Proving that this can't happen is required to complete the theorem. Updated 22w ago • View Upvotes
