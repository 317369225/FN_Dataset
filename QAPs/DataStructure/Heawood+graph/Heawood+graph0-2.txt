What is the significance of the projective plane in mathematics?
Thanks for A2A. For my part the projective plane is too simple and basic to make significant work with. That being said, I work everyday with projective structures. However, there is one exception, the Octonionic projective plane. See Cayley plane, Octonions, What is the Cayley projective plane?
