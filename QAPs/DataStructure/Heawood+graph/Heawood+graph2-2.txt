Why is the seemingly obvious proof of the four colour theorem wrong?
All the regions may have 5 or more neighbors. If such a region has three colored neighbors they might not be touching. Many times when you start coloring the regions, you'll get to the a new region and find you've already used all four colors on its neighbors, and you'll have to backtrack or start over. For a start, try 4-coloring a soccer ball.  Here's one spread out on a plane so you can see all of it at once.  (The outside region has to be colored, too.) After doing that one, try a few of your own. Soccer balls are symmetric, but the nonsymmetric figures are harder.  Draw a figure where all the regions have at least 5 sides. Many will be hexagons; there will be at least 12 pentagons; for each heptagon you'll need another pentagon; for each octagon you'll need two more pentagons; etc.
