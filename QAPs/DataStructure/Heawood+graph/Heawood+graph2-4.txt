Why is the seemingly obvious proof of the four colour theorem wrong?
There is a simpler argument to show that your proof does not work. The four color theorem only works on planes, not on for instance a torus (which requires 7 colors). The number of colors required is dependent on the global topology, and therefore the proof is as well. Your proof does not depend on the global topology, and if it were correct, it would incorrectly proof that 4 colors suffice on a torus (which is not true). An example of a torus map requiring 7 colors: So more specifically, the following is false: 2) If three countries all touch each other and a fourth country is added, which touches all three of those countries, then it must completely encircle one of those countries. Take for example any three countries on the torus (say 2,4 and 5). Any other country (say 3) touches all of the previous, without encircling any of them. So the problem is proving that your statement is true in the case of a surface topology, which is highly non-trivial. At least less trivial then you make it seem.
