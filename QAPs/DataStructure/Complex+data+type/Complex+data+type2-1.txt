What types of “complex data” are associated with medical codes?My understanding is that medical codes have a one-to-one relationship with diagnoses, so how complicated can it get? Disclaimer: I don't have a medical background but have been looking into jobs as a medical code statistician, a natural progression of my self-employment as a bespoke statistician. Thank you for your perspectives.
From the UK: Medical coding has had numerous false starts and even now is still growing in complexity. The range of data to be coded and the relationships between the codes - usually crucial to making sense of records - makes for an essentially impossible task in the clinical sphere. Diagnostic categorisation is fraught with dispute, time changes views, miscoding is probably rife. Never lose sight of the fact that medical coding is not primarily for the benefit of patients or clinicians - it is almost exclusively a management tool and device for billing. Some countries do still send out bills for medical treatment - strange but true.
