What's are good ways to learn node.js, angularJS, Meteor, JavaScript and NoSQL?
I've gone through this entire process recently so I have a fresh perspective.Â  I started with Meteor approximately a year ago and completed some sample projects. I really like the book Discover Meteor, but what it made me realize is that meteor abstracts too much for a beginner. Wait...isn't that why you want abstraction? For me personally, I get really annoyed by not understanding the underlying workings of a technology. So, next I decided to be focus on building up my JS/Angular/Node/MongoDB chops. Regardless of the source where you get your education (books, online tutorials, codeschools, etc.) the #1 thing that gave me confidence was building a full slice through a pet project. Building a slice through a project is far more difficult, than building it sequentially from the front-end to the back-end or vice versa, as it requires some luck to get it up and working correctly without using a boilerplate or scaffolding (which I avoided). I literally typed everything instead of using copy and paste. In the end, I'm very happy with the confidence that this process gave me. After doing various online tutorials and code challenges I knew I was getting no-where unless I could build something that incorporated every aspect of this stack. I won't get into what tutorials, books, tech is best. It's worthless. It's all you. Good luck.
