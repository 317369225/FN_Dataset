Originally Answered: What should I do to get a job in Google?There are two ways : Either you need to have a really really impressive background with strong(I mean really strong...like blazing fast ) coding ability , should be flawless in algorithmic knowledge and Maths . [ Because Luck doesn't favor all , believe me , you might be good in stuffs but if you don't click within that 45 mins , noone cares who you are or what you are !! ] Or, you have worked / are working on an app which has / about to have more than a million users , then you won't even require interviews , Tech Giants other than Google would love to have you in their Team ! P.S. Be an Over-achiever and you would be in a position to turn down Google !
