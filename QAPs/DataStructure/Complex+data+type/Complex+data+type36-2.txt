Which is better, SQL or NoSQL?
It depends on your specific task. Use SQL if 1. You have complex and relational data scheme, like 100+ tables, related to each other 2. You have lots of complex queries to your data Use in-memory (Redis/CouchBase/Aerospike/Tarantool) NoSQL if 1. You have 100k+ qps, including CRUD operations 2. You need sub-millisecond latency 3. The size of your data is below 1-100Gb per node Use on-disk (Cassandra/HBase/) NoSQL if 1. You have 100k+ qps, including CRUD operations 2. You're Ok with 20-50 millisecond latency 3. The size of your data is terabytes per node Use hybrid architecture if your requirements don't fall to one of the groups above. For example, store everything in SQL, except extremely hot pieces of data that need to be stored in in-memory NoSQL.
