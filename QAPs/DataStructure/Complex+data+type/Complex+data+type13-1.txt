Why do structs exist in C?I'm a bit new to C and coding in general but I vaguely recall a lecture I sat in on that has to do with memory stored efficiently contiguously. Stuff I googled suggests this but mostly defines how to deal with a C struct. I think a bit of intuition would help me understand/use C structs much better.
In other languages, a struct is often referred to as a record, which might make it a bit clearer:  You group data elements together because they have meaning together. It's really as simple as that.  If you have an employee (or student) record, you want all of the information for each person in the same place.
