For someone who has zero knowledge of programming, what would be the best approach to learning R?
Assuming that you've got no or little programming background, I'd recommend to get used to it by learning the following. 1. simple to complex data types - number, string, logical, vector, data.frame, matrix, list (optional) - better to know how to keep your data 2. reading/writing text (csv) files - better to know if data can't be created easily in R or has to be exported 3. (optional) conditioanl expression (mainly 'if') and looping construct (mainly 'for') - better to know if outputs are obtained conditionaly or recursively 4. (optional) function (eg to create your own function to multiply two numbers) - better to know if you've got your own way of obtaining values It doesn't need to be exhaustive as your R can be improved a lot by doing. There must be enough R tutorials on the web including the following. Learn R with R tutorials and coding challenges | DataCamp Try R swirl: Learn R, in R. Finally below is a link of a cookbook for reference. Cookbook for R
