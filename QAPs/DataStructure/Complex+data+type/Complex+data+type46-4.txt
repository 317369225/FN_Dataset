What are some mind-blowing facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?
There's a song which you know really well, and everyone around you knows really well, and most children around the world knew really well for decades and probably still do, and it was written for a porn movie. Yup, that's right. That cute skit by the muppets? It was written by Piero Umiliani for Svezia, inferno e paradiso, a "pseudo-documentary about wild sexual activity and other behaviour in Sweden", specifically for the "Swedish Sauna scene". (This is what passed for porn in 1968). Mah Nà Mah Nà graduated from its seedy beginnings to be featured in the very first season of Sesame Street, in 1969, and from there to the Ed Sullivan show, and from there to stardom.
