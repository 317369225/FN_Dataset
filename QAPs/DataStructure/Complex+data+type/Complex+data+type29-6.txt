As a coder, why do you prefer C++ over C?
C++ is basically object oriented programming i.e. It deals with the situations of real world like if we need to have an implementation of airport system c++ has various modules defined in it which help us for proper implementation and if necessary update them without much effort. Where as c is procedure oriented programming which is not much convinent when we come across such situation. But if you are working on c++ it is necessary that you should have proper knowledge about c, its syntax, keywords and other criteria. So it is like c++ is an extended version of c with some extra ingredients. But ya now a days even c++ is also left behind most of the people are working on java because of its simplicity in implementation and its acceptance to object oriented programming.
