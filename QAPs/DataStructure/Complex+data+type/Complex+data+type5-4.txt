What are some cool things that are easy to do in Haskell but hard to do in other languages?I'm curious if I should learn Haskell for fun.
Embedding domain-specific languages (DSLs). The syntax is extremely flexible, and laziness means you can add your own control structures. Then you can actually leverage Haskell's type system for your DSL using generalized algebraic data types (GADTs). This allows you to very easily add your own type system to your custom embedded language while still taking advantage of the machinery Haskell has in place for it like type checking and type inference. While some other languages are decent at letting you customize syntax enough for DSLs, Haskell is one of the few (along with OCaml) that makes it very easy to add a custom type system to your DSL.
