What are the pros and cons of using Amazon Redshift?
Redshift has been working really well for us so far after we set up the ETL pipelines in production. pros: * High performance - Generally we see 50-100x speedup over Hive. * Low cost - The price is extremely low if we buy 3-year reservation. * Easy operation - It has been very reliable and self-managed. We spend less than 5 hours a week on the operation side. cons: * ETL is non-trivial - It took us quite a while to figure out how to import data from Hive, especially for big tables and data consistency issue. * Small feature set - Compared with Hive, it lacks complex data types, udf, etc.
