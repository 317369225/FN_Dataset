How much time did you spend preparing for Google's interviews?
If you haven't done so already, read Steve Yegge's article Get that job at Google.  Pay close attention to the section on the Interview Anti-Loop.  It will at least give you some consolation, in case you aren't hired. My general opinion is that the Google interview process is largely hit-and-miss, not unlike playing poker or some other game of chance.  You could prepare very well, but be unsuccessful (often), simply because of the far larger quantity of questions that can be asked vs. those a candidate is likely to be able to answer in an interview setting.  I'm sure most people who have a software engineering background could devise a sequence of questions that nearly all Google software engineers would not do well on. Unfortunately, there are few other alternatives to getting a full-time software engineering job at Google than the interview process.  Some people like Vint Cerf (arguably not a software engineer) just made a phone call and asked for a job, but one must be an industry luminary to do that. So one way of looking at this situation is if your time is better spent doing things that could make you an industry luminary, or participating in an interview process where it is not guaranteed that you will be hired.
