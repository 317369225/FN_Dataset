What pre-launch or early-stage web projects deserve more attention?Looking for suggestions that are still under the radar for the most part (ie haven't been covered in any major way.)
From our testing, I'm digging SimpleGeo. I think in general specialized third party services, especially those dealing with complex data set types are going to be super relevant in the future.
