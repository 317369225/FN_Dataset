What are some good ways to replace a Python module or function with a RESTful API call?
If you're set on REST then I don't know of anything to help you. You mostly have to replace the module calls with API calls. This gets harder if you use complex data types in the module. Adding to Jean-Baptiste Juin's answer, thrift and protobuf are the old (syncronous) way of doing this, which is simpler if you don't need a lot of concurrency. With something this eleme/thriftpy you can get clients and servers fairly easily, you'd then have to rewrite the method call to use the thrift client. In both cases you have less guarantees about the "function", so you'd have to add some exception handling.
