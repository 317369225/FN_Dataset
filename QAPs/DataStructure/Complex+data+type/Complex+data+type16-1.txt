What's are good ways to learn node.js, angularJS, Meteor, JavaScript and NoSQL?
Honestly the answer is "a little bit at a time," since that's a whole lot of ground to cover. I'll note too that "NoSQL" is just an umbrella term for a lot of different technologies that don't have much to do with each other, except that they all store data, but don't use the Structured Query Language that relational databases do. So "learning NoSQL" is probably not what you really mean. All that said, this book is a decent place to start: JavaScript: The Good Parts. It's also somewhat telling that the "good parts" of Javascript fill 176 pages, while the "definitive guide" to Javascript is 1096 pages. From this you might conclude that only about 16% of Javascript is good, and in my experience, that's still an optimistic number.
