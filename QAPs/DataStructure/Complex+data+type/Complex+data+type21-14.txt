Man's Search for Meaning by Victor E. Frankl "Live as if you were living already the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!" This book is structured into two parts. First, Frankl's aphoristic description of the life in a concentration camp as a prisoner through the eyes of a psychiatrist. Second, a discussion of his theory inspired by these experiences. This part is basically a summary of the core ideas of logotherapy, which postulates a will to meaning as an essential human motivation and stands in stark contrast to freudian reduction of what is human to mere irrational drives.
