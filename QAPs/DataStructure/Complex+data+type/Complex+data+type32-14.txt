How much time did you spend preparing for Google's interviews?
I spent less than a day.  I don't believe last minute cramming can make much difference.  The goal of the interview is highly differentiating people based on years of acquired knowledge and experience.  You can't do much in a short time to fool an interviewer; if you could, they aren't a very good interviewer. I used the day to review a few algorithms and refresh my memory on the more obscure Java APIs just in case they came up (they didn't). My interviews were very non-technical in nature, in fact one of the most non-technical interviews I've ever done in Silicon Valley. Of the 8 or 10 interviews, there was one interview focused on caching architectures, one on order of operations of a sort, and another on unit testing best practices.  The other interviews were conversational in nature. Some tech interviewers are more concerned with assessing personality traits and whether they can work with you, which may have been the focus of the non-tech interviews.
