What are the advantages of using C++ over C?
Basically unless your application has weird constraints -- which it probably doesn't -- C++ is always superior; that is, you probably aren't writing a driver and you probably aren't writing embedded code and you probably don't care about the size of your executable. C++ is better because it offers powerful styles of programming that C doesn't. C is always low-level. C is always pointers and malloc() and typecasts, etc., no matter what. C++ doesn't have to be particularly low-level if you don't want or need it to be. In C++ you can Use the standard library plus lambdas in the place of most C style loops. Never write the keyword "delete" through judicious use of std::shared_ptr, std::weak_ptr, and std::unique_ptr. Manage other resources via RAII and/or shared_ptrs with custom deleters and thus never have to manually grab and de-grab resources. Use runtime polymorphism where OOP is a natural fit for your application domain. Use compile time polymorphism (i.e. metaprogramming) in lieu of the sort of "cut-and-paste polymorphism" that large C projects invariably degenerate into.and do all of the above such that the compiled code is as fast or faster than it would be had it been written in C.
