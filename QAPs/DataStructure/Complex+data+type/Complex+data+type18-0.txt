How and where should I begin learning R programming?I'm an undergraduate student planning to submit a report on R.
Assuming that you've got no or little programming background, I'd recommend to get used to it by learning the following. 1. simple to complex data types - number, string, logical, vector, data.frame, matrix, list (optional) 2. reading/writing text (csv) files 3. (optional) conditioanl expression (mainly 'if') and looping construct (mainly 'for') 4. (optional) function (eg to create your own sqrt() function) 5. do you report It doesn't need to be exhaustive as your R can be improved a lot by doing. There must be enough R tutorials on the web including the following. Learn R with R tutorials and coding challenges | DataCamp Try R swirl: Learn R, in R. Finally below is a link of a cookbook for reference. Cookbook for R
