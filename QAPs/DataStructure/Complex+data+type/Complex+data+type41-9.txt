Originally Answered: What should I do to crack a software developer position interview at Google?1. Be good at Data structures and Algorithms ( Crack the coding interview/Algorithm Design Manual). You should be able to code them in any one programming language. When you pick any programming language for google interviews, make sure you in and out of it. 2. Go through Basic OS Concepts, Networking Concepts, Bits/Bytes,Memory Management. 3. Also go through some Design Questions (like implementing url shortener etc) 4. Also learn some Database concepts. 5.Practice writing code on Black Board and also google doc(if your phone interview is not yet done) 5. Practice makes you perfect or atleast close. So just keep solving problems from hackerrank/codechef/spoj etc 6. Finally "All the best" :)
