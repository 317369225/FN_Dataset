What are computer data types?
Data written in the memory of a computer is just so many bits and bytes. Data types are there to help make sense of that mess. Suppose, you have a record for all the students in the class. You'd probably store it like this: The smallest cells denote individual bytes. This is fine, except that in contiguous memory it is a linear array the labels and thecolored/bold outlines do not exist. So you have no idea how much of the data is the name, how much is the type, etc.Here's where the data types come in. Data types tell you two things: the size of the data unit the meaning of the data unitLet's elaborate on that: Here's the structure of the student record (in pseudocode): STRUCT STUDENT BEGIN         NAME    character[12]         GRADE  integer         AGE       integer         ID          integer END In our example, character, integer, and STRUCT STUDENT are the types. The size of a character is 1 byte, while an integer is 4 bytes long. This makes each STRUCT STUDENT 24 bytes long. How does this information help? Suppose you have a byte-addressable memory. Let's say, you know that the student data is contiguous in memory, and starts at 0x2C001000. By knowing its size using its type information, you can now calculate what is the binary data comprising each unit of data. For example, the age of student 1 is 4 bytes starting at 0x2C001010, or the name of student-2 is  12 bytes starting 0x2C001018. And how does that semantic information help? By assigning the type character (array) to name, we can expect to pass it to a function called DISPLAY(), whose purpose is to print the ASCII character for each byte of data. By making 'age' an integer, we allow ourselves to ask questions, such as, what is the average age of all the students, which is not a meaningful question for the label-name.
