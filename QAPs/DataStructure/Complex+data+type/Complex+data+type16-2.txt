What's are good ways to learn node.js, angularJS, Meteor, JavaScript and NoSQL?
Honestly, I've come to the conclusion over the last couple years that learning AngularJS without the support of a team is fairly pointless. Yes, you can use the framework as a single developer to increase your productivity - if you have a good grasp of JavaScript and experience with Angular; even so, Angular is an enterprise framework. It contains numerous features that really make sense only when you scale up to the enterprise level, and that requires a team of developers. Learning JavaScript is much more important than Angular as you are learning about these technologies. Also, Node.js has many advantages, but it's probably more useful to understand SQL and how it can be used on the server-side. One of the advantages of Node.js is that once you have NPM and Yeoman going, you can add new modules quickly if you are building a very bare bones back end.
