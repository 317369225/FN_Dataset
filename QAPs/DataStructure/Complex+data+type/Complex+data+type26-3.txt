Why is Java a dominant programming language in open-sourced distributed systems?Hadoop, Hive, zookeeper, etc...
While "compile once run anywhere" was a bit of dud on desktops, if you actually only want to use the CPU to do calculations and do not need to care about all kinds of other hardware and graphical user interfaces, Java is pretty much the bees knees. It has a built-in system to make long running computations faster (JIT). It runs on all the major fast computers systems (x86_64, PowerPC, Sparc). If the compute platform has a way to drop in java class files and run it with some particular data, you are pretty much set.
