Why is Java a dominant programming language in open-sourced distributed systems?Hadoop, Hive, zookeeper, etc...
In terms of the "distributed" part about that, I think the fact that Java allows you to produce a very scalable product is a huge factor in its success.Â  There's also not a heavy investment required for JVMs to support those systems, and if the system is designed to be platform agnostic it can be easily ported to other infrastructures.
