How much time did you spend preparing for Google's interviews?
How long does it take to learn how to play the violin? It's a function of talent, hard work, and hours per week and frequency per week.  You'll get there when you get there.  I spent one day, but I also spent 4 years in college and 1.5 years in high school, so it depends on how you count it.  I'd go with 5.5 years.
