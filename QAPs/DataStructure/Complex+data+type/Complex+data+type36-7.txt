Which is better, SQL or NoSQL?
In SQL based or relational database data is highly structured and stored in a tabular form.  No SQL is radically different from SQL database. Information is stored in loosely structured form like key value pair, in hierarchical structure like JSON string, as a collection of documents,  big data etc. No SQL database scales well.  All you need to do is to add more servers. It is easier to perform complex queries against an SQL database. When it comes to complex transaction oriented applications for example like ticket booking system, where a logical unit of work involves a series of updates and data manipulation, SQL database performs better and data integrity is assured.  For read only or simple quering applications, no SQL is well suited as there is less need for table joins. SQL technology is highly matutured as it has been around for long time. Disaster recovery mechanism in SQL database is excellent.  Again there is no right or wrong answer. Both technologies have their own advantages  and limitations.
