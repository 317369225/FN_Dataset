Why do stack variables contain garbage values? Is there any way we can assign our whole stack to NULL?Why do local, stack-based variables have garbage values by default?
Originally Answered: Why will automatic variables contain garbage if it is not set?The compiler makes space for auto variables on the stack, by making a suitable adjustment to the stack pointer. The memory itself is therefore not touched or initialised when entering the function, which is consistent with C's principle of doing as little unnecessary work as possible.
