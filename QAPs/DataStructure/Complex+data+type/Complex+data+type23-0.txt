Debugging: In totalview debugger, is there a way to viewÂ  data inside STL containers (vectors/maps etc) in a logical fashion, i.e., for maps logical fashion would be a tabular view showing keys against values?
TotalView provides transformation capabilities that produce improved STL data viewing. Documentation is available at http://www.roguewave.com/support... The user guide provides detailed information on its STLView transformation capabilities, at Page 281. In addition, a new feature has been added recently that provides a fully customizable mechanism to transform any complex data types into more logical formats. It is called C++ View, and is documented in the TotalView Reference Guide, Page 241.
