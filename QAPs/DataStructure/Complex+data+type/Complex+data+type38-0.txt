What advantages C++ offers as compared to C in competitive programming landscape?
From experience, I would say python is a better language to code for competitive programming when the problems aren't computation intensive. It just isn't fast enough for such problems. For the rest of the problems, it is the language that makes it very easy (& fast) to code your logic. Also, the debugging is relatively easier & faster. It can also work well (if you really know how to) with the difficult & complex problems. In short, Pros - Easier & faster to code in & debug. Cons - Python is slow when there are a lot of computations.
