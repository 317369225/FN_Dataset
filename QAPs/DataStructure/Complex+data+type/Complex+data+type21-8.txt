The Tao of Pooh and The Te of Piglet by Benjamin Hoff. Through the analogy of Winnie the Pooh tales, the author Benjamin Hoff explains the concepts of Tao in  a beautiful manner. It isn't a philosophical book at all. If I have to categorize it, I will put it under self-help. The author examines how peoples' behaviour reflect in the characters of Tigger, Piglet, Owl, Rabbit and Eeyore and finally presents Pooh as the example of Taoist living or to quote Wiki " Winnie-the-Pooh himself, for example, personifies the principles of wei wu wei, the Taoist concept of 'effortless doing,' "   Once again to quote Wikipedia: "The book starts with a description of the vinegar tasters, which is an actual painting portraying the three great eastern thinkers, Confucius, the Buddha, and Laozi over a vat of vinegar. Each tasting the vinegar of "life," Confucius finds it sour, the Buddha finds it bitter, but Laozi, the traditional founder of Taoism, finds it satisfying. Then the story unfolds backing up this analogy." The Te of Piglet was written about  10 years after the first book. This second book :(wikipedia)"The Te of Piglet is based around two topics, the concept of Te, the Chinese word meaning 'power' or 'virtue', and Piglet of the Winnie the Pooh books.[3] Hoff elucidates the Taoist concept of 'Virtue — of the small'; though, he also uses it as an opportunity to elaborate on his introduction to Taoism." Another 'mind-expanding' book is 'Many lives. Many masters' by Dr. Brian Weiss. Also may I add to this list 'One hundred poems of Kabir' ~ translated by Rabindranath Tagore with Evelyn Underwood. Saint Kabir was a mystic who lived in India in the 15th century. The poems are full of mysticism as well as earthly wisdom. Updated 15 Apr 2013 • View Upvotes
