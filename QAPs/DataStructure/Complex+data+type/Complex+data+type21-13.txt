What are some books that expand your mind?Please also add some details on the book and why you think it's mind-expanding.
The books below radically changed the way I think. They’re not necessarily the best, most influential, or most valuable - but these books altered deep-seeded beliefs I’ve had about important aspects of life. I list the three I’d consider to be most mind blowing first, and then a few others that have been almost equally mind blowing. I highly recommend all of them! 1.) The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich by Tim Ferriss (link) -Radically changed the way I think about work, money, lifestyle, entrepreneurship, definitions of success, and productivity, and proposed new opportunities I had not before considered. 2.) The Startup Owner’s Manual: The Step-By-Step Guide for Building a Great Company by Steve Blank and Bob Dorf (link) -Having been thinking about and practicing business and entrepreneurship since I was a kid, this book radically changed the way I think about business strategy and the entrepreneurial process. It puts a science behind an otherwise "dark art." 3.) Sex at Dawn: How We Mate, Why We Stray, and What It Means for Modern Relationships by Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha (link) -This book challenges conventional beliefs about sex and relationships in a major way. The authors pile on scientific evidence to support what some might have guessed from our 50% divorce rate: monogamy is far from natural. Not saying I agree, but it certainly made me think. Some others that have been quite mind-blowing: The Power of Now (mentality), Think and Grow Rich (mentality, motivation, work ethic, success), Ayn Rand philosophies (government, politics, mentality), Choose Yourself (entrepreneurship, mentality, lifestyle).
