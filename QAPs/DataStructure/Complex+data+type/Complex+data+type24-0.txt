Is there a really hot database start-up out there?......a company specifically dealing with data mashes?
When I think of DB start-ups, I think of companies building DB technology. The term "data mashes" makes me think of some sort of content mash up, which is focused on building and enriching content, not on building DB technology. That said, there are quite a few companies building NoSQL (think OLTP DB) technology. This list is not exhaustive and in no particular order: - DataStax : the Cassandra company - 10gen : the MongoDB company - Basho : the Riak company - Hibernating Rhinos : the RavenDB company - LinkedIn : the Espresso and Voldemort company There are also many challenges in the OLAP and Analytics space. These DBs solve a different class of workload. There are a few companies working on these sorts of problems. - Trifacts (Stealth - Joe Hellerstein's company) - Qubole (Hosted Analytics in the Cloud) - Metamarkets - the Druid (realtime OLAP) company Â  Hope this helps.
