What is the most powerful feature of C++ that other programming languages don't have?
One of my favorites that I haven't seen in many other languages templatized code with operator overloading.  (C# also supports templatized code and operator overloading, but C# comes at the cost of compiling to .NET bytecode, which may not be what you want). In templatized code, you write one function that is valid for any data type that has the operators defined. For instance, create an algorithm that adds all elements of a large container of objects and returns their sum. //pseudocode template<object> //insert necessary stuff to define function and set stuff up object sum = 0; for each object in container sum += object; return sum; This is pretty easy to do.  Now let's say you have a custom data type like a complex number, consisting of a pair of floats for the real part and the imaginary part.  Without use of templatized code, you'd have to write a brand new function for this complex number data type.* *Technically you can do something similar with a generic object type and inheritance/polymorphism, but it suffers from the very serious problem of type safety.
