Why is Java a dominant programming language in open-sourced distributed systems?Hadoop, Hive, zookeeper, etc...
I would say it's because there are actually very few alternatives. For large projects, statically typed languages, with explicit type declarations tend to work better than dynamically typed languages. So that rules out quite a lot of languages. Then you've got the fact that for most applications, reliability trumps speed, so you're probably going to want a managed language, not 'hit the metal'. Then you're probably going to want this system to run on a few different platforms, like Linux, Windows, Solaris, maybe even something exotic like IBM i or z/OS. Once you've made a list of languages that tick all those boxes, you've got a very, very short list. The list may even only have one language on it - Java.
