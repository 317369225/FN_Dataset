Why do stack variables contain garbage values? Is there any way we can assign our whole stack to NULL?Why do local, stack-based variables have garbage values by default?
To answer your second question, yes, theoretically there are ways to assign your whole stack to NULL; it is just slow and pointless. And you would need to do it every time you called any function (since the previous stack frame would need to be cleared out each time); again, slow and pointless. Far easier (and more readable) to just follow best practices and explicitly declare and initialize your variables at the top of your functions.
