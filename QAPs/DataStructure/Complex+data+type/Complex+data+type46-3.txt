What are some mind-blowing facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?
In 1979 a woman named Elvita Adams jumped from the 86th floor of the Empire State Building, only to be blown back onto the 85th floor. On December 2, 1979, Elvita Adams showed that sometimes, even normal, everyday people can be a little bit super. Elvita Adams, then age 29 and living in the Bronx, decided to take her own life. The reasons are unclear, but most likely, Adams was suffering from severe depression and in a fight with her landlord and about to be evicted. She went to the Empire State Building in midtown Manhattan to the observatory on the 86th floor. She scaled a seven foot fence (replete with steel spikes) and jumped. That, in and of itself, is nothing terribly peculiar. A few dozen people have jumped to their deaths off the Empire State Building, the first occurring before the building was even completed when a laid-off worker took his own life that way. In 1947, a 23 year-old jumped, leaving a crossed-out suicide note about how an unnamed man would be “much better off without [her]” and that she would not have made a very good wife. Her body was found on a limousine at the building’s base, and LIFE magazine ran a picture of her body, so situated, as seen here. And just a few years ago, a 54 year-old Manhattan woman took her life in similar fashion. But Adams, pictured above, did something none of the others can claim to have done. She survived.  A wind gust — a very strong one, certainly — caught hold of her and blew her back toward the building, albeit one floor down. She landed on a ledge on the 85th floor very much alive, where a security guard found her before she could make another attempt. The only damage to her body? A fractured hip. Adams was taken to a mental institution to recuperate, both mentally and physically. Her current whereabouts are publicly unknown. Source :http://nowiknow.com/saved-by-the...
