How much time did you spend preparing for Google's interviews?
This is an unpopular opinion, but I think preparing for interviews is super tacky. Time you spend looking up interview questions is time you could be spending on useful things, like learning to code better. Interviewers want to assess your coding ability, not your ability to solve interview questions.  If you solve their questions by knowing them in advance, that is basically cheating, and takes all the fun out of solving the interview questions.  You can tell them you've seen their questions before, but if you do that enough, you'll look like someone who prepares way too much for interviews. So to answer the question, none.  But I got rejected, so I guess I got what was coming to me. * Note: It's fine to prepare by doing things that help you outside of interviews, like reading through algorithms textbooks or taking a class.  I only think it's tacky to do things that don't teach you anything other than how to pass a test.  I feel the same way about SAT prep.
