What are the pros and cons of using Amazon Redshift?
For us, pros: - cheap (really cheap once you consider all the external costs of Hadoop type solutions, or even standard DWH, that you don't need like hardware or man hours of DBA); I could not find a scenario where we could do this cheaper, and one guy here played with a Raspberry Pi cluster...; - abstracts away DBA/IT non-value adding stuff; - really fast; - easy to use and well integrated with AWS; - very easy to get started in (20 minutes for us). Cons: - different flavour of PostgreSQL can be annoying; - no ETL (edit- our approach is now to just have no ETL - raw data goes in, views on top do the "processing" declaratively). As I've said here: Is Amazon Redshift ready for production use?, we are very happy with Redshift. Updated 31 Oct 2013
