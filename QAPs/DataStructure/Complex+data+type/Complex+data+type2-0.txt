What types of “complex data” are associated with medical codes?My understanding is that medical codes have a one-to-one relationship with diagnoses, so how complicated can it get? Disclaimer: I don't have a medical background but have been looking into jobs as a medical code statistician, a natural progression of my self-employment as a bespoke statistician. Thank you for your perspectives.
Medical codes reduce a lot of information (describing for instance a patient's diabetes, their complications and disease sequelae) into a very compact form (250.xx Diabetes Mellitus). As Steven Ford's answer describes, this is particularly handy for billing and standardizing administration. Where the challenge comes is when you want some of the information that is thrown away in the (All Patient Metadata) ==> (Small list of codes) conversion.  Would this patient be a good candidate for a clinical trial? Well codes can narrow the list, but you would also require clinical data to refine the picture further. Would this patient respond to our new outpatient diabetic treatment clinic? That requires information outside of the EMR and the billing system to answer correctly. What is nice is that for the past 20 years, healthcare providers and payers increasingly have valued the data outside of the coded information in managing patient care. If you are looking for a rapidly growing area, this is a good one.
