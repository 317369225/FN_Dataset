How can we represent a logical data model for HBase and Hive?
HBase is schemaless, so it's kind of difficult to draw a schema diagram for it.  Every row is an unbounded list of arbitrary key-value pairs.  Qualifier names can vary from row to row.   It is inherently denormalized, and if you did attempt to normalize it the performance would be crap. If you did draw an ER diagram, it would be the same one for every Hbase table: a parent table with the row key, and a fk to a child table for each column family - each of which has 3 fields:  (key, qualifier, value).   Not very useful.   You could potentially model SOME logical HBase databases with an ER diagram, but it wouldn't necessarily translate to a physical schema in an obvious manner. The general consensus I've seen is to use a JSON-ish notation with shell-style variables to describe the data structure of a column family.
