How much time did you spend preparing for Google's interviews?
I intended to study a variety of topics. But I started by studying red black trees and thought it would be interesting to implement one. So I ended up spending all my time (maybe 8 hrs) on that instead. Of course none of the interview questions had anything to do with red black trees...
