Why do structs exist in C?I'm a bit new to C and coding in general but I vaguely recall a lecture I sat in on that has to do with memory stored efficiently contiguously. Stuff I googled suggests this but mostly defines how to deal with a C struct. I think a bit of intuition would help me understand/use C structs much better.
struct is the keyword used to define a structure. It is a complex data type which is user defined. As you might be aware that C has a lot of data types such as int, float, char, double, etc. A structure is a complex data type as it has different types of data types defined inside it; for e.g. : struct house {     int houseno;     float average_house_salary;     char *address; }; Now the above is a data type definition. To initialize of variable of type struct you simply write : house x; This variable x has three different types of data types and as such is called as a complex data type. x has details of a house such as house no, house address and average house salary. So all the data related to one house will be stored together. In these kinds of scenarios we use struct. You can also define a array of that variable as house x[10] and store details of 10 houses. This is the only option to save all this data contiguously at run time. Hope you understood.
