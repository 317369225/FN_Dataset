How much time did you spend preparing for Google's interviews?
You need to be familiar with the basics of data structures and algorithm design. I interviewed at Google and Microsoft in the past and I never felt their interviews are rocket science. You just need to have some academic background and you will be just fine. They almost all ask a simple programming question then if you get it right they ask you to make it better. You should be familiar with computational complexity and running time and they are in deep love of Hash tables. I was never asked about complex topics like dynamic programing or NP completeness. I am personally very interested in algorithm interview questions and if you are interested you can find several sample problems and solutions that I compiled over time on my personal blog http://www.8bitavenue.com
