What tips and advice would you provide an individual who is looking to learn the programming language R?
I'm not going to say this in particular for R, but in general for all languages: If you want to learn a new language... use it. First get the basics, how to create variables, loops, if/else statements and anything else you can. Then, put it to good use and make something out of it. Even if it's a "hello world" program. What would be better, would be to make something you can actually use and find useful. Just to piggy back on the previous idea, there is really 3 steps to master something new: Learn it. Study it through tutorials, videos, whatever... Review it, ask yourself, how to do this and check up on your answer. Apply it. In the case above, build something with it. I think the issue with many people is that they don't do enough or anything at all with step 3.
