How can we represent a logical data model for HBase and Hive?
I am working through this right now. I will be able to answer this better in about 6 months but here is what I am thinking. Hbase/Hive to me is a file system that has been extended to support a lot of services to do a wide variety of things.  I would think about coupling how you are presenting the data to how it is consumed. If you consume it like an OTLP, than represent it in a way your community understands OLTP data.  Though it will be important to remind people about RI and such... If you are using it as a super fast tapeless archive strategy represent it just like you would when talking about back up tapes.  if you are using it as just a file system then there are images for that in a visio also.
