What makes C++ so good?
Freedom ======= Freedom is the core objective in C++ language design. 1. It has all features, but it never forces anything to programmers. You can choose to do all sorts of programming like assembly, structured, OOPS, functional, meta, confused, etc... 2. You can bypass everything. If you don't want OOPS, you can use the C subset.     If you want to bypass STL and use Boost C++ Libraries you can do so. If you want to bypass C++ runtime you can do so. C++ treats you like an adult. C++ gives you great power. And with great power, comes great responsibility. Updated 6 May 2013 • View Upvotes
