The Secret Life of Pronouns by James W. Pennebaker This book is especially interesting if you are fascinated by the use of language and how the little words can tell so much about our personalities, leadership style, gender differences, and state of mind and much more. I think someone should do a case study of Quora personalities! That would be interesting! According to Pennebaker: At the heart of this book is the idea that our words leave indelible fingerprints of personality, our relationships and backgrounds, and even our plans for the future. Once you see the power of pronouns, articles, and other function words, you will better understand: How Tweets and Facebook posts can tell us about the personality of their authors. Why lying to others and to ourselves causes us to talk differently. How it’s possible to predict if two people will fall in love by counting the function words the two people use in their first conversation with one another. When we can predict a person’s age, sex, where they live, and what their background is by analyzing their conversations or emails. Why self-confident leaders rarely use the word “I” and insecure and depressed people do. How writing about an emotional upheaval using particular linguistic styles can help you get past it. Why analyzing your own emails, letters, and natural conversations can tell you about yourself and the relationships you cherish most.
