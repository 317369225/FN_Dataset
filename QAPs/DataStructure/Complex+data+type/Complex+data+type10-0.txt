Apache Hive: Why has Hortonworks not used Facebook ORCFile for Stinger?Hortonworks recently completed the Stinger initiative. [1] They however do not seem to be using the Facebook ORCFile format, which is claimed to perform much better.

Because the Facebook ORC file writer is still more or less an experiment (by most company's standards).  It is based on the ORC file available in Apache but still hasn't been merged into the Apache code yet.  I'm also guessing that Stinger had a fixed set of features to implement that didn't include using Facebook's ORC file format (and by including it would have introduced scope creep). One of the other primary use cases for the Facebook ORC format was to improve the compression of complex data types like JSON, MAP and ARRAY fields by using different compression algorithms based on data type.  From my personal experience, these data types are far more common at Facebook than I have seen at my other clients. One last bit from the Facebook blog post: We have made our storage format available at GitHub and are working with the open source community to incorporate these improvements back into the Apache Hive project. We'll likely see these improvements available in all Hadoop distros in the near future.
