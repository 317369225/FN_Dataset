What are computer data types?
Data types, data formats, data protocols, etcetera… At the simplest, computer data types may refer to VarChar, Integer, DateTime and the like. Such data types help computers and database management systems to organize and operate upon data sets in an appropriate fashion. Organizing analog or digital data per formats and protocols is more complex. Data packets and headers, metadata, data definition libraries and literally thousands of “standards” - often competing - exist to transmit, govern and manage data sets. Nascent and emerging technologies, such as machine-to-machine communications, sensor analytics and Internet of Things data often lead to conflicting approaches to control data. Take a look at MQTT vs COAP or SensorML vs GRID2 for examples. For an older analogy, look at VHS vs Betamax ;-)
