Why is use of pointers neccesary in C for swapping of two numbers through a function call?
Let see if I can explain you with what exactly happens when you call a function 1. A copy of variables is made in a place called stack 2. a return value area is created 3. program counter is moved to the function start [ At this point function does not have access to original variables and it modifies values in the stack directly] 4. Once execution is complete, it put the return value in the stack and return program counter to the location mentioned in the stack and the stack is destroyed. As you can see the function called does not modify the variables passed to it, simply because it does not have have access to them in C. It just have values. Pointer are the way to get around this problem in the most elegent way.
