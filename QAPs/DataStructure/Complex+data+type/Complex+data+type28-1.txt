What is the most powerful feature of C++ that other programming languages don't have?
The ability to embed assembly code in a way that makes sense - just make sure you're using the right calling conventions and you're done. This is very important if you need to use specialized processor instructions, like hardware-accelerated AES encryption rounds, for example. I'm not aware of any other medium- or high-level language where this is possible (without, of course, using some form of FFI, which is much more complicated than just slapping a piece of assembly in a function). EDIT: As Steve Schafer said, Turbo Pascal and Delphi can embed assembly, too. Updated 29 Mar â€¢ View Upvotes
