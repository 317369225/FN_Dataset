What types of “complex data” are associated with medical codes?My understanding is that medical codes have a one-to-one relationship with diagnoses, so how complicated can it get? Disclaimer: I don't have a medical background but have been looking into jobs as a medical code statistician, a natural progression of my self-employment as a bespoke statistician. Thank you for your perspectives.
