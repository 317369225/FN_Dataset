How can we represent a logical data model for HBase and Hive?
For Hive, this is really isn't much different than any other database.  If your question is around what type of modeling results in the best performance for Hive, that is more complicated.  This is mostly true so long as you're not exclusively or heavily leveraging complex data types like ARRAY and MAP. For hBase, Joe Pepersack is correct.  But I would also add that one of the whole points of "NoSQL" databases is the notion of having a "Schema On Read" approach.  That is, there is no Schema until you want to read the data. Which means trying to model a schema as if you were to consistently write to it in the same way doesn't make sense.  Or if you are, you're probably using the wrong tool.
