What are the pros and cons of using Amazon Redshift?
Not an exhaustive list, but a few points to get this going. Pros: SQL based interface so you can keep using your existing tools and knowledge, no need to learn new tech (like, for example, hive/pig/hadoop). Easily scalable - as with other AWS tools, you can always grow with your needs. Need another 10 nodes in your cluster? Just a couple of clicks and you're done. Cons: Potentially more expensive than your existing infrastructure. If you already own a bunch of servers where you have some spare cycles / storage space, you can implement your own solution using open source tools that might end up being cheaper. Data is on AWS. Your data is out there on the "cloud" (S3 to be exact). Even though there are solutions to make that sort of set up absolutely safe, If you're concerned with privacy and/or have extremely sensitive data - you may be uneasy with the situation.
