Which is better, SQL or NoSQL?
I'm afraid this is a question without a precise answer. Both NoSQL databases and SQL databases have their strengths and weaknesses. The answer depends on your use case. On top of that, a question that asks "what is better" in the technology world will get you answers that are based on prejudice, unfounded opinion, and "religious" beliefs. :-) . You might find some further guidance in a book like @Amazon.com: NoSQL Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Emerging World of Polyglot Persistence eBook: Pramod J. Sadalage, Martin Fowler: Kindle Store or @Amazon.com: Seven Databases in Seven Weeks: A Guide to Modern Databases and the NoSQL Movement eBook: Eric Redmond, Jim R. Wilson: Kindle Store. Both of these books go into the strenghts of different types of databases. "Seven Databases in Seven Weeks" compares a "SQL" database (PostgreSQL) with NoSQL databases.
