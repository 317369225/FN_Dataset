Is there a really hot database start-up out there?......a company specifically dealing with data mashes?
By "data mashes" I am assuming you mean what is called "data fusion" in the database world. That is, the continuous and seamless integration of unrelated data models into a single data model that can be analyzed in-place as it is aggregated. The only database company that specializes in this of which I am aware, startup or otherwise, is SpaceCurve. Which is a company I founded around technology designed for precisely that type of workload based on some research in petabyte-scale real-time sensor fusion I did a number of years ago. It is a very different kind of database platform than any in the NoSQL or traditional relational markets. SpaceCurve's parallel database engine is highly optimized for organizing completely unrelated data sources around relationships in space and time in real-time at petabyte scales. It does not just handle simple data sources like the Twitter stream but also sources like doppler radar, satellite imaging, mobile networks etc at petabyte scales and at continuous ingest rates of millions of updates per second to disk storage, even complex data types like geospatial polygons from sensing systems. This allows for incredibly immersive, contextual analysis of real-time environments. The traditional limits on this type of data fusion have been a lack of data structures and algorithms that could deal with high-dimensionality data and sensing polygons at the rates required. SpaceCurve has some very unique computer science behind it that has allowed it to handle these types of fused data models from inception. My bias aside, you would be hard-pressed to find a database company that claims capabilities we routinely demonstrate.
