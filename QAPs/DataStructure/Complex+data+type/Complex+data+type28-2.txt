What is the most powerful feature of C++ that other programming languages don't have?
There are no specific features which are completely unique to C++. (The key properties being, native code compilation, object oriented features, partial forms of extensibility etc.) There are other languages which now do the same. But what it does have is a significant momentum in the world. It has a cultural significance within the engineering community which is currently unmatched. This means a lot of investment by compiler writers. A lot of knowledge by engineers and so on. And that places the language in a unique place.
