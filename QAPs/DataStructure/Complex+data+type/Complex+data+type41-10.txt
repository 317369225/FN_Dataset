Well ,these people have explained you really well here what to do and what not too , and since you have asked a question like this then I can just assure you one thing with certainty that you cannot join Google ever , sounds rude ! But yea thats the fact and  you've to adjust to ,and dont worry it wont be hard or long befor you'll be adjusted to to it although <I mentioned this only so that you dont post a new question like " How can I make myself understand that I can never be a Engineer in Google ">  . Also now if you really wannan change these future facts about your life ,then just start using your brain's thats all . After all what these people want from a person is  1.Aptitude ,Creativity and a will , and   2. Simple thinking on complex conditions . < KISS principle"Keep it simple silly" ).  Anybody can learn anything ,anybody can make anything but its just the ONE who learn and create it FIRST is the ONE who's goes on position FIRST Updated 26 Sep 2014 • View Upvotes
