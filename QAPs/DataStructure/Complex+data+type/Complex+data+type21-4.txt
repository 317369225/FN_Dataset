What are some books that expand your mind?Please also add some details on the book and why you think it's mind-expanding.
Mind Expanding: The User Illusion: http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com..., by Tor Norretranders. Read it twice. You will never see the world the same.  Very well written and researched.  None of the data or concepts are in the public dialog and after reading this book you will ask why. I shall offer just one point:  the Conscious mind is fed "reality" by the sub Conscious.  The sub Conscious edits 98% of the input it receives from your senses and present a Believable concept of the world.  It also reacts to all inputs and responds in most cases before you have even made your conscious choice.  This all happens in a proven 1/2 second delay between the reaction of your conscious mind to any input.  This is a very long period in time in reality when it comes to making choices as these delays set a cascade of events that if really understood are making you more into an observer of "you" then a controller of your reactions. The shocker comes when it is demonstrated that your sub Conscious recreates "time" in your mind so as to allow you to "Believe" your conscious was in control the entire time. I am not doing proper justice to this, just one of the concepts this book covers. Nor can I cite  the 100s of repeatable science behind the concepts. Here is a video that explores some of the concepts: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D... Update: Many have asked if there are any other companion books to The User Illusion.  I would recommend the The Holographic Universe by Michael Talbot.  This book catalogs the work of University of London physicist David Bohm, a protégé of Einstein and quantum physicist, and Stanford University neurophysiologist Karl Pribram.
