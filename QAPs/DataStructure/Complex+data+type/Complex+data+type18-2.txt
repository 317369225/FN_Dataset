How and where should I begin learning R programming?I'm an undergraduate student planning to submit a report on R.
R is an awesome software to learn and there are stacks of helpful answers to the many problems you run into along the way. The online community truly is awesome in this respect. Get onto google and choose your resource (some are mentioned already by posters). I started with R from scratch and it's been a very rewarding learning process. Once you familiarize yourself with the basics, I would recommend working through reproducible examples...many of which can easily be found online. To be direct: try Ruey Tsay's "Financial Time Series" book. Also, Bernhard Pfaff's "Financial Risk Modeling and Portfolio Optimization in R". Once you're up and running, you can probably find a ton of resources on what you specialize in. One last thing: I recommend using the RStudio overlay to R.
