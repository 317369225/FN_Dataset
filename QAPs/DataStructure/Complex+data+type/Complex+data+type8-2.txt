What skills do self-taught programmers commonly lack?Or, to put it another way: what should a self-taught programmer study to get up to speed with his/her formally-educated peers?
I think the most important thing I learned in school that I might not have learned otherwise was functional programming.Â  There are a lot of useful properties you can get from having no side effects in your code, and in general, I think it's easier to write code with fewer errors if you try to program in a way that minimizes side effects except where necessary. F.P. isn't terribly complicated and most of the best self-taught programmers are aware of it, but since it's pretty rare to use something like Haskell or ML in practice for anything, I think it's pretty common for self-taught programmers to not have the same understanding of it that you get from having to write a bunch of big programs in that style.
