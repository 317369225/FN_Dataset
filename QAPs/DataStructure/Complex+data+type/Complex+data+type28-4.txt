What is the most powerful feature of C++ that other programming languages don't have?
C++ is just a means to generate machine code instructions in order to make a computer do something you want it to do.  It's not like there are magical powers granted to you by one programming language over another.  If there is something  you want your computer to do, either a programming language can, or it cannot, enable you to get your computer to do that. Thus. we can only talk about the power of languages in terms of how easy it is to get certain functions to occur, or how difficult it would be. There are some functions that the good ol' Windows batch language makes super easy.  For those things, it's "powerful".  There are other functions that would simply be impossible using only the Windows batch language.  For those things, other languages are "powerful". C++ is one programming language that doesn't have any real limitations -- that is, there isn't any operation that a computer can perform that can't be expressed in C++.  So in that sense C++ has a degree of "power" in any programming situation -- it's like the proverbial "renaissance man" who has a broad base of knowledge and can be useful in any situation.  Something like the Windows batch language is like a good mechanic who knows a lot about cars.  He always does quality work on your car and gets it done quickly.  You could bring your car to someone like Albert Einstein or Thomas Jefferson, and given time and a well-stocked laboratory they could probably make the thing sing after a period of careful study and research. But that's not always what you need.
