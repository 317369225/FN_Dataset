What's are good ways to learn node.js, angularJS, Meteor, JavaScript and NoSQL?
Learn the language first and learn it well (ericelliott/essential-javascript-links.md). As you know this industry moves extremely quickly. Forget learning a Framework before you have a solid understanding in the Language. If you have a solid foundation and understand the core concepts of Javascript, you can pick up a Framework in a matter of hours. So my advice to you would be: learn functional Javascript and you will be able to walk into most jobs and blow them away. You will be able to write elegant code while being able to pick up a new Framework or technology very quickly. Don't fall into the trap of mastering a new Framework or new technology only to find it becoming obsolete.
