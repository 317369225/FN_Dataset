What is "must have" knowledge or skill set about Java for a recent CS graduate applying for an entry-level Java Position?
Threading, JDBC, HTTP (both servlets and also non-servlet systems like Jetty), and the streams library are, I would say, the staples of enterprise Java development.  Android dev would be another good place to explore.  Since you're a CS grad I assume you have generic knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and design patterns but you should see how Java does those things. You should also understand source control (git, svn) plus build systems (ant, gradle, sbt) and understand some theory and practice around unit testing and talk intelligently about them (e.g. test driven development). Finally, read up on more general development practices like Agile, Scrum, Lean, Kanban, and all that (these are language neutral and will be commonly found in practice).
