Learning to Program: What are are the push and pop operations in C? When do I need them?
Push and pop are for arrays, and is available in almost all programming languages.  If you have a stack of papers to work through, and someone adds one to the pile, they just pushed onto the top of the stack.  When you take one off to work on one, you just popped one off the top of the stack. So it's something you do when you have a lot of similar things to work through. I'm just curious why you're learning starting with C, it's a very outdated language.  You should be learning with something like Javascript, and then C#.
