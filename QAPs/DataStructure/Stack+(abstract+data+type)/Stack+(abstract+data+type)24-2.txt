Can one study computer/software engineering by him/herself?
As Varun and Harish have said - Yes certainly. At the University closest to me here in Queensland Australia some 1, 500 students are currently studying Engineering externally.   Computer Engineering is probably the easiest engineering discipline to study by yourself because the external study tools coincide with what you are actually studying. However, do take every opportunity to link up with others doing the same course in your locality and go to events organised by the University.   One caution, especially if you have been out of school for a time, be prepared for the difficulty of the first year math. Some revision here will be helpful to you.
