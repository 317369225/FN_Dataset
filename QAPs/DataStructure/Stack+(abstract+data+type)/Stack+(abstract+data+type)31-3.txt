I have one year left to complete my CS graduation. How should I prepare for Google?
Twenty years ago when I graduated there was no Google, no Amazon.  Yes there was IBM and Microsoft, but on a different continent. Even with none of these 'leaders' around I found that my career took the path of taking the available open doors, these were not bad doors, but looking back now I realize that I was not making decisions based on a long-term plan. Although I wouldn't mind working at Google (or maybe when I was younger), I have to wonder if most people fresh out of school who have this overpowering need to go to Google (and others) are not just making the same mistake I made.  Do you really have a passion for working at Google due to the work you will be doing and the specific interest in the field where you will be gaining skills or experience? Or do you just want it because it is what smart people are expected to do, the definition of being one of the best programmers, or just fashionable?  The sooner in life you get down to the real why you want things, the better.
