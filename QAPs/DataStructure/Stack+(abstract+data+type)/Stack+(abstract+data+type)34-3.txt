Why do stack variables contain garbage values? Is there any way we can assign our whole stack to NULL?
Always zeroing stack would significantly decrease performance. As it is done, allocating stack variables is very fast because it only requires changing the stack pointer. If you need a variable zeroed, do it explicitly.
