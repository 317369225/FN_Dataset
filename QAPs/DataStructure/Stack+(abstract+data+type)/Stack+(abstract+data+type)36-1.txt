In C language why is a pointer used when one can assign the variable itself?
When you want someone to come to your house you don't give them your whole house , you give them your address so you can find where it is. Pointers are addresses and especially where the structures involved are large it makes more sense to REFER to the already existing structures than making a copy of it particularly in a language like C which focuses on optimizing. Doing so often saves a lot of memory and also saves the time involved in creating a copy thus helping out both time and space complexities.
