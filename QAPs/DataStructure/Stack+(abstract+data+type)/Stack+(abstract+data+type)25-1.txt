Why does Java consider a stack to be a type of queue?
I'll try to simplify the other answers. In normal usage in computer science, a stack is a LIFO container, and a queue is a FIFO container. However, the word queue is sometimes used for a more general concept. For example, in a priority queue the entries come out in the order of their priority, not in order of their time of insertion. Yet this is also called a queue. So usually queue means FIFO, but sometimes queue means a more general container where stuff comes out in some particular order, but where that order has to be defined separately. If you use the word "queue" that way (don't do that - you'll only confuse people!), then normal stacks and queues are both examples of this kind of generalised queue. That is the way the word seems to be used in the java documentation.
