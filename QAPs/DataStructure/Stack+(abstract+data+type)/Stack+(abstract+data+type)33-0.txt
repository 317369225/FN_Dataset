How many stacks are required to implement a queue?
A2A. That is a bit like asking "how many boats are required to build a car?" Just like a boat and car are two fundamentally different vehicles for different purposes, a stack and queue are two fundamentally different data structures for different purposes. A queue is a FIFO (First In First Out) structure; that is, elements which enter a queue exit it in the same order. A line of customers at the cash register is a real-world queue. A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) structure; elements which enter a stack first exit it first. They are useful for keeping track of most recently used items, and are efficient when you don't particularly care about ordering, such as resource pools. If you have a pile of books, it is likely a stack because the book most recently read is on top :)
