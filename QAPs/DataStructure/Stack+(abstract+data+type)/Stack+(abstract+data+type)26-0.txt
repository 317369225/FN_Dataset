What is a list of the most commonly used abstract data types and their corresponding implementations?
Let me share the sequence in which I start teaching ADTs to my students. Array ADT using in-built arrays in language (I use C) Array ADT implemented using pointers Multidimensional Array ADT implemented using one-dimensional array Stacks ADT implemented using Arrays Linked List ADT using Pointers Linked List ADT using Arrays I do not know whether these are the most common but I find that this is a good sequence for beginners to learn the difference between an ADT and its implementation. My apologies if I did not answer your exact question!
