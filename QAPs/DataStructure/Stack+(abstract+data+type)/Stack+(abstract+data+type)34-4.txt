Why do stack variables contain garbage values? Is there any way we can assign our whole stack to NULL?
Where does garbage come from? A random collection of once good and beautiful items is transformed into garbage. Right? Assuming you allocate 3 32bit numbers, without initializing, and you get random values 47 61 72 62     61 67 65 20     44 61 74 61. What doesÂ  Look like? Garbage Data? Now, if you allocate an array of 12 characters. What would you get? 0x47, 0x61, 0x72, 0x62, 0x61, 0x67, 0x65, 0x20, 0x44, 0x61, 0x74, 0x61 The above is ASCII equivalent of 'G', 'a', 'r', 'b', 'a', 'g', 'e', ' ', 'D', 'a', 't', 'a' This does not look garbage, but looks more structured. So, if previous execution cycle, stored characters there, and we read characters, things does not look odd, but when type is changed, the representation of date changes. And the new values look garbage like. This is a practical scenario. Normal execution will have very complex data types that would randomly overlap in memory and thus result into Garbage.
