What are abstract data types?
You can think of it as a set of objects that is defined by their behavior and properties in most general terms, rather than by specifying their implementation in detail. Each object is a concrete implementation of the ADT that can be run on a certain machine. This allows you to reason about all implementations efficiently and to prove properties like termination, correctness and asymptotic runtime-behavior.
