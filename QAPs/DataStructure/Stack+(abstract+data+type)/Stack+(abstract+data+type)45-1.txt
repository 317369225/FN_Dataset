What is the CSE syllabus at the IITs/NITs for the first semester? Which languages must one know before joining?
Here is the curriculum for CSE @ IITB The common CSE course (CS101) is taught in the first semester It includes the following: basics of C++ which include variable, constants, data types, etc operators and expressions and pointers in C++ Object oriented programming: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism (basics), etc a few common data structures (stack, queue, linked list) and algorithms Linux commandsC++ is the primary language we are taught (though we learn many more in the third semester in the software systems lab course) The second semester has a course on abstractions and paradigms in programming (CS152 + lab) in which we are taught the following: Details of abstraction and encapsulation Stress on object oriented design Functional programmingThe 2 courses overall do not teach much. CS101 is for those who haven't seen a computer before. CS152 is to teach students to think in an object oriented way We aren't taught much of CS in the first year. I believe the reason for this is that several students change their branch to CS. Also, IITs believe that a computer science student is firstly an engineer and only then a computer engineer and so, in the first year we are mainly taught the common engineering skills (mechanical workshop, engineering drawing, labs of physics and chemistry, etc) However, second year onward, we have a rigorous CS based curriculum Sem 3: CS213 (and a tough lab): Data structures and algorithms CS207: Discrete mathematics CS251: Software systems lab CS215: Data analysis and interpretation EE101: Introduction to electrical and electronic circuitsSem 4: CS224: Computer networks (and a lab) CS226: Digital Logic Design (and a lab) CS228: Logic in CS CS218: Design and analysis of algorithmsFor those who want to gain more knowledge, IITB offers a pool of honor courses to take. My friends took courses on machine learning, computer graphics, network securities, etc in their fourth semester. That was pretty much I have done so far (I am in third year now).
