Learning to Program:Â What are are the push and pop operations in C? When do I need them?
Push and Pop operations are generally used in a Stack ADT. Push is used to insert elements in to the stack whereas Pop operation is used to delete an element or remove an element from the top of the stack. Now let us create a structure using keyword struct struct stack{    int data[MAX];    int top;}s; Here MAX is the limit you set for the number of elements you can enter into a stack. And you have declared a variable named s of type struct stack. The push( ) function is as follows : void push(int data){  if(s.top == MAX)  {     printf("The stack is full");     return ;  }  s.top++;  s.data[s.top] = data;} The above code inserts the data of integer type into the stack. The pop( ) function is as follows : int pop(){     if(s.top == -1)    {       printf("The stack is empty.");       return ;    }       int data = s.data[s.data];    s.top --;    return data;} In the above function we have popped out the top element and return the data which we have deleted. Hope this answer has helped you understand push and pop functions in C.
