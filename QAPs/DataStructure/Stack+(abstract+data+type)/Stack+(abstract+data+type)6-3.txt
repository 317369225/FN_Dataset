What are various methods of implementing a stack using linkedlist(s) and what method is the best?
As stack is an ADT which is first-in, last-out, so it can be easily implemented using a single linkedlists. It requires two functions, Push() for putting data on the stack like the stack of plates, and a Pop() function for removing the data one by one. Just make a structure: struct node{     int data;     node *next; } Using this make a node of the stack, and put NULL in the first node's "next". A pointer should be pointing at the end of the node. Whenever you call Push(), make a new node, point that pointer to the new node and assign value to the variable "data". Whenever you call Pop(), delete the last node and make the pointer to point previous node.
