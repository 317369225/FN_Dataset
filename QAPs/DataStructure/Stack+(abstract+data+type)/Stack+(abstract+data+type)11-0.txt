Why doesn't std::queue have a clear function like std::vector does?
Only someone on the standards committee can explain the true reasoning behind the decision not to include such a function, but I'll hazard a guess: because it's not part of the definition of a queue. It's basically universally agreed that a queue is an abstract data type that supports pushing items one at a time and popping items one at a time, such that items are popped off in FIFO order. A stack is the same sort of thing, but with LIFO order. The definition doesn't include an operation to remove all the items at once, so there isn't such an operation in the STL. Note that, by default, a queue is a wrapper over a deque, so basically it's a deque with severe restrictions on which operations are allowed. Notice that a deque does have a clear() function. So for any application where you think you want to use a stack or queue, but need a clear() function, or iterators, or random access, or whatever, you can just use a deque instead.
