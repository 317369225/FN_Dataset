What are abstract data types?
What is an ADT or an Abstract Data Type? It is an abstract definition or contract the API has to obey and promise the user to deliver what it says. There are two things in an API which can be considered pretty much independent of each other. The contract and the implementation, we mostly try to write a contract before providing an implementation. This is good for two reasons, first – we define the goal and hence seal the requirement (with a minor scope for changes) before even starting the implementation, second – we make our intentions clear to the user of the API and give them a hint of what they can expect. The ADT should be such that it can handle all sort of variations in the data structure, for e.g. if I define an ADT for Tree, then it must be capable of handling Binary Tree, N-ary Tree, Red-Black Tree, AVL Tree, Heap etc. For more please visit the blog post Hierarchical Data Structure – Tree ADT - Techie Me
