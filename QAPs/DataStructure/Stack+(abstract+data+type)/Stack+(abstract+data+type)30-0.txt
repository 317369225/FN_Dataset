What is the meaning of the word "abstract"?
abstract (adj.) simply means 'existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence' By extension, this means 'not tied to/ explicitly separated from/ hiding/ any particular object/ implementation/ representation'. The topics you asked about should have topic definitions (they don't, people should add them), but anyway most of them can already be found on Quora Q&A: WP: Abstract algebra What is abstract painting? What is the exact difference between abstraction, encapsulation and information hiding in OOP (object oriented programming)? What is abstract data type in the context of OOP? What's an example? What are some code examples of these OOP features: Polymorphism, Abstraction and Encapsulation in PHP? For the programming ones, an abstraction of a stack (data type) would define an object which can perform operations like push(), pop(), perhaps peek() or depth() or swap() or empty(), but hiding the details: not defining their concrete implementation (or even perhaps which language we use), the functions involved, which data types they can/can't use, exceptions they raise, memory management etc etc. But hiding details. Example: an abstract stack would almost always define that "pop'ping from an empty stack isn't allowed(/meaningful)", but wouldn't specifically say how that is handled: whether it raises an exception, boolean False, returns a None or empty value, null pointer, or even risks returning undefined data or coredumping (no error handling, i.e. user must guarantee/enforce that depth()>0 before calling pop() ). Also you might like to subscribe to Topic Gnomery board, and reask this there: "Abstract... topics need definitions". PS: whereas abstract (noun) means 'a summary of the contents of a book, (academic) article, or formal speech'. Presumably not what you meant.
