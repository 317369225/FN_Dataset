Why do we have to wrap a monad transformer stack in newtype?
You don't! Well, rather, it's perfectly possible to use them without a newtype. So, instead we should investigate what one gains by using a newtype. You can hide certain layers You get much shorter types You can provide a semantic boundary—is this just any Reader/Writer stack or is it the one that takes some meaning to my program? You can more easily maintain certain invariants which involve interactions between the layers of your stack—just hide the newtype constructor You can leave yourself the option of expanding (or shrinking) the stack at a later time with less breakageEssentially all of these come down in some way or another to advantages enjoyed via the use of abstract data types, and, indeed, that's one of the major uses of newtypes in general.
