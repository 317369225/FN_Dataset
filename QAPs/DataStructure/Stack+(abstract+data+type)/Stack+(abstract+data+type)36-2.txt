In C language why is a pointer used when one can assign the variable itself?
One more addtion to Subhash' answer. If you want to pass a large structure to a function then it is good that you paas address of this structure not the structure itselfÂ  because passing a large structure is like copy one structure to another structure . And this copy operation is very costly.
