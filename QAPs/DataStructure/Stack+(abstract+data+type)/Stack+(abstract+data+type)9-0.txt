What is the differences between abstract data type and user defined data type?
A2A Data types Data types are classification of data in any programming language - for example integers, characters, floats etc. Nothing really to explain here. Abstract data types An ADT is just a theoretical concept - it's how any type should look: what operation are allowed etc. Implementation is not a part of ADT's. Take for example Stacks. A stack ADT can have the operations push, pop, peek. These three operations define what the type can be irrespective of the language of the implementation. One misbelief many people have is the ADT is a concept of OOP. That's just not true. Coming back to our stack, you could implement stack in Ruby (complete OOP), Java (object oriented), Racket (pseudo-OOP), C (procedural) etc. All would have (at least) the same three operations. Hope that helps. PS: Follow me if you like the answer. I tend to answer a lot of technical questions.
