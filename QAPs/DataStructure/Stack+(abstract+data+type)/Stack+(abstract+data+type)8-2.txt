Learning to Program:Â What are are the push and pop operations in C? When do I need them?
What are push and pop operations ? Let's see you have some plates which are arranged in top of one another like this. if you want to put another plate on the stack you have to keep it on top you simply cant just insert in middle or at bottom(you can if you can lift them up but let's consider you cant), so when you put a new plate on top of stack you just did a PUSH operation. Now, from the stack of plates you want to remove a plate for some purpose you have to remove the top plate, without removing the top you cant remove the plates below. This is POP operation This is exactly what happens in stack which contains same data types like here we had all plates and stack insertion(PUSH) and removal(POP) always happen in LIFO (Last In First Out) manner, in simple words the plate which was inserted last should be removed first. NOTE : PUSH and POP are operations of stack which can be used with any programming language, they are not just in C. When do i need them? whenever you have to use with same data type and the last element should be removed first.
