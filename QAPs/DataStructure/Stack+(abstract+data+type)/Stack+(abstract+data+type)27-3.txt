What should I do/learn next?
You said you learned all that in less than 48 hours. What do you mean by learned? Have you learned everything conceptually or just read? Have you tried your hands on programs? If answer of any of these questions is No, then please learn those concepts again. And try practicing them. Learning programming or any language is like when you read anything you will find it very simple to understand at that very moment, but when you try to apply that concept while writing code later, you don't get how to implement it. Even though thinga look easy, please try to understand it to the core. Don't just bother for interviews. You can crack them with mere luck also. But think about the long-term. Please let me know if I can help you with particular part. Good luck! And thanks for A2A.. :) ~RB
