How do I keep on moving forward in my coding education after I've completed a few Codecademy languages?
There's 2 ways you can take this. 1. You can keep investigating technologies and try to round yourself out a little more. MEAN stack, Ruby on Rails, Django or Flask, Laravel, you name it. 2. You can start building applications in your spare time and literally build your resume from scratch. You'll learn a lot that you'd learn on the job, and you'll be a better engineer for it. (You should go with #2. It implicitly includes #1) Updated 20w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Anonymous
