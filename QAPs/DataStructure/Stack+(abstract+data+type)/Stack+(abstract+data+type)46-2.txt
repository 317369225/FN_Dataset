Why am I not smart enough?
Nicola has agood point: "practice makes perfect." Well, maybe practice makes better. Certainly, practice does improve performance, even as it seems that no progress is being made. If this is you passion, spend the time in practicing, just as if you were trying too master a musical instrument. at times it will seem likde drudgery, but change will happen. My recommendation, however, is that you try mastering a musical instrument and see if you discover that your passion lies elsewhere!
