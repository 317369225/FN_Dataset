Why doesn't std::queue have a clear function like std::vector does?
The objects, std::queue, std::stack and std::priority_queue all do not have a clear function this is because they are adaptors and not real container like a vector. They also have underlining containers type that they use to store the data so if your are willing to create your own containers with the proper methods and structure to feed into the container definition then it should work. This might be helpful if your container must be thread-safe as the currently not. Check cppreference.com for the methods you need to implement in you own container definition for these classes. Â  In my opinion, the big reason why would be these classes do not have a clear method is to limit the scope of the std::queue, std::stack and std::priority_queue classes to just the basic methods that you need. In a sense this classes are little more then interfaces. If you need more functionality, consider using the underling container structure that the classes are built on rather than the classes themselves.
