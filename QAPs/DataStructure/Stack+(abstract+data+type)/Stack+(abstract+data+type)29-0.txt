What is the difference between logical schema and physical schema?
I hope we are talking databases here and not some other topic. Logical schema is like the "definition" of a data structure or the definition of the ADT (Abstract Data Type).  Eg., a stack is defined by its pop and push operations. In RDBMS, a relation or a table is logical. Physical scheme is like the implementation of a data structure.  Ex.- A stack can be implemented using a array, a linked list or even as a table in a database. In RDBMS, different RDBMS packages will implement a table differently ranging from a flat file, to a balanced tree and all the way to a distributed architecture. Hope this cleared some of the fog!
