How do I keep on moving forward in my coding education after I've completed a few Codecademy languages?
Fist codeacademy is great but it only gives you one type of learning. And it gives you all the solutions. The best way to get going is to make something. What ever you want. It should be something you are passionate about so you don't burnout; don't go to ambitious. A small game or a web app are very good starting projects but you will know what is right for you. Don't follow a tutorial unless you are learning something new like a platform in which case do the tutorial first than the project. Just Start is the best advice I can give you.
