Learning to Program:Â What are are the push and pop operations in C? When do I need them?
First off, a push/pop operation is not limited to just the C programming language. They can be written in any language. What are they, though? A push/pop operation is usually performed on a "stack". You can think of a stack as an array of, in this case, integers. A stack is a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure. That means that whatever the last thing you pushed into a stack was, will be the first thing that pops out. So if you have: stack = [] stack.push(1) should give you this: stack = [1] Let's push again. stack.push(2) This should give us: stack = [1, 2] Now, let's pop from the stack. popped = stack.pop() Notice how the pop function has no parameters. It just removes the last item in the stack, and returns it to you, such that popped = 2. Now our stack looks like stack = [1] Hope this helps.
