What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
A compiler is something that translates one language into another (which can potentially be the same language). Think about it like what Google Translator is for natural languages. An interpreter is something that executes a program in some language. All programs are ultimately interpreted, it just so happens that one interpreter is implemented directly in the hardware, and some interpreters are implemented as softwares (and these interpreters themselves are interpreted by some hardware). Some hardware, like the intel x86 family of processors, also compile your programs from a set of instructions into another set of instructions before interpreting.
