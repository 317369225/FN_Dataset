What is "must have" knowledge or skill set about Java for a recent CS graduate applying for an entry-level Java Position?
Thanks for the A2A. Since I make a living from programming courses, I get some feedback from my subscribers about what they had to learn to get a job. I also got a job myself after teaching myself to program. The answer seems to be the following: it's possible to get a job as a Java developer knowing only basic Java, to the point where you can develop simple programs.. But every additional thing you learn helps. Some skills that are particularly in demand are: SQL HTML/CSS Top-down OO design Android Servlets, JSPS Anything web-related, e.g. Spring Framework (but comparatively few new developers understand web frameworks) Knowledge of design patterns Any kind of proven ability to write software
