Who will get the head coach job at Duke once Coach K retires?
Most likely one of Coach K's former or current assistant coaches.  Tommy Amaker is the front runner in my mind as he has head coaching experience.  Coach K's style of basketball, and running the team, has served Duke well.  They University won't stray far from this model when the time comes to appoint a new head coach.
