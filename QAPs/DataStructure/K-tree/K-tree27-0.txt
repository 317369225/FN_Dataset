What are some of the movies that you still don't understand?
Pi (1998) - Downloaded the movie because it's title is my surname (well, that and the fact that it's synopsis (and rating) on IMDB (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138...) made it seem like a great movie) Watched the movie, then instantly deleted it, because it made absolutely no sense to me. Till date, just mentioning the movie makes my head hurt! Random Fact: I watched Requiem for a Dream (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180...) by the same director a few years ago... Easily among the best movies I've ever watched. Since then, I've always wanted to revisit Pi, but my brain just doesn't allow me to! :P
