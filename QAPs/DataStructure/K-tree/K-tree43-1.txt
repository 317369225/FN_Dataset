Is Jaime Lannister in love with Brienne of Tarth (Spoiler)?
Their feelings are complicated. I'm not sure even they know what they feel or why. You have Jaime, who's actually sworn to celibacy but secretly in love with his twin sister, someone who takes advantage of that love to manipulate him. Then you have Brienne, who, due to her appearance and fondness for masculine pursuits, has never had many prospects in that department and seems resigned to a life of solitude. Neither of them are what you'd call emotionally available, but they bring out good qualities in each other. Jaimie tries to get Brienne to appreciate that the spirit of the law shouldn't be overcome by the letter of it, and Brienne's adherence to duty and genuine, non-selfish decency hit a chord in Jaime. If you're only familiar with their relationship from the show, I'll stop there. Just saying that you're on the right track and there's more going on there.
