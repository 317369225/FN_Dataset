Why is it important for a CS major to learn about databases?
The short answer:  I don't think it is (very important). But, a few other reasons:  it is possible (even common) for an app-developer to write code, unthinkingly, that chokes (bottlenecks) the back end data repository ('database').  Further, developers will write 'better' (more streamlined) transactional queries if they understand how those queries are parsed (in the case of SQL, query terms are processed right-to-left, so putting your greatest narrow-down search in the last (rightmost) field of the query is 'faster').  Lastly:  maybe the student likes data structures, and might have some interest in how Oracle implements B-trees, K-trees, etc.? I have a personal (unsubstantiated) feeling that, in this day and age of distributed storage, grid processing, and meta-attribute-relationships, we are starting to move away from traditional relational databases (RDBMS).  But, for the time being, they're still here, and still very much in use.
