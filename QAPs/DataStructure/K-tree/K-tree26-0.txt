Why is it important for a CS major to learn about databases?
Programs that deal with lots of data will probably use a database. You can store millions of pieces of data in there and still get a really quick response to most of the types of questions you might want to answer. You just can't get that kind of speed from a flat file. You can get it from memory, of course, but you're unlikely to be able to house all your data in memory all the time for certain types of programs. Â  For example, the program I'm working on now has tens of millions of documents. Their paths are stored in a database, as well as a lot of metadata related to the documents, relationships between some of the documents, notes left on the documents by particular customers, etc.
