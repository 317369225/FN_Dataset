Is it generally better to marry a girl older than you or younger?
Generally, younger. Girls mature faster than guys (I'm not boasting, it's science). But, remember to have all your duckS in a row, or she won't have the time to put up with crap. Ask yourself, are you ready for commitment? If not, don't be wasting peoples time and just hang out with your buddy's. Hope this helps!
