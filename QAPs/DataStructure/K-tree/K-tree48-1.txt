Which machine learning algorithms for classification support online learning?
There are some gradient-based machine learning techniques for classification and regression. They supports online learning with these steps: 1) Define loss function for EACH training data instead of ALL data. 2) Calculate gradient of these loss functions. 3) Modify parameters to the direction based on these gradient, so that the loss becomes smaller. 4) Repeat these steps until convergence. This is called SGD: Stochastic Gradient Descent, the simple way to implement online learning. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sto... Many other techniques are proposed for online learning. Some of them are based on Newton Methods. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New...
