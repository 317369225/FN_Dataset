What is the major difference between a fractal tree and a b-/k-ary tree?
Fractal trees are similar in some ways to log-structured merge trees [1], and achieve much higher insert rates than a conventional B-tree by converting random disk writes to sequential disk writes, while avoiding the obvious read penaly of a naive LSM implementation through the use of fractional cascading [2].Â  See this answer [3] for a brief discussion of Fractal vs LSM, or this blog post [4] for the first in a series of posts discussing in detail various strategies for large external memory dictionaries. 1. http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/vie... 2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fra... 3.
