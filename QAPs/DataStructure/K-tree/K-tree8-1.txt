Who will get the head coach job at Duke once Coach K retires?
It is widely believed that long time Duke alumn and assistant Steve Wojciechowski is the Head Coach in waiting. Unless of course he takes another job prior to Coach K retiring. [edit] This answer is already dated. Marquette has hired Steve Wojciechowski to be their head coach. This doesn't mean he won't jump for the Duke job when it becomes available.
