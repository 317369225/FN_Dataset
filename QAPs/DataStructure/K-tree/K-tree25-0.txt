Computational Complexity Theory:Â Which problem of proven lower bound [math]\Omega\left(n^k\right)[/math] is there under the decision tree model, but in fact, it has an algorithm of time [math]O\left(n^ {k-\varepsilon}\right)[/math]?
If by "it has an algorithm of time [math]O(n^{k-\epsilon})[/math]" you mean it has an algorithm of time [math]O(n^{k-\epsilon})[/math] in the decision tree model, then the answer is trivially no. Upper bounds cannot be smaller than lower bounds within the same model. If you allow your upper bound to be in any model whatsoever, then the answer is trivially yes, e.g., sorting takes [math]\Omega(n \log n)[/math] in the comparison model, and [math]O(1)[/math] in a model that allows you to sort an array in one step. You could potentially get an interesting answer by choosing a specific model for the upper bound.
