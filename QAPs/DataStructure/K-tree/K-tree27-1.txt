What are some of the movies that you still don't understand?
Primer. I have seen this movie a few times, and I have reconciled with the fact that perhaps I am never going to really understand it. Heck, I even tried watching it after reading the plot description on Wikipedia, and I still didn't get it. WTF keeps going on?! What is the timeline like? When did they change from one time frame to another? I even put a bet on this movie in college: anyone who could understand it in one attempt without reading the subtitles would get some hundred rupees. As expected, no one won. Here is XKCD's take on Primer. http://xkcd.com/657/large/
