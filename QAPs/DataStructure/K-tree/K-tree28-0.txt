Sorting Algorithms:Â What are some of the best and easily implementable data structures that support finding the kth largest element quickly?
If the data can be compressed into integers or is bounded to integers less than some N, binary searching on a Binary Indexed Tree aka Fenwick tree allows updates and queries in O(log N), and is far easier to implement than conventional balanced binary search trees.
