Is Jaime Lannister in love with Brienne of Tarth (Spoiler)?
I would call their relationship a "slightly more than platonic appreciation." He's kinda a jerk, and she brought out the best in him. She saved his life. He saved hers. There's obviously going to be some bonding in there. Look at Arya and the Hound: they start out basically despising each other, but I think they grow to have some sort of affection between them. Jamie and Brienne are rather similar. She begins by despising him and as they get to know each other better, and are both put in positions of vulnerability with each other (Jamie losing a hand and Brienne getting attacked) they develop a mutual respect. I think you could probably go so far as to say that they love each other. It's not romantic though, at least in my opinion. There's a difference between loving someone and being in love with someone.
