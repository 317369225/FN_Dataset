Which machine learning algorithms for classification support online learning?
Most algorithms can be adapted to make them online, even though the standard implementations may not support it. E.g. both decision trees and support vector machines have online variations (for example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inc... and http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/vie...). However, the algorithms for which the natural implementations support online learning are: Nearest neighbor: You simply add a new instance to the set, and from then on it is available to match as a nearest neighbor. Note that any optimizations for speeding up look-up (e.g. k-d tree) also have to support dynamic update. Naive Bayes: Provided that you store the counts (n out of m) instead of the computed probabilities (n/m), naive Bayes is also online.
