How do I go about preparing for interviews on geeksforgeeks.org? It's so vast.
Good Question. You must have a few target companies in mind for which you want to prepare. Geekforgeeks allows interviewees to upload their experience and questions in the respective companies. You can access company-wise interview question set. Each set will have 3 to 4 questions all asked in a single interview. This is a good strategy because you will get to know some patterns. For example you will see that companies like Google, Amazon ask only about Data Structures and Algo. Microsoft interview sets have a few core-CS based questions also. Some companies also ask you design questions. So you will get an idea what you can expect in your interviews. Once you have gone through a lot of company-wise interview sets - start exploring topic wise. They have sets like Dyanamic Programming, Graphs, etc. You can concentrate on your weak areas this way and prepare for those "unlucky rare" questions - that you might require.
