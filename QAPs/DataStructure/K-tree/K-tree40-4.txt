Is it generally better to marry a girl older than you or younger?
I think it differs from person to person,even to the same person,it differs in different times.Take myself for example,when I was in senior 1,I have affection for two girls at the same time.One was older than me,and the other one is younger than me.At the beginning,I prefer the older one,because I want to be looked to instead of spending much time to comfort a girl,as if she wasn't my girlfriend but my little sister.Later,when I stepped into senior 2,I felt that it is better to be dominant in a relationship than be treated as a child.The older one always told me what was right and what wasn't and I hated that because I wanted to explore the world myself instead of repeating anyone else's life. As for marriage,I have preference for the girl who is a little younger,because girls are always a littleÂ  more mature than their peer boys.Therefor, in a best situation,you can have both dominance and care. Anyway,when you really meet someone,it doesn't matter is she younger or older,what matters is both of you love each other.
