Why is it important for a CS major to learn about databases?
Because databases are the core of virtually all the software in use today. It is a multi-billion dollar industry that powers computing. In addition, databases are an important scalability and performance bottleneck that can compromise your whole business if not designed and understood properly. With the various DB systems in use today, having a good foundation knowledge of DB theory and practice will help you choose, improve and design your apps on top of it. Even change the (open source) DB internals to meet your specific requirements. From a CS perspective, the building of database is a very interdisciplinary task, requiring knowledge of hardware, OS, programming language design, algorithms & data structures, and network programming.
