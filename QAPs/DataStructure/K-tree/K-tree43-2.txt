Is Jaime Lannister in love with Brienne of Tarth (Spoiler)?
Having not read the books I can only answer the question in the context of the TV series.  I don't see Jaime being 'in love' with Brienne in the classically romantic sense.  What's happened is that just when Jaime had become utterly cynical with regards to knightly honor, feeling that everyone had their price, he meets a warrior who can't be bought.  Yes, she's a woman which in his world is, on the surface, laughable, but she doesn't just put honor forward as a concept you apply to yourself with words.  She lives the concept.  Yes, she's naive, socially awkward and lacking in the graces of the knightly class.  But her core is pure.  Jaime loves this about her.  It's caused him to reevaluate the world and his place in it.  He'd come to think true honor existed only in fairytales, and then it turns up personified right before his eyes in the form of an ungainly woman.  And thus does he take the first steps on the road to redemption.  I don't know if he'll find that redemption, but his love for Brienne's deep down goodness has awakened something in him he thought was long dead.
