Sorting Algorithms:Â What are some of the best and easily implementable data structures that support finding the kth largest element quickly?
Quickselect (already described in the above Wikipedia page) should be easily implementable, provided you are comfortable with recursion. Also, it is somewhat similar to quicksort (picking a pivot and sorting the rest of the elements by doing a comparison with this pivot element), then repeating this task with a smaller subset Quickselect is fast if you can find the median in O(n) each time, which you can do by using median-of-medians algorithms (also described in the Wikipedia link above)
