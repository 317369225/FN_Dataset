Kd-tree, K-nearest neighbor?
Suppose you are at a point where you have the following points, and you want to split on the x-coordinate. (10, 10), (10, 20), (10, 30), (10, 40), (10, 50), (10, 60) You can then sort the points with the key (X, Y) and choose the median point [(10, 30) in this example] and split the point-set based on this median point. Store this point as the split point at the internal node. While answering queries, if you need to locate the point (10, 40), you can compare it with the split point and check if the point in question (10, 40) is to the left or right of the split (10, 30). Of course, in this example, we split based on the x-coordinate. If you are splitting on the y-coordinate, you need to adjust your compassion code accordingly and check if the query point is above or below the split point. Every alternate level will split on x/y coordinates.
