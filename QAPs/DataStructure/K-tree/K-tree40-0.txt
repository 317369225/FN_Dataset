Is it generally better to marry a girl older than you or younger?
It's better for yourself (and your future children) to marry the one you like and love. Life as a married couple will be too 'exciting' with too many important things to deal with than quibbling over age differences. That being said, from my own experience of my friends and generally looking at people, I would say your spouse generally shouldn't be more than 10 years' difference. It gets a bit difficult to align the personal perspectives of the pair of you because of formative years occurring at different times. That being said again, if the pair of you are in love and you've decided as far as to get married, then you've already surmounted the perspective differences.
