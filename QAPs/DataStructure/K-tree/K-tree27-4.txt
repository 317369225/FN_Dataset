What are some of the movies that you still don't understand?
'No Smoking' by Anurag Kashyap. When the film started with a Kafkaesque opening scene, I had a hunch it wasn't going to go down well with me. Halfway through the film, I had lost track of the plot and by the time it ended, I was so confounded that I couldn't tell reality from hallucination. Despite going through the ordeal of watching it again several times, I'm still unsure if the protagonist ("K"- another reference to Kafka) was experiencing hallucinations or actually underwent the weird 'experiments' to quit smoking. [Any sort of explanation welcome!]
