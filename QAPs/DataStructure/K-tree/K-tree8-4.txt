Who will get the head coach job at Duke once Coach K retires?
Johnny Dawkins would be a good fit and i doubt he would pass on the opportunity. He has done a great job at Stanford, which should prepare him well for the lead role. But that would be some years from now. Factors constant, Coach has at least 5 more years in him and should get that 1000 wins before he even thinks of retiring. Their are other good options though. With a resume strengthening with each passing year, you can't rule out Brad Stevens. I think if he can pull off another 2 or 3 good runs he would be in a position to catch the eye of Duke. As alumni myself, I wouldn't mind a youthful but focused coach. His discipline and aura mirages a legendary coach in the making. I also like Tommy Amaker, he has taken his lessons learnt from Coach K and implemented them into a now decent Harvard program. Over time, if Harvard can start dominating other Ivies like Princeton, I wouldn't rule him out. When all is said and done though, and when Coach K's reign ends, their will be a transition period where the Blue Devils will look a tad bit shaky, never miserable. But with time order will prevail and Duk will be atop. That's just me taking the opportunity to give a shout out to my alma mater :)
