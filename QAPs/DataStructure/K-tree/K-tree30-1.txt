What skills are expected from entry-level software engineers at Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Twitter, etc.?
I can tell you the things I look for when interviewing a pending or recent graduate. Passion, intelligence, communication skills. Able to explain their thinking, approach, and analyze strengths / weaknesses of an approach. Good problem solving, ability to iterate on solutions. Quick thinking. Clear understanding of boundary between what they do and don't know. Good attitude.For technical skills, I hope to find solid knowledge of core data structures and algorithms, and good, accurate coding skills. For example: Knowledge of linked lists, binary trees, k-ary trees, tries, lists, heaps, queues, stacks, multidimensional arrays. All standard operations on these. Hash tables and hashing. Various sorts: bubble, insert, merge, quicksort.And whatever else qualifies as core these days. Finally, understanding of space, time, and complexity tradeoffs of algorithms.
