Who will get the head coach job at Duke once Coach K retires?
Count me as one of the only Duke fans who doesn't want a Coach K coaching tree successor. I love them all, but how likely is it that our best option comes from that limited pool? Based on the question as asked (no restrictions requiring potential to happen), I'd have to go with the next best current coach - Tom Izzo. For potential to actually occur, however slight, gotta be Brad Stevens.
