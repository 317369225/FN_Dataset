What are the most important data structures needed to reach the ACM-ICPC World Finals?
Knowledge of special data structures isn't particularly useful at the regional level. It does depend on the regional, but knowledge of all the standard data structures (i.e. all library data structures) is essential to doing well. In a regional contest, I have solved a problem by coding a BIT (it was inversion counting though, so I suspect the intended solution was to code something like merge sort). If I had to be pressed on one non-standard data structure that you should learn, learn about range trees. They aren't too complicated and they've appeared often enough in contest I've done that it's the first non-standard data structure that comes to mind.
