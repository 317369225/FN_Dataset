Given an undirected graph where edges have been colored, can I find a spanning tree with exactly k colors?
Yes, if you know that there are n colours then you will have to form a sets of [math]\binom{n}{k} [/math]different colour combinations and then for each of the colour set obtained, filter out the edges and run Kurskal's on it to get the minimum spanning tree (if you want to find it that is, otherwise a simple dfs to check if all the vertices is covered is enough). Another way would be to do a DFS from the initial root, and do it till you have covered all the nodes and that path has only k colours in it.
