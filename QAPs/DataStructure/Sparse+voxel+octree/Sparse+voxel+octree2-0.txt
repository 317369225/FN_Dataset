Is this so called "Unlimited Detail Real-Time Rendering Technology" theoretically possible?
This looks like an implementation of metavoxels.   There was a SIGGRAPH paper and demo around (IIRC) 1995 where a company showed a metavoxel rendering engine.  The demo video they showed started with a planet as viewed from space and zoomed in to a frog on the ground - all in spectacular detail (for the time).  This was possible with graphics workstation technology that existed in 1995, but not "consumer PC" technology.   Voxels have been around for a long time, but as the video claims are hard to manage due to the volume of data.  Metavoxels nest voxels inside other voxels to optimize scene data for rendering. The video feels a little suspect because what it sounds like the company is calling "graphic atoms" have been called "voxels" by the computer graphics industry for decades.  They also sound like they're hyping, but maybe I'm used to hearing dry voice-over from technical demos, not marketing videos.  I suppose the tech could be real but they're trying to hype it as not-voxels to get a patent.
