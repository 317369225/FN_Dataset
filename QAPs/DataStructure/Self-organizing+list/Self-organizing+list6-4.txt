What are some good ideas for interesting physics-related simulations to code as a side project?
Audio synthesis. This is something you can do at many levels. You can start with basic simulations of analogue synthesizers: oscillators and filters etc. You get to implement a lot of engineering techniques like the analysis of systems through transfer functions. See http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A... (though be warned, you'll want to do band limited synthesis if you want good sound quality. This is non-trivial.) At the other end you can try fully simulating 2D and 3D objects: drums, metal bars, 3D air cavities and so on. See http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D... for some ideas on cutting corners and doing this more efficiently. If you really want to go crazy you can start ray tracing cathedral interiors to try to simulate their reverb. Audio synthesis has surprisingly many connections to other parts of physics: ODEs, resonance, wave equations, Fourier theory, electronics and lots more. As a side effect you may find you get a usable musical instrument out of your work.
