What are some funny and idiotic logics of Bharatiya Janata Party supporters?
your Ford foundation funds are from CIA , mine are for development... (yes, Ford Foundation has put more money in gujarat govt schemes than it ever gave to Kabir AK and Manish Sisodia's NGO for RTI awareness) Congress is all corrupt and evil, AAP is their B-team even though AAP opposed and hurt Congress more than BJP ever did over the period of its existence. Gujarat Model is the ideal model of development, when No one knows what Gujarat model really is, if its not providing subsidized land for pennies to multi billion Corporate groups who can and should pay for it. AAP are violent bunch of maoists but for electoral advantage we can lay a red carpet for Maoist leader Kamleswar Baitha ex-JMM accused of many murders including that of copsÂ  Baitha released from jail - The Times of India
