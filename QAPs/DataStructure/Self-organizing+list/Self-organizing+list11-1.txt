What's the best way to manage Spotify playlists?
I have folders called - Genre -- Indie  (if i pick this folder, it plays any folders in it) --- folk --- rock -- Rock -- Electronic - Era - Atmospheres -- party -- kids party What I like about my setup is that if I choose the Indie folder, it will hold all songs from sub-folders.  So I can play either all 'Indie' music, or pick the folder 'Indie folk'
