What are the necessary parameters to use an artificial neural network aka ANN package in R?
In AMORE package packages:cran:amore [R Wiki] , The users may choose among three different degrees of involvement with  the package: using the already available functions, programming their  own functions playing in the easy R arena during the first steps and trials, and using the C programming language to speed up the training heavy tasks. Then there are obviously a list of all the parameters required for a feedforward or self organized feature map network. This is a standard feedforward network and using AMORE package you require: 1. Layers (total number of them and a list of as many numerical vectors as layers are needed) 2. a list containing Neurons 3. Input and Output Vectors 4. Teacher value (i.e. target expected value vector) 5. Delta Error 6. And some other auxiliary elements as given in the Auxillary list of AMORE documentation There are some more packages mentioned in R Forge but parameters pretty much remain the same in all.
