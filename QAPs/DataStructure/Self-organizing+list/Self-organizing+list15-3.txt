How does one get invited to speak at TED?
I can contribute a once-removed perspective as a TEDx organizer. Most important is taking the long view, not working "speaking at TED" as a specific goal. The most successful, compelling presenters work tirelessly in their passion/knowledge areas, think and work outside the box, talk, write, speak, sing and dance about their passion with other thought leaders and creatives at every opportunity. While they recognize speaking at TED (or TEDx) as an amazing opportunity to connect with an open-minded audience, their real work is their focus, not any single communication opportunity. So our selection committee avoided applicants for whom the goal seemed to be getting a TED or TEDx "notch in the belt." While organizing TEDxSanAntonio, we learned a lot about how TED does things, including selections, and what worked for our smaller self-organized event. TED encouraged us to keep our "theme" very broad, to allow for a good mix and serendipity - the ability to discover passionate, informed, thought-provoking people and topics. Speaking at, attending, or organizing a TEDx event can help you understand the TED organization better and make contacts. Some TEDx talks get featured on "big" TED's website, and some get invited to speak at the main event(s). Practically speaking - having video of yourself talking knowledgably and passionately about your topic greatly helps selection committee members get a better sense. Looking at your topic in a new way is key - new approaches to old problems, innovation, and fresh perspectives made speakers rise to the top of our lists.
