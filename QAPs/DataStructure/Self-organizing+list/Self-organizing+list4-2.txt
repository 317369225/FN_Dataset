What are some of the most important algorithms used in quantitative trading?
To say that algorithmic models can be simplified to a certain number of models is ridiculous. There may be influences, genesis and adaptations upon others but the link between the begginings of Algo and what is done today is akin to saying the Beatles influenced or are the most important force in what...any break-off from Rock&Roll is today. What is really exciting is the pace at which algorithmic models are being iterating upon faster than ever before with large amounts of capital being invested by institutions into programming teams. This is billions of dollars yearly being put into Computer Science programs, correlating new forms of data (like social media and otherwise) and computing power which are allowing for capacity and innovation like never before seen. The end result being a a divergence of input data (from basic inter-industry data to solar flares and social media data), diverging model complexity and speeds and diverging model usage. Moreover, the algorithmic model creation process has been quickened by democratized software like QuantConnect or a few others which allow a much larger section of the population to create algorithmic models and put them into practice. This is allowing large numbers of people to push innovation in the field. A democratized low cost and easily iterative process in Finance is a dream for many an is coming to fruition, definitely worth a look at some projects in that space.
