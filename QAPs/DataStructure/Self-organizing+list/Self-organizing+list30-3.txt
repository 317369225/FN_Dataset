What is Evernote missing?
I love Evernote Web Clipper for saving little pieces of information i find as i trawl the web, but it creates a new note for every sentence, image and piece of content i clip. What i really want is to be able to combine new information into an existing note. Also, i've found that after many years of using Evernote, my notes are stacked up and getting stale. The amount of notes that i have that i never read again is growing, and this means there's a needle-in-a-haystack problem trying to find the good stuff worth re-reading. I'm mostly interesting in capturing information that i'd like to remember/learn. One other thing i'd like Evernote to do is provide revise and repeat functionality like http://www.memrise.com/ does but with my notes, not a specific course. For these reasons i'm experimenting with creating my own note-taking system (Life Learner) designed purely for learning. It has a Spaced repetition revision function which uses timed intervals to remind you what you haven't learnt yet. It also imports all new notes into one summary per topic making it simple to access everything at once. If Evernote got its act into gear i wouldn't have to create this for myself!
