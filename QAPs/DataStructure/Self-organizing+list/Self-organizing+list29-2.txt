Are people using Asana as a personal organizer/to-do list tool?
I've used a variety of tools to support my GTD system over the years and Asana remains my favorite.  Between the workspace, projects, tags, speed and usability it ticks most of the boxes. Lists are most easily managed using the Notes field attached to a task. If you are not sharing your workspace with others I recommend have just one,it makes daily and weekly reviews much quicker.  It also means you don't have to duplicate contexts (e.g. Phone calls to make)
