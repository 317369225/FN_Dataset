What is the smallest self-propelling organism?
As a quick answer, about 0.8 microns seems to be the lower limit. For very small objects the Reynold's number is below 10^-4, which means viscosity is so large relative to inertia that almost any movement becomes impossible. For a good analysis see https://boulder.research.yale.ed...
