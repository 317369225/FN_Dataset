What are the best books and blogs on software development management?
I have a blog on software management and posted an article on my top 5 books for new software managers here:  Top 5 Books for New Software Managers The books that I chose were: The First 90 Days by Michael Watkins The Lean Startup by Eric Ries The Innovator's Dilemma by Clayton Christensen Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie Overall I found "The First 90 Days" to be the most helpful, especially when transitioning into a new role or company.
