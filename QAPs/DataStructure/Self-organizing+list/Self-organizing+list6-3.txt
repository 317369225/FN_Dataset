What are some good ideas for interesting physics-related simulations to code as a side project?
Three Body Problem A lot of structure exists within the three body solar system.  Five Lagrange points exist where a test point would exhibit no motion with respect to two massive bodies, and masses can exist in various resonances, like the 1:2:4 of Ganymede, Europa, and Io. Simulations can show how the stability of certain structures, and chaotic nature of others. While the Lagrange points are fairly easy to understand, you can check out a textbook like Murray and Dermott's Solar System Dynamics for a more advanced perturbation treatment of resonances. Two options exist for posing the simulation: 1. Write in the co-rotating frame of two massive bodies, and treat the third body as a test mass.  This is best for seeing the Lagrange points. 2. Write in an inertial frame and treat all bodies as massive.  Add in the option for an n-body problem.  This is more general and can show more chaotic situations. And for entering initial conditions: 1. Write in terms of positions and velocities 2. Write in terms of orbital elements ([math] a, e, I, \Omega, \omega, f [/math]) Even after writing the simulation, there are so many numbers to play around with. Or you can just play super planet crash: http://www.stefanom.org/spc/ and learn orbital dynamics that way!
