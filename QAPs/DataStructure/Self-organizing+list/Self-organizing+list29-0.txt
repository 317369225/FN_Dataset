Are people using Asana as a personal organizer/to-do list tool?
As Asana has Personal as the default Workspace, shows us what they want us to do. I have been trying to use it for my personal GTD and journal of where I'm at with my personal vision of life/private stuff.Â  The goal is to try to review it regularly, but it seems that Asana is a bit premature on that front until they publish their API. What I need are more tools for handling capturing of items into the Personal workspace. Similar as Evernote and similar capturing tools have implemented so nicely. I do have a few lists on my Personal workspace, like Knowledge, Vision board, Stuff I Want, Mega Goals and some fun lists like my personal Life Goals list. I moved my personal Watch, Read, Listen list from my personal workspace to my shared company workspace as the future is very much about sharing.See my thoughts on that here: What are some best practices and techniques for using Asana to manage a tech startup product/service? You can see the lists I use (at the time of the writing) at my company here: What are the most important kanban boards or lists product development companies should foster and maintain?I have challenges to keep my daily GTD list in the Private workspace, as I do not want to navigate around the workspaces. As a self-declared Asana-poweruser, I feel that navigating around my tasks around the different workspaces is too cumbersome. This is why I use my company Workspace as my semi-personal organizer list tool. That my change when Asana improves their product in the future...
