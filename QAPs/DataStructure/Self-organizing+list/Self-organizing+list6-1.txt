What are some good ideas for interesting physics-related simulations to code as a side project?
I suggest a canonical problem from statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics: simulating the Ising model for magnetism on a lattice with nearest neighbor interactions. The Hamiltonian for the Ising model is [math]\mathcal{H}=-J\sum s_i s_j -H\sum s_i [/math] where [math]s_{i,j}[/math] are spins on the i-th and j-th (where j is a nearest neighbor of i) lattice site (usually represented numerically as +1 and -1 for spin up and spin down), J is the magnetic coupling between neighboring spins (J>0 gives ferromagnetic coupling, J<0 gives antiferromagnetic coupling), and H is the applied magnetic field. To get started, I recommend this (free online) statistical mechanics textbook in which chapter 8 walks you through computations using the Ising model: http://pages.physics.cornell.edu... This model can be used to get intuition about magnetic phase transitions and scaling of magnetic correlations above the transition temperature.  It can be extended by considering higher dimensions (the Ising model is only exactly solvable in 1D and 2D), different types  of lattices (e.g. triangular), second nearest neighbor interactions, etc.  Additionally, modifications of this model can be used to study binary alloys, liquid-gas phase transitions, and even neuron activity, as discussed in the linked textbook and wikipedia article.
