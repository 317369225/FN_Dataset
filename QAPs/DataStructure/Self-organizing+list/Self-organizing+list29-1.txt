Are people using Asana as a personal organizer/to-do list tool?
I've been looking for years for a tool that would allow me to implement David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD) and yet be simple, fast and flexible enough to keep me encouraged to use it on a regular basis. Asana is the tool that has come closer to it (and I've reviewed tons of tools every new year and every time I move from one country to another or start a new start-up or project). It has the speed and nice flow of modern to-do lists and task manager with the capacity to handle multiple workspaces (for projects, or businesses) and still allows you to access them all from a single platform. And the joy of "tags" allows you to group your thoughts and tasks beyond task lists, projects and workspaces. Updated 208w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
