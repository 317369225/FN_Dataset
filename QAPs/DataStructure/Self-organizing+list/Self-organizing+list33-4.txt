Do “helicopter” parents help their child’s school experience?
Generally, no, for the reasons Jeff points out concisely. But I have seen some students (especially those who lack self-advocacy skills) who have benefitted from parental involvement. As a high school teacher, I usually appreciate email from parents. However, the worst helicoptering parents are generally those in the earlier grades.
