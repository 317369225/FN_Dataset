How does one get invited to speak at TED?
I assume you are talking about what I call "the real TED" which is held in Long Beach every year, usually in February or March. I attended the 2010 version. One thing I've noticed is that the planners attend a lot of events around the world looking for great speakers. For instance, Bruno Giussani, who is European Director of TED, has always been in attendance at LIFT in Geneva. One year five speakers who gave great talks at LIFT were invited to speak the next year at TED. LIFT's site is here: http://liftconference.com/ -- I've been several times and it's a great conference that has lots of people who've done extraordinary research or things in their lives. There's a list of the key decision makers of TED here: http://conferences.ted.com/TED20... I got a tour of TED's offices in New York, where you'll pick up some other tips. That video is here: June Cohen (she is the executive producer) told me that they look for people who: 1. Have done something world changing. 2. Are able to give a good speech. She says that there are lots of people they would love to invite, because they have done something world changing, but that just aren't able to give a good speech. They also look at YouTube and now that they have hundreds of TEDx's around the world, there's a constant stream of great speakers to choose from there. Several people told me that if you want to be invited to the "real TED" your best shot now is to: 1. Have done something extraordinary with your life. 2. Give a TEDx talk that is extraordinary. That's pretty hard. It's above my pay grade, for sure. But getting invited to speak at a local TEDx is much easier (I've spoken at two of those), and the other answers here give great tips on how those are chosen.
