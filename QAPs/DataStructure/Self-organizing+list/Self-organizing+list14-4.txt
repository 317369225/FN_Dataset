What are some books about everything?
Whatever is here, is found elsewhere. But what is not here, is nowhere else. Besides its epic narrative of the Kurukshetra War and the fates of the Kauravas and the Pandava princes, the Mahabharata contains much philosophical and devotional material, such as a discussion of the four "goals of life" or purusharthas.
