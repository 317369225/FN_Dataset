What could a 20-year-old do to potentially improve their quality of life further down the line?
For god sake please learn about Debt early on in life and avoid it. More than a third of young people are worried they may slip into debt during the next three months, a survey has claimed. Around 36% of people aged under 35 fear they will not be able to meet all their financial commitments going forward, according to financial services firm CPP Group. But those aged over 35 are more confident about their finances, with only 17% concerned that they will not be able to pay all the bills in the next three months. Across all age groups not being able to meet mortgage repayments was the biggest fear, cited by 33% of those who were worried about their finances, followed by not being able to pay the council tax for 21%, and not being able to meet utility bills for 16%. Julia Procter, of CPP Group, said: "Whilst young Britons are now more fearful than ever of slipping into the red, older people believe that their finances are more under control. "Whatever their age, it is essential that anybody who fears that they will not be able to meet financial commitments acts quickly to address the issue. "The most important thing to do is to acknowledge the problem before it gets out of hand and to talk to professionals to tackle the problem head on." Updated 82w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
