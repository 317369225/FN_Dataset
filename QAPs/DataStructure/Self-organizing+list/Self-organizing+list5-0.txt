Y Combinator:Â How do YC alumni usually reach out to other YC alumni after YC ends?
There's an official mailing list for each batch and an official mailing list for all founders ever. In addition, there are private Facebook groups for each batch and for all founders ever. These are self organizing and not maintained by YC.
