What's the correlation between complexity and consciousness?
Your question is kind of like "how red is this color red?". What is red? It's a man-made idea ascribed to a band of EM frequencies, but there is no real "red" that actually exists. This is kinda the Holy Grail of neuroscience, (creating consciousnesses), and while we're not there yet, we have a pretty good idea of what's going on. If you read very much by Ray Kurzweil, he describes (as well as other scientists) that consciousness is most likely an emergent property of a complex system. Consciousness evades tests because... well how well can you measure it? On what kind of a scale? Brain-dead humans have complex brains, but can be unconscious. Dolphins, monkeys, dogs,... they all have complex brains but are they conscious? If conciousness is even a property things can have, it seems like a good heuristic is that : the more complex a general decision maker is, the more consciousness it has. picture: Link
