What are some measures of complexity?
According to Lloyd [1]: Here is a list of some measures of complexity grouped according to the question that they try to answer. Measures within a group are typically closely related quantities. 1. Difficulty of description. Typically measured in bits. Information; Entropy; Algorithmic Complexity or Algorithmic Information Content; Minimum Description Length; Fisher Information; Renyi Entropy; Code Length (prefix-free, Huffman, Shannon- Fano, error-correcting, Hamming); Chernoff Information; Dimension; Fractal Dimension; Lempel--Ziv Complexity; Kolmogorov Complexity. 2. Difficulty of creation. Typically measured in time, energy, dollars, etc. Computational Complexity; Time Computational Complexity; Space Computational Complexity; Information--Based Complexity; Logical Depth (CH Bennett) Thermodynamic Depth; Cost; Crypticity. 3. Degree of organization. This may be divided up into two quantities: a) Difficulty of describing organizational structure, whether corporate, chemical, cellular, etc.; b) Amount of information shared between the parts of a system as the result of this organizational structure. a) Effective Complexity Metric Entropy; Fractal Dimension; Excess Entropy; Stochastic Complexity; Sophistication; Effective Measure Complexity; True Measure Complexity; Topological epsilon-machine size; Conditional Information; Conditional Algorithmic Information Content; Schema length; Ideal Complexity; Hierarchical Complexity; Tree subgraph diversity; Homogeneous Complexity; Grammatical Complexity.b) Mutual Information: Algorithmic Mutual Information; Channel Capacity; Correlation; Stored Information; Organization. In addition to the above measures, there are a number of related concepts that are not quantitative measures of complexity per se, but that are closely related. Such concepts include: Long--Range Order; Self--Organization; Complex Adaptive Systems; Edge of Chaos.
