What are some of the best channels to follow on YouTube by programmers?
The best channel out there to follow in terms of programming tuts and learning new skills is thenewboston. He has tutorials on PHP, Python, Java, CodeIgnitor, Game Development, C, Objective-C, Node.js, jQuery, Javascript, Visual Basic, Android, AJAX, iOS, R, Ruby, Laravel. It's great in case you want to try something new and need a starting point. Another great channel is phpacademy. This is more focused on php, mysql and front-end technologies. Here you'll find more in-depth tuts about the basics of web development from a Senior Developer himself. I'll personally watch this channel grow into something that is consider a valuable resource within the PHP community. Lastly, Adam Khoury is another youtuber who's pretty much been there since the beginning. His channel has tuts on CSS, HTML, Javascript, Flash, PHP, SQL, Swift, XML, JSON,Â  Android and the CS suite. He also videos where does small projects like showing you how to build a social network and the like. Hope that helps.
