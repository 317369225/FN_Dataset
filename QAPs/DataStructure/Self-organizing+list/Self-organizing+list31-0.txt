What are good papers on algorithm and datastructures in distributed/concurrent systems?
Distributed Hash Tables are used as the basis for a number of NoSQL systems. Consequently, I would put some of the DHT papers as references for this. The list includes CAN [1], Chord [2], Pastry [3], Tapestry [4] and P-Grid [5]. [1] Sylvia Ratnasamy, Paul Francis, Mark Handley, Richard Karp, and Scott Shenker. 2001. A scalable content-addressable network. SIGCOMM Compuer Communication Reviews 31, 4 (August 2001), 161-172. [2] Stoica, I.; Morris, R.; Karger, D.; Kaashoek, M. F.; Balakrishnan, H. (2001). "Chord: A scalable peer-to-peer lookup service for internet applications". ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 31 (4): 149. [3] Antony I. T. Rowstron and Peter Druschel. 2001.

In Proceedings of the IFIP/ACM International Conference on Distributed Systems Platforms Heidelberg (Middleware '01), Rachid Guerraoui (Ed.). Springer-Verlag, London, UK, UK, 329-350. [4] B. Y.

SIGMOD Record 32, 3 (September 2003), 29-33. The DDS paper [6] is also interesting to read, as is the Skip-tree [7]. [6] Steven D. Gribble, Eric A. Brewer, Joseph M. Hellerstein, and David Culler. 2000. Scalable, distributed data structures for internet service construction.

The LH* [8] is a fundamental paper, as is Plaxton's [9], which forms the basis of Chord, Pastry, CAN etc. [8] Witold Litwin, Rim Moussa, and Thomas Schwarz. 2005.

Efficient top-K query calculation in distributed networks. In Proceedings of the twenty-third annual ACM symposium on Principles of distributed computing(PODC '04). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 206-215.
