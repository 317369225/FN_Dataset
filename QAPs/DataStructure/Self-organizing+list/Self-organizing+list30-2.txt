What is Evernote missing?
Aside from my answers here: Christopher Bruce Sabine's answer to In what ways do Evernote and Springpad fail? How can a new startup compete in the field? I'd have to say that localized encryption is important, seeing as a lot of people keep sensitive information in Evernote. The encryption currently happens on the server (meaning the encryption keys are, obviously, also on the server). This is a vulnerability. If the encryption happened locally the sensitive information would be secured in case of lost/stolen computers/phones/tablets. See the comments on Christopher Bruce Sabine's answer to What's the best way to use a scanner for a paperless life?
