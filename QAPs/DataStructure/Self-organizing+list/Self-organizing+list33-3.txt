Do “helicopter” parents help their child’s school experience?
There is a difference between healthy parental involvement, which often has positive effects on on child's academic attainment, and helicopter parenting. Helicopter parents are (hyper) involved parents, but not all involved parents are helicopter parents. Therefore helicopter parents are involved in situations that are developmentally inappropriate for them to be involved in. This denies student's opportunities to develop autonomy and other necessary skills that promote achievement. However, current research in helicopter parenting is looking at the perceptions and attitudes of helicopter parenting held by students. If a student views helicopter parenting as intrusive, this may have more damaging impacts than if a student views helicopter parenting as helpful and a signal of love.
