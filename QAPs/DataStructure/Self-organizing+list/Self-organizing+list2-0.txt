What could a 20-year-old do to potentially improve their quality of life further down the line?
Start saving money. Put it in an account that will garner compound interest or invest in an Index Fund (this advice is per Warren Buffett). Develop healthy habits. We're talking flossing, drinking water, taking a vitamin daily. Similarly: stop bad habits. If you smoke, quit. Don't be in the habit of drinking yourself to sleep. Bad habits are hard to break and the longer you keep a bad habit the worse it is for you. Take big risks. When you are younger, you can afford to be less risk averse than when you're older. For example, launching a start-up when you are 20 has far fewer possible negative consequences than launching one when you are 40 and have children to feed. Travel. As the demands of your career increase and you start having commitments (relationships, children, etc.), finding time and money to travel is harder. It's better to travel on the cheap when you are young than to wait until you are retired. Invest in yourself. Learning, developing skills, and getting an education will pay dividends to you later.
