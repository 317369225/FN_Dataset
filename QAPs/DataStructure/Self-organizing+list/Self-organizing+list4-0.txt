What are some of the most important algorithms used in quantitative trading?
I do not believe that there are specific algorithms for quantitative trading, rather there are modeling methodologies.  For instance you can use a hidden Markov model of stock price movements, which extends Brownian motion models.  Brownian motion based models of asset pricing extend the fixed period mean/covariance models such as APT. Successful quantitative strategies consist of creating models that can represent statistical relationships that exist in market behavior, finding these relationships and exploiting them for the purpose of achieving a higher rate of return.  If you know for instance that a stock's price movement after controlling for covariance with the market portfolio is well modeled by Brownian random motion in a potential, then you can quantify the notion that the stock's price varies randomly but regresses to a mean. On a short time scale if the stock price was lower than the value it tends to vary around, you could buy the stock under the model's assumption that with high probability the stock price would eventually pass some higher threshold in the future.  These models can get very complicated and have few analytical results that are useful, therefore empirical methods such as Monte Carlo simulation under  a model often seem to be used, especially in options trading. Aside from arbitrage opportunities created by high frequency trading, quantitative trading consists of creation of models of market behavior and using these models to predict the results of specific investments and use this information to select an allocation of resources. There are different approaches however, for instance www.jair.org/media/1336/live-1336-2275-jair.pdf See the table on page 558 (pdf page 10)
