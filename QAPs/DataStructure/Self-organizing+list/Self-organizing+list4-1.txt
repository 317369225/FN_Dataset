What are some of the most important algorithms used in quantitative trading?
Here are some that come to mind, this list is not even close to being exhaustive. Machine Learning/Statistical Classification Neural Network - Backpropagation, Hopfield net, Perceptron, Pulse-coupled neural networks, Radial basis function network, Self-organization map Association Rule Algos for finding relationships when data mining The Expectation Maximization Algorithm Monte Carlo (there are many variations) Mathematical Optimization Algos (there are tons of them) Others relating to the software development components include distributed systems algos, memory allocation algos, and network algos.
