What's the correlation between complexity and consciousness?
In brief: complexity is necessary but not sufficient for consciousness. Some would say that complexity necessarily produces some consciousness, but I believe that theory (panpsychism) does not hold up in the face of our considerable collective knowledge about how brain function relates to our reported experiences. Consciousness is used to name several different things, and that's one reason people tend to think it's such a tough topic. It's important to ask yourself exactly what you mean by consciousness: Do you mean any awareness (ability to report and use) of what information is passing through one's own mind? Then read Consciousness Explained and The User Illusion. Do you mean exactly the sort of awareness we humans have? Then read Tononi and Edelman, or better yet, read Dehaene and Naccache's 2001 article 'toward a cognitive neuroscience of consciousness...' Good luck; I think the answer is pretty straightforward, but obscured by philosophers not bothering with the science and assuming they know enough, and scientists similarly not bothering with the philosophy and jumping to conclusions. You didn't ask what consciousness is, but I'm going to answer anyway: it's a process in which an extremely complex representation of the state of things can be replayed and compared to past representations of other states of things. There are a lot of specific brain mechanisms/information flow properties/psychological mechanisms that make it exactly what it is for humans, but at core, our sense that it's "like" something ineffable and rich is about that ability to compare rich representations in many directed ways.
