Career Advice:Â Embedded systems or VLSI design?
I dont have much idea on how ur career path will be if you choose VLSI, but I definetly feel choosing embedded system will give u a good knowledge on hardware software interfacing(which in my opinion is more important and interesting) this also give good oppurtunity in learning about electronics in general. I feel there are good oppurtunities for embedded and suites best for ur preconditions
