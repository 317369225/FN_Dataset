What's the best way to manage Spotify playlists?
I listen to a lot of new music, and to full albums, so I massively use full album playlists, turning the left area in a sort of self organized library (sometimes by year, sometimes by genre, sometimes by the gnomes in my mind). On top of the list I have a heavy rotation playlist that I fill on a day by day basis ("current obsessions") and the public playlists I use the most to see what's new ("new albums on spotify", We Are Hunted, and Drowned In Sound's playlists).
