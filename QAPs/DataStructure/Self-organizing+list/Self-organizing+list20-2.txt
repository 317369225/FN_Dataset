Imagine that "Planet, Inc." were an organization charged with securing the survival and development of the human race and you were the CEO. What issues would you put on your agenda for the 21st century? How would you prioritize them? How would you go about addressing them in practice?
If you want to figure out how best to ensure the survival of the human race in the long term (1000+ years), I think the most important question is definitional; i.e., what is the essence of the human race that we want to preserve. For instance, we’re wired with instincts toward violence and tribal loyalty that make perfect sense in hunter gatherer societies, but not in a globally integrated world with nuclear weapons.  We could alter these instincts through germ-line genetic engineering, but then are we helping the human race or eradicating it?  Similarly, our prospects for survival are enhanced greatly if we give up these bodies and become information running on more durable material substrates.  But would such a transformation be in service to humanity? We don’t even have a good vocabulary or framework to discuss these options.  So as CEO of Planet Inc, my number one task would be to facilitate a conversation to converge on a long-term vision for humanity.
