Who is your favorite Fields Medal winner?
I personally like Ed Witten.  However, I'm a physicist and Witten is the only physicist to ever win the Fields Medal.  Witten helped show that the methods of quantum field theory not only provide interesting mathematical problems, but that the calculational methods developed for quantum field theory can be useful in mathematics.
