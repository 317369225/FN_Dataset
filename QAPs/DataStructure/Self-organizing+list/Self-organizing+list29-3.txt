Are people using Asana as a personal organizer/to-do list tool?
Asana has become my default and only personal to-do manager. It fits my model nicely of logging everything, us as: All the important household tasks Personal projects Research items for my kids Things to read up and learn related to work Subjects I want to learn more about personally DIY tasks around the house Etc. There are many different approaches to using contexts to help categorise all of this, and so far the following has worked well for me:Â  Thinking / Full Focus Hanging Around / Brain Dead Learn Hack All of the above is possible using pretty much any GTD tool, or just a notepad and pen. I prefer Asana because of its easy email integration and generally slick application.
