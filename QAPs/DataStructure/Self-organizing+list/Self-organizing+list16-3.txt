What were the greatest (both well and least understood) leaps in evolution?
The greatest leap occured 2 B years ago when a bacteria swallowed another giving rise to eukaryotes (any lifeforms other than bacteria and virus) and the explosion of life as we know it. Lynn Margulis suffered derisions and scorns for several decades for hypothesizing endosymbiosis until the discovery of mitochondria within our cells and their distinct set of genes. To understand life, why we have two sexes, aging, disease, health... one needs to become a mitochondriac. A good place to start is Nick Lane's last 3 books. He's currently a prof. of biology at UCL, Univ. College of London.
