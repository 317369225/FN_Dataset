Imagine that "Planet, Inc." were an organization charged with securing the survival and development of the human race and you were the CEO. What issues would you put on your agenda for the 21st century? How would you prioritize them? How would you go about addressing them in practice?
Education. Nothing would happen unless people are educated enough to understand the problem and support the necessary solutions. Global warming wouldn't even be a debatable issue if there weren't so many stupid influential people. The disease that is organized religion (not necessarily faith) would also slowly disappear. All countries would eventually resemble places like Sweden, the Netherlands and Finland.
