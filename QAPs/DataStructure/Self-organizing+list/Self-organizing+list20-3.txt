Imagine that "Planet, Inc." were an organization charged with securing the survival and development of the human race and you were the CEO. What issues would you put on your agenda for the 21st century? How would you prioritize them? How would you go about addressing them in practice?
The goal is maximising happiness for everyone.  The virtues are the means for maximising happiness.  The most neglected virtue is justice, specifically income justice.  Income injustice causes 99% of the violence in the world and 99% of other, lesser problems.  Violence includes war, civil war, revolution, and crime.  We have super-extreme income injustice, incomes from 0.5c an hour to $5,000,000 an hour; that is, $10 a year to $10,000,000,000 a year.  Violence pollution is the biggest cause of unhappiness.   Limiting maximum income to $50 an hour will end violence, poverty and millions of other, offshoot problems.  But can people wake up to this greatest of problems?  They are too busy trying to make their way, trying to get as much income as possible for themselves.  Everyone is just grabbing as much as they can, because everyone else is doing the same.  And this is violence.  Can we all stop, and set the maximum income, so everyone gets fair shares, and end the violence in time?  We have the weaponry to freeze the whole planet dead (nuclear winter).  Will we be smart enough to wake up to the great danger, or will we puddle on in our little lives, refusing to see the big picture?
