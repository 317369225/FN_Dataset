What are the open topics in computer wireless networks?
Far, far too many to list. Power reduction (battery life) and power scavenging Improved spectral efficiency (speed, capacity) Improved user density in cells (like the wild stuff at Artemis Networks) Use of radio whitespace (cognitive radio) Self organizing meshes (with low power use) Identity Roaming and Billing (OSS),  Imagine life without annoying intercept proxies. Security of peer to peer communications (like AirDrop, only universal) Establishing relationships with wireless nodes (intelligent roads, vehicle to vehicle, enhanced retain experiences) Peer and resource discovery while preserving privacy Privacy, in general. Extremely high bandwidth in short ranges (think DVI and SATA replacement) And much, much more.  Leaf through IEEE Wireless Communications to see the kinds of topics under current research.
