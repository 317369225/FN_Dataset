What could a 20-year-old do to potentially improve their quality of life further down the line?
I am 25. And three years ago I formed this guiding principle for my daily life, in addition to, and in order to fuel a sustainable effort for my long-term goals: Heart Nurture your relationships. Family, friends, significant other, colleagues, acquaintances. Make time for a healthy social life. Volunteer. Give. Facebook moderately. Make new friends. Smile at the cashier, barista, librarian, janitor :) Mind Stay creative. Don't allow any situation to keep you in a rut. Develop your skills and seek out new ones, too. And, as already mentioned, you should be the one to benefit from your work (per Cyril). If you're a coder, learn something that requires manual dexterity. If you have two left feet, dance with them! Quora moderately. Seek like-minded peers. Work on your weaknesses a bit just to gain perspective, but play up your strengths. Body Eat healthy. Exercise everyday. Play sports. Sleep well. Laugh. Heartily. Learn to cook. Get off the computer/tablet/smartphone and into your sneakers! Soul Have a healthy regard for the things that transcend the human mind and the physical world. This way, you'll be stronger in facing uncertainties pushed to you or risks you'd need to take in order to grow. I'm a Christian, so maintaining a personal relationship with God would be how I'll invest in this aspect. Wallet Yes, you need to earn a living. If your money job (per Tiana) isn't your passion, hustle during your free time. Hustle. Brush up on personal finance. Regularly set aside cash for long term investments and don't touch it! Let it grow for the next 30-40 years. Of course, don't be stingy. Enjoy your income and reward yourself reasonably. Easier said than done, yes. But each time I find myself on an uneven keel and losing my bearings a bit, I look back and try to see which "baskets" I have neglected. Sometimes you do need to take from one basket to put into another.
