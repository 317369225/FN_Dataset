What are some funny and idiotic logics of Bharatiya Janata Party supporters?
Mostly people put postscripts. But I have to put a pre-script here , (in case the word exists) As I have got a yet another amazing example, and this one came from no one other that Mr. Narendra Modi himslef. In his playfulness with words , he went way too far and declared Arvind Kejriwal to be an Pakistani agent. And the proof that he gave was that a map on AAP's website has given Kashmir to pakistan. . Kejriwal feted in Pak, his aides Pak agents: Narendra Modi in Jammu . Now it was surely not something that you expect from a person who is aspiring to be the prime-minister of the country. But, I would love to analyze his comment with facts - . 1.The website he talked about is not AAP's official website, but a website developed by an individual developer ( Check yourself Aam Aadmi Party Donation Trends) . 2. Anyways that website is run by an AAP member, so lets not leave the cynicism for now. So the question is that did the website show a map in which it gave Kashmir to Pakistan. Well, it showed a map of India in which POK was not shown as part of India. . 3. So, does it mean it was done intentionally to support Pakistan. Now, this is funny, because anyone who has spent some time on internet can see that the website was using Google maps to show their donations, while clearly saying that the map shows the density of the donation that they received from different places. And if you are using Google maps, it automatically shows the map that google stores on their servers. And as a matter of fact, google, wikipedia and many other sites don't show POK as Indian territory, which is a long known controversy. . 4. So, are they the only people to use this map. This is the most interestng part, while making such stupid allegations against Kejriwal & AAP, Mr. Modi forgot to look at BJP's own website, which ironically uses same google maps. Now is BJP going to gift Kashmir to Pakistan. According to Modi's logic, it's 100% sure. . AAP hits back at BJP on Kashmir map issue . Nothing can be more embarrassing for BJP than watching all their stupid and baseless allegations firing back on themselves, and specially when this time it came directly from their prime-ministerial candidate Modi Ji, and not from some random member of their IT team, or one of their spoke-person.  ################################################################ . ################################################################ And then the one about AAP being agent of Ford Foundation because his NGO once received donation from them. . Tighten your seat-beltsguys , as it's a long story. And I'm providing proofs from official sources wherever necessary. Some parts below are my own research and rest is taken from different sources. . Ford Foundation is an organisation which gives grants to many government/non-government organisations and individuals under many categories. Their every grant can be seen on their website and annual reports. All the hoax being spread about his donation to AAP is based on the fact that they gave a donation to an NGO Kabir some years back in which Kejriwal used to work, this NGO used to work on the aim of telling people about RTI, and how to use it to expose corruption. It may sound anti-national to those who think stopping government from doing corruption is anti-national. . Now lets come to funny part of this conspiracy theory. People telling this story try to make you believe that taking money from Ford Foundation means that you are a CIA agent. Now this claim is so baseless but spicy that it will make you feel like James Bond, the moment you hear it. But the truth is that Ford has been giving grants to 100s of Government / Non-Government projects in India for years , including many welfare schemes, including many IITs, AIMS and IIMs. . Now as this theory has been spread mainly by BJP IT cell, so I would like to turn the light to their own prime-ministerial candidate Modi Ji. Many projects running in Gujrat, which are in fact being run by Gujrat Govt are taking funds from Ford foundation. Including some NGOs and also many government projects started in rule of Modi Ji, with involvement of Ford foundation directly or by providing grants. . Ford Foundation has worked on many projects in Gujarat. Read and and : tterIndia . Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India (EDII) . Participatory Rural Appraisal Methods in South Gujarat, India . http://www.fordfoundation.org/grants/grantdetails... . Foundation for Ecological Security . Now I was not trying to imply anything here, because I'm not one of the "BJP's Conspiracy Theory Maker". As far as I know, lots of International organisations give grants to many NGOs or governments. And that's what Ford Foundation claims to be their dream. See :  Ford Foundation . There's nothing "James Bond" thing from my side to "Find This Out", until I came across this news. . Gujarat PSUs gave undue benefits to business houses: CAG | PTI | Tehelka.com . Now this is something interesting. When Ford Foundation grants some money to Arvind Kejriwal's NGO Kabir to support the cause of telling people about RTI, then Kejriwal himself and then AAP which was formed few years after the grant, automatically becomes the agent of Ford, or in fact proxy plan of CIA to de-destabilize India. Not to forget they have not been found out to have benefited Ford in any way. . Then what would be the wise words that they will use for Mr. Modi himself, who has been the head of government which has been heavily funded by Ford Foundation in many of it's projects, also some projects that he is never tired of talking about. And also CAG has accused their PSUs to have been unduly benefited a branch of Ford in Gujarat. Now, the question is that how those "bad people" in Ford tried to use our Modi Ji this time by giving him much more money than they gave to Kejriwal's NGO, and what were their "dangerous plans" with the involvement of CIA ? And who is the bigger agent now ? . I know many people will say that it's not Modi himself who is doing so, may be some NGO in Gujarat did so, or may be some government officer did so. Well that sounds fair enough. But then I would like to mention something that I had saved for the end: Narendra Modi too accepted money from Ford Foundation but AAP doesn't scream CIA / Foreign hand Indian Exponent . And here I'm not providing fake screenshots like you might have seen in the conspiracy theories you have seen earlier, but genuine links from Ford's official reports. . Grants Report 2002 of Ford Foundation http://www.fordfoundation.org/pd... . On page 42 of the above report, there will be a declaration of grant to Gujarat Ecological Educational & Research (GEER) foundation. GEER foundation, which is headed by Modi Ji, has received $ 122,000 from Ford foundation. Introduction | About us | GEER Foundation . Again, On page 89 of the Ford Foundation list of grantees , there is another recipient of their grant, the Gujarat Institute of Development Research (GIDR). The grant was for $197,759 The Financial advisor to GIDR is none other than the Department of Education, Government of Gujarat, Gandhinagar. Check the link of their official website GIDR . This much is only from 2002's Grant list of Ford Foundation. And there are many more in the list if you check out the Grant lists of other years, so what is cooking between Modi Ji and Ford Foundation (equivalent to CIA according to Modi supporters) . PS : I'm not trying to say that Modi Ji is an agent of Ford Foundation. Because he is not the only one to accept these grants. There is hardly any state which has not taken their grant, but it doesn't make any one of them agent of CIA. But this was spread about Kejriwal, this is how conspiracy theories work. They tell you something obvious in such a way that if you don't know the facts, you feel as if something big is cooking somewhere. Updated 96w ago • View Upvotes
