Why do conversations with influencers matter?
We all have the opportunity to become influencers . The key is to interact with people. Pushing your message out via services Friendfeed or through automated tweets , collecting followers like you collect stamps may provide a temporary buzz but it will not reap long term rewards. Building relationships with the people who excel in your own or related fields is the better way to network . Listen to people , read and digest what they say, help them and in return they will not only remember you but will return the attention you paid to them many fold. The equation is simple .. make yourself known for being knowledgeable and helpful, and over time your own influence will grow. Above all, do not chase the numbers, follow the fun. PS Philip and I connected via Twitter many moons ago, made it onto each others Twitter lists and kept in regular touch since - helping each other without fear of reward on many occasions.
