What's the correlation between complexity and consciousness?
Opposite to Yohan's (very nice) answer, I would not throw integrated information away. (Kolmogorov complexity has little to do, in my opinion, with consciousness. It cannot be univocally measured, it's a great concept, but is almost a property of the observer.) Complexity and information are strongly related: they are the opposite. The more information you store in a network –like the brain– the more complex (less random) the network will be. The ability to store information is a fundamental property of consciousness. Without going into the details of Tononi's article, every one would agree that a brain which cannot retain information is not conscious. Following Yohan when he says: "Consciousness seems pretty organized", it derives that organisation is a fundamental property of consciousness. But organisation shows itself as complexity. The more organised a system, the more complex. Sometimes, network stores too much information and the organisation –the complexity– is nothing more than a memory of the past. A dead brain remains "complex", an old company retains complex bureaucracy without being able to learn... In conclusion, consciousness always produces complexity, but complexity does not always produce consciousness.
