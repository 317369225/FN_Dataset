How does one get invited to speak at TED?
I think it's important to clarify that there are multiple TED events and different types of speakers at each event.  TED officially sponsored conferences (includes TED in Long beach, TEDGlobal, occasional conferences like TEDIndia and TEDAfrica)  These conferences are curated by the TED team.  They look for speakers who are the best at what they do who fit into the theme of the conference that year. TEDU - TED U are mini speaker sessions that are given by TED conference attendees.  These are typically 3-10 min presentation about anything the attendee wants to talk about.  It can be a topic they're an expert or something random like to how to make cheese.  Attendees are asked to submit topics proposals before the conference and the TED team picks a subset of the topics. TEDx - TEDx conferences are mini TED conferences organized by passionate viewers of Ted.com and TED attendees.  The speakers are curated by the organizers of the conference and it most likely depends on how local the speaker is and what the organizers want to focus on for that particular TEDx event.
