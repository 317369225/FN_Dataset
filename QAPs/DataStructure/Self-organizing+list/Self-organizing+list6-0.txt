What are some good ideas for interesting physics-related simulations to code as a side project?
Taking cues from Inna's answer, I would like to suggest a simple lattice model to study some key characteristics of protein folding using MC/Self-avoiding walk.  You can start with a basic system and add complexities as you progress. Assumptions: Each residue is represented by a monomeric bead of uniform size, and can only occupy positions in the defined lattice. * All bond lengths are the same. Simplified energy function** * you can start with one bead representing the backbone of the residue and then increase resolution by representing a side chains. ** you can play with just LJ interactions and then add in electrostatics Even though lattice models are utterly simplistic and no where close to real systems, they can be used to beautifully explain some key concepts in protein folding. Method: Define a lattice, you can start with 2D and then move on to 3D.  Chose a sequence for the biopolymer, you can start with patterning hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) beads (and then move on to adding charges). One of the simplest models is the HP model. In the HP model, the energy contribution of contact between two hydrophobic monomers is -1 and 0 otherwise. [math]H= \sum_{i<j}E_{p_{i}p_{j}}\delta(r_{i}-r_{j})[/math] [math]\delta(r_{i}-r_{j})[/math] is 1 when [math]r_{i}[/math] and [math]r_{j}[/math] are adjacent non-bonded nearest neighbors and 0 otherwise. Use Metropolis Monte Carlo Method to minimize energy function.

Figure 2: HPNX model : Page on oxfordjournals.org You can explore different patterning and lengths (there is a length effect), change the energy function to include more interactions, add in effect of solvent and even write a short discontinuous molecular dynamics code For further reading: Page on chem.utoronto.ca Protein folding in the hydrophobic-hydrophilic (HP) model is NP-com...
