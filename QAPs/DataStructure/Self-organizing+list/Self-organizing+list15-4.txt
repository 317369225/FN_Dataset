How does one get invited to speak at TED?
I can't speak for the organizers of the TED Conference, but as a TEDx organizer, it was completely random.  I organized TEDxBerkeley on the UC Berkeley campus, so we got a lot of speaker referrals by fellow students and professors. Bradley Voytek in fact was referred by a random connection with no affiliation with the University.  It just so happened that his field of expertise (neuroscience + brains) was something that fit well into our theme. Having past speaking experience is also pretty important.  We asked that all speakers send a video of past performances, we called up references to see what they thought of the speaker, among other things you would do to evaluate a job candidate.  I have a feeling that the main TED Conference isn't too different.
