What are some books about everything?
I agree with the above suggestions of Connections, by James Burke (the TV series is also very good, and can be found online) and A Short History of Nearly Everything, by Bill Bryson (one of my favourite writers). To those I would add: The Ascent of Man, by Jacob Bronowski - the history of human civilization, with particular emphasis on scientific discoveries and technological inventions that had a dramatic impact on human culture, commerce and politics. (The original TV series, by the BBC, is one of the best documentary series of all time, and is avaialble as a DVD box set.) Guns, Germs and Steel, by Jared Diamond - a fascinating account of the rise of European civilization to global technological, economic and cultural dominance during the second millennium as a result of various accidents of geography.
