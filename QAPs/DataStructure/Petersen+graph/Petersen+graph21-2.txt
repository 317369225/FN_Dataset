What is the relationship between systems biology and computational biology?
Prospective graduate student here. Systems biology seems to be more about graph theory and modeling, whereas computational biology is more about running and analyzing experiments. Systems biology pieces together a map from DNA to protein to phenotypic effect, and so is more theoretical, developing hypotheses about unrecognized biological pathways that happen to be leading to some sort of curious reaction to stimulus. Computational biology is more about programming, and maybe building and testing differential equation models for a few specific enzyme balances at a time. I think graduate programs in either would overlap a lot, and the choice of name seems kind of arbitrary. Bioinformatics on the third hand is even more programming, and relates a lot to typical big data work. You'll be managing computer networks and optimizing load-sharing and working on databases. Check out the Coursera specialization in Systems Biology, it's offered by the Icahn School of Medicine in New York City, which is nineteenth in the world or something for Systems Biology. Coursera Cheers and good luck! :) -Matthew
