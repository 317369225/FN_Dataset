What's the most beautiful graph you have ever seen?
If you allow infinite graphs and relax the geometric pattern bit (ok maybe I'm stretching it a bit here), the Rado graph. This  is a countably infinite graph with the interesting property that for  every pair of disjoint finite subsets X and Y of the vertex set, there  is a vertex which has an edge to every element of X and no edge to any  element of Y. Some interesting consequences: This is the only such graph, upto isomorphism. Any finite modification of the graph (adding/deleting finitely many vertices or edges) results in an isomorphic graph. Suppose  we construct a random graph on countably infinitely many vertices, by  choosing for every pair of vertices u and v, whether there is an edge  between them or not with probability p and 1-p respectively, with all  choices independent, for a fixed 0 < p < 1. Then almost surely  (with probability 1), the resulting graph is isomorphic to the Rado  graph.
