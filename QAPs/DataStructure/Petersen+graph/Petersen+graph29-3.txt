What are some of the best 10-year old textbooks that Springer has just made free to read?
To be honest, it really depends on a field of study you would like to do. I would really recommend adding a little more information in the description of your question. In the meanwhile, select a topic and then search for good books. Even if they are not Springer books, you can probably get them at the Imperial Library of Trantor or Jotunbane's Reading Club. Don't stop reading !
