What tools do hiring managers use for recruiting?
Traditional recruitment approaches, such as resumes, interviews and references checks can be subjective and misleading. Recruitment managers are increasingly turning to objective candidate evaluation tools that allow more accurate hiring decisions. Such tools can be used to automatically assess candidates based on challenges posed by the system, or by evaluating publically accessible online profiles. There are, for example, tools that assess coders based on programming challenges. Two examples are CoderCred and HackerRank.Â  Gild is an aggregator of social profiles. These and other web based tools are beginning to change the way recruiters make hiring decisions.
