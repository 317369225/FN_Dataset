Theoretical Computer Science: At 27, am I too old to learn advanced Mathematics?
Of course not.  The lovely thing about Maths is that if you are willing to be critical and like "breaking ideas" and dissecting them, you'll be fine.  There's no evidence that at 27 you can't.  To be a successful researcher in an area, you have to be willing to learn if a field evolves in that direction.  For example, I'm doing my PhD in CS Theory right now, I'm 26, and have had to learn quite a bit of maths in the past year to come up with my latest results.  I'm expecting to do this as I need to, and that's fine.  That's what a good researcher does.  It's never too late until you decide it is.  Don't, keep learning for life, and don't let it intimidate you.  It can be daunting but take your time. :)
