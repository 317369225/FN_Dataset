What are some predictions or notions that the Petersen graph disproves?
The game of Cops and Robbers The famous thief, Bobby McRob has just robbed the central bank of the island Malta. The Chief Sheriff immediately jumps into his car, and the two embark on a wild car chase. Both cars have the same speed, and both are equipped with a fancy radar, so that they always know where the other person is. The goal of the sheriff is to catch the robber, and the robber wins if he can elude the sheriff indefinitely. Can the robber choose his route to always escape the sheriff, or can the sheriff force him into a corner and catch him eventually? What if we have two cooperating cops chasing the robber? Or three? Formally, the game goes as follows. We are given a graph G (the streets of Malta in the above), and we have two players: one player controls some number k of cops  and the other player controls the robber. First, the cops occupy some vertices of the graph, where more than one cop may occupy the same vertex. Then the robber, being fully aware of the cops' choices, chooses a vertex for himself. Afterwards the cops and the robber move in alternate rounds, with cops going first. At each step any cop or robber is allowed to move along an edge of G or remain stationary. The cops win if at some time there is a cop at the same vertex as the robber; otherwise, i.e., if the robber can elude the cops indefinitely, the robber wins. At any time in the game, all players are aware of the position of everyone else. The minimum number of cops for which there is a winning strategy, no matter how the robber plays, is called the cop number of G, and is denoted by c(G). Note that if initially we place a cop on every vertex of G then the cops will win in the first round, and hence c(G) is well-defined. Examples The path. If G is the path of length n, then one cop can win easily. Put the cop anywhere, and just keep moving towards the robber. Eventually the robber gets caught, so [math]c(P_n)=1[/math]. The complete graph. If [math]G=K_n[/math] the complete graph on n vertices, one cop can win: we put the cop anywhere, and catch the robber in our first move. So [math]c(K_n)=1[/math]. The tree. The cop starts anywhere, and just keeps moving towards the robber. It is not hard to see that eventually the robber will get caught. So one cop is enough, and so [math]c(G)=1[/math]. The cycle. Suppose [math]G=C_5[/math], the 5-cycle. If we use only one cop, then the robber can evade us forever by keeping a  distance of 2 from us (i.e. by always staying on the other side of the pond). Two cops however are clearly enough. Just put both cops on the same starting vertex, and let one of them move clockwise, the other anticlockwise. The robber will get caught in at most two rounds. So [math]c(C_5)=2[/math]. Similarly we conclude that [math]c(C_n)=2[/math] for any [math]n\geq4[/math]. An optimistic prediction. In all the above examples, we needed only one or two cops. Is there a graph for which we need three cops? Maybe two cops are always enough for any (connected) graph G? Two cops do not always suffice. Let G be the Petersen graph. If there are only two cops chasing the robber, then at any point in the game the robber can move to a vertex that has no cops in its neighbourhood. Why can the robber always do this? A simple proof goes as follows: The Petersen graph has no 3-cycles and 4-cycles in it, so a single cop can only control one neighbour of the robber. Every vertex has three neighbours.However, three cops are clearly enough - indeed, one can initially place the three cops in such a way that every vertex has a cop sitting in its neighbourhood. Hence, [math]c(P)=3[/math]. (In fact, the Petersen graph is the smallest graph that requires three cops.) It is probably not too surprising now that there are graphs for which 3, 10, or even 10000 cops are not enough. This problem has received quite a lot of interest in the past 20 years. Most of the research in this area revolves around Meyniel's conjecture, that roughly goes as follows: Meyniel's conjecture: If G is a connected graph on n vertices, then [math]\sqrt{n}[/math] cops are enough to catch the robber. We are incredibly far away from solving this. In fact, we don't even know that [math]n^{0.999}[/math] cops are enough!
