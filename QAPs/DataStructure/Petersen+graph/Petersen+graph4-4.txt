What are some iconic mathematical images?
Pál Erdős explaining a problem involving some sequence of integers and a squarefree number n to a 10 year-old Terence Tao at the University of Adelaide in 1985. This image captures the intergenerational and cross-continental spirit of mathematics, which is simultaneously ancient, contemporary and timeless. (source: Terence Tao) The Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions to the Lorenz system (a set of three ordinary differential equations), which, when plotted, resemble a figure eight or wings of a butterfly. This system (a.k.a the Lorenz equations) was developed by Edward Norton Lorenz in 1963 to model atmospheric convection.

Its negative resolution by Leonhard Euler in 1735 laid the foundations of graph theory and prefigured the idea of topology. The city of Königsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) was set on both sides of the Pregel River, and included two large islands which were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem was to find a walk through the city that would cross each bridge once and only once. The islands could not be reached by any route other than the bridges, and every bridge must have been crossed completely every time; one could not walk halfway onto the bridge and then turn around and later cross the other half from the other side (the walk need NOT start and end at the same spot). Euler proved that the problem has no solution. The Penrose polygons are standard examples of Impossible objects: Triangle   Square Pentagon Hexagon Octagon
