What is the process tea goes through from the plant to be ready to be used?
First, there is no "simple" picking. The best teas are picked by hand. In Chinese tea, quality green and white tea is picked solely in the spring to select only immature small leaves and buds. (Cheap teas are harvested by machines similar to power hedge clippers available at Home Depot etc. in a process that crushes and tears the leaves.) Oolong and black teas are generally made with more mature leaves. The main remaining steps are withering, oxidation and drying. Green tea is typically withered in the sun for several hours and then dried with heat, which results in minimal enzyme oxidation. White tea is produced by a somewhat similar process but is dried at lower temperatures, which changes its taste and its anti-oxidant composition. Oolong teas are partially oxidized, then dried with heat. Black teas are fully oxidized then dried.
