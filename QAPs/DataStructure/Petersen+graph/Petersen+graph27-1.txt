Is IPL and other T20 formats of cricket spoiling Indian Cricket future? Whether average play time of players decreasing due to this?
No. Similar doubts arose when the ODI format was at its beginning. It has only increased the capacity of players to adjust to the format. If T20 is spoiling cricket then you can't find bowlers like Ravichandran Ashwin who is excelling in all formats. Nor can you find batsmen like AB de Villiers who is playing according to the format.
