Is the United States' justice system flawed considering that the U.S. makes up less than 5% of the world population and yet almost 1/4 of all inmates in the world are in the U.S.?
The biggest reason for our prison population is actually because the US sits in the "middle ground" between cruelty and softness when it comes to prisons, which gives us a lot more "lifers" than the rest of the world. In the nations more barbaric than the US, many of the "lifers" are executed quickly instead of kept in prison for life. The prisoners the US does execute spend a long time in jail before their execution (20 years is common). By comparison, many first world nations don't sentence that many people to life in prison. They don't have "three strikes" laws like many US states do, and prison sentences are lighter for all crimes in Europe. So basically: Europe keeps people in prison for less time for the same crimes than the US. Non-European nations execute people quickly so they don't spend as much time in prison.
