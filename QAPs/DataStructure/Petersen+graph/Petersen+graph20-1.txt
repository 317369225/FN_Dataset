Is there some connection between a regular and a planar graph?
A 1-regular graph has n disjoint edges on 2n vertices, and is always planar. A 2-regular graph is a disjoint union of cycles, and is always planar. A d-regular graph is never planar for d > 5, as a planar graph on n vertices has at most 3n-6 edges. For all n > 1, there exists a 3-regular planar graph on 2n vertices. For n=2, [math]K_4[/math] is the only such graph. For n=3, the prism graph [math]Y_3[/math] (triangle inside larger triangle with corresponding vertices joined) is the only such graph. Since every even number greater than 2 can be written as a non-negative integer linear combination of 4 and 6, disjoint copies of [math]K_4[/math] and [math]Y_3[/math] will give planar 3-regular graphs on 2n vertices for all n > 1. For all n > 2, there exists a 3-regular non-planar graph on 2n vertices. For n=3, [math]K_{3,3}[/math] is the only such graph. For n=4, the Wagner graph (octagon with four diagonals joining pairs of antipodal points) is an example. Since every even number greater than 10 can be written as a non-negative integer linear combination of 6 and 8, disjoint copies of [math]K_{3,3}[/math] and the Wagner graph will give non-planar 3-regular graphs on 2n vertices for all n > 5. For n=5, the Petersen graph is an example. Analogous results hold even with the additional requirement of connectedness, and also for 4-regular and 5-regular graphs.
