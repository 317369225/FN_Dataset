What is a good tool to compare scatter data?
No quick way for after the fact data entry that I am aware of, but you can easily manually enter and organize the data In an Excel spreadsheet and use the built in stats functions like calculating correlation coefficients. And you can use the insert chart function to create a scatter plot graph of data from arrays you select from your worksheet. It is quick and easy once all your data is entered. It even allows you to add in a least squares regression line that is placed automatically if you select that option.Â  This will provide an excellent visual representation of any trends in the data over time.
