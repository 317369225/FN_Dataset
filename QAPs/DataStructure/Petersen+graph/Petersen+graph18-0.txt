What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
When I was about 18 a schoolteacher pointed out to us that you can treat the differential operator [math]{d\over dx}[/math] like a variable. So if you write [math]D={d\over dx}[/math] then you can, for example, interpret [math](D^2+1)f(x)[/math] as [math]f''(x)+f(x)[/math]. But then I had the way out idea of not just forming polynomials in [math]D[/math] but also transcendental functions. Eventually I tried [math]\exp(D)f(x)[/math] for various functions [math]f[/math] and realised I was getting [math]f(x+1)[/math]. I was completely blown away. You could shift functions by exponentiating a differential operator. I thought that exponentiating such a thing would give complete nonsense but it didn't. Turns out Oliver Heaviside had been making use of this well over a century ago and Boole had documented it even earlier. And I just discovered page 343 of this book from the 18th century: http://books.google.com/books?id... It also turns out that this is important in quantum mechanics and having played with these operators before ever studying QM gave me a head start. I also found countless ways to use this approach to solving many problems in differential equations - many of them not in standard textbooks. So my discovery may have been old, but it was really useful to have discovered it for myself. I recently heard that the teacher who taught us the idea of treating [math]{d\over dx}[/math] as a variable was knocked off his bicycle and killed. That makes me sad. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ope... Updated: 17 to 18. I remember now that this was the extra school term we had as preparation for Oxbridge entrance exams.
