Is the United States' justice system flawed considering that the U.S. makes up less than 5% of the world population and yet almost 1/4 of all inmates in the world are in the U.S.?
Of course it is flawed! It is made up of flawed people. The are huge problems with access to justice, wrongful convictions, the School-to-Prison Pipeline, racial profiling, the fact that we still implement the death penalty, and the list goes on and on. I like to put a positive spin on things, so in some ways, the number of people incarcerated can be seen as a good thing. For one, it means we aren't doing what China does and executing a bunch of people.* Two, it means that our corruption levels are low enough that many people aren't buying their way out of jail.** *Capital punishment by country **Corruption Perceptions Index - Overview
