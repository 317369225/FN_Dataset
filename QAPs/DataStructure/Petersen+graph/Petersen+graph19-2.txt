Are economic models and theories copyrighted to include in an economic textbook I'm writing?
You don't need those economists' (or their estates') permission to use their models, but you do need to cite anything you use. If you express another economist's idea in your own words, you need a citation. If you copy an economist's exact phrasing, it needs to be as a quote with the proper citation. If you reproduce a graph from another economist's work, you need to say "reproduced from ___." Just so long as you don't go as far as copying a whole section from someone else's book and sticking it between quotes, you shouldn't have a copyright problem. Academics love to be cited!
