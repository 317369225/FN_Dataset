Is the United States' justice system flawed considering that the U.S. makes up less than 5% of the world population and yet almost 1/4 of all inmates in the world are in the U.S.?
Yes, the US justice system is flawed. America incarcerates too many of its citizens, with about 1% of all adults sitting behind bars and being permanently marginalized from society. Most Americans, who value their perceived freedom more than any comparable culture, fail to understand that they are one mistake or accident or mistake away from a lengthy prison sentence. Americans not only incarcerate too many, they also sentence their citizens to extremely long sentences for marginal offences that do not exist in comparable countries. A DUI or minor drug conviction can easily turn into 5 years of you mess up your paperwork or miss a probation meeting. Only in America can a normal and average citizen be put away for years for seemingly innocuous actions that are not criminal. It will take decades to understand why America turned on itself so hard beginning in the 1990s and the prison construction boom. Millions of lives and potential have been wasted on this flawed social policy from the land of the free. I do not see any structural changes in the near future, so millions will continue to waste away in prison. Thanks for the A2A.
