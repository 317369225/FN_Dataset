Talent and HR: What are the popularly used hiring and recruitment products worldwide?
LinkedIn, although often not seen as a recruitment product but a social network, is one of the most commonly used recruitment products.  Take a look at Talent Solutions to see their offerings for recruiters, which are above and beyond those for standard members.  Because you're looking at trends in recruitment, your research would be flawed without including them. Some other vendors worth looking at include: PageUp People (PageUp People | Unified Talent Management) Taleo (http://Taleo.com) RecruitASP (http://RecruitASP.com) Kenexa (http://Kenexa.com, recently acquired by IBM) Also worth a look at some of the social sourcing products like TalentBin and SwoopTalent (http://www.swooptalent.com). Regarding psychometric assessments, take a look at the California Personality Inventory and Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. Good luck with your research!
