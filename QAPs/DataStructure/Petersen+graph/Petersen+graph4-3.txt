What are some iconic mathematical images?
This figure is taken from Jean Perrin's Mouvement brownien et réalité moléculaire dissertation (Brownian motion and molecular reality), published in 1909. The image shows the trajectories of three brownian particles that Perrin observed during his work. I think it really nicely shows the discontinuous and stochastic character of the brownian motion, that was key in Perrin's proof of the existence of atoms, no less.  This is one of the picture I always show to a non-scientist audience to illustrate the notion of thermal agitation. It's perhaps more a physical than mathematical image. However the study of brownian motion, that is rooted in experimental observation, has given birth to the field  of time-continuous stochastic processes. This very important area in mathematics has applications ranging from biology to finance. @http://hermes.ffn.ub.es/luisnava...
