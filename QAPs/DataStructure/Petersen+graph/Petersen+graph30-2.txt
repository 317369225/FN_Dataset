Mathematics: What is a good book/ set of books/ Lectures on Tensors?
Thank you for the A2A. If you "just" want an introduction starting from the very basics like Vectors , Geometrical Meaning of Dot,Cross Products and stuff and ending with Higher Rank tensors, this book by Daniel Fleisch is best for you -> http://www.amazon.in/A-Students-... (But while reading it do remember that old terms like Contravariant and Covariant Tensors are seldom used now, Covectors and One-forms have taken their place. Ahhh it's actually just a different way of saying things but yes it has a much better flavor and you will realize it's importance once you start learning General Relativity) And now for the next part of your question (Sorry, dude you can't get all the good stuffs at one place if you really want to go deep :P ) Once you progress to the next level in this wonderful game of "Learning The Facts of the Universe", you will find these books on General Relativity (They all have Beautiful and detailed Introduction to Tensors in starting chapters) to be extremely Helpful: Schutz- A First Course in GR http://www.amazon.in/A-First-Cou... Sean Carroll- Spacetime and Geometry http://www.amazon.in/Spacetime-G... P.S. Amazon links are just for your reference. You can always find their lecture notes and Pdf online.  Daniel and Carroll both of them are also Amazing Science Popularizers, you will find their Youtube Videos really useful. Do watch them :)
