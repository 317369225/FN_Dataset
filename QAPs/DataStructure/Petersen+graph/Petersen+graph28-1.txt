What is your opinion of the Indian cricket team for ICC 2015 World Cup? Is it really a blunder?
Team is never announced on the basis of big guns or their great records in past but on the basis of their present form and fitness. Yuvraj, sehwag, gambhir, and others are very good players and their achievements clearly reflects so but are they still capable of playing those mesmerising shots? And are zaheer and harbhajan still in conditions to rock the ground by their excellent bowling. Personally, zaheer is my favourite Indian bowler but he is no more fit to play. And if we talk about Yuvraj or Sehwag then they are out of form. We have better players than him, like RAYUDU. He is more deserving then Yuvraj and sehwag. Smashing centuries is ranji matches are not a big deal. The conditions of ranji games are purely opposite to that of Australia. Moreover, the selectors are professional and they would not dare to take any risk.
