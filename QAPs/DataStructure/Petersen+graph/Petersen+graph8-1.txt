Soft question: how did you learn to find counterexamples?
It's not unusual in mathematics to know something is true for an example or two, and you wonder whether it's true in general.  So you investigate "Does property P always imply property Q?"  You know it does for your examples, but is it always true? You'll do two things at once.  You'll try to prove that P implies Q, and you'll look for examples for which P is true but Q is false.  You'll see what other properties P implies.  You'll see what other properties not having Q implies. You'll work from both ends.  If you work hard enough, one of two things will happen. You'll succeed in showing that assumption that P and not Q implies a contradiction.  You've done it!  You've shown that P implies Q. You'll find a counterexample.  You've found something that has property P but doesn't have property Q. You've done it.  You've shown that P doesn't imply Q. Of course, there's a third possibility. You keep working and don't come to a conclusion. That's okay. You've probably learned something in the process.  And there's more that you can try. You could try adding another hypothesis R. See if P and R together imply Q. You'll find counterexamples in the process of trying to prove things.
