Is IPL and other T20 formats of cricket spoiling Indian Cricket future? Whether average play time of players decreasing due to this?
No, not at all because just watch the career graph of Virat Kohli form where he came from and where he is. It is totally dependent on how a player takes that and Virat Kohli is the prime example of a player who have taken most from the much criticized Indian Premier League. He was one of the player who was bought as the uncapped player, but his willingness to learn and be a improved cricketer has put him at some other level and now he is the captain of the team which bought him i.e RCB. It happened because he got the company of Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble, Mark Boucher Ross Taylor, Kevin Petersen, Dale Steyn and many others. He taken this oppurtunity to improve his game and now he is among the best players in the world. Not only Kohli but Jadeja was also the beneficiaries of this tournament, as he got the company of the likes of Shane Warne and some others. He excelled in their company and worked continuously to improve his game. So its ultimately depends on the player how they take this. I have mentioned only two names but there are many players who really made a mark because of IPL like R Ashwin, Mohit Sharma, Murli Vijay etc. It was not only about the Indian players, the foreigners too revived their career like Shane Watson, Chris Morris, David Wiese and many more. So we must not only criticize the IPL and t-20 cricket but also look in the positive side of it.
