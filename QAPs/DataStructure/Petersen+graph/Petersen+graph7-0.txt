How do I create a hyperlink in the README file in my GitHub account which would redirect to a new page containing the project explanation?
There are two ways to add a hyperlink. They are called inline and reference respectively. Inline Style Markdown: [Quora profile link for Adam D'Angelo](http://www.quora.com/Adam-DAngelo) HTML: <a href="http://www.quora.com/Adam-DAngelo">Quora profile link for Adam D'Angelo</a> Rendered: Quora profile link for Adam D'Angelo Reference Style Markdown: [Petersen Graph][reference-id-for-petersen-graph] [reference-id-for-petersen-graph]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet... HTML: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petersen_graph">Petersen Graph</a> Rendered: Petersen graph While using the Reference Style, the ideal way that I have seen is, writing all the reference id syntax at the end of your markdown. For example, the below markdown will work fine there. [text-1][ref-1] ###A heading [text-2][ref-2] [ref-1]: http://example.org [ref-2]: http://example.org By the way, this is the convention/syntax from the native markdown, but GitHub uses its own version, called GitHub Flavored Markdown, which is kind of superset to the original one. So, you're allowed to just put a link in your README file, and it should work properly. People generally prefers the inline style for links. You seems to be confused about the markdown format itself.
