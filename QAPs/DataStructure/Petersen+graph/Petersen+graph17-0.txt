What is the process tea goes through from the plant to be ready to be used?
Jon Sides gives a great overview in his answer, and I'd like to also say that these processes have tremendous depth and subtlety of skill behind them, particularly in the method of drying. The skill required to create a well roasted tea is one that is passed down for generations, and a poorly roasted tea (also *baked* or *dried with heat*) can be awful. Then of course, there are teas which aren't roasted but steamed (an alternate form of drying), mainly, Chinese teas pre-13th century and Japanese teas today (in which lives the old Chinese tradition of tea preparation by steaming rather than roasting - albeit with the modifications as it evolved over time in Japan). Finally, aside from all these processes covered by Jon, there is the final bit of processing before tea reaches the end user: storage. This is often forgotten but can be crucial particularly in the case of aged teas. Even for un-aged teas (teas meant to be consumed fresh), the care of the farmer and merchant in protecting the teas (mainly from moisture and sunlight) is highly important. Some teas are less susceptible to spoiling than others, but in general, great teas should be greatly protected from the elements. In aged teas like pu er and other fermented teas, storage becomes much more important. The method of storage significantly affects the flavour and characteristics of the tea, and improper storage can destroy the tea. Just to drive home the point, I have a tea-friend who oft says that within subcategories of tea (for example, within the Chinese oolongs from Wuyi Mountains), it is the processing more than the tea varietal which influences the taste of the final product!
