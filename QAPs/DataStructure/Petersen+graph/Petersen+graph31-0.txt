What tools do hiring managers use for recruiting?
Nowadays the fast-pace business atmosphere requires quality optimization of each employee`s workflow. This includes, of course, Hiring Managers. They need to hire fast, building an efficient candidate pipeline so that they hire the brightest minds in the shortest time frame. That`s why old means of hiring processes are inconvenient. Putting down spreadsheets,Â  screening candidates, and doing everything manually takes too much time. Working directly with Hiring Managers, my impression is that more and more of them count on online hiring tools such as Recruitee. Such tools are handy as they offer all-in-one hiring solution including screening candidates, creating a candidate pipeline, direct communication with candidates, etc. Basically everything a Hiring Manager would need within the hiring process. More alike hiring tools can be found on comparison websites like GetApp or Capterra.
