How can I use the signed constraint of the left-right planarity criterion to show a Petersen graph is not planar?
First of all, I think this paper should be of use to you: Page on arxiv.org Secondly, since the Petersen graph is vertex-transitive, you may start your Tremaux tree from any vertex you like. You'll, in fact, end up with a path linking all 10 vertices as your Tremaux tree T. You'll then need to show that no partition of the cotree edges (the edges not on the Tremaux tree) into two classes exists such that any two edges belong to a same class are T-alike and any two edges belong to different classes are T-opposite. Hope that helps.
