How does the neighborhood complex of the Petersen graph looks like?
(A2A) I'm not familiar with this subject, but I looked up "neighborhood graph" and it referred me to Lovasz's paper "Kneser's Conjecture, Chromatic Number, and Homotopy," where we find the following definition: Let G be a graph. Define the neighborhood complex N(G) as the simplicial  complex whose vertices are the vertices of G and whose simplices are those subsets of V(G) which have a common neighbor. Let's also remind ourselves what the Petersen graph looks like:   Okay, great.  Every vertex of this graph has exactly three neighbors, so no four vertices can share a common neighbor.  Therefore the largest simplices we're going to be attaching are 2-simplices, and as such the neighborhood complex itself is 2-dimensional. Since we're going to talk about vertices both of the Petersen graph and of the neighborhood complex, let's call the latter "vertices" and the former "nodes" so that things don't get too crazy. Right, so we have ten solid triangles, one corresponding to each node of the Petersen graph.  Given one of these triangles, the vertices correspond to the neighbors of the associated node, and then we just glue matching vertices and edges together.  Now each node in the Petersen graph has three neighbors, so it belongs to three of these triangles -- that is, N(G) has exactly three triangles coming together at each vertex. Moreover, if you look at the graph, you can see that none of the edges of these triangles are getting glued together.  Because of that, you can easily embed it in three-dimensional space and actually look at it, though the diagram I tried sketching out is a bit messy: I'm sure if you played with it you could find a nice symmetric realization, though. Take all that with a grain of salt, though -- I don't think I made any mistakes, but since I'm not experienced with the subject I wouldn't be as good at recognizing a mistake as an actual expert.
