Talent and HR:Â What are the popularly used hiring and recruitment products worldwide?
In my opinion it's a mixture of all. Still starting with jobboards, Business Network Research and more and more also the Social Networks. Recruiting is becoming more active - means that it's not enough to have profiles at all this platforms. Contacting potential employees will become more important (even if many recruiters hate it). During the selection process, Profile screening and structured interviews are the most used instruments (eye-to-eye, via telephone or video interviews). Assessments (on- and offline) are used from time to time (often only for specific target groups or positions). Even if it becomes more affordable than they are today I don't see that they are becoming a standard because companies are not willing to describe their positions as precise as they need to to be effective with it. And as a bonus HR guys (and Line Managers) hates eliminating the gut feeling from process ;-)
