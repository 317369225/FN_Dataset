Who has used Periscope? How would you rate this tool compared to Chartio?
I wouldn't characterize Chartio as "less sophisticated", but I agree that Chartio and Periscope are aimed at different kinds of users. Our goal is to made business intelligence as common as Excel. This means it's designed from the ground up to enable non-SQL users to analyze complex data. Unlike a lot of other tools, Chartio enables non-SQL to transform data themselves, taking a big burden off analysts and also simplifying implementation of BI in the organization. Having said that, we support SQL, and SQL users love the great-looking charts and dashboards they can create with Chartio.
