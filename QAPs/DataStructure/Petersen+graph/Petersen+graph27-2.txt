Is IPL and other T20 formats of cricket spoiling Indian Cricket future? Whether average play time of players decreasing due to this?
Surely not. In my view it is helping in developing future talent. Consider Axar Patel case, he was not known to anyone before last year IPL. He came into limelight because of his superb performance in IPL (KXIP team). He was a handy spinner in ODI now for INDIA.
