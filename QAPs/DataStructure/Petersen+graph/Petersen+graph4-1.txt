What are some iconic mathematical images?
Here are some visual representations of iconic concepts. Proof of Pythagorean Theorem as it appears in Euclid's elements: Complex unit circle, visualization of why Euler's formula is true: Fibonacci spiral: And for some iconic images of mathemeticians: Solvay conference, 1927. So much brainpower in one photograph. Planck, Einstein, etc. The famous picture of Ramanujan. I love this picture. I don't know if there's a better photo out there which captures someone doing math in their had while trying to pose for a portrait.
