What mathematical or scientific principle have you discovered on your own only to later learn it was already known?
A discussion had started with a friend, maybe because of excess of Mario! Suppose you have the game of Mario where Mario just knows how to move on a line, one step forward and backward. What would happen if Mario is taken out of the game and made to move on a very big circle in 2D space? It can still move one step forward and backward, just as it did in 1D but now this motion can in a plane. Though Mario would feel that locally he's moving on a line, but if he traversed on the circle, he would reach his starting point without having taken equivalent backward steps. Now put Mario on the globe. He can just move forward, starting from the North pole, via the South pole and would again reach the North pole, forming a circle on the sphere, by just moving forward on a line (a curved line on the sphere). Similarly, take a Mario which knows how to traverse the 2D space in the game, and then leave him on a sphere and it would traverse the 3D space, feeling as if we are moving on a plane, though this movement is different from 1D Mario's. Example, we walk on the Earth, as if we are walking on a 2D plane. So how and why is 1D Mario's movement in 2D and 3D different? How is 1D and 2D Mario's motion in 3D different? I felt that, Line : Circle :: Plane : Sphere. I realized it much later that this is what Manifolds deal with, topological spaces which are locally Euclidean. An interesting question which popped up in my head later was, since the 1D Mario can reach back to it's starting point in a 3D space by just taking forward steps on a line, why can't we reach back to our starting point in 4D spacetime in a similar way?
