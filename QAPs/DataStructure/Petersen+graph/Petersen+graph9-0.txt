What is some highly interactive software for creating and analyzing graphs (graph theory)?
Sage is what you are looking for! It is meant for much more than graph theory, but I have personally found it great for graph theory, and abstract and linear algebra (and algebraic graph theory). It is free and open-source (unlike Mathematica, which also offers very good tools for graph theory and algebra). It uses a Python-based language which is quite easy to use, and learn on-the-go if you haven't learnt Python previously. One of the best features is that it has a vast library of named graphs (and digraphs), such as the Petersen graph, and graph classes such as complete graphs, cycles, paths, etc. It also has various types of "randomly generated" graphs where you can choose the parameters (such as number of vertices, edges, etc.) This means you don't have to define a whole graph manually, using adjacency lists — you can just create a graph that's close enough to, if not exactly, what you want, and modify it as necessary (for there are multiple ways to add and remove vertices and edges). There is also a plethora of library functions to do most of the things you would want to do with graphs — compute various parameters such as order, size, connectivity, adjacency and Laplacian matrices, spectra, automorphisms, etc., and apply graph operations such as the various graph products. You can even create "interactive graphs" where you change the basic parameters using sliders and update the generated graph in real time. You can also try it out online  and see for yourself.
