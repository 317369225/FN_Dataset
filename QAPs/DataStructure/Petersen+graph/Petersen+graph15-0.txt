What are the best data sources for studying the housing bubble and potential recovery?
1. Calculated Risk 2. The Big Picture 3. AGBeat Naturally, I'm biased and added the third, but all three are cautiously optimistic whereas most are already calling housing in recovery mode... the potential recovery is a LONG way down the road, and as you likely know, we're just now weaning ourselves off of life support. I recommend those three for solid stats and legitimately uninfluenced, non-cheerleader analysis.
