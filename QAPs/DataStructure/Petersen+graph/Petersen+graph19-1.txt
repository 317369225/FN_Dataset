Are economic models and theories copyrighted to include in an economic textbook I'm writing?
If you can express the theories in your own words, its not copyright infringement. But you can't copy their exact text. Of course Fair Use (Fair Dealing in Commonwealth countries) gives exceptions to this base rule for academic use. In order to discuss the theories, copying limited portions is allowed. Be aware that fair use is a defense in court, not against being sued. But a one paragraph quote, used in an academic text, is very low risk.
