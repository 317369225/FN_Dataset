What tools do hiring managers use for recruiting?
Most hiring managers don't have the luxury of using internet tools in the candidate selection process. They are confined to using task management tools to schedule interviews, etc with their team members and of course whiteboards, post it notes and ad-hoc tools like Google docs/ collaborative writing tools for technical interviewing. For about a year now, I've noticed hiring managers and team leaders using tools like http://www.gapjumpers.me and other video interviewing technologies to evaluate applicant performance even before telephonic and in-person interviews are conducted. Hiring managers are heavily underserved by the recruitment technology industry despite the fact that their decision to hire a candidate is the most important and valuable.
