Which topic should be perfect in c to learn data structures in c?
Thanks for A2A, Venkateshwar Reddy Kakulavaram Topics of C that must be clearly understood to learn data structures are listed below: Pointer: In pointer, its not necessary to solve those problems like output of printf("%d", p++-++p+*p), etc. You must be conceptually correct about referencing and de-referencing or address operator (&) and '*'. Structure: It is also one of the mostly used component of C while constructing data structures and big applications in C. It provides binding of variable to a common variable. Functions Recursion: Most of algorithms based on tree require good amount knowledge about recursion. You must practice it to be good at it. Only theoretical knowledge is not sufficient. Pass by reference (using pointers and double pointers(in case of linked list), etc.)
