Is there any advantage to getting more than one PhD?
Harry Kloor, the first person documented as getting two simultaneous PhDs (from Purdue University, btw) has had a very successful and eclectic career.  In my discussions with him, several years ago, it sounded like some doors were opened for him because he had gotten those two degrees, but his success is more attributable to his creativity, intelligence, and drive.   Those characteristics don't come from getting a PhD, but they sure help to get a PhD if you possess them! A PhD doesn't necessarily mean mastery of a whole field.  Instead, it means that the recipient has spent a lot of time studying a particular narrow subject, becoming the world's (current) expert on that narrow topic.  It often is  a topic than only 2-3 people ever care about.  And that may be the only thing in that field that they are expert in.   A PhD doesn't necessarily mean brilliance (I  know of PhDs with no common sense or life skills), and that is a common public misconception. BTW, if you count honorary degrees, the multiple doctorates tend to come after the success. :-) As with most other things in making life choices, the value is relative to what you want to do, and what it is other people use to judge your success.  I think Harry is brilliant, not because of his multiple degrees, but because I've seen some of the things he's done, and had conversations with him.  I also know some people without degrees who are brilliant (think of Steve Jobs, for instance).  What you can do is usually more important than what titles you have.
