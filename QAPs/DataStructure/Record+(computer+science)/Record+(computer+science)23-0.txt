Graduate Record Examination (GRE):Â I took the GRE (score-309 verbal-150 quants-159) in April 2013, and I want to apply for Fall 2016 for an MS in computer science. Will the university consider this old GRE score or will they need a new fresh score?
GRE score is valid for 5 years, so you can use this old score, and you will not have any problem. However, do remember to use proper method to report scores i.e. via @ETS, and not just by sending the photocopy of the GRE score card. If you took TOEFL also around the same time, then you will have to re-take TOEFL again as its validity is only 2 years.
