Is there any advantage to getting more than one PhD?
You will have two different doctoral hoods, which gives you an additional option when you don your academic regalia for ceremonial purposes. Frankly, I think getting to wear our anachronistic robes, mortarboards, tassels, medals, berets and so on is one of the underappreciated benefits of being a professor and having a Ph.D. I usually make it a practice of wearing mine as I walk to the arena where we hold our exercises. The outfit draws more than a few approving glances. What can I say? I'm a shallow person. But, truth be told, you need not pursue two (or more) Ph.D.s to get multiple hoods. I got a scarlet hood for a Masters of Divinity at Yale, which packs more sartorial punch that the drab (yes, that's the official color) for the business administration Ph.D. I received from the University of Illinois. If the Dean asks me to say the invocation, I'm wearing the scarlet.
