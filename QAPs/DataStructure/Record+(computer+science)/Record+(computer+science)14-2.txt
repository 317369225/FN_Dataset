Graduate Record Examination (GRE): Apart from good GRE scores, what are the other credentials required to ensure an admission in a good foreign university for an MS program?
Since Suyash Gupta has hit the nail right on its head by covering almost every important points. I shall point out only what he has missed in his answer. Your planning matters a lot while making applications to US varsities. You need to arrange all your documents well before the application deadlines. Since, most of the Top universities have their 1st round(financial aid) deadline in the month of December of every year for their next fall intake. It is very important that you finish your complete application process as soon as they start rolling out their application.  It is true that the earlier you complete your application process the higher the chances of you getting admit from the universities, provided, you meet all their requirements. ;) Also, make sure you apply to at least 6 universities to be safe. Wherein, you apply to at least 2 ambitious, 2 moderate and 2 safe universities. You need to be realistic while you choose the universities, you may have to consider lot of factors like, University's ranking, Course curriculum, research opportunities, financial aids, acceptance rate, University's location, Alumnus network, etc. I truly hope this helps to all of those who are really willing to achieve their dreams. :) God bless!! All the best..
