What are some of the wackiest titles of serious Computer Science papers?
PL people love coming up with clever titles, often involving puns. My favorite is probably Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire. It's usually just called the "bananas paper". I've also recently come across these: Klesli Arrows of Outrageous Fortune Dealing with Large Bananas Tackling the Awkward Squad Calling Hell from Heaven and Heaven from Hell A Short Cut to Deforestation Simply Easy! The Concatenate Vanishes Diets for Fat Sets A Prettier Printer The Great Escape: Or How to Jump the Border without Getting Caught Power Series, Power Serious You probably wouldn't guess that these are all CS papers, much less that they're all from the same field (programming languages) :P.
