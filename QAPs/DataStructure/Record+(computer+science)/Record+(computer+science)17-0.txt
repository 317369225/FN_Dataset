I have a very bad academic record, but still manage to complete my graduation in computer science. I want a career in investment banking. What should I do?
This has got to be one of the strangest questions I've answered. I can almost believe you're just trolling. Why would someone ever go into compsci to work in investment banking?? Do you know the extent of compsci knowledge that is required in IB? Excel and PowerPoint. If you meant an investment fund or investment arm of an investment bank, it might make a little sense (but still not really-it's far more important to understand accounting and finance). You say you have a bad gpa. Then I have a story. A friend of mine had a bad gpa. Her gpa was so bad that she worried she wouldn't get a single interview. She spent weeks networking as a result, with past alumni and friends and anyone who might talk to her on LinkedIn. She got a job at credit Suisse. You know how "bad" her gpa was? 81% average. I hope your dad is Jamie dimon.
