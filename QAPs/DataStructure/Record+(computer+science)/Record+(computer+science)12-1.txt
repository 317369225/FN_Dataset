Will I be shortlisted for the ISRO written exam for a scientist/engineer SC stream computer science post in 2015 on the basis of my academic records?
You should be a bachelor's degree holder with first class(65% or CGPA >7) in relevant branch to write the centralized examination which is conducted by ISRO. I think you can write the exam.
