What are typical academic/extracurricular accomplishments of admits to top computer science graduate programs in the US? Is one's pre-undergraduate record still important?
Accomplishment in terms of GRE, GPA, Letters of Recommendation and Personal Statement (in that order) determine whether or not you have a chance of being admitted. Unless the extracurricular accomplishments are related to Academics specifically Computer Science, they are not really going affect the admission committee. For example, Eta Kappa Nu is one extracurricular activity that does have weight. What most applicants don't know is that the area of study within Computer Science such as Artificial Intelligence, Programming Languages, Systems, and Theory, each has a number of allocated slots available, so in determining what schools you want to apply, I recommend you check the Computer Science Specialty ratings. For example, Computer Science Programs | Programming Languages | US News shows that Indiana University at Bloomington has an excellent Programming Languages research program that may be easier to get in than a higher ranked school. You should also check the University admission data to see if you fit the profile. Frankly there is no reason to apply to a Graduate School that you don't fit the profile. If you have been following me, you know that I am very excited by Udacity, Georgia Tech, and AT&T Partnership as a very good alternative to full-time terminal Master's program. Georgia Tech is ranked 9th in the Nation and would be a very good jumping point in doing a Doctorate at top Computer Science Graduate School. Graduate School is all about research: You take professors not just coursework. It is the professor's research area that determines what school you should apply. Unless you are admitted into a Doctoral Program, you should consider part-time Master's degree program. The only reason for doing full-time terminal Master's is if you don't have a job in the Computer Industry.
