Can a non-cs graduate earn a MS degree in computer science?
The same as the best graduate programs for computer science, period. As long as you demonstrate interest and aptitude for computer science coursework / research in your application, it doesn't matter what your undergraduate degree was. Many of the students at top programs (MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley)* have undergraduate degrees in fields other than computer science -- for example, math, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, bioengineering, linguistics, etc. In fact, it may be a strength if you have background in a non-computer science field, because it makes you that much stronger as a multidisciplinary student and researcher. *This is an unordered list. I haven't researched the CS grad school rankings, but they vary heavily by research area anyways.
