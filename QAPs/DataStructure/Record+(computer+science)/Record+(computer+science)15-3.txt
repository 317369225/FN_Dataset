Is there any company in India which will give a job to someone with a terrible academic record (a B.Tech in Computer Science) but willing to work one hour extra everyday and even on Saturdays for a low salary?
It's not about your marks and grades that makesÂ  much difference but the practical knowledge is what really matters.make sure that you're strong enough in coding and important programming languages like c,c++,java .then you can join any company.but doing work for more one hour will not workout.hardword,dedication and skills are the one which will help you to grab the job...good luck!!
