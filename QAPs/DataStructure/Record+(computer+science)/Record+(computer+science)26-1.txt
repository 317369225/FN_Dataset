What are the best graduate programs for HCI in the United States and Europe?
Since no one has mentioned it, I thought I'd throw Indiana University for consideration as well (http://soic.indiana.edu/). Our program was founded in 2000 and has frequently been a part of the major HCI conferences in the world (IXDA, CHI, etc). If you have any questions about it, feel free to contact me!
