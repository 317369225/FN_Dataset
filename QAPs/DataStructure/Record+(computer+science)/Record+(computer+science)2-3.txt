As a fresh PhD graduate in computer science with no industry experience but a proven track record, how can I best negotiate my job offer?
The first thing to understand is that there is a risk on both sides. The company could be a brain damaging slavery and you might be a complete moron. Based on the hiring process you can't tell. Unless you hire to a department with just you alone, the question if you fit in the company culture is as important as what you know. Also what you know is not the same as what you can bring to the table. I remember two stories. Once I had an interview with guy with very similar CV as yours - a prestigiousÂ  university, excellent results, very confident. I told him bye bye after about 15 minutes because of his arrogance. The other day I found a very cool guy on LinkedIn and I hired him the very same day because of his attitude. The second guy asked for two times as much money and I agreed without much thinking. And I do not regret this. To sum up - who cares about your diploma?
