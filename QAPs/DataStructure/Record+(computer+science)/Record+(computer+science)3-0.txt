Where can a computer science major with a felony record find a job?
I know two people with misdemeanors that have gone on to successful technology careers; however, I also am aware that it is more difficult with a felony.  I think your best bet is to prove your skills by contributing to open source projects and forge a good reputation and contacts by your contributions.  Demonstrating your skills will go farther than just applying/interviewing.  If you don't have the right skills there are thousands of online courses (many free) at your disposal.  So, land your job by proving your worth.  Finally, don't shy away from your past or lie about it.  Be up front about it and state that you made a mistake and have learned from it.  Then focus on the positive things you have done that prove you have learned from your mistake.  If you demonstrate your skills and our honest about your past, you will find a company to take a chance on you.  Best wishes!
