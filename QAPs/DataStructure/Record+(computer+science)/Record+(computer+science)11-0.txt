MS by Research Computer Science: I am from BITS-Pilani and I have a CG of 7.2. I will be graduating this year. How much GATE score should I get to overshadow my academic record so that I get into an MS in research in computer science in IIT-B/ IIT-D / IIT-M?
         Its difficult to predict the score but the ranks are relatively easy to forecast. Normally people upto 200 rank will be called for MS interviews. Bulk weightage will be given to interviews so don't worry about your CG. IIT-B sometimes calls people upto 300.Though the ranks i quoted are for Chemical stream i hope it is same for most disciplines.
