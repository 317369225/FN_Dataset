Where can a computer science major with a felony record find a job?
I'm not really even conversant about felony rules. on tv I sometimes see where people with felonies are never allowed to use a computer again. if this is the case, I have no ideas. michael daconta suggested that you seek volunteer work.Â  I agree. you will be noticed if you do a good job, and this could lead to employment. good luck my friend.
