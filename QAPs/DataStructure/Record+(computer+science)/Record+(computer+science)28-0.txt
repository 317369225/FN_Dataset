Which topic should be perfect in c to learn data structures in c?
Good question, if you are just starting to learn data structures. Basic topics are below: Mostly you will use: #1 struct     Record (computer science) Example:     Record (computer science) #2 Pointers     Pointer (computer programming) Example:     Pointer (computer programming) #3 Array (also called ArrayList)     Array data structure Example:     Arrays in C     Multi-dimensional Arrays in C #4 Recursion     Recursion (computer science) Example:     Program for Fibonacci numbers - GeeksforGeeks You might also use: #5 union     Union type Example:     Union type #6 Tagged union     Tagged union Example:     Tagged union         Scroll down a page or two, to "C and C++" part: Most other data structures like implementations of linked list, trees, graphs, etc. will be based on the above at least to start with. Best of luck
