Graduate Record Examination (GRE):Â Apart from good GRE scores, what are the other credentials required to ensure an admission in a good foreign university for an MS program?
I wish you had looked up on Google about this as there are endless resources available which go in depth about all the things you've mentioned. Anyway, I'll give a gist of it. TOEFL is generally needed for international students. However, if you've studied in an English medium school, you may be exempt..this depends on the univ you apply to. LORs are taken from academic/professional advisors. Could be your professor or internship/job manager. SOP should be about why you want to go for MS. Please go through the various informative websites online for more details. Good luck!
