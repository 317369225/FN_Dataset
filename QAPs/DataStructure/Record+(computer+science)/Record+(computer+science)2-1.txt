As a fresh PhD graduate in computer science with no industry experience but a proven track record, how can I best negotiate my job offer?
Edit: Important note: I sympathize you a lot, believe you'll make it in the best way possible, make a difference in the world, surround yourself with like-minded people who enjoy your company and enjoy all the above and many other things along the way. That said ... You're in bad shape. You would have to carefully articulate to the recruiter how awesome top 0.1% is. And he/she would not understand it. While assuring you he/she does. The recruiter would still assume you fit into the "new grad" bracket and act accordingly. Your best bet is probably to: Excel at the interviews. Establish personal connections with a few of the interviewers. Get a low-level, low-pay offer. Politely reject it citing a few major reasons why are you worth more. Keep in touch with those interviewers, let them know what happened. Do so with a few companies. Wait until they get back to you with some ~25% .. 40% increase after they notice how awesome you have been and after they have new hiring goals to meet. Another best way is to be noticed in the community of an open source project you are contributing to. The sweet spot is to combine the two above: You get an entry-level offer and reject it. Someone from an open source community says "Hey, it would be cool to work with you! Are you available?" You say "Yes." That person talks to the recruiter and the recruiter figures out what has happened. The recruiter asks that person for extra evidence and the case is made to make you a stronger offer. All the best!
