As a fresh PhD graduate in computer science with no industry experience but a proven track record, how can I best negotiate my job offer?
Basically, you want to get directly hired by people who understand the value of what you've done. That means you should try to avoid the standard recruiting process as much as possible (since recruiters won't really be able to evaluate your skillset) and focus on reaching out and getting to know people. Previous graduates, friends of your professors, and others who went from Academia to Industry are good candidates. Talk to as many people as you can to get an idea of what different jobs are like and what would be a good fit. This won't just help you earn more, it'll also make sure you know what you're getting into so you can find work that's more interesting. Once you have a pretty clear idea of the exact types of work you'd be interested in, sit down and come up with a case that clearly articulates why your top performer background in academia also means that you will excel at the new job. Do you understand Statistics extremely well, in a way that lets you write incredibly performant algorithms for large datasets? Are you aware of important kernel details that make you a top candidate for writing operating systems? Etc. Once you have a clear case showing that your performance and knowledge from before will lead to more value for the company, it's much easier to ask for significantly more money.
