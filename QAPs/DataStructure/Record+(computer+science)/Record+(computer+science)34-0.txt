What are the most seriously shocking and hilarious results at the end of Day 1 Placements at IIT Delhi?
Girls tended to dominate consultancy placements. None of the General Secretaries (usually hot property for consults), except dual degree General Secretaries from the previous year got placed. Even Rendezvous Overall Coordinator did not get placed. Shocking, given that they had good academic records as well. Computer Science people preferred core jobs, many in US, some in Tower Research. Tower Research, Twitter, Microsoft extended many offers. Other departments had few core companies on campus and so had nothing much to look forward to except for consult or finance companies.
