How does one become an independent genomics/bioinformatics researcher?
Independent researchers are becoming exponentially more rare.  Essentially, all the easy answers have been found.  All the answers we now seek are refinements of the easy questions and are much more difficult.  The known body of facts becomes more complex every day.  All further research depends on knowledge of those facts. A single mind is seldom capable to holding all the relevant facts at quick and ready access.  Researchers really need the "community" of their topic to bounce ideas around, discard avenues that others have found unfruitful, and, within the group synthesize new ideas about how to pry more information from our world. My philosophy is that everyone benefits from the thoughts and ideas of others, even, and often, specifically those that are new to the field.
