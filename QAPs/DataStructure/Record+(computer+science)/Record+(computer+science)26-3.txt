What are the best graduate programs for HCI in the United States and Europe?
A few I've heard good things about, but this could be totally off: NYU ITP:  http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/ Stanford's HCI group:  http://hci.stanford.edu/ MIT Media Lab, although I don't think it's directly an HCI program:  http://www.media.mit.edu/ UC Berkeley's HCI group:  http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Res... If you're interested in startups, NYU's ITP program generates a lot of interesting ones; for example, Dennis Crowley of Foursquare is a graduate and I think the Foursquare precursor Dodgeball was something that he worked on there.
