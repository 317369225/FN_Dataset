How do I build a profile to get accepted into a star college like Caltech, MIT, Stanford or Berkeley for an MS in CS?
Go to the website of each school and have a look around. Pay particulars to attention to the information under the admissions tab, particularly with regard to the application process. Then go to COLLEGEdata: College Search, Financial Aid, College Application, College Scholarship, Student Loan, FAFSA, Common Application Enter each school in the search then choose Admissions. Pay careful attention to the numbers--GPA and test scores. Look at the class rank info. That's the bar you need to exceed. You'll also want to have impressive ECAs, hold office, organize events, play sports, etc. You also want to get some long-term volunteer service under your belt. Sounds like you have a great start. Keep it up! Best to you --
