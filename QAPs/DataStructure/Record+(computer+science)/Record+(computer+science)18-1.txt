I will get computer science in PESIT, MSRIT and BMS. Which is better with respect to the education, faculty, college life, extra curriculars, records for abroad studies, and college life overall?
CSE in Pesit is definitely a better option go for it. Because there are two reoaons Â first:Pesit is better than BMS. second: CSE in Pesit is better than CSE in any other college in Karnataka.
