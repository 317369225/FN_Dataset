Graduate Record Examination (GRE):Â I took the GRE (score-309 verbal-150 quants-159) in April 2013, and I want to apply for Fall 2016 for an MS in computer science. Will the university consider this old GRE score or will they need a new fresh score?
Yes you can use your old scores as GRE scores are valid for 5 years. But I would highly recommend you to increase your quant score a little bit if you are aiming for top US school.
