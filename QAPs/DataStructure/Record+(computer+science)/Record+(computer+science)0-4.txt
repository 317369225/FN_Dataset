Can a non-cs graduate earn a MS degree in computer science?
I had no difficulty getting into a second-tier MSc programming with a BA in Theater and no college math or CompSci courses.  My GRE scores were 98th percentile (I think, it was a long time ago), my letters of recommendation were good enough that the department chair commented on them, and my undergrad GPA was.... poor.  And I had a nice story about how I had been using computers to do statistical analysis of Shakespearian texts as an undergrad. Do with that information what you will.
