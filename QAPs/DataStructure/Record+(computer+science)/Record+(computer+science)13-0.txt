I am good at computer science fundamentals (DS, algorithms etc.) and have a good academic track record. Yet, I am not successful at my job. What is the reason for this?
Do you work with TCS!!! or any other consultancy services in India. Well answering your question you are not getting the work of your interested as you have mentioned you are good in Data Structures and algorithms and at your job you might not be using them or working on some other profile. My advice is that if you really like data structures and algorithms start problem solving through various channels online. Refer this : Is there any website, where I can get Java Challenges? And seriously if you are good with problem solving then there are enormous opportunities waiting for you.
