I will get computer science in PESIT, MSRIT and BMS. Which is better with respect to the education, faculty, college life, extra curriculars, records for abroad studies, and college life overall?
PESU, man. CSE is way better than any other college in Karnataka at PES, if you want to really learn and get placed in a very good company. People say it's more like a school than college. But at the end of the day, if you have a good job in your hand, the place from where you got your degree won't matter much. For universities abroad, it doesn't matter if you're from RVCE or HKBKIT, you'll still be treated as an Indian student. Your profile matters more.
