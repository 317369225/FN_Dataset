Is there any advantage to getting more than one PhD?
The only person I know who has two PhDs started out in math, but decided to transfer to statistics after his third year.  But it turned out that he got enough done during that year to finish his first PhD, so he went for it.  The conversations that he has with people tend to be more along the lines of "Why?" rather than "Wow, you're smart". I don't think there's any other set of circumstances where it makes sense to go for a second doctorate.
