How can I prepare myself to be a software engineer at Google?
I'm currently interviewing. I have offers from a couple companies in the top 5 bracket, but not google - since I haven't interviewed with them yet. In any case, what worked for me, was taking challenging courses at university; especially operating systems/distributed systems & machine learning. Studying and writing a compiler is critical; it makes one a better engineer and thinker. I spent very little time solving interview questions and mostly focused on my curriculum. Remember, the key here is to challenge yourself and grow as an engineer; anyone can clear interviews with some amount of preparation.Â  One's goal shouldn't be as trivial as working for company X. Dream big; you are an engineer after all. Now, put down your copy of cracking the coding interview and object oriented design patterns and read this : Rich Programmer Food Godspeed.
