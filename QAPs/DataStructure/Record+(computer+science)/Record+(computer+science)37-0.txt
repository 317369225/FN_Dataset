Is there any advantage to getting more than one PhD?
I know of multiple people who've gotten one PhD in math and then, some while later, gotten a second PhD in computer science. Since their math PhDs were some time ago, I suspect they were closeted computer scientists but working in an era where computer science was not yet entirely “a thing”, and then later it became one, and they went back and got the training they really wanted. It makes some sense if you want to make a career change, especially if you want to pick up the credential so you can apply for jobs. All the people I'm thinking of are computer science faculty members, and might have had some difficulty wandering into a CS department with just a math PhD and math research record.
