I will get computer science in PESIT, MSRIT and BMS. Which is better with respect to the education, faculty, college life, extra curriculars, records for abroad studies, and college life overall?
Go for PESIT, hands down, without a doubt. PESIT CS is one of the best in state. Source : I'm an alumni.
