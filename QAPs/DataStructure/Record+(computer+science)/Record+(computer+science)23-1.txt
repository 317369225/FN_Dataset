Graduate Record Examination (GRE): I took the GRE (score-309 verbal-150 quants-159) in April 2013, and I want to apply for Fall 2016 for an MS in computer science. Will the university consider this old GRE score or will they need a new fresh score?
They'll consider this score for 5 years.   I would strongly advise putting in 100-200 hours of study to get a higher score. It would open up more opportunities, increase the probability of scholarship AND leave you with a stronger foundation for when you do apply.
