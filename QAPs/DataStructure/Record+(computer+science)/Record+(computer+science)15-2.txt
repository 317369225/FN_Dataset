Is there any company in India which will give a job to someone with a terrible academic record (a B.Tech in Computer Science) but willing to work one hour extra everyday and even on Saturdays for a low salary?
There are some small companies in Delhi. But you need to know some one who can forward your CV. Its all about contacts (until you pass out from some reputed college.)
