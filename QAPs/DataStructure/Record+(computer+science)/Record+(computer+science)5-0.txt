What are the 5 best BTech colleges in Maharashtra electronics/computer science with awesome placement records?
Well, I am Delhi based and hence do not know much about engineering colleges in Maharashtra. However, you can google for the college rankings and then use sites like Directorate of Technical Education, Maharashtra State, Mumbai ::.. andÂ  Home | College Pravesh etc. that list the cutoffs of past years. Also, read blogs and Quora content that gives your fair idea as it comes from the real people. For my son's admission in Delhi, my son and I also used Google to find rankings and used quora to finally decide about the college. Best wishes!
