What are the best graduate programs for HCI in the United States and Europe?
I think the paper summary at the top of this article is a pretty good indicator, though I might note that it leaves out UC Irvine, which is clearly in that top 10. The key is finding a set of people that you'd like to work with. I've been a student at CMU, faculty at Berkeley, and now at UW.  I am very happy with where UW is in this space and think we are only getting better.  But, I still think CMU & Georgia Tech are the people to "beat". :)
