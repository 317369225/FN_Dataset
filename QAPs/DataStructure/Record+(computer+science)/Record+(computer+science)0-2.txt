Can a non-cs graduate earn a MS degree in computer science?
I did a year in the Colorado State Master's in Computer Science program. This program does not require a related undergraduate degree, which was fortunate since I have a BA in English Lit. If you have "no technical background" you will have a hard time in a graduate CS program. You should do some remedial work to ensure that you can deal with the coding and the technical concepts first. (This does not necessarily entail getting another bachelor's degree or even necessarily attending college courses.) I am a mostly self-taught software developer (and I've been writing books and giving talks at conferences, etc. for many years). That said, I wanted to be sure I could keep up academically in a graduate level CS program, so prior to my matriculation at Colorado State, I took a few CS courses from the community college near my home. I did well in all my classes and gained not only a great deal of confidence, but some valuable experience in the programming languages that are used for teaching (mostly C/C++ and Java).
