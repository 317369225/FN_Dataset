Is there any advantage to getting more than one PhD?
One of my dissertation committee members had two PhDs. He did his undergraduate degree at Cambridge and got a PhD by the conventional route at Oxford If you have a degree from Cambridge, you can submit a piece of work that you have done and receive a PhD by publication, from Cambridge. So he submitted a book that he'd written, and got a second PhD. Here's his website: David Clarke. His first PhD (which was called a DPhil, same thing though) was in 1976, his second was 1987. Â  (Note that in the UK, especially then, there were no coursework requirements for a PhD. You write a dissertation, and the PhD is awarded based solely on that dissertation.)
