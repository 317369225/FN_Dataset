What are the best graduate programs for HCI in the United States and Europe?
Carnegie Mellon is commonly acknowledged as a top school and is generally well known by those outside of the community. But two which are highly regarded by those inside the community are University of Washington and Georgia Tech. If you go by the number of published papers at the CHI conference every year, CMU, UW and Georgia Tech are pretty consistently the top 3 schools. MIT Media Lab tends to do its own thing and not participate as much with the general HCI community. It's a very distinctive culture and you have to figure out if it's what you want. Stanford & Berkeley both have their HCI run out of their CS programs which leads to a different flavor of research. They produce very high caliber students but, IMVHO, you miss out on a significant chunk of HCI education by not working with an inter-disciplinary team. If you want to expand to Canada, University of British Columbia and University of Toronto both have very strong programs. Ultimately though, finding the best match for you is far more important than finding the objectively best school. Every school has a slightly different area of focus and different environment for doing research. Also, where the university is located turns out to be an important factor. The UW managed to attract several Stanford Undergraduates specifically due to it's urban setting. On the other hand, I know one UW PhD Candidate who returned to California due to a severe Vitamin D deficiency over the winter. Disclaimer: I interviewed with Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, CMU & UW and did 2 years of a PhD at UW. My personal experience with the UW HCI program was fantastic and I could not recommend it highly enough.
