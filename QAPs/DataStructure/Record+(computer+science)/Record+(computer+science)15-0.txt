Is there any company in India which will give a job to someone with a terrible academic record (a B.Tech in Computer Science) but willing to work one hour extra everyday and even on Saturdays for a low salary?
There are thousands of engineering students passing out every year .Almost 80% remain as job-seeker as a year or two.Don't compromise and just learn new skills that are ever demanding ,until then join some good startups as intern. You will learn a lot and career graph will go exponentially .All the best for your future endevour .
