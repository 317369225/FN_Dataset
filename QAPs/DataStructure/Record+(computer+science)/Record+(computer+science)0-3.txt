Can a non-cs graduate earn a MS degree in computer science?
Speaking about Masters programs: See What would I have to do to qualify for an MS in Computer Science if I'm a humanities major undergrad? As for PhD: I can only guess that unless you did some CS courses, or something closely related in undergrad, it will be hard for you to get in (because you're competing with people who have) unless you can convince the admissions committee that you offer a particular research program something special. I would suggest first doing a Masters then applying for a PhD.
