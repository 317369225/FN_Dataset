What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
Open Source doesn't mean anyone can edit the source code. The true meaning of the word Logic. There are dozens of programming languages in use, and hundreds that aren't. Building a website or a program is hard work. The entire field of programming radically changes every 4 years. Doing simple tasks like "browsing the internet" have a dozen of different layers under the hood ... and good programmers actually understand all the different layers (it's truly a miracle that these layers do work correctly ... usually). The day to day job of most programmers has little to do with what you learn when you get a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Just because you're a programmer it doesn't mean you can figure out why their MS. Word crashed right now. That some tasks might be solvable by a computer in theory, but in practice would take more time than the universe has been alive! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Com... Updated 174w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
