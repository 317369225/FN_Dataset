Which are the top affordable (not exceeding 25000 USD per annum in total) colleges with an excellent placement record for a 4-year computer engineering, computer science or software engineering in Canada, the USA or Australia for an Indian student?
Go to Europe. Higher education is cheaper there and significantly much better than what you could get in the US for $25k per year.
