Are there really programmers with computer science degrees who cannot pass the FizzBuzz test?
Yes there are computer science graduates who can't write simple programs.  Failing people who can't program is bad for computer science department revenue so many schools cut the coding, use team assignments,  and/or relax the grading. My alma mater replaced our Data Structures professor, who graded students based on the fraction of the teaching-assistant-developed automated unit tests they passed, with one who demonstrated algorithms by passing stuffed animals around a room.  Supposedly the original professor failed 1/3 of the class, although interviewing graduates in industry we saw our reject rate go from negligible to about half. The majority of computer science graduates can probably program.  The people who can't are just over-represented in the recruiting process because as Joel Spolsky notes in Finding Great Developers for the most part, almost every hiring manager in Palo Alto right now  with 1000 resumes on their desk has the same exact set of 970 resumes  from the same minority of 970 incompetent people that are applying for  every job in Palo Alto, and probably will be for life Conversely, as Joel mentions, great developers are rarely on the market.  I didn't bother looking for jobs in the first decade of my career - I just let friends who were happy with their work environment know I was ready for a move or waited for some one to recruit me.  Good developers also disappear immediately - a first on-site interview with an offer before they leave the building isn't out-of-line.  Many cancel because they accepted a job before a phone screen scheduled two days in the future. I'll have coffee with promising candidates on weekends or skip my morning bike ride for a 9 am meeting to increase my odds of being  first to make an offer, and start encounters with why they'd want to join me with room for questions instead of finishing that way.
