Are there really programmers with computer science degrees who cannot pass the FizzBuzz test?
Most people who haven't done much interviewing of programmers for an average programming role would probably be honestly stunned how many candidates seem incapable of solving a relatively trivial programming problem in a satisfactory way in an interview setting. I certainly was, although I've gotten over it. It's a little different when you've got a great position at an exciting company and you're mostly looking at referrals or very strong candidates that you've got some kind of insight on. But on the market as a whole, there are lots of people looking for work that I wouldn't hire.
