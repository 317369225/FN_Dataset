Should I study what I want to study or what I'm good at?
A very interesting recent article in Quartz carried by The Atlantic cut through all the suggestive but vague advice like "what you love" and "what you are good at".  Their advice was "do what the world needs to be done".  (a) it will make you happy, because doing important and useful things makes people happy, and (b) there will be a demand for it, or you can create a demand for it. Still low on details, but I found it "convincing", which is a step up from "suggestive". The best career advice you’ll never hear in a graduation speech Updated 36w ago • View Upvotes
