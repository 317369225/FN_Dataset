How do I build a profile to get accepted into a star college like Caltech, MIT, Stanford or Berkeley for an MS in CS?
Master of Science in CS???!!!!!! I hope you have $120,000 in spare cash..................... MIT does Not offer a terminal Masters in CS.  They can't be bothered. Stanford will, but will expect you to Pay in full. CS is a Horribly oversubscribed major in the USA, and the research colleges save all of their financial aid for PhD students and give the Masters nothing or next to nothing.   Expect to expend $60,000 to $65,000 per year in your quest. But if you are still enthused about this because you consider $120,000 to be Pocket Change, then Make Certain that you have three professors lined up at your current college to provide you with Glowing letters of recommendation.   Preferably professors who are known in some manner by the CS department at the colleges to which you are applying.   And of course, you should be in the top 10% of your graduating class, have a great GRE score and a TOEFL in excess of 100 (preferably around 110). If you are depending upon your start-up work, then of course the $120,000 will be easy money.   You should publish a few papers (at least two) in professional international peer-reviewed journals.    You then still need at least two glowing letters of recommendation from people whom the admission committee respect and know.
