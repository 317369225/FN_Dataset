How does one become an independent genomics/bioinformatics researcher?
Definitely. On my own time throughout high school, a few years ago, I eagerly delved into bioinformatics and genomics because frankly I didn't want to wait for college to learn about the awesomeness of biology + computer sci. This knowledge eventually allowed me to land 2 papers (when the journals asked for my affiliation, I said "independent researcher") in peer-reviewed scientific journals and a nice internship at a national lab before my last year of high school. It can be done, and is completely possible. Independent research is a lot of fun, too.
