What are the placements records and packages of VIT Vellore in computer science?
I don't have the statistics so I won't be able to tell you the numbers but I can tell you that the placements are pretty good . Last year the highest package was of 25 lac and many students got a package of over 10 lac . If you have a cgpa of 7.5 then you'll easily get placed though your starting salary might not be good .
