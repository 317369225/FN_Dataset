Graduate Record Examination (GRE):Â I took the GRE (score-309 verbal-150 quants-159) in April 2013, and I want to apply for Fall 2016 for an MS in computer science. Will the university consider this old GRE score or will they need a new fresh score?
The GRE is valid for five years so it should be ok. However, some universities do have a shorter validity period they consider. You should check with the.
