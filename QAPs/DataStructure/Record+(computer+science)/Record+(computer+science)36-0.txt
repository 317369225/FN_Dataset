How does one become an independent genomics/bioinformatics researcher?
You can become an independent researcher in genomics if you start with computer skills and learn the biology; the opposite is also true. The best researchers in the field of computational biology for genomics are very good in both fields, biology and computer science. Programming skills are very important. Right now, we can produce data much faster than it can be analyzed, and the bottleneck is really the analysis. We are sitting on a goldmine of data from big genomic projects such as ENCODE, TCGA and others, in addition to the flood of data that individual labs are constantly producing. It's a great time to become a bioinformatician or computational biologist. In terms of becoming an independent genomics researcher, it depends what you mean by independent. In general, independent means having your own lab in a university setting (or similar setting in some non-academic institutions) and generating your own research money through government and foundation grants. This is of course also possible, but in addition to computer science and biology knowledge, you'll need a PhD (with very few exceptions), and post-doctoral training, with a good publication record, just like for any other type of academic career. I hope this helps. Thanks for the A2A and good luck with your future career! Updated 15w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Devashish Singh
