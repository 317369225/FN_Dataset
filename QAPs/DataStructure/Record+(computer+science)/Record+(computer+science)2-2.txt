As a fresh PhD graduate in computer science with no industry experience but a proven track record, how can I best negotiate my job offer?
If your open source projects or research are relevant to the field you are working in, that's certainly going to help in the interview, but it sounds like you are already past that. Since you are at the stage of considering multiple offers, the main negotiating point is contrasting the different offers.  If one is significantly higher than the others, you can probably talk up the other offers to match it.  You probably already have a particular company you would prefer to work for, so start by seeing if you can convince that company to come up to a level where you'd accept the offer.
