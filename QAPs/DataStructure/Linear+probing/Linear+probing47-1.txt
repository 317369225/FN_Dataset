What is a good and/or established alternative term for the kind of free will that many people imagine as being incompatible with determinism?
Independent from what? Causality is the main issue in the free will versus determinism debate. In classical physics, causality is linear: cascading in lockstep with the unidirectional arrow of time. Cause and effect. Inexorable. Unstoppable. It's the core cog in the clockwork cosmos. But physics deals with inanimate matter. Humans are not inanimate. We're intelligent biological systems. Our brains are like 'causality batteries'. We observe, remember, analyze, understand and anticipate causality. Our intelligence and memories represent a virtualized form of causality. Instead of cascading in lockstep with the unidirectional arrow of time, causality can take circuitous routes to effects . . . or they can manifest in many effects . . . or they can repeat effects. We're animate beings, not inanimate objects. More importantly, we're thinking, intelligent, beings who understand causality so well that we routinely anticipate it with a high degree of accuracy. We're surrounded by proof of our special relationship with causality. It's called technology: applied science. The Internet. Men on the moon. Rovers on Mars. Probes passing through the Oort Cloud or landing on comets. The food in your refrigerator. Our ability to anticipate causality gives us a temporal advantage over it. And that advantage turns the linear causality of inanimate objects into the reciprocal causality of animate beings: particularly, intelligent human beings. We don't merely react to causality . . . we interact with it. Does this mean we're 'independent' of causality? No. It means we can anticipate, plan and execute our own vision of the future (within the constraints of causality). It's not free will. It's self-determinism. It's as close as we can get to free will.
