What are some examples of non-linear novels?
Practically anything written by Kurt Vonnegut. Vonnegut is famous for his asymmetric style of writing. Most of his novels have plots that jump around in time because the protagonist is: unstuck in time (Billy Pilgrim in Slaughterhouse Five) a ghost that narrates the story (The ghost of Kilgore Trout's son narrates the story of Galapagos which spans millenia, but focuses on a small group of stranded travelers) telling their life's story in retrospect (Breakfast of Champions, Cat's Cradle, Deadeye Dick, Slapstick)
