What are good ways to increase employee engagement?
Don't just put a band aid on it. Find out what's really going on. Do this by asking questions on a regular basis. Think of yourself more as a coach and less as a manager. A good coach helps people improve performance have more of what they want. But first they need to know what's really going on. It might be that they're going through some tough personal issues. It might be that your culture is toxic - it might be that they don't believe the company has a chance at being successful. There are different solutions to each scenario, but they all begin with asking people questions that open up honest dialogue and then devising a strategy that helps people make progress towards having more of what they want ( and what the company wants ) We built 15Five to help companies and managers ask these questions that are going unasked and then take action on the answers.
