What are some examples of non-linear novels?
Catch-22 by Joseph Heller is probably one of the most famous examples. The Wikipedia article describes this structure well: "Many events in the book are repeatedly described from differing points of view, so the reader learns more about each event from each iteration, with the new information often completing a joke, the punchline of which was told several chapters previously. The narrative often describes events out of sequence, but events are referred to as if the reader is already familiar with them, so that the reader must ultimately piece together a timeline of events." (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat...) Another famous example is Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut. Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time, and he experiences events out of sequence and repetitively. Another non-linear novel is Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell. The novel consists of six nested stories that begin on a 19th-century schooner and progress in time to a post-apocalyptic future, then go backwards through time to the beginning story again and ends where it began. Tim O'Brien has written a few non-linear novels, notably his Vietnam War novel The Things They Carried and the suspense thriller In the Lake of the Woods.
