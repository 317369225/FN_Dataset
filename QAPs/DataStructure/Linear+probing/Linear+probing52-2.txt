What did Marshall McLuhan mean by hot and cool media?
I used to be puzzled about the difference between hot and cold media because it seemed counter-intuitive to say, as Marshall McLuhan did, that books are hotter than TV.  It's not just about the newness of a technology.  Now I see the point that McLuhan was making about effects. The physical act of reading long strings of text imposes an environment of linearity and isolation.  Dictionaries and other reference works that provide answers are hotter than murder mysteries and cliff hangers that engage readers' participation in figuring out answers. The small, low resolution black and white TV of McLuhan's day engaged participation by causing watchers to jiggle rabbit ears, translate the image through the physiology of the eye, surf with the remote, and buy a new TV every few years.  Better screen and sound technologies have heated up TV in relation to our sensory apparatus, and masters of the medium have gotten increasing more skilled at instigating responses from viewers. McLuhan often described engagement with "probes."  My take on this is that  the more the media serves to probe, or "prove," or calibrate you, the hotter is. The more you're calibrating, probing, or proving while you use it, the colder it is. In the slides linked here, I use the metaphors of a branded horse, and a deep-space observing telescope to drive home the hot versus cold distinction. Page on slideshare.net
