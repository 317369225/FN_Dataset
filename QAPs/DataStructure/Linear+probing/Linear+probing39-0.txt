What can we expect to happen to humans in 1,000Â  years?
The human race is extremely destructive. We as a species have a lot of problems. We are self-aware and dominant because of it, and there are over 7 billion variables -- each and every one of us. The bottom line is, we are destroying the planet we are living on. Eventually, although probably not within our lifetimes, humans will need to move on. There will be nothing left on Earth for us, and we'll have to go somewhere else. The Moon looks like the best candidate, although it will eventually leave Earth's orbit if we don't correct it. Mars may also be a good candidate, certainly better than Venus. We could live in space if we could get a sustainable way to run a spaceship indefinitely, but living on a planet is our best bet. However, the resources required to live on another planet without using Earth to help us out in requisitioning those supplies. I, personally, think the human race will eventually die out. I am religious, so I believe the end of the world will happen at that time with the rapture and the whole shebang. But without that happening, the human race would likely cease to exist and a new species will take over as the dominant species. Of course, aliens could show up at our doorstep before all of that and emprison us too. There's no real way to tell as of this time.
