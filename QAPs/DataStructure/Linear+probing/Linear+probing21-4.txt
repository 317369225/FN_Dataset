What are examples of great scientific books that introduced the public to revolutionary concepts?
"Silent Spring" by Rachel Carson had an enormous impact on the public's appreciation for the many lasting environmental consequences of pollution, and the necessity for independent assessment of environtal toxins (EPA) and mandatory gov't regulation.  Pollution levels throughout the US dropped dramatically in the decade thereafter. "Unsafe at Any Speed" by Ralph Nader revealed to the public the need for government regulation of automotive safety.  It's hard to overstate the impact it had on car roadworthiness and crash survivability.
