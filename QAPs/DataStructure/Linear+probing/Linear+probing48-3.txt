College Advice: Is 33 too old to get a master's degree, then get into a field that's completely irrelevant to what he has done before?
I would be much more concerned with your lack of experience than your age.  PhDs in STEM fields are paid positions, and I don't think you're going to find anyone who wants to pay you a PhD salary while you get up to speed with your undergraduate classes. If you're paying your own way, you probably have 3-5 years before you can think about external funding (this may be easier if you're a member of an under-represented population, and much harder if you're not a citizen or permanent resident of the country). I'd recommend getting a bachelor's or Master's degree first.  If you're really good, you'll have a much easier transition to a PhD.  If you aren't quite that good, you have a defined exit and a new degree. As to your question:  I think 35 is an ideal age to start a PhD.  You know how you learn and you'll be comfortable treating the process as just another job.
