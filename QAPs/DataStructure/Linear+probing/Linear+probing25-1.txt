How is a proton beam produced?
Since you asked about production, I think all the answers here up to now are slightly lacking. I am sure there are many ways to produce beams of protons, but those of the LHC are produced in Linear accelerator 2. My understanding of LINAC2 is that it is a chain consisting of: an hydrogen gas source, a microwave oven where an hydrogen plasma is made, in the plasma, electrons are no longer tightly bound to protons, the plasma is in the presence of an electric field which segregates electrons from protons as Robert mentioned, the protons come out one way and enter a very particular piece LHC - Radio Frequency Quadrupole (in German) where the beam is both focussedÂ  into a narrow "strand" and accelerated. The beam is then accelerated to relativistic speeds by an Alvarez linear accelerator.That's the production of a continuous proton beam. After this the beams are: Spliced into packets, i.e. protons are bunched together into packets so that the beams are not continuous. This is done in the The Proton Synchrotron Booster Focused, accelerated, tracked and measured, which is what beams do for the most part they exist while passing through the different accelerators in the chain of CERN accelerators. Collided with each other or with a target, fulfilling their purpose of probing matter at the smallest scales.
