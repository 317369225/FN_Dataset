What is "tensor calculus" and why did Einstein need it for some of his theories?
I think the single most important thing missing from Rob's answer is any mention whatsoever of "curved surfaces". You don't really need tensors to do calculus on 3, 4, or even 1,000 dimensions that are flat. As Rob said, on top of it all you have (single variable) calculus. It lets you study properties of functions whose domain and target are the real numbers that we know and love. This picture should look familiar to anybody that knows any calculus: (image credit: UCSB website Lee's CLAS Homepage) This is an example of starting with a function (the blue curve) and computing its tangent line (the black? line), i.e. its derivative. (Rob has a good explanation of this.) Better yet with calculus you can go even backwards. I can describe a derivative to you, i.e. all the black lines (slopes) that correspond to your blue curve, and then ask you to tell me what the correct blue curve is. This is an example of an Ordinary differential equation in calculus. Look at the axes in the picture above. In this case the x and y axes are both straight lines, i.e. your function's domain is a straight line and so is your target space. In mathematical lingo, your function is of the form [math] f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} [/math] Let's generalize. You could very well have a domain that is a 2-D plane (e.g. the xy-plane), in which case the graph of your function looks like this: (image credit: University of Minnesota, School of Mathematics - math.umn.edu) It might look more complicated but the ideas are very similar to single variable calculus. You just look at everything one dimension at a time. Look at the green curve. It has a tangent line (black) much like we had a (black) tangent line to the blue curve in the previous image. Derivatives are now called Partial derivatives and you have one for each axis (x, y here). The green curve above has to do with the partial derivative in the x-direction. By the way, the bent sheet above is (not surprisingly) called a Surface in mathematics. We can still go backwards like we could in single variable calculus. I can tell you what the tangents to the surface look like and you can try to tell me what the function/surface is. This is an example of a Partial differential equation. So this was what happens when your domain is a plane (the xy-plane) and your target space (the z-axis) is still a line. In mathematical lingo: [math] f : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}[/math] In fact at this point you can have the exponent in the domain be as large as you'd like, as well as the exponent in the target space. You can have functions from an xyz-space to an wv-plane, or what have you. In mathematical lingo: [math] f : \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n[/math] You can go about business as usual here without too much change. Surfaces now are higher dimensional by the way, and therefore we give them a fancier name: Manifold. This is where Rob stopped, but arguably we haven't even done tensor calculus yet: we just did Multivariable calculus. Now i'm going to ask you to focus on the axes in the previous pictures. In the first case you had a function on the x-axis (a straight line) with values on the y-axis (another straight line). In the second case you had a function on the xy-plane (a flat plane) with values on the z-axis (a straight line). Everything was nice and flat. Tensor calculus comes up when you want to study way funkier functions, such as functions whose domains themselves are non-flat surfaces/manifolds, instead of just straight lines, or planes, etc. like we previously described. Imagine defining a function on the bent purple sheet above [math] f : \Sigma \to \mathbb{R} [/math] and then looking at its graph. The axes are now all bent. Worse yet, imagine defining a function on the purple sheet, and whose target space is another bent sheet! [math] f : \Sigma \to T[/math] Standard partial derivatives of such things express a preference for having coordinates, such as (x, y, z). This is very often annoying when dealing with surfaces: there is no "x" or "y"-direction (axis) for a function defined on a surface! What is the x direction on the surface of a basketball? There's no such thing. So partial derivatives are not quite the correct thing to use anymore. Tensors do away with all this inconvenience by encoding everything in coordinate-free ways. Now we're in business. Why did Einstein care? Einstein's theory of gravitation says that the presence of matter curves spacetime so things that should be straight are actually not straight anymore. (Image credit: Book cover of Sean Carroll's Spacetime and Geometry: An Introduction to General Relativity) You have a massive star sitting in your universe, and Einstein says that time and space around it get bent. Look at the gray "planar" sheet on which the star is sitting and how it gets bent to accommodate for the mass. Those are your axes that are being bent. Einstein also said (in Special relativity) that space (x, y, z) and time (t) aren't separate things, but they are best thought of as being coupled (x, y, z, t). Therefore time gets bent too, but we can only fit so many dimensions in one picture... One more thing. Light is massless, and it's supposed to travel in straight lines. You turn on your flashlight, and it emits rays that follow a straight path. But if your light were passing just nearby a massive star, then it would get bent! The picture above also shows this. In any case, we now have four bent coordinates (x, y, z, t). I should say right away that in fact we shouldn't even write (x, y, z, t) because this notation is misleading. Physically that is so because (for instance) "t" is not necessarily "time" for everybody anymore. There is no distinguished way to measure time (or spatial position) exactly because of all the relativistic effects: the bending, or things like the Twin paradox. It's best to think of spacetime not as four coordinates (x, y, z, t) in [math]\mathbb{R}^4[/math], but as a curved four-dimensional surface: M. Mathematically (x, y, z, t) makes little sense for this curved manifold for the same reason that I mentioned it makes little sense to talk about x, y axes on a basketball. So that's that. What about Curvature? Let's look at the first graph again: The diagram above tells you how the (first) derivative is related with tangent lines, i.e. slopes, i.e. rates of change. The second derivative measures the rate of change of the slope, and if you think about it, this measures just how curved the blue arc is. For example, if the second derivative were zero, then your slope would be the same everywhere, i.e. your blue arc would really have been a straight line (no curvature). In other words, derivatives are not only good for measuring slopes and tangents, but also for measuring curvature. Curvature, then, naturally shows up in differential equations. If spacetime M is not "flat" then differential equations on spacetime escape the realm of multivariable calculus, since you necessarily have to use tensors instead of partial derivatives. Einstein's field equations [math]G + \Lambda g = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T[/math] are a mathematical formulation of "matter curves spacetime". They are a (second order) differential equation in the unknown tensor g (the Metric tensor) that determines the geometry of your spacetime. G is precisely that second order derivative tensor of g that measures curvature in the right way. Those two tensors together depend on T, a tensor that indicates the presence of matter. TL;DR. To talk about Einstein's field equations we need second order derivatives of things that are defined on curved surfaces, so we need to use tensor calculus instead of multivariable calculus to make sense of things. Hope this helps. Update. I've rearranged some things I said to possibly make this answer more presentable. Updated 106w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
