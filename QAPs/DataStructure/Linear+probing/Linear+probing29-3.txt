How did the Universe begin?
Taking from from my answer to How can I wrap my mind around the concept of a God who existed before there was anything, who always existed, and who had no creator himself? Time isn't what you think it is. Neither is space. We live in a bubble and occupy a small enough section of the bubble that what is curved feels flat. The planes used in the question details are misleading. It's kind of like when you walk along the surface of the Earth and for all practical purposes you experience comparative "flatness" all around you, but you know that Earth is a sphere so you must be on a curve. The same is true of Earth's place in the universe and its place in the fabric of space-time. I have found that moving out of a mental model of [point->line->rectangle->cube] and starting to think around [point->circle->sphere->bubbles] has made some of the more complicated stuff start to feel more natural. Within that framework, how did the Universe begin? I'm not certain that it did. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-s... Updated 172w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
