How do I look for perforator incompetence while doing a color doppler examination of extremity veins?
Read a book instead of asking on Quora. Edit: are you pissed off by this answer too? (like the guy who commented on my answer) Would you feel better if I searched for some article on the net and copy-pasted it here? (like the only other guy who's answered till now) Truth is, nothing will replace asking a senior to teach you or reading it from some book or article and practicing it yourself. Therefore, I repeat: Read a book instead of asking on Quora. Articles can confuse and mislead, esp if you are just starting.
