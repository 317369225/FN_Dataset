Werner Heisenberg, one of the fathers of quantum mechanics, once said, “The universe is not made of things but of vibrational energy networks, emerging from something even more profound and subtle.” So, does that mean that our thoughts too are mere energy?
"Mere" energy? In this context, I have no idea what this means. Is the universe the "mere" universe by the same token? Just like the universe, our thoughts are all we have. Are they a product of the physical world? Yes; everything in the universe is. Are they any lesser for it? Not for me. It's a given already. Heisenberg is describing a reality; but he is not talking about thoughts. Thoughts are a biological phenomenon. You couldn't, for instance, ask a geologist to explain with authority how the brain works. Geologists and doctors research different "things" - at a quantum level they have the same discreet material, but rock and brains have different properties. Heisenberg is not concerned with any other properties than the quantum ones. It would be a misquotation to imply he is taking about consciousness.
