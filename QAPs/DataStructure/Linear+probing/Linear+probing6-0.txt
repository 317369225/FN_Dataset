Why HashMap not allowing duplicate keys? How it is stored?
Hash map contains hash function that take key as parameter and returns an unique index corresponding to that key.The value related to that key is mapped with that index generated.If hashmap allows duplicate keys, then its hash function will generate same index for two same keys..and this will guarantee the case of collision. Although we have methods to handle collisions because it may be the case that two different keys generate same index. But this is very rare and if that happens..we have methods such as single chaining, linear probing, quadratic probing and double hashing to avoid those scenarios... Due to the fact that hashmap doesn't allows duplicate keys it is very useful in solving many algorithmic problems in an efficient way..
