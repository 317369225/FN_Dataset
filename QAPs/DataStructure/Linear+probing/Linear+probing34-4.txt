How can Voyager send a signal strong enough for us to receive, in spite of its enormous distance from us?
Postcards from the edge is an article from The Economist (2013) which sketches some of the technology used in Voyager.  Not mentioned in the other answers, the Error Correcting Codes used to protect weak signals from corruption by electromagnetic noise was also an enabler for the continuing functionality of Voyager. Most ingeniously of all, Dr Stone's team equipped the probes with an advanced bit of hardware called a Reed-Solomon encoder. The device significantly reduced the burden of "error-correction" necessary to ensure that a message can still be read if some of the bits are lost or corrupted during transmission. Originally, the Voyagers used an older, well-tested system that sent one "error-correcting" bit for every bit of the actual message; error correction therefore hogged half the available bandwidth. The Reed-Solomon encoder would enable a single bit to correct for five bits of the message. The rub was that in 1977 a way to decode Reed-Solomon corrected data had yet to be worked out. Luckily, by the time Voyager 2 reached Uranus in 1986, it had been. Updated 72w ago • View Upvotes
