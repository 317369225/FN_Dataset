What are some examples of non-linear novels?
The Golden Notebook by Doris Lessing is a fine and underrated example of a non-linear novel. Anna, the book's protagonist, keeps four journals, each a different color. In the black journal she records her past in Africa, which will become a novel; in the red she records her political experience as a Communist;Â  in yellow she writes of a dying love affair, and in her blue notebook Anna records her emotional life, including a psychological breakdown. The woman is in pieces, mentally. But, in her fifth and golden notebook, Anna tries to reconnect all her disconnected "selves" in one narrative. The novel is her golden notebook. In an orderly yet non-chronological fashion, Lessing weaves together segments from each notebook to produce an ultimately coherent and philosophical life story. http://www.dorislessing.org/theg...
