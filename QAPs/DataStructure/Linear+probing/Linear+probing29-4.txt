How did the Universe begin?
If you hate philosophy stop reading this answer further. Reading Kant can help you with the first two questions. According to him, space and time are the two modes by which our mind structures or rather orders the experiences ( the information that we get from our senses ). There can be no experience that is not categorized in space and time by our mind. In essence every experience is defined by the coordinates space and time. They are like the infinite axes x & y , in whose "coordinate space" all our experiences lie. So, when did time start? Where is the starting point of the infinite x axis?  Where does universe end? Where is the ending point of infinite y axis?   As for the third question - Knowledge is like coke. The more you drink, the more you get thirsty. It's for you to decide when to stop :)
