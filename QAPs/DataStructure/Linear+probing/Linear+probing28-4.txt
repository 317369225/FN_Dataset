What are the most fascinating things researchers and scientists are working on?
I'm biased but by far the most exciting field is Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning. That's because if we were able to replicate our thinking in a computer and then speed it up, it would change everything. In particular, the most exciting is the prospect of our algorithms thinking just like we do, finding new theorems, coming up with new inventions and so on, only 1000x faster, and with access to virtually infinite memory, instant learning capabilities, etc etc. And no, I'm not talking about mapping the brain and replicating it in a computer. I'm talking about extracting the core information processing principles that are realized inside our messy biological brains. Now, the dream of AI has not been realized despite a few decades of research, mostly because, as we found out, it is actually a very very hard problem. To be honest, I don't think anyone has any idea about how we can even approach the problem, or what the underlying principles are. However, I think there is some of light at the end of the tunnel. Over the years we have somewhat shifted our plan of attack from symbolic logic to probabilistic reasoning, and there has been some renewed interest in this goal. Maybe it is time to seriously try again. For example, here are some videos from a recent gathering of leading scientists who discuss the way forward: http://mit150.mit.edu/symposia/b... If we can get this working, it will change everything. Forever. Quite literally.
