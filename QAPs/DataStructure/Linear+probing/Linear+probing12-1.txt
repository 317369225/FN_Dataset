A splinter got stuck in my face 3 months ago. My mom removed it using a needle. There has been a black spot in that part of my face since then, but now I feel my skin roughening in that area and it hurts when pressed. What could be a solution?
Get it checked. It could be a scar due to healing or may be a part is left inside.
