What are the most clever hip-hop one liners of all time?
There are some truly amazing lines on here, I've upvoted a lot of them. But I think Childish Gambino might own the title for best one-liner of all time. "So it's 400 blows to these Truffaut ni**as" -Childish Gambino, "That Power" Even out of the context surrounding the line, it's an amazing reference: Truffaut directed the classic film The 400 Blows which was one of the biggest films of the French New Wave movement; "True Faux" meaning honestly fake. In context, it's slightly more impressive. So it's 400 blows to these Truffaut ni**as Yeah, now that's the line of the century Ni**as missed it, too busy - they lying about penitentiary Man, you ain't been there, Ni**a, you been scared... Intentional or not (and clearly, I think it's intentional) - referencing jail in connection to the 400 blows line is pretty brilliant. The main character in 400 Blows spent a night in jail and was sent to a juvenile detention center in the film. Listen to the song here: http://hypem.com/item/1fq03/Chil...
