What is a map data structure?
A map data structure stores data in key/value pairs, and in the strict definition, each key is unique. A very simple real-life example of how a map data structure works could be addresses / buildings in a town (key = address,  value = building).  Every address would map to a building, providing a quick reference on how to find that building.  Each address also only goes to a single building.  Imagining yourself as the computer, you now have the ability to go to any house you want using a "map" and a building's address. *I realize that not every address goes to a building in real life, but for simplicity let's imagine a town like that.
