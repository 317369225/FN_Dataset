Why are so many psychology results irreproducible?
The field of psychology is so politically charged that the degree of scientific rigor required of most medical disciplines is simply absent. A case and point is the DSM-5, the publication in which all mental disorders are catalogued. This manual is critically important to the field because it determines what disorders therapists can bill insurance for. In other medical disciplines, illnesses are identified and codified by peer review of rigorous studies. The DSM is unburdened by such formalities; instead, classification in the DSM is achieved through campaigns mounted by different factions of psychological theory, by industry forces, and even by outside political influences For example, in 1973, Homosexually was removed from the DSM as a disorder. Homosexuality was obviously not placed in the DSM with rigorous scientific evidence proving it was an illness, and it also was not struck down with rigorous evidence to the contrary. So what changed? Simply put, before 1973 it was popular to think of homosexuality as a treatable illness and after 1973 it was not. Democracy is a wonderful thing, but it is not science. Since then there has been little reform. In large part, this is because it is very difficult to actually prove that phycological disorders exist, much less what causes them. Many popular disorders, like ADHD and Autism, are actually vaguely defined collections of symptoms which may or may not be related. Hopefully this will change soon as neurological imaging becomes more sophisticated and neurology starts to eclipse some of the more intangible (read: fictional) foundations of the field.
