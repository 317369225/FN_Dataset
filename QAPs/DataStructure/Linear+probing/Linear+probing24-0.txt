What are big data project ideas in the field of neuroscience?
Functional Neuroscience as a Big Data Problem The brain is ultra-complex, and as yet, neuroscience is just starting to learn how it works and even what to look for.  A big data approach addresses that by recording massive brain-wide data sets and then using machine learning techniques to locate patterns.  This is one way big data approaches differ from previous methods, which tend to hypothesize a pattern in advance and then attempt to verify, by focused data studies, whether it holds. The following article advocates the big data approach to understanding brain function.  It also defines many of the assumptions that have limited previous studies. Functional Interactions as Big Data in the Human Brain Noninvasive studies of human brain function hold great potential to  unlock mysteries of the human mind. The complexity of data generated by  such studies, however, has prompted various simplifying assumptions  during analysis. Although this has enabled considerable progress, our  current understanding is partly contingent upon these assumptions. An  emerging approach embraces the complexity, accounting for the fact that  neural representations are widely distributed, neural processes involve  interactions between regions, interactions vary by cognitive state, and  the space of interactions is massive. Because what you see depends on  how you look, such unbiased approaches provide the greatest flexibility  for discovery.
