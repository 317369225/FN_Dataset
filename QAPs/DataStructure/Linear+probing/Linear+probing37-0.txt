What kind of research can a freshman undergraduate do in the physics department at most US universities with top physics programs?
In experimental physics research, there are a lot of sub-projects which can be performed by freshman.  Some examples include: Writing programs to communicate with instrumentation and/or analyze data. Plumbing and electrical work which is needed to make experiments work (e.g. soldering, putting together gas or vacuum lines) Researching new equipment to purchase and getting quotes from vendors Machine shop work Taking data on an experiment which is already set up Helping a grad student set up an experiment Helping a grad student analyze data Some of these tasks might sound relatively menial, but they all develop tools that an experimental physicist MUST have in their toolbox.  It is not important what you work on as a freshman, but that you work on something and that you work regularly and long-term (once you find a lab which is a good fit).  By being in a research environment regularly, you will automatically learn the physics relevant to your research.  When you gain more experience (which takes time, especially for undergrads), you will be able to do more independent projects using both the 'blue-collar' skills you learned during your early research and the higher level physics and mathematics you learn in your coursework and in your lab.
