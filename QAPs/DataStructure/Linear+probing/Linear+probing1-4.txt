What algorithms should I know to become a good programmer?
Algorithms is step by step procedure to understand the computer problem clearly. Before we start our one computer program first we have need to submit their algorithms. Algorithms indicate the execution flow of program. There are lots of different type of algorithms. First we should know data structure algorithms. Stack, Queue, Heap, Array are the different type of  linear data structure algorithms. In array there are one dimensional array, two dimensional array and multi dimensional array. You should study all these first. Intro to algorithms,  Binary search, Asymptotic notation, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Recursive algorithms, Merge sort, Quick Sort, GRAPH representation..etc  are the other different type of algorithms. You should also study all these.
