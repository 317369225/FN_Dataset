Is there any importance for scientific computing in electrical engineering?
You touched a very important point. In general the skills needed for research, engineering or industrial careers are very different.  If I take electrcal power systems (my field of expertise) if one is planning to do research, scientific computing is a must have skill, simulations are done by solving problems such as differential equations, non linear programming or machine learning. to do this you have to master programming,  numerics, math physics and deep understanding of the different phenomenon related to the field... matlab can be very helpful, fortran or cpp if calculation time is an issue, software engineering if he plan to make his simulation software (most of professional software begin as research project).  Industrial and engineering field prefer professional softwares (PSSE, neplan pscad ...) so no deep knowledge of computer science is need. The common thing between the two careers is a deep understanding of phenomena and capacity to extract useful informations from scars data.
