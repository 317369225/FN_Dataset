What did Marshall McLuhan mean by hot and cool media?
My understanding has been along the lines of resolution - that is, how much work the 'audience' needs to do to fill in the gaps to create the fuller picture. So Hot media is very high resolution - there isn't any space that the viewer needs to fill in to understand a photograph. On the other hand, a cartoon - that consists of a simple circle to represent an eye, a few squiggles to represent the hair and the top of the head, and a curved line to convey a smile - is low resolution; the viewer has to understand and interpret the information there to create the whole picture. Media that involve more than one sense tend to be Cool - because the audience has to actively interpret different signals from different senses (for example, matching the voices with the actors, or processing audio information about what is happening off screen.) So there is a kind of active/passive role that the audience has to take - which is quite different to the active/passive split we tend to talk about today, comparing something like TV to interactive media. In Hot media, the audience is passively consuming what is presented. In Cool media, the audience has to actively analyse and interpret what is presented to make sense of what they see and hear.
