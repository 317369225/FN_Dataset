How did the Universe begin?
We are actually still working these things out.  Hence the study of Cosmology[1] It is generally understood to begin with the Big Bang, followed almost instantaneously by cosmic inflation - an expansion of space from which the universe is thought to have emerged ~13.7±0.2×10^9 (roughly 13.7–13.9 billion) years ago.[1] Where did the Big Bang "come from" is still being debated.  There a number of theories and little to no proof.[6] The shape of The Universe is interesting. When you look at the sky, there is no preferential center to the coordinate system. [2]  There simply doesn't seem to be a "center of the Universe". The recent Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) measurements have led NASA to state, "We now know that the universe is flat with only a 0.5% margin of error."[1] Within the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) model, the presently most popular shape of the Universe found to fit observational data according to cosmologists is the infinite flat model,[2] while other FLRW models that fit the data include the Poincaré dodecahedral space[3][4] and the Picard horn.[5] The local geometry is the curvature describing any arbitrary point in the observable universe (averaged on a sufficiently large scale). Many astronomical observations, such as those from supernovae and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, show the observable universe to be very close to homogeneous and isotropic and infer it to be accelerating. The above statement basically mean, anywhere you look on a large scale, The Universe looks the same and is of the same "density"  There isn't a huge empty portion and super dense portion when you look at the visible Universe as a "whole". The Universe is expanding fairly rapidly, a discovery made by Edwin Hubble who observed the majority of galaxies and celestial object were red shifted and therefore moving away from our galaxy. [3] Matter seem to occupy the areas were dark matter energy were/are. Dark matter comprises the bulk of the mass of the universe[4].  We know this through observational inferences and a considerable amount of the work in particle physics in trying to define what "it is".[4] 3D map of the large-scale distribution of dark matter, reconstructed from measurements of weak gravitational lensing with the Hubble Space Telescope A simulation of the filament-like distribution of Dark Matter in the Universe[5] The cosmic microwave background spectrum measured by the FIRAS instrument on the COBE satellite is the most-precisely measured black body spectrum in nature[6] don't know how the universe will end or when[3].  As it appears now, The Universe will continue to expand and stars and galaxies born, decay, and explode until The Universe is so diffuse it goes black. We estimate The Universe is expanding at: The newly refined value for the Hubble constant is 74.3 plus or minus 2.1 kilometers per second per megaparsec.   [7] As the Universe expands, the density of radiation and ordinary and dark matter declines more quickly than the density of dark energy (see equation of state) and, eventually, dark energy dominates. Specifically, when the scale of the universe doubles, the density of matter is reduced by a factor of 8, but the density of dark energy is nearly unchanged (it is exactly constant if the dark energy is a cosmological constant). Current observations indicate that the dark energy density is already greater than the mass-energy density of radiation and matter (including dark matter). In models where dark energy is a cosmological constant, the universe will expand exponentially with time from now on, coming closer and closer to a de Sitter spacetime. In this scenario the time it takes for the linear size scale of the universe to expand to double its size is approximately 11.4 billion years. Eventually all galaxies beyond our own local supercluster will redshift so far that it will become hard to detect them, and the distant universe will turn dark. In other models, the density of dark energy changes with time. In quintessence models it decreases, but more slowly than the energy density in ordinary matter and radiation. In phantom energymodels it increases with time, leading to a big rip. [1]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cos... [2]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha... [3]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acc...
