How difficult is it to understand the math used in theoretical physics?
actually its not the "math" which is difficult to understand, because the concepts are easy when you study just mathematics but WHY the hell you are using it and where to use what is difficult to understand. For instance, many people don't understand where to use partial differentiation and where just differentiation, some places some quantities are neglected and some places they are not.Â  Take ohm's law, V=IR, according to maths, if you multiply resistance with 2 then voltage is also suppose to get doubled, but practically it won't happen. All i can say is, of course mathematics is the language of physics but still we have a difference between these two.
