Why is consciousness considered to be the final frontier of science?
If science can explain consciousness it will be have finally become all encompassing. Right now science is the only game in town for explaining the motion of matter and energy. It doesn't have all the answers, but at this point it would be hard to imagine what a satisfactory non-scientific explanation would be. There is though, this one gaping hole. Consciousness. We know that experience, per se, is real; we experience. In some capacity our sensation of pain is real, and the reality of that pain requires an explanation above and an account of  neural signal processing. Attacking this problem will require science to break into wholly new realms with wholly new methods. In so doing it will either make a leap in terms of  explanatory power rivalling any other past leap, or it will fail leaving a bleeding wound in magisterium leaving a real gap for another system of knowledge. Either outcome would be grand human achievement. ["author's" note. I used a tone more grandiose than I really like because I was trying to convey the sentiment of an answer to the question as posed. Even as I use my energy to follow consciousness studies I think there are many other avenues of scientific inquiry just as exciting for different reasons.]
