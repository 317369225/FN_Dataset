What are examples of great scientific books that introduced the public to revolutionary concepts?
Introduction to VLSI System Design (1980) ushered the Mead & Conway revolution. It would not be an exaggeration to thank this book for 15-20 generations of semiconductor chips, although some people considered the contribution trivial at the time. The Mythical Man-Month has been a very influential book on managing large SW development projects.
