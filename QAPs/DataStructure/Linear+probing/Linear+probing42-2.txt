Is there any importance for scientific computing in electrical engineering?
The short answer is, it depends. For lots of work, a few simple equations and the use of available simulation software when needed will get you by just fine.  For other work, knowledge of the deep math is essential. The question is, what aspect of this is fun for you?  The concepts?  The Math?  What kind of stuff do you want to create? No matter what anyone tells you, the field of Electrical Engineering is extremely huge and vast.  You could spend multiple lifetimes of study and not learn all there is to know about the discipline, which is why everybody specializes.  Even the 'generalists' who dabble in lots of things only learn bits of a small number of the broad range of specialties.  The good news is, there is something for most everyone, so find your passion and enjoy the run. Side note: As you start your career, consider reading an article I wrote from the perspective of an older hardware engineer (one of the quadrants of Electrical Engineering with its own host of specialties) (The value of an older Hardware Engineer.)
