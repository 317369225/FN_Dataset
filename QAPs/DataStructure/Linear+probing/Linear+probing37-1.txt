What kind of research can a freshman undergraduate do in the physics department at most US universities with top physics programs?
There is scope for much research (in my opinion) even in undergraduate physics (maybe not freshman, but senior or at least sophomore). With just a good knowledge of Linear Algebra, PDE and calculus, one can probe a plethora of problems (not just textbook ones) in basic areas which might yield very interesting and instructive results. For example, one of my friends has contributed a very insightful paper to AJP (accepted but not yet published) on tunneling through a one dimensional piece-wise constant potential barrier. He does not use, say Quantum Field theory. The mathematics (he invented a neat method to multiply 2x2 matrices!) and Physics (discovered an effect he named as alias effect) he uses would be accessible to an undergraduate physics student, requiring only care and attention to demystify.
