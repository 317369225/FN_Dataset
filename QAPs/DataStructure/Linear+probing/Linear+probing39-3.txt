What can we expect to happen to humans in 1,000  years?
I think that spectacular advancements in bio-technology will result in dramatic increases in human lifespan, resulting in sudden and severe population explosions beyond the capabilities of the world's resources, already stretched thin today.  Wars, famine, disease and severe weather events caused by global warming will combine to worsen the human condition over time and threaten the survival of our species.
