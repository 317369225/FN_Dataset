Why is consciousness considered to be the final frontier of science?
I think it's because consciousness is fundamental to energy and matter. It is the basic building block of reality. As such we will need a daring new kind of science that maps what we explore with our consciousness. Instruments can't go where the mind can. This is where spirituality, science, mysticism, psychology, and psychedelics will meet. It doesn't appear to be very popular to think that consciousness exists independent of the brain among the science community but this seems to be what things like NDE research are forcing us to consider.
