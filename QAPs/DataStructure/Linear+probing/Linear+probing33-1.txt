Why are so many psychology results irreproducible?
Replicating research ​ 1. Psychology is dealing with an emergent phenomena called mind. The biggest advantage with studying brain is; it can be experimentally studied and to certain extent analysed in a reductionism/ top down/ bottom up approach. 2. Behavioral studies can be done in evolutionarily simpler organisms and extrapolated. 3. Psychological studies are heavily subjective and all the questionnaires are just tools to probe the mind and get data out. The age old averaging demon is a huge concern. 4. Unlike classical studies that works for physics, math and chemistry; in neural science research there is no linearity or modular approach. 5. Similar issues pop up when we study emergent/chaotic/dynamical systems. The crux of all these issues lies in the fact that "we don't know how mind works unlike how brain works". If we don't know what we are looking for, how can we measure them? IMITATION SCIENCE: A huuuuge blog. Updated 22w ago • View Upvotes
