What is a good and/or established alternative term for the kind of free will that many people imagine as being incompatible with determinism?
Not sure this is what you're looking for, but the two main categories of thought in this area aside from incompatiblism are called compatiblism and libertarian free will. In my opinion,Â  compatiblism is really incompatiblism that just redefined the terms to mean something else. Libertarian free will (not to be confused with the completely unrelated american political movement) is the idea that we are free to make choices unconstrained by determinism. There are several kinds of this. My problem with the whole free will discussion is that I'm generally ignostic about it. No one really presents a coherent definition of what the idea even means or could mean. Most discussions about it are meaningless noise as a result.
