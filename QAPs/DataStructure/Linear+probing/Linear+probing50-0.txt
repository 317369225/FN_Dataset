Why are ultrasound machines expensive?
The expense comes from three sources. Unavoidable equipment costs (10-40% of the marked cost), costs associated with mandatory regulatory approval/testing and infrastructural+management+RnD+margins charges. Note that an ultrasound can be used for full-body diagnostics. That allows it to be treated as a key capital expense with its own operator training-requirements/grades/examinations related industry. This also forces equipment manufacturers to use the highest grade reliability components and create absolutely turnkey systems. There's a lot of cross-licensing required to maintain interfaces across manufacturers. I can only talk about material costs here. The equipment cost is primarily focused on the DSP h/w and s/w. You have around 256 transmit/receive channels controlled by a H/V mux/switch circuit which is used in beamforming and synthetic aperture synthesis and acquisition. The probe itself has as many H/V piezoelectric elements (expensive material) that create the RF waves synthesis/sense elements (~3/5K). H/V power amplifiers with low THD/voltage slew rates/excellent signal characteristics are expensive (~10K). The knowledge/experience base required to create these systems is not commodity and requires premium (PhD level) training. Then you have on-top costs that come from display, storage, networking, retrieval hardware that are usually subject to high quality control processes (such components may not be the commodity items we find on Amazon, for example).

Such components may also be subject to deep inventory controls, shelf-life regulations, and end-to-end (component sourcing to customer sites) tracking. Since these are generally specialized and not high volumes components, they are also subject to premium pricing. Then there are probe design and specific imaging-modality related costs. For example, we have small parts, endorectal, micro-convex/linear, phased array, mechanical-scanning multi-element designs among others. Some of these require custom transmit/receive beamformer h/w and the general purpose probe PCB designs don't work. This also ends up adding costs to machines. This is good reading: FDA.gov Information for Manufacturers Seeking Marketing Clearance of Diagnostic Ultrasound Systems and Transducers A few startups (Mobisante) that operate in this arena have started to scale the prices down by using commodity components (DSP app processor + smartphone-grade core processor, input/output and display systems) and software-driven lower-resolution aperture synthesis specifically designed for field diagnostics. Lower-end equipment from China is obviously cheaper, and also not FDA approved. Their lower-prices reflect lower reliability/lower lifetime components, designs, and testing.
