A splinter got stuck in my face 3 months ago. My mom removed it using a needle. There has been a black spot in that part of my face since then, but now I feel my skin roughening in that area and it hurts when pressed. What could be a solution?
Get an ultrasound done from a centre having good machine and high frequency linear probe. It will tell if there is any foreign body remaining. If something is found get it removed.
