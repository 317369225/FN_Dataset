What are the most fascinating things researchers and scientists are working on?
Scientists are are developing technology that can give us flying cars, help us colonize mars, or build floating cities in the clouds.  If successful it will fundamentally change humanity in the same way as making fire, the printing press, and the steam engine. This is the EmDrive. Today, when we go to space, we have to haul stuff (usually a gas) with us to throw out of the spacecraft at high speed to make us move where we want to go.  Hauling that stuff is expensive, so we give our spacecraft a little push in the direction we want to go and coast the rest of the way there.  It works, but it is slow.  All of this is because we are limited in how much propellant gas we can carry. So here's the exciting bit.  There is a very smart fellow named Roger J. Shawyer who has spent the last dozen years trying to get people to believe that he built a device that breaks this rule.  NASA recently tested it, and it looks like he did.   (NASA Technical Report) The way it works is by bouncing microwaves around in a special resonant chamber.  As the microwaves echo their frequency is gradually reduced.  The energy from this reduction in frequency appears to be directly converted into motion through some fiddly quantum mechanics bits.  Maybe.  The physics model to explain it doesn't exist yet. If I were starting college today, this would be my life's work. It has the possibility of fundamentally changing the world.
