How did the Universe begin?
The universe began with a Big Bang that: Isn't an explosion; Had no visible light; and wasn't heard. Shortly after there was a period of inflation with no money involved. Then we had the Dark Ages when there was a higher density of electromagnetic radiation, including light, than there has ever been since. At this point the first generation of stars came into existence but they didn't twinkle because there was: No atmosphere to make them twinkle; No planet to have an atmosphere; and No being to admire the show! Elements heavier than Hydrogen and Helium began to be created by fusion in the stars, and even heavier elements were created by those stars exploding at the end of their life. This allowed for a second generation of stars that had planets. We are currently on our third generation of stars including the Sun that have at least one planet, namely Earth, that was formed from these heavier elements from earlier generations of stars. Earth includes life and human beings which together with Hydrogen from the Big Bang is made of these heavier elements. As Carl Sagan said in his 1973 book, The Cosmic Connection: Our Sun is a second- or third-generation star. All of the rocky and metallic material we stand on, the iron in our blood, the calcium in our teeth, the carbon in our genes were produced billions of years ago in the interior of a red giant star. We are made of star-stuff.
