Why is consciousness considered to be the final frontier of science?
Because science hasn't explained it yet. We've explained the universe's origins and so many other things, but not consciousness. We have little knowledge as to how the brain forms consciousness. Thus, it is the final frontier, as it is at the edge of our scientific knowledge. Speaking of consciousness, I need to rest my little grey cells.
