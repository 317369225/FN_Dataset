What is "tensor calculus" and why did Einstein need it for some of his theories?
Take the idea of vectors (multicomponent mathematical quantities that transform according to specific rules) and imagine that the components themselves are vectors. There you have a general idea of tensors. (Vectors are considered tensors of rank 1.)   Tensor calculus is need it to do calculations in space-time which may be curved.  Here the calculations need to take into accounts effects due to the curvature of the underlying region as well as the physics and geometry germane to the situation. Imagine trying to do geometry on a trampoline dented by a baseball. Not only do you need to take into account the mathematical relations among the quantities themselves, but how the curvature of the underlying surface contributes to the result.
