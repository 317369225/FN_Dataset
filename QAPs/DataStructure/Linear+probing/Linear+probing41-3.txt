What are good ways to increase employee engagement?
Engaged employees are those who have a sense of belonging to their workplace, and who hold themselves accountable for the company's performance. One of the most effective ways of ensuring engagement could be to keep the motivation levels of your employees high. Monetary rewards in terms of salary hikes and bonuses are definitely motivating for employees to work harder and stick to a company, but research has shown if you want your best employees to stick around for long, you will have to plan your strategy in a way that focuses on a number of non-monetary rewards as well. Four key areas where companies provide rewards are monetary compensation, personal development, organizational attributes and benefits. Below are a few tips that can be helpful in ensuring that your best employees are happy and consistent with delivering great results: 1. Give them opportunities to learn and grow. 2. Provide your employees a flexible work environment. 3. Always give due recognition to high performers in front of a large number of people, so that they feel valued. 4. Motivate your employees by making them feel that their decisions and initiatives play a key role in defining the overall success of your organization. 5. There is nothing which is less motivating than the prospect of 9 hours of drudgery. You need to make the office a place employees love to go to work, so make sure you keep the FUN element alive!
