How far can a probe be sent into space before it loses all communication links?
Information theoretically: nearly no limit (width of the known universe), but the bit rate gets less the further you go. It's all based on a number of information engineering compromises. I'm not a communication systems engineer, but depending on the amount of power you have (you must keep the inverse square law in mind: you have to show me that you really appreciate the problem with this limit), you could send a laser 2M light years to galaxy M31 (Andromeda), and send intelligible pulses in the visible wave lengths. You can improve collection using lenses or parabolic reflectors. You only have to apply error correcting codes and made certain that you have a clear line of sight (not too much dust). And you could go billions of light years. But it's all going to take time. And your energy source needs to last the travel time. Your mistakes in understanding will all start linearly. This is all quadratic and power law (O(n^4)).
