Competitive Programming:Â What is the quickest way to create a simple HashMap in C for use in the proof of concept programs?
For programming competitions / online judges where you can't use non-standard libraries, you have to implement your own hash table. In my competitive programming experience, in the couple of problems where a hash table was the only way to go (afaik), linear probing was enough. This does not require much code and it is a nice exercise for you. Pro-tip: if you do implement this simple hash table yourself, you'll understand all the details and probably be able to implement it in the future without looking up any resource.
