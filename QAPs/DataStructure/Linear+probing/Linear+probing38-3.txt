Is it true that the universe is a self-containing black hole?
The Universe being inside a black hole is more correct than the Inflationary Cosmology/Big Bang/Cosmological Constant (BB) model since it accounts for the preferred spin of the Universe. Was the universe born spinning? "The universe was born spinning and continues to do so around a preferred axis" Â  I think our Universe being a larger version of a black hole polar jet is more correct than our Universe being a black hole itself. Our Universe spins around a preferred axis because it is a larger version of a black hole polar jet. It's not this: It's this: Dark energy is evaporated matter emitted into the Universal jet. 'First stars' in the image above is where the pressure associated with the evaporated matter emitted into the Universal jet causes the evaporated matter to condense back into particles of matter. The lid in the pressure cooker image below is analogous of 'First stars'. The particles of steam moving outward and away from the pressure cooker emission point is analogous of the particles of matter moving outward and away from the Universal jet emission point. Our Universe's spin about a preferred axis, the directionality of galaxy clusters, our Universe being open, very large scale anisotropies, anomalous alignments, and non-Gaussian distributions all refute the BB model and are evidence of our Universal jet.
