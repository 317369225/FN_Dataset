Why are so many psychology results irreproducible?
Consider all the chemicals interacting within your thinking and emotive producing system. Then consider all the interrupted and missing neural paths that must be bypassed through a uniquely different set of neural paths so that you can function. In addition think of what knowledge you have that others do not have. What you have then is a person no one can understand completely because no one can predict all the little specifics of that person and thinking without knowing exactly why that person thinks and acts the way that she/he/it does.       Psychologists then poll or interview a certain number of subject people all having different chemical signals passed through their own unique neural path ways. The very fact that many people agree on many things within these studies is astonishing.       Psychologists then use a generality template based on these studies and expect a similar outcome when testing another group of people based on that template. The fact that they are surprised by the different result on the repeat test should be the surprise.        Any system of "science" (in this case psychology) creating experimental data from either polling or interviews must inevitability be skewed each time an experiment is attempted. Not only is there the problem of individuals in one group being different from individuals of a second group there is the problem of the testing itself. There is always risks of dishonesty of some the interviewed, dishonesty of some of the interviewers, and the dishonesty of some of the compilers of the data. In overall effect these differences in experimental outcome from past experimental outcomes should be expected more often than not.
