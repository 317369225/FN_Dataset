How is a proton beam produced?
The basic premise is you have a tube with electrodes arranged along its length.  You then have a proton injector that deposits a proton near the first electrode.  You set the electrode up to have a negative charge to pull the proton towards it. As the proton passes, you switch the electrode to positive to repel the proton and switch the next electrode to negative to attract the proton. Rapidly repeat this process and the result is a stream of protons rushing out the end of the tube like a beam. The electric force accelerates the protons, so the velocity can be controlled. To get the protons near the speed of light requires a tube almost two miles long. To save space, the tube can be circular so that the protons do multiple laps, but that requires very strong (super conducting) electromagnets to bend the proton in its path.
