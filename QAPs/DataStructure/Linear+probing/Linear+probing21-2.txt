What are examples of great scientific books that introduced the public to revolutionary concepts?
Hofstadter's GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid. In a strange but fascinating way it deals with topics related to cognitive science (emerging as a discipline at the time the book was published), artificial intelligence, mathematical logic etc. It won Pulitzer prize for nonfiction, and has inspired quite a few people to become researchers in these fields.
