What are good ways to increase employee engagement?
You just performed one of your semi-annual employee engagement surveys in an effort to find out what your employees think and feel about the workplace. And, much to your delight, most of the results are positive. Sounds familiar?  In fact, practically all of them are. Seems a little too good to be true? It probably is. While positive comments and reviews are all well and good, you can’t solve a problem you don’t know exists. Surveys are always top-down and as such aren’t the ideal way to elicit genuine — and helpful — feedback from folks who matter most to your company or your team: your employees. Our customers want to increase employee engagement and they always tell us  they are looking for a real-time, anonymous feedback forum designed to give employees a true voice in the workplace and engage them in decision-making on an ongoing manner.  That is the only way management and HR can get the true truth, crazy innovative ideas and generally a trustworthy and continuous heartbeat for their company. In fact, they realize, everyone is interested in talking about what's working and not in the workplace, and to help improve the company or project teams! And they are able to surface issues and topics they are never able to know of otherwise.
