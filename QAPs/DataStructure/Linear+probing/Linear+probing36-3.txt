Werner Heisenberg, one of the fathers of quantum mechanics, once said, “The universe is not made of things but of vibrational energy networks, emerging from something even more profound and subtle.” So, does that mean that our thoughts too are mere energy?
If you consider energy to be "mere" then I highly recommend you read a bit of science history: "Energy, the Subtle Concept" by Jennifer Coopersmith. I am a little confused at how you take a quote from someone as your premise, and then draw a hypothesis from it that is completely at odds with the quote. This seems illogical. By this I mean Heisenberg in this quote considered energy to arise from something quite profound and subtle, which would logically preclude describing it as "mere" as you go on to do. Back to your question "Are thoughts energy". Our best theories of the universe (Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity) are built on the idea that there exists "stuff" subject to a process (it moves around) and the process (how it can and cannot move) is described by physical law. This moving stuff happens to have a property called energy which is conserved. Since our brains are made from this stuff and subject to these laws, our thoughts are indeed a conserved energetic process, but to describe a thought as energy is a gross oversimplification since it cannot describe how one thought is different from another. Thoughts are an emergent property of how energy flows around our brain; yes it is subject to the basic laws of nature, but it is also constrained by circumstance (the present detailed structure and shape of our brain), and as it changes over time, so we record memories in that structure, and the process of change we call thinking. At this point I am now way out of my depth and would refer you to a neuroscientist.
