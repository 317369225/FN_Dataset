What do I need to work on to get a Google/Quora summer internship? I'm a CSE freshman.
it doesnt matter how much language you know, you can even get selected with one language like C. google always want the best coders and problem solver. they will expect you to solve any problems that they give optimally. this is what you need to do. First start learning Linear data structures and algorithms. Arrays Linked List Stack Queues Then move to basic algorithms : Sorting - Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Number of inversions Matrix Multiplication (just know the algo if not implement it) Prime Sieving Modular Math including multiplication and division Euclidean Algorithm for GCD, Modular Inverse, Fast Exponentiation Fibonacci number with matrix multiplication Probability distribution and expected value Stats - Mean, Median, Variance, Bayes theorem The one can learn some popular algorithmic techniques: Divide and Conquer - Binary Search, Maximum Subarray Greedy Algorithms - Activity Selection, Huffman encoding Dynamic Programming - Matrix Bracketing, Knapsack, Linear Programming - Variable Maximisation, Linear time sorting String Algorithms - Manacher, LCS, Edit Distance Then comes some typical data structures: Trees - Binary Tree, General Tree, Lowest Common Ancestor Binary Search Tree - Inorder Traversal, Level order traversal, finding kth largest element, diameter, depth, number of nodes, etc. Heaps - Array Implementation, Heapify, Heap Sort Union Find Hash Table - Linear Probing, Open addressing, Collision avoidance Then you can learn about Graphs: Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix, Weighted Edge Graphs Basic Traversal algos - Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, etc Shortest Path Finding Algorithm - Dijkstra, Floyd Warshal, Bellman Ford Minimum Spanning Tree - Kruskal's Algo, Prim's Algo By this time you are already pretty good with programming. You will do better than most of undergrad CS students. Advance Tree and Graph : Balanced Trees - AVL, Red-Black Heavy Light Decomposition, B+ Trees, Quad Tree Advance Graph - Min Cut, Max Flow Maximum Matching - Hall's Marriage Hamiltonian Cycle Edge Graphs / Line Graphs Strongly Connected Components Dominant Sub-Graph, Vertex Cover, Travelling Salesman - Approx algos Advance String Algorithms : Knuth Morris Pratt Algorithm Rabin Karp Algorithm Tries and Compressed Tries Prefix Trees, Suffix Trees, Suffix Automation - Ukokken's Algorithm Advance Math: Fast Fourier Tranformation Primality Testing Computational Geometry - Closest point pair, Voronoi diagram, Convex Hull General Advance topics : Iterating through all combination / permutation Bit manipulation at your free time visit websites like topcoder, codechef, hackerrank, hackearth etc and start coding. use sites like GeeksforGeeks | A computer science portal for geeksÂ  to learn Datastructures and algorithms. eventually you will be good at programming. all the best!
