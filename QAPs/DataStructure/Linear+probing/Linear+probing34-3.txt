How can Voyager send a signal strong enough for us to receive, in spite of its enormous distance from us?
Nothing has traveled "really far" into interstellar space. We have some probes that have gone beyond the boundary of the solar system, and that's certainly far enough anyway! The space probes have radio antennas on them that they keep pointed at Earth using gyroscopes. Here's the New Horizons spacecraft that went to Pluto -- as you can see, the main antenna is the biggest thing on it. It's 2.1 meters across. It also has two others that can be used as backups, although they're less efficient. Believe it or not, the transmitter aboard the craft uses only 12 watts, and the signal that it receives from Earth is only a millionth of a billionth of a watt. In order to receive the signal from it on Earth, we use the NASA Deep Space Network , a collection of radio antennas around the world. Only the biggest ones can detect that signal from New Horizons; they're 70 meters across. There's a good article about New Horizons here: Talking to Pluto is hard! Why it takes so long to get data back from New Horizons
