Is there any importance for scientific computing in electrical engineering? I suggest your exposure to the different facets of electrical engineering has been limited. Most of the electrical engineers I have worked with have been very well versed in what might be called scientific computing or what I would call basic electrical engineering computing. This includes: radar signal processing for not only weapons, but ground mapping and remote sensing (things like ocean wave height, snow pack height, foliage, etc) communications signal processing for space probes, radio, cell phone, troposcatter internet of things sensor collection and processing remote sensing for process control and data collection system simulation for linear and nonlinear system, control algorithms, etc collecting huge amounts of data in a short period of time, These are just off the top of my head. Electrical engineers have always been near the forefront of requiring more intensive computing to build the next generation of equipment.
