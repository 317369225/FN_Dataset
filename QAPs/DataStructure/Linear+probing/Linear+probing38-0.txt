Is it true that the universe is a self-containing black hole?
There is another HUGE problem with these types of models that hasn't been discussed, but the reasoning is subtle. Not to sound mean, but black hole cosmology is incorrect, barring some major retooling of the theory that allows it to circumvent problems that are immediate and obvious to anyone trying to really put our cosmological models under scrutiny. Allow me to try and explain. So, in a black-hole cosmology, the expansion rate [math]a(t)[/math], has to be linear with time [math]a(t) \sim t[/math]. This is forced by the fact that the Hubble radius of the observable Universe must be the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole. Some theorists claim that such a model is an even better fit to supernova data that directly probes the expansion rate. But here is the problem: the sky surveys we have conducted ALREADY reject this model, given what we know about structure formation. Remember, a theory has to work not only with supernovae but also with the entire ensemble of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the CMB that we observe, the formation of all of which are ultimately driven by cosmology. And if we had linear expansion throughout the entire history of the Universe we know that we would observe far more high mass galaxy clusters than we do now. And it is not even close. So while one probe of cosmology may be consistent with this model the other probes are definitely not, and any viable model has to explain not only the supernova data but literally the entire structure of the Universe. Our current model of dark matter and dark energy does work to the extent that the data allow us to test it. Rest assured that black hole cosmology does not survive real scrutiny to the data, and anyone that tries to convince you otherwise simply doesn't understand the data. Updated 117w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
