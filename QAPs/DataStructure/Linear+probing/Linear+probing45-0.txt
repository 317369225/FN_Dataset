What is plasmonics and is it part of condensed matter physics?
Plasmonics is essentially a fancy term for the optics of metals. Typically when working at long radio-frequency wavelengths metals can be simply approximated as perfect electric conductors. But at visible and near-infrared wavelengths this doesn't apply. The real part of the complex permittivity is still negative, but the conductivity is not the huge value it used to be. Various physical phenomeneh emerge as a result, such as surface plasmon polariton waves at the interfaces of metals and dielectrics, and localized surface plasmon resonances in metallic nanoparticles. How plasmonics is categorized depends on your definition of condensed matter. See Inna Vishik's answer to How is AMO different from CM? for more about classification. The plasmonics community today is made up of physicists, materials scientists, electrical and optical engineers, chemists and chemical engineers. It's very interdisciplinary, and is studied from many angles.
