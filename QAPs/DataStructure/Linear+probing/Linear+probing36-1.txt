Werner Heisenberg, one of the fathers of quantum mechanics, once said, “The universe is not made of things but of vibrational energy networks, emerging from something even more profound and subtle.” So, does that mean that our thoughts too are mere energy?
I would hesitate to derive from Heisenberg's comment about the nature of the physical universe a conclusion about the nature of thoughts. Heisenberg would have no doubt acknowledged that the brain is composed of elementary particles that are ultimately "more profound and subtle" than the classical notion of material things. But he did not view the nature of thought as being reducible to physical matter. Rather, he views matter and mind as complementary aspects of reality: In the philosophy of Descartes, the antithesis between res cogitans and res extensa played a decisive part, and the bifurcation of the world expressed in this pair of concepts has had a most powerful influence on the thought of succeeding centuries. In the physics of quantum theory, this antithesis looks rather different from what it did before. It appears less abrupt. ...The areas in question may exclude one another but they also supplement each other, so that only through the interplay between them does the full unity become apparent. ...In comparison with classical physics, the quantum theory therefore manifestly departs from that rather too abrupt Cartesian division of the world. —Heisenberg, Werner.
