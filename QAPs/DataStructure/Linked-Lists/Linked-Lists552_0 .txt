What is the use of structure in linked list?I dont understand your question what is the use of a structure? A structure is a complex data type declaration that defines a physically grouped list of variables to be placed under one name in a block of memory, allowing the different variables to be accessed. For maintaining a linked list, in order to maintain different kinds of datatypes along with a pointer(for maintaining links) defining a struct is the best method. For a linked list the struct definition looks like: struct lnode {int data; struct node *next; }; 88 Views
