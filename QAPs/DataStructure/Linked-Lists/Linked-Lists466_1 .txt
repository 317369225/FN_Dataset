How do I go about inserting elements into a linked list within a linked list?You can add elements to the individual paths like you do in a normal list. Think of the pathStart pointers as the head pointers of the individual lists of each RoomNode. So travel the roomnode list and reach the desired roomnode. If the pathStart pointer is empty, create a newpath node and add it to the node's list. Otherwise traverse the path list for that node. It should be something like this : Create a new room node RoomNodeStruct *newroomnode = new RoomNodeStruct[sizeof(RoomNodeStruct)]; newroomnode -> roomNumber = x; newroomnode -> pathStart = 0; newroomnode -> next = 0; Creating an individual path for a roomnode PathNodeStruct *newpathnode = new PathNodeStruct[sizeof(PathNodeStruct)]; newroomnode -> pathStart = newpathnode; Adding to position y in room x's path RoomNodeStruct *roomitr = head; //head of the roomnode list int pos = 0; while(pos < x) // x is the roomnumber whose path you want to add to { roomitr = roomitr->next; pos++; } PathNodeStruct *pathitr = roomitr -> pathStart; //get the head of the roomnodes pathlist pos = 0; while(pos < y) //y is the position in the path list you want to insert at { pathitr = pathitr -> next; pos++; } 290 Views
