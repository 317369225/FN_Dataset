How do I exchange kth element from head to kth element from tail in java linked list without using any java API of Java linked list?Assuming that you don't have any special implementations (where you store size, etc.), here's a simple way to do it: 1. Get address of the kth node by travelling from the head down the list. Call this N1. 2. Reverse the linked list. 3. Traverse from the new head down the linked list to get the new kth node. Call this N2. 4. Reverse the linked list. 5. Swap the data in N1 and N2. The main reason that this works is that in the process of reversing the linked list, you don't change the addresses of the individual nodes, just the pointers pointing to them. 95 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Umesh Naik
