Why should the first node (the head) of a linked list be declared as a pointer rather than as an object of the structure or class?Conceptually a linked list should conjure the image of a linked chain. The front of the list is the part you hold. Break any link on the list without recording the broken link's address and you lose that chain and anything connected to it into memory. Since nothing points to those elements you create a memory leak. Treat the pointer to the head as another link which does not hold any data. 38 Views  Answer requested by Romeo Bismarck
