How do I identify a loop in a singly-linked list?The problem with this question is that the tortoise and hare algorithm has no real disadvantages. It is the same as the (also pretty intuitive) iterative deepening algorithm that Michal suggested in that the two pointers are invariantly kept within a factor two of each other while they are moved further and further out - but it is much more elegant. It is really a perfect algorithm. Of course you can play around with the number of steps that tortoise and hare make each iteration, but it would uglify your code and yield very limited benefits whatever your application. 717 Views  View Upvotes
