Why is LinkedList faster than ArrayList? How else do they compare?Both have their strengths and weaknesses. Arrays An array is great for accessing data (O(1)), but not great if you're entering or removing data frequently. If you need to add an element and keep the data sorted, you may have to shift quite a few elements. That gets expensive. Linked-List Conversely, linked lists are great for "much data come, much data go."* They're also useful because of dynamic sizing. When it comes to accessing an element, a linked-list can be more expensive than an array (ties if you access head of the linked-list). In short, Array: great when "little data in, little data out"* Linked-List: great when "much data come, much data go"* Like all data structures, there is no panacea*, which can best address all needs. * attributed to one of my professors, Dr. Koh 89 Views
