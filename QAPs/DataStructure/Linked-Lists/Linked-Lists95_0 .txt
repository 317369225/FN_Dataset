In Java, how can I link the names of two players with the objects that are instances of another class with their object ID (like a linked list)?If the both names belong to the same class say Player, where Player player1 = new Player(); Player player2 = new Player(); List<Player> players = new LinkedList<Player>(); players.add(player1); players.add(player2); If these are two different objects originating from two different classes, using a LinkedList is a bad design implementation choice. Can you be more specific? 137 Views
