What are the key points of Linked List in Data Structure?A linked list is a linear data structure that can grow and shrink dynamically. the Key points you need to remember while using linked list are: Advantages:  1.A linked list can have any number of elements(if your computer memory lets the way).  2.Any element can be added to the list and deleted from the list in runtime.  3.pretty helpful when you cant predict your list size.  4.Linked list helps to implement many other data structures like trees,graphs,etc,.  5.you can bind any number of data you want within a single cell.  6.stack and queue can be best implemented in linked list. Disadvantages:  1.Memory allocation is not contiguous.This restricts random access.  2.Searching and deleting elements is time consuming.  3.Not good when list size is fixed.  4.Consumes more memory space , since each cell needs to store additional information which is the address(c/c++) or reference(non c/c++ languages) of the cell it points to(it can point one or more). 203 Views
