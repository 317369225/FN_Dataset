What would be the algorithm to find the middle element of the linked list without using an integer variable? Do not assume that the number of nodes is given.Node *temp1=root; Node *temp2=root; While(temp2!=null) { temp1=temp1->next; temp2=temp2->next; if(temp2!=NULL) temp2=temp2->next } return temp1; Logic is to traverse a node twice and other one for single time,by the time temp2 is null temp1 will be in middle. EDIT 1: Thanks For suggestion. Added condition as suggested in comment. 448 Views  View Upvotes
