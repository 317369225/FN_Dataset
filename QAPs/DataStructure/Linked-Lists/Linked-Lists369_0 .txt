How do I implement undo in C using linked lists?You log the things you're changing and keep each one as an element in the list; undo is taking the last thing on the list and doing the opposite thing. (Or you describe the compensating actions in the list). Then you might unlink and dispose that item. You need to decide your semantics -- is it an editor-like undo that has long depth, or bounded by transactions? Can you undo the undo operation, because the undo was a mistake? 411 Views  View Upvotes
