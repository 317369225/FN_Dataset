What is the advantage of keeping the next pointer as first element of structure in linked list?It makes coding he algorithms easier. Imagine a complex structure for storing your data. If you wish to pop the first element from the list, you have to grab the next element, copy it into the current structure (including the pointer to the third element) and free the second element. If you just keep the pointer, then you replace the head with the next pointer and free the first chunk. Also, how do you represent an empty list? Set the head pointer to null and the list is empty. I usually code a doubly linked list library and use it for my singly linked lists, as well. Once you've codes a doubly linked list and better yet, templatized it, you'll find that it's easy to use it for singly linked lists, stacks and queues. One structure, coded and debugged, becomes the basis for lots of other data structures and algorithms. 145 Views  View Upvotes
