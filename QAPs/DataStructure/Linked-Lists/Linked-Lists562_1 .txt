What is a single linked list? What are some examples?Singly linked list is a data stucture. Each element in the singly linked list is a node. Node consists of 2 parts 1.data(info u wanna store in list) 2.next(reference to other node in list) the last element in the list is not going to refer to any node(precisely null node) U can perform basic operations such as insertion,deletion,finding an element.difference,union,intersection, of 2 lists are also possible operations. Most other data stucture are built on top of singly linked list like stack, queue,adjancey list etc 286 Views  View Upvotes
