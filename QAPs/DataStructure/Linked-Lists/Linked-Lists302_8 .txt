When is it appropriate to use a linked-list, as opposed to a different data structure in C++?The answer is pretty obvious - you would use a linked list when you cannot predict the size of the data structure in advance - it could be very small or very big. Or it can dynamically keep changing size. Since you would not want to preallocate a massive fixed size data structure (to accommodate the maximum potential size) it makes sense to use a linked list which can change size dynamically. Another potential usage I can think of is a list where this is some kind of ordering (like sorted by size or alphabetical). But there is a need to keep adding or deleting items at different points in the list. In a linked list you can add or delete an item at any location in constant time. In an array it would be a linear time operation as you would have to move everything that follows the item being added or deleted. Off the top of my head thats what I can think of. 286 Views  View Upvotes
