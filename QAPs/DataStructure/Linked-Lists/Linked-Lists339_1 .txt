Does a linked list always need its own separate class or struct?No. There are circumstances where you might implement a linked list using only regions of memory (or even cache line blocks in a file system) and code that knows how to parse that memory to find the location of the next block. This is rather common in things like kernel implementations of a file store... and they are still technically linked lists. 387 Views  View Upvotes
