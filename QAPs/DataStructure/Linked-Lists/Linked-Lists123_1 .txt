Why and how would a cycle be created in the Link list?Lately I have been studying about data structures. I came across Floyd's Cycle detection algorithm (also known as the Hare and the Tortoise algo), to detect the presence of cycles in Linked Lists.Why a cycle would be created in a Linked List may mainly be unintentional, but it is very much possible, and sometimes may be desired, such as in Integer factorization. A simple way to see how a loop is created in a linked list is as follows: struct Node loopBackNode = getSomeRandomNode(list->head); struct Node p = list->head; while(p->next != NULL)  p = p->next; p->next = loopBackNode; 146 Views
