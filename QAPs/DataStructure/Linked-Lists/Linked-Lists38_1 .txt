How do I insert a node at the end in a singly linked list in c?Lets consider ptr to be a node pointer,new_node is a pointer pointing to the node that needs to be added to list.Then follow the simple steps 1.Traverse the linked list till the end  ptr=head;  while(ptr->next!=NULL)  ptr=ptr->next; 2.Now ptr will be pointing to the last node of the list 3.Make the last node pointing to the new_node   ptr->next=new_node; 4.Assign NULL to the newly added node to complete the list.  new_node->next=NULL; 51 Views
