What are some practical, real-world code use cases of a linked list?Linked list is one of the most general data storage structures. If we start from less obvious to more visible uses: First of all, you need to remember they can be used for everything that you are using regular arrays for. So they can replace arrays both static and dynamic. Secondly, you can use them for dynamically resizing data storage. While there are dynamically resizable arrays (like reallocated memory blocks in C) they: might be very inefficient on CPU while enlarging are very bad for memory fragmentation while shrinking and might be impossible to use on fragmented memory (and see above, for fragmentation :( ) They can be relocated, rearranged, sorted, all the while they are staying on the same location of memory But you were asking for real-world uses. The short answer is everything but some samples might be: An employee list ordered by their KPI, preferably unlimited numbers of KPIs, thus a linked list of linked lists.
