How will you find the longest increasing subsequence in a circular linked list?This question was asked in a Microsoft Interview. P.S: Please try to give a solution having O(n) complexity where n is the size of the circular linked list.(Code is written in C/C++) Make an array of size equal to that of linked list. And initialize it with all zeros. Now, a[0]=1 Let structure of linked list be : struct linkedlist {  int val;  struct linkedlist *next; }; Let tmp be the iterator of linked list. So, int prev=head->val; tmp=head->next; i=1; while(tmp!=head) {  if(tmp->val>prev)  a[i]=a[i-1]+1;  else  a[i]=1;  i++; } Now, find max value in array a, which will be the length and from position of max value and nearest 1 on its left side will be start and end indices of longest subsequence. 209 Views
