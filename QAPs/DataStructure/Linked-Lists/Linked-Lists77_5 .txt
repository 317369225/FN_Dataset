Why do I need a linked list and why is it important?Suppose your program expects some input from the user. Now there are 3 possible scenarios: 1. You and and your user both know the size of input, in this case go for array as it has fastest insert, search times. 2ndly you may not but user may know the size of input. Then you can ask for the size and then declare array of that size dynamically. But if your user also doesnot know the input size (It may happen, think you are writing a text editor)? You may declare a huge array, but still there is chance of overflow, or huge wastage of space. Linkedlist here comes into play, you allocate one unit of space at a time and link it with a new one when required. This helps you to optimize space. linkedlist has got another advantage, as the space needs not be contiguous, chances of space unavailability is quite less, which happens in case of large dynamic array allocation. time and algorithmic advantages are also there as mentioned brilliantly in the other answers. 398 Views  View Upvotes
