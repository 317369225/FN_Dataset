use singly link list instead of a doubly link list ? yes . singly link list be easier to work with in highly concurrent situation , because there s less datum to keep consistent . for example , suppose you want to append a lot of item to a link list in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-blocking_algorithm#wait-freedom" rel="nofollow"> wait-free </a> way . it s okay if consume the item be not wait free , but producer absolutely must not block no matter what the other thread be do . with a singly link list you can just do : easy ! guarantee progress for every producer . produce node may not be immediately visible from the head of the list -lrb- a previous producer may have yet to update the <code> next </code> pointer of the node it get -rrb- , but they eventually will be . with a doubly-linked list , you need ca loop and other try-retry-retry-fix-up sort of construct . it s a lot easier to make a mistake , so i win t try to just zip off a example .
