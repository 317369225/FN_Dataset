How do you find out if a linked-list has an end? (i.e. the list is not a cycle)Another way is to add a boolean IsVisited to the node.(if you are allowed to change the structure of the node). Then while visiting each node make isVisited node as “true”. while traversing the list if a node with value isVisited “true” is encountered it means there is a loop in the list. It also helps in finding the starting point of the loop 11 Views
