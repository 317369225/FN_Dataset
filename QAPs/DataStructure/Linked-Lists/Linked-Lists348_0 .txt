Is it compulsory to use dynamic memory allocation for implementing linked lists?The basic purpose of a linked list is to link nodes one after the other. Suppose you don't want to use dynamic memory allocations, then I suggest, don't go for linked list, instead you can use array of structures. Each struct will have two values, one for the data and another for pointing to the next array index. Dynamic allocations will help only if you don't know the number of inputs. Also it will help in memory management, in case you don't have enough available contiguous memories. Deletion and insertions will also become easier than if you use array. 127 Views  View Upvotes
