what be a suitable datum structure in this scenario ? depend on how limited the memory be , the best choice for 1 could be a sort array : binary search be fast , insertion and deletion be rare and memory overhead be negligible . for number 2 a -lrb- unsorted -rrb- singly link list be better than a doubly link one , since we -lrb- presumably -rrb- don t perform any operation that benefit from the backlink and thus can save the memory -lrb- and maintenance time -rrb- require for they . for number 3 , unless the hash function and datum don t play nicely with each other , the hash table will likely be faster than a tree . if the load factor do not get too low , it will also be more space efficient , since a binary tree with $ n $ key need $ \ sim 2n $ pointer .
