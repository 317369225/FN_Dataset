How does inserting a new link works in linked lists?For the code to work, first has to be defined outside the function but accessible from within the function. It has to be persistent between calls to insert. 2 cases - suppose you start with an empty list. In this case you will have first == null, by definition. Then you call insert. You will get: link -> (a Link object) nextLink = first == null first = link So now first is pointing to the head of a 1 element list, and the nextLink is null, because the tail of a (single-linked) list is marked by a null: first -> Link object -> null If you call insert again, the nextLink field of the new Link object will point to the previous Link object, and first will point to the new Link object: first -> Link2 -> Link -> null Hope this helps. 127 Views  View Upvotes
