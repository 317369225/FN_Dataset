what be the advantage of seperate chaining over open address ? in addition to what bharadwaj say , you don t have to use a association list to implement separate chaining . for example , java 8 use red-black tree instead of link list for <code> hashmap </code> . theoretically , this reduce the worst-case scenario of a hash table from $ o -lrb- n -rrb- $ to $ o -lrb- \ log n -rrb- $ . of course , in instance where you bucket remain small -lrb- e.g. small hash table , or if you dynamically resize you table as more element be add -rrb- this may or may not be faster than just search a link list linearly .
