What is the use of append and prepend operations in a linked list?Drew Eckhardt nailed it. You can build a few different data structures depending on whether you're appending/prepending. Something like messages, you'd want to get the first one first, and the last one last. FIFO. First in, first out. You'd obviously want to read the oldest message first. That's a queue. A good use case for a stack would be Undo/Redo functionality. You put the event on the stack, and if they Undo, you just pop it off the stack and onto another stack. After a handful of Undos, you can start doing Redo's, and pop off the undo stack and prepend onto the event stack. Stacks are FILO. First in, last out. The first event should be the last one popped if you Undo all your actions. Does that help? 238 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Anish Tuladhar
