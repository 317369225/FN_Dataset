the most appropriate way to implement a heap be with a array rather than a link list , why be this ? it doesn t make any sense at all to implement a heap as a link list . heap be inherently binary tree . you can store a heap in a array because it s easy to compute the array index of a node s child : the child of the node at position k live at position 2k and 2k +1 . it s massively more efficient to find the kth element of a array than the kth element of a link list . advantage of store a heap as a array rather than a pointer-based binary tree include the follow .
