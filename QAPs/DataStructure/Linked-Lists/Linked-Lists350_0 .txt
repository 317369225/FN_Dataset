What are linked lists in Java How do you use them?LinkedList is a list that is fast when insertion or deletion take place. It's slow when you want to access an element at arbitrary index because it has no random access property, it needs to traverse over element one-by-one until it gets to the requested index. Following is how you create an instance of linked list in Java. Java's linked list is internally doubly linked list, it means that you can either traverse from the head or the tail first. LinkedList<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>(); Usually when you want to use ArrayDeque instead because its performance is roughly better about 2-3 times.
