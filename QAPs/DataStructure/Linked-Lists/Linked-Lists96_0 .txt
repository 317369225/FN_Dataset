Are linked lists data structures or abstract data types? Why?If linked lists are abstract data types, doesn't that mean that abstract data types can be used to implement other abstract data types (i.e. a linked list implementing a stack).Originally Answered: Is the linked list an abstract data type or a data structure? Excellent question! A linked list is an implementation of some abstraction, the simplest being that of a finite sequence. A data structure is an abstraction described by an interface (api) for acting on unknown data. An algorithm is an implementation of an abstraction such as a data structure. These two concepts have usually been confused in CS education. 1.4k Views  View Upvotes
