How do I print the traverse of a doubly circular linked list and the adjacency matrix of a graph?I am not strongly familiar with adjacency graphs, but I think you have some basic problem. You say you want to "print the traverse of a doubly circular linked list", and that can not be a tree. That is a symetric circle of elements where each node has exactly 2 neighbors and exactly 2 vertices from each adjacent element. And that should leave an adjacency value of 2 for each and every element of the adjacency graph, I believe. A tree is not a circular, doublely linked list. A doublely linked circular list is the most common data structure used, but its traversal is linear until you return back to where you started. So you have to explain better what it is your are trying to do? 169 Views
