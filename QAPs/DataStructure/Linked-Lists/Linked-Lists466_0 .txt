How do I go about inserting elements into a linked list within a linked list?I dont know if I understood you question properly, but from what I read you want to find RoomNode x and insert elements at the end of the rrespective PathNode. 1. Use a loop to iterate over the entire LinkedList to find RoomNode x and store the address of the respective PathNode in a pointer. 2.User that pointer and traverse till the end of that LinkedList and add your elements 285 Views  View Upvotes
