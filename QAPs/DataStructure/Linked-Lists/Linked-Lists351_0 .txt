How do I store a linkedlist for future data retrieval using Java?I have a linkedlist of 100k entries. I want to store this in the permanent memory for future retrieval by another program. How do I implement this? I am looking for something similar to saving variables/Matrices in MATLABSerialization does this for you. Once you serialize the linkedlist, other Java program can deserialize it easily and be able to use it. Java - Serialization 161 Views  View Upvotes
