Is it possible to write a method that displays all the elements in a circular linked list?Yes it's very well possible, as one answer mentioned one way to do this is to keep the reference of the first element and stop when you reach the same reference. Second method which is expensive in terms of space is maintaining a visited boolean array, whenever you visit an element check it its visited, if not mark that as visited(0 - unvisited, 1-visited) and then when you find a element that is already visited you can stop. 98 Views
