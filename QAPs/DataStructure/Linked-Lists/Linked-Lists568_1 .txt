How do I implement a singly or doubly linked list for the scenario given in the details?Whatever the language that you are using, it is likely to offer you a vast collection of data structures in its standard library. Their implementation has already been done, and most often they are optimized in smart ways that would make them better than yours should you implement them yourself. If you are working on a real project, don’t reinvent the wheel, that is not only a waste of time, it’s deeply against what being a programmer is about. If it is a class assignment, you should be thinking about the answer (by yourself or with other students), because that is how you will learn what the concepts that you are studying are really about. 316 Views · View Upvotes
