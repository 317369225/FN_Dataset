be there datum structure that mix a tree structure with list ? yes . build a tree -lrb- with any branch factor you want -rrb- . then , augment the datum structure by maintain one doubly link list per level that contain all of the node at that level . in particular , in each node you have a `` left '' and `` right '' field which go to the next and previous element in that doubly link list -lrb- i.e. , the next sibling to the right of it and the previous sibling to the left of it -rrb- . all of the standard tree operation can be augmented to update\/maintain these doubly link list as well . this add only $ o -lrb- 1 -rrb- $ extra time to each operation to update the doubly link list , so the asymptotic run time for each tree operation remain the same . this construction can be apply to any tree with any structure you want -lrb- binary tree , $ k $ - ary tree , b-tree , avl tree , red-black tree , etc. -rrb- i don t know of any particular name for this specific case . it be a instance of augment a datum structure . many datum structures\/algorithms textbook will have a chapter on augment datum structure .
