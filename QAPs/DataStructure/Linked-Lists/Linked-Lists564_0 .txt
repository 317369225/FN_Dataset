How can I traverse forward and reverse direction in a singly linked list?The solution that comes to my mind instinctively is to do the following - Start traversing th singly linked list in the forward direction . As you visit every node in the linked list reverse the direction of the links. Once you reach the last node (which is now the head) you can traverse backwards. Alternatively, you can achieve the samw using a stack: Push ever node into a stack while traversing in the forward direction. Once, you reach the end pop all elements in the stack and that's how a reverse traversal will look. 1.4k Views  View Upvotes
