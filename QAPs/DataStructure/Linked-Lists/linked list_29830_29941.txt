how can i teach computer science without use computer ? it would be possible to teach the concept of computer science without a computer . of course without access to a computer , what good do learn computer science really do ? when i be learn computer science in high school , we first several class didn t involve computer at all . instead , we work from a book call <a href="http://csis.pace.edu/~bergin/karel.html" rel="nofollow"> karel + + </a> , which teach object orient concept . the make up language can be `` run '' on a whiteboard or blackboard pretty easily because all of the code take action on a graph . we first few assignment be all handwritten and the professor would demonstrate the correct solution on the board at the start of the next class . when we start discuss algorithm , we professor call we all up to the front of the room and tell we to stand in a line . he proceed to demonstrate a few different sorting algorithm - start with something silly he call `` monkey sort '' where he would randomly exchange two of we and then check to see if we be sort every iteration , but then perform <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bubble_sort" rel="nofollow"> bubble sort </a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shellsort" rel="nofollow"> shell sort </a> - by `` run '' they on we . he draw diagram on the board , explain the basics of how computer memory and the stack work . he demonstrate variable and pointer -lrb- it be a c + + class -rrb- and from there to link list and tree ... i could probably add to this if i go over the note i keep from that class , but that s all i remember now . if these suggestion be interesting , i can expand on this answer .
