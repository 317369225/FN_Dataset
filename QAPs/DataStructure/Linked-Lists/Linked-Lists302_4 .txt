When is it appropriate to use a linked-list, as opposed to a different data structure in C++?Every Data Structure has there own Pros and Cons. Like in case of Linked List here are some Advantages Linked List is Dynamic in Nature so that when we do not know the number of elements to be stored Linked List is a better Choice Linked List nodes in memory do not store in consecutive location but still it maintains its linear fashion so where the order of elements matters it can be used(For Stack and Queues) here are some shortcomings Slow access compared to Arrays Lot of pointer handling code is needed so complex in writing codes Extra space is needed to store pointers for example if we need to store n element we have to keep n+1 pointers 159 Views  View Upvotes
