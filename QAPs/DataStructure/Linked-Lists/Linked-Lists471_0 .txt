How do I implement a C code to insert an element at the middle of the linked list if the size of the list is not known?I am answering this considering the list as Single Linked List. If there is no constraint that you have to traverse the list only once: You can traverse till the end to find the length Insert an element in the middle If you have to traverse it only once, [code]p1, p2 pointers p1 = p2 = head; while (not end of the list) p1 = p1->next; p2=p2->next->next; done while //Middle element will be p1; ele->next = p1-> next; p1-> next = ele; [/code] 171 Views  Answer requested by Swati
