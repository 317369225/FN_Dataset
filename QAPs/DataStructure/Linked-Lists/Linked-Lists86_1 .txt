Is a linked list a self-referencing pointer?I think you mean self-referencing structure. Yes, if you define a struct like, struct Foo { int somedata; struct Foo *next, *prev; }; Then part of the structure (next, prev) points to itself. Note that, when we say "points to itself" it means points to things of similar type. In practice the memory addresses will be different. 224 Views  View Upvotes
