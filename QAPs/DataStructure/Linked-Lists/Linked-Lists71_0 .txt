How can I implement this linked list in a C program?I don't know how much of this you can't do but I will give you the structs: typedef struct { char firstName[21]; char lastName[21]; double score; char zipCode[6]; } Student;  typedef struct NodeStruct { Student student; struct NodeStruct *next; } Node; If you have a variable of type Node (say, *node) then you can access the Student members with node->student.firstName etc. Note that each Node variable must be a pointer and you need to use malloc() to create space for the Node. 1k Views
