Can we implement binary search operations on linked list?Performing a binary search on linked list is never a good idea , as usually its running time can exceed that of standard ( linear ) search. In terms of arrays, we could perform binary search and go directly in the middle of the array, then jump back or forward. That is because we can access array items directly using their index. However as we saw the linked lists unlike arrays can’t benefit of a direct access and we must go item by item. Because of this natural problem of linked lists searching is slow and obviously we can’t make it better. The only way to improve searching over dynamic data structures is to use different data structure. The tree is a data structure where each item, except of keeping some data, keeps a reference (pointer) to its children and its parent. But on the other hand, I’ve found something on the web of your interest:) Hope it helps:) A2A Appreciated :) Implement binary search in Linked list 262 Views · View Upvotes
