To check the linked list is circular what will be the loop condition? I know further process like taking two pointers. Please suggest me.Using the two pointer approach, the loop condition will be - if the fast pointer and the slow pointer are the same the linked list has a loop. Else we move the fast pointer and the slow pointer as long as fast!=NULL and fast->next!=NULL Check out this blog post where everything is explained properly :) http://thealphaking01.blogspot.com/2015/07/leetcode-solution-linked-list-cycle.html 341 Views
