How do I insert a node at the end in a singly linked list in c?Iterate through list and add the new node when any of the node whose next is NULL found(last node). Here I am writing a recursive version of this Algorithm void add(Head) { if(Head == NULL) then createNewNode and Head = newNodePtr; else if(Head->Next == NULL) then createNewNode and Head->Next = newNodeptr; else add(Head->Next); } 86 Views
