How do I insert a node in a linked list in C++?Explain very very simply.There are 3 cases in linked list insertion. 1. Inserting a node at the begining. Its very simple. Assign the value of the 'next' part (the pointer pointing to the next element) of the head node to the 'next' part of the new node. Then set the head node to point to the new node. newnode->next=head->next; head->next=newnode; 2. Inserting at a given position. Here you get the position where the node has to be inserted, traverse to the node at that position. Now, assign the 'next' part of the previous node to the 'next' part of the new node and then make the 'next' part of the previous node point to the new node. Let pr denote the previous node. Then, newnode->next=pr->next; pr->next=newnode; 3.inserting at the end of the list Traverse to the last element of the list. Make it's 'next' part point to the new node and assign NULL to the 'next' part of the newnode. Let last denote the last node. last->next=newnode; newnode->next=null; 3.8k Views  View Upvotes
