How do linked lists work?Typically through pointers. "Nodes", in my experience, are objects comprised of data and pointers. In my experience , node pointers often point to other objects of same class type. At a most basic structure, pointers are one directional, starting with the "head" and ending with a node whose pointer is NULL. This structure is very reminiscent of arrays with some null character at the end to signal that This Is The End (such as C-Strings) like: A B C D -1 In these simple structures only the head is directly accessible. and the other nodes are only accessible through a sequential search. There are a million ways to restructure linked lists to fit ones needs. Trees, two way nodes, rear nodes that have identifiers, 160 Views
