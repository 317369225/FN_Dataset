Can we say a two dimensional array is same as a linked list; regardless of the fact that linked list is dynamic and arrays are static?No we can not. There are various differences in the above two structures. The one you stated Linked list is dynamic and arrays are static (regardless) Both are sequential data structures in terms of arrangement of data. But in terms of memory, arrays have contiguous memory while linked list don’t. Accessing array element can be done in O(1). While in linked list you needO(number of element) time. You can also make dynamic arrays. Also its size can be altered by realloc(). But linked list do not have the above three advantages. Adding a point to Rachit Saxena’s answer A 2D array can have data in a matrix form of same type like for example a 2D array of int type. But coming to a linked list of 2 data members, 1 should necessarily be a pointer and other can be an int or a char or pointer or some others. 148 Views
