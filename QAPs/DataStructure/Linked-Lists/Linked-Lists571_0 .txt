How do I implement a C program that uses a linked list to delete the last node which has the value "x"?We can divide this problem in two parts: 1. To find out the last node having value as 'x' 2. To delete the last node. The problem will be very easy if we iterate linked list twice, but we can solve it in single iteration using two pointers previous and next. void findAndDelete(Node node){ Node cur=node, previous,next; while(cur.next != null){  If(cur.data=='x') {  previous=cur;  next=cur.next;  }  cur=cur.next;  } previous.data=next.data; previous.next=next.next; delete(next); } 287 Views
