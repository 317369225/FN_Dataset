How can I search a node by it's address in a linked list? Can I create array of nodes for implementing such a function or there exists any other way?Thanks for A2A Sagar Mishra. I will C/C++ notations.(As I'm more comfortable with its syntax) Let's say your structure for linked list is like: struct ll { int data; struct ll *next; } *start; Now, let's say the address of the node you want to search is stored in the pointer called key, then you can directly go for linear search as follows: struct ll *key=start->next; //For example I'm searching for 2nd node of the list.  int search(struct ll *start, struct ll *key) { struct ll *tmp=start; while(tmp) { if(tmp==key) return tmp->data; tmp=tmp->next; } return -1; //Or return some indicator that node not found. } 141 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Sagar Mishra
