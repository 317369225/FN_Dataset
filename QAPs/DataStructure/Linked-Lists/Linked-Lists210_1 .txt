Have you ever coded a real life application solely using linked lists?If you code a meaningful application completely in R using only native language data structures, you’re pretty close, as the entire memory model under the hood is composed of linked lists. Note that this can only work because most R data structures are linked lists of numerical vectors, which are not themselves stored as linked lists, and use highly optimized linear algebra libraries to do any heavy numerical lifting (which is presumably the only thing you would ever try to do in R). So you’re not really technically doing everything with linked lists. But it’s pretty close. Note that I am not taking this way question the way Garry Taylor seems to be taking it. I’m assuming you allow both linked lists and common operations on them, not just lists that you can’t do anything with. 170 Views
