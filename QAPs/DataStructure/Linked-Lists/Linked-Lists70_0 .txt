How do I sort a single linked list with Java?Your immediate problem is that you're setting head = pointer rather than pointer = head in the last line in your for loop. pointer at that place in the code is pointing at the very last node of the list, so setting head to that makes your list be just the last element. Then length() returns 1 and the for loop ends. The rest of your code looks pretty reasonable, although you probably want to reset 'count' to 1 at the start of the for loop; it's not clear why you need 'position' when you have 'i'; and I am not a computer (IANAC). For solving problems like this in general, I recommend one of the following rather than a post to Quora: Interleave many more print statements with information about the list in the code. Write something that prints out the full list, if you haven't already. Then you can look at the program's output to track down when it is going wrong. Use a debugger, if you're writing in an IDE that has one, to step through lines in the code one by one and see what is going on at each point. Explain exactly what your code is doing, line by line, to a friend. It is helpful if your friend can program, but not necessary; the purpose is to make yourself really read each line. 1.1k Views  View Upvotes
