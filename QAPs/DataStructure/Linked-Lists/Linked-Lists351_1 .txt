How do I store a linkedlist for future data retrieval using Java?I have a linkedlist of 100k entries. I want to store this in the permanent memory for future retrieval by another program. How do I implement this? I am looking for something similar to saving variables/Matrices in MATLABBecause your data is represented in Java Objects, Java Serialization, or any other serialization format that can faithfully map the Object oriented nature of Java objects completely will work (note: XML Schema can represent a Java object including it's class hierarchy since XML Schema is Object Oriented, but you still would have to write your own way to serialize and de-serialize the linked list structure itself). Something like Redis (from another comment), in general will not work because (most likely) Redis will know nothing about any Class hierarchies that may exist in your Linked List elements.. thus, when attempting to restore the representation to java all class hierarchy information has been lost and the Java Objects cannot be restored. 69 Views  View Upvotes
