What is the importance of linked list in programming?A linked list is the simplest method of storing data without having to pre-allocate memory based on the expectation of how many items you wish to store. The simplest way with pre-allocation is an array, but extending an array once it's full is costly. When the set of items to store is not overly large (and if you don't need direct access to the items in the list, and instead use a find), a linked list is much more efficient. 262 Views
