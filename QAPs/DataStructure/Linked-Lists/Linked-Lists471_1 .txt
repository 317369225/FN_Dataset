How do I implement a C code to insert an element at the middle of the linked list if the size of the list is not known?Thanks for A2A! I feel others have given correct answers in case of a singly linked list. The solutions work fine for a doubly linked list as well. As for me, I would suggest you to follow the following method for finding the middle element in a doubly linked list: 1. Place two pointers, one at the start and one at the end 2. Keep traversing the linked list (first pointer moves towards right and the second pointer moves towards left) until both the pointers meet at a common node (in case of odd no of elements) or they cross each other (in case of even no of elements). If they cross each other then the middle element is the one pointed to by the pointer which was placed at the end initially. 221 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Swati
