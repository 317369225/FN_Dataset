Can you implement a singly linked list like a doubly linked list?Yes. You can by using a XOR Linked List. It basically XOR's the front and back pointers of the DLL and stores as one reference, which can be got back by XOR'ing with the one which we are on and the XORed address it's pointing too. For more knowledge do go through the geeksforgeeks question with the same heading. I have personally forgotten a bit about this XOR list so won't be more of a help. But I remember learning from GfG only. Thanks for the A2A 308 Views  Answer requested by Shyam Sreenivasan
