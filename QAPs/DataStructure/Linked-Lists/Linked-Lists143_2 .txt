How do I identify a loop in a singly-linked list?A simple solution with O(N) complexity is to put a flag at each node. You traverse the list once to reset the flags. While traversing the list for the second time you set the flag for each visited node. If you reach a node with the flag already set there is a loop and the node is the beginning (and the end) of the loop. Edit: Seth Sims is absolutely right, this is a wrong answer that can't work as described above. However the nodes can be created (while building the list) with the flags set to the right value. After creating the list the loops can be found by changing the value of the flags. If the loop is not detected then the flags can be reset and the list can be modified and tested again. 639 Views  View Upvotes
