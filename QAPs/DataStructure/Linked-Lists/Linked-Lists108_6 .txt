What is the difference between an array, a list, and a linked list?An array is usually static, indexed by (again usually) sequential counters (numbers or characters..) data storage. A list, especially a linked list is another but "can be used similarly" data structure, usually containing some open or hidden (depending on implementation) indexing/linking structure that permits adding, deleting, inserting in between type operations. You can see it as one level above in complexity than regular arrays. Also linked lists are a special case of binary trees, this is something useful to keep in mind.. 911 Views
