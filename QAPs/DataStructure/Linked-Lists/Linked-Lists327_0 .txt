Can somebody explain about unrolled linked lists?An unrolled linked list is a linear data structure that is a variant on the linked list. Instead of just storing 1 element at each node, unrolled linked lists store an entire array at each node. It is also known as cache sensitive data structure. The term ‘cache’ has been taken from cache memory which is associated with CPU. Advantages of Unrolled Linked List 1. Due to its cache behavior, the unrolled linked list performs the sequential traversal very rapidly as compare to ordinary LinkedList. 2. It requires less storage space. UnRolledLinkedList define in Java class UnRolledLinkedListNode { UnRolledLinkedListNode next;  int numElements;  int array[]; public UnRolledLinkedListNode(int n) { next = null;  numElements = 0;  array = new int[n];  } } 87 Views · Answer requested by Vineeth Kanaparthi
