How can we delete the last node in the linked list in Java, when we only have a pointer to that last node?To delete the last node you need to set node.prev.next=null, just like your code so to delete a node you need the link to prev/parent. So to delete p7, you need to set p6.next=null. Here you have a pointer at p7 so it will be hard to delete p7 from there. 292 Views  View Upvotes
