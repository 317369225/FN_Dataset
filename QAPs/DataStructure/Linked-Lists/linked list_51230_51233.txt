hash table collision : why use a link list if we can use a hash set ? but then the lookup time be no longer constant not worst-case constant -- which it <em> never </em> be for -lrb- basic -rrb- hashtable -- but it be still average-case constant , provide the usual assumption on input distribution and hash function . why not use a hash set instead of a link list ? and how do you implement that one ? you have create a circular definition . the lookup time would then be constant . nope , see above . you major confusion seem to be about what people mean when they say that hashtable have constant lookup time . read <a href="http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/249/when-is-hash-table-lookup-o1?rq=1"> here </a> on how this be true and false .
