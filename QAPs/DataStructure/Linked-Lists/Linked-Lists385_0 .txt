When insertion is done in reverse order in singly linked list. Is it considered to inserted in the end?There are two use of Link Lists 1) Stack 2) Queue 1) Stack(LIFO) Generally Node are always added at Head, We Don't add any node at End Ex : I/P : 1, 2, 3 ,4 ,5  O/P: 5->4->3->2->1 If we add(Push) new Element Lets Say (6), List Will be Like 6->5->4->3->2->1 Now if we remove the same Element (6) From the List, List Will be 5->4->3->2->1  So In Stack Operation are performed at at Head only. 2) Queue (FIFO) In Queue We Insert(Enqueue) at End and We Remove(Dequeue ) From the Head . Ex : I/P : 1, 2, 3 ,4 ,5  O/P: 1->2->3->4->5 Now Dequeue Operation will make list O/P : 2->3->4->5 Hopefully this two Example should be clearing your doubt. If you see Stack Example Then o/p Sequence is different from I/p Sequence. So it is Opposite order of I/P, And If you see Queue , Removal Happens from End. 31 Views
