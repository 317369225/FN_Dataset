How do I insert an element at nth position of a linked list?Initialize an iterator Iterate n-1 times through the linked list. Put a check condition if end of linked list is reached. If so, your choice whether to return error or append at end. After reaching (n-1)th position, make pointer->next = N N-1->next=pointer End It's a very basic code based on linked lists. Practice such basic ones because actual codes you'll have to handle are quite complicated. 1.4k Views
