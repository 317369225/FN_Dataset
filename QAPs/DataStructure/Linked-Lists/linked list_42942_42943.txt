efficiently enumerate all path from i to j of give length in a graph it s not possible to solve this problem `` efficiently '' . there can be exponentially many path of a give length , so enumerate all of they be not feasible in large graph . you dynamic programming approach be a pretty good one , though you might be able to improve it by not store the path explicitly but instead store the path as link list or use pointer , so that you only use $ o -lrb- 1 -rrb- $ storage per path , let path share they common suffix -lrb- if you do not do this already -rrb- .
