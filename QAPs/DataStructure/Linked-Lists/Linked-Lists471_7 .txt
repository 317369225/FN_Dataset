How do I implement a C code to insert an element at the middle of the linked list if the size of the list is not known?In many cases when you don't know size faster pointers helps a lot . As many people have said the best algorithm for doing this would be fast pointers where firat pointer traverse twice the second hence when first will end we will reach to mid of link list 94 Views  View Upvotes
