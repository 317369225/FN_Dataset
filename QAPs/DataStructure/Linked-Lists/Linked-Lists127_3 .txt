What is an application of linear linked list data structures?One use case is Linux Process Management. Linux uses a circular linked list of process descriptor (task_struct) structures to identify a process in the process hierarchy. In such alignment, you can reach the init process ( pid = 0 ) from any process and vice-versa. The next,prev pointers represent child-parent relationships respectively. Typical structure looks like this: Pic courtesy: http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~agupta/... 2.8k Views  View Upvotes
