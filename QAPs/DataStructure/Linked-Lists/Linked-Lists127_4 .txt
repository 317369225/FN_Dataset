What is an application of linear linked list data structures?Originally Answered: What is the application of linked lists in data structures?A2A Well linked list is used in a lot of data structures. For example: Stacks , Queues , Dequeues , Graphs , Hash tables ,etc. We already know this. Those who don't: 1. We can use linked list as a stack by adding and removing elements from the beginning of the list. 2. Same goes for the queue. Adding in the beginning, removing from the end( can be tricky? No, we maintain a pointer to the last element of the queue or dequeue). 3. Graphs? Adjacency list representation of graph. Adjacency LIST :P 4. In hash table , each bucket of the table can itself be a linked list(chaining). The main advantage of linked list is that there are no limits(not literally). for example: Lets say you are using a ticketing (movie,train, APPU GHAR , whatever) system and you use an array of say 500,000 elements assuming that no matter how many people book tickets it will be less than 5*10^5. Say on some day only 2 people book tickets. Thus, memory wastage. On some other day 500,000+ people tried to book tickets. Thus, loss in business. With linked list -> voila! problem solved. P.S I know its a bad example but you get the idea. :) 21.6k Views  View Upvotes
