What are some definitive reasons of [not] using a linked-list instead of arrays?For starters see this page on FuturechipsIf frequently random access to data is needed, Linked lists are not very good choice. Arrays have constant time complexity for random access while Linked list have o(log n ) average case [ in case of skip lists] and o(n) in worst case time complexity. In such cases Arrays are best data structures. 275 Views
