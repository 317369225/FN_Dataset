What is the difference between an array, a list, and a linked list?Array is a fixed length data structure while ArrayList is variable length collection class. ArrayList resize itself when gets full depending upon capacity & load factor unlike Array. ArrayList resizing operation slow down overall performance. You cannot store primitives in ArrayList , it can only contain objects. While array can contain both primitives & objects in Java. ArrayList converts primitives to objects. Linked List- It consists of nodes which together represent a sequence. Each node is composed of a data & a link or reference to a next node in sequence. Nodes can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or recognition of the entire structure because the data items need not be stored contiguously in memory or on disk. 966 Views  View Upvotes
