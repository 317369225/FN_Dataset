How do I print the last ten data items in a linked list?Reverse the list and take the first 10 elements. Reversing a linked list is a common enough operation that it's often optimized by the library, compiler, or runtime. Alternatively, keep a rolling buffer of 10 elements as you iterate through the end of the list. If you need to do this often, you should know that linked lists are not well-suited for this kind of access pattern. If you can, you should try to use a doubly-linked list or an array for tasks that need to do this often. 1k Views  View Upvotes
