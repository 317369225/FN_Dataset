use b-method , and formal method in general , to model and verify a reverse link list there be many approach for verify link structure -- arguably , more suitable than the b method -- that you might want to use , depend on the language and property you want to verify . most of the approach rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/separation_logic" rel="nofollow"> separation logic </a> -lrb- which be in big part motivate for verification of link structure -rrb- . some tool include : to quote <a href="http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/56083/reverse-linked-list-set-logic-in-method-b/"> this answer </a> -lrb- which answer a very similar question -rrb- , even though you do not give detail about what be you try to verify , it seem that property you might want to prove about the `` reverse link list '' might be formulate as property for a regular link list . -lrb- if the reverse list require some additional -lrb- non-standard -rrb- implementation , not already declare for the link list , you might be able to model those in addition . -rrb- i be not sure what be the purpose of you example , but you code seem similar to a example of model a link list with b -lrb- which include other standard operation -rrb- method in <a href="http://www.apress.com/9781852330538" rel="nofollow"> program development by refinement case study use the b method </a> .
