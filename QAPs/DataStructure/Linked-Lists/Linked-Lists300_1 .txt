How can you find first and last node in circular linked list?I think this question is more like how to find the start and end of a circle. the answer is any point can be taken as start/end. But still if lets say given a node to be the start node (startNode) and you want to find the last node within a circular linked list, you can keep traversing the list until u find a node for which (node->next == startNode). that node is your last node. In case of doubly linked list, startNode->prev is your last node! 152 Views  View Upvotes
