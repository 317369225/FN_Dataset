How do I convert Array into Linked List?Simply maintain a structure for the linked list with 'Node item' and 'next Node' link in that, set the start pointer to the first element of the array and then traverse all the array elements one by one. On each pass provide the link of the upcoming element to the current node and increment the pointer till there are no elements left in the array. 332 Views  View Upvotes
