What does node=node->next exactly do in a linked list?Harsh Joharis answer already covers Tue crux of the concept. I will try to help you visualize. Now what's a pointer? It points to the address or location of a variable. So let's assume the struct list is at 0x100000 address. Then the node member of the struct gets created,which is another pointer.Let's assume the node is created at a random location, 0x123456. So now when u do node-> node, it points to this new location. This goes on and on. 382 Views  Answer requested by Kapil Sharma
