How can linked list simulation be used in real life application?The linked list is fundamental, and as the simplest persistent, recursive data structure, is used everywhere. It's also known as a CONS list and I find it surprising that it was not "discovered" until around 1955. In a sense it's the first abstraction above arrays (the array being a structure that exists directly at machine level). Grab any programming or algorithms text; here's a random example: The Algorithm Design Manual 1k Views  View Upvotes
