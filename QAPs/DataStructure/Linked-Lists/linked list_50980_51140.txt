usefulness of a link list with a cycle the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hamiltonian_path_problem" rel="nofollow"> hamiltonian cycle problem </a> ask for a cycle connect all node . in this case the solution be a full circular link list . however a modify version of the problem may ask that a particular connected subset must not form a cycle -lrb- so just a hamiltonian path -rrb- while the other must . the solution will therefore be a link list with a cycle . i guess this can be useful in a graph problem where a particular subset of node form a connected path between the head node and the connected cycle of node . a example be to have the head node at the border of city a , a path from city a to b through the desert , and connected node in city b.
