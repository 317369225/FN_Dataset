To check the linked list is circular what will be the loop condition? I know further process like taking two pointers. Please suggest me.It's easy when you have something like C/C++ which allows cool things like pointers, or stuff like java, even where two objects may be compared accurately enough to tell us whether they are the same. All you need to do is mark off where you started - like how do you know in an unfamiliar place whether you are driving around in circles? You pick off a milestone and if you reach there once more, you know you're back where you started. Code-wise, we could do something like this in C: #include <stdbool.h>  struct ListNodeT { void * data; struct ListNodeT * next; }  bool isListCircular(struct ListNodeT * start) { struct ListNodeT * current = start->next; while (current != start){ if (!current) // End of list reached - linear. return false; current = current->next; }  // Circular. return true; } 628 Views  View Upvotes
