I am deleting a node from a linked list (code in C),but it is still getting printed in my original list. How can I fix this?Without being able to see your code, I can only speculate but most issues with linked lists have to do with bad pointer code. Look at how you are managing your "next" pointers when you are deleting a node. Also, you may have to handle node deletion differently if your target node is at the head of your list versus somewhere in the middle of your list. Draw pictures to visualize what you are doing and pay special attention to the reassignment of node pointers (usually called "next" pointers or "next"/"prev" pointers if you're dealing with a doubly-linked list). Chances are there's something wrong with your pointer code. 197 Views  View Upvotes
