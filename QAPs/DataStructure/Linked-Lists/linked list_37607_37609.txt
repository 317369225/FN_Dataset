complexity of bst complexity of a bst differ in different case . in worst case bst be be like a linear link list -lrb- all sub node be only left-child or right-child of each other -rrb- which its complexity can be measure by solve follow recursive equation : $ t -lrb- n -rrb- = t -lrb- n-1 -rrb- +1 $ which be $ o -lrb- n -rrb- $ . but for average case we can consider it as a complete binary tree so $ t -lrb- n -rrb- = t -lrb- n\/2 -rrb- +1 $ and it s complexity be $ o -lrb- log -lrb- n -rrb- -rrb- $ which $ log -lrb- n -rrb- $ be height of the tree .
