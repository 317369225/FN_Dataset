How does inserting a new link works in linked lists?It took me a while to understand what confuses you. I think the problem is not how linked lists work: you seem to have figured out that new items get inserted at the very start of the list each time. Instead, the problem is that you get confused by the fact that the name “first” refers to a different object each time. Perhaps you get confused by the name, which suggests that it is always the first object that got inserted! But that’s not the case. For example, after you create the second link, the variable “first” will refer to that second link object (due to the “first = link” statement in the insert method). The second link will refer to the thing that “first” was before, which was the first link. And the first link points to null. So, the same variable at some point in your program does not always point to the same object. The variable “first” certainly doesn’t. So the situation is: first -> null first -> [first link] -> null first -> [second link] -> [first link] -> null first -> [third link] -> [second link] -> [first link] -> null and so on. 217 Views · View Upvotes
