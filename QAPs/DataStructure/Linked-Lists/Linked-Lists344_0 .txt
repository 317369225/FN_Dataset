What do Linked Lists do in Java?Linked Lists in Java allow you to store data without predefining its length. So, if you don't know how much space you need, Linked Lists can be a good choice. Linked list is a data structure where each node has a pointer to next node (sometimes to the previous node as well, called doubly-linked lists). You can keep adding to the list. It will just create a new node and set the appropriate pointers. Deleting works similarly. However, there are some drawbacks to Linked Lists. First, in order to access an element in a linked list, you would have to traverse the list. Another issue is memory overhead, since every node has a pointer to the next node (sometimes two pointers). 543 Views  View Upvotes
