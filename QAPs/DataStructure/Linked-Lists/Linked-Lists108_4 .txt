What is the difference between an array, a list, and a linked list?A list is a generic (common) name for a set of items. The main difference is between array and linkedlist. An array is stored sequentially in the physical memory where as items /data in linked lists are scattered at different locations in the physical memory. Apart from this items in an array can be accessed in O(1) where as accessing an element in a linked list can have a worst case complexity of O(n). Also, the size of array is fixed, you cannot have items more than the specified initially in the program whereas a linked list gives you the freedom to have as many as items you require . In nutshell you would use an array when your application require too many access and would use a linked list when you are not sure beforehand how many items you would require in your application. 2.1k Views  View Upvotes
