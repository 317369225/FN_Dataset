use singly link list instead of a doubly link list ? other than save space , the first advantage i can see for singly link list over doubly link list be to avoid have to update two link instead of one when you modify the list , when add a element for example . of course , one might say that you can always ignore the second link , but in that case , it be no longer doubly link , but only a unused field . what might also be see as a advantage be that singly link list be necessarily consistent , though possibly wrong when there be bug in the program . doubly link list can end-up have inconsistent link forward and backward . but it be debatable which of the two case , if any , be a advantage . update : i have try to see some impact on garbage collection , but find none . actually , there be one when storage reclamation be do by reference counting , as reference counting be defeat by loop , and doubly link list contain loop . singly link list escape the problem . of course , there be way around it for doubly link list , such as the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weak_reference" rel="nofollow"> weak pointer </a> , or programmable reference counting as part of datum abstraction .
