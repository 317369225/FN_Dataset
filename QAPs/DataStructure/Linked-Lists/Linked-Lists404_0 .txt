How do you write an "abstracted" linked list in C?Your question says you want a linked list, then discusses allocation of contiguous memory to hold variable-size data. If you use linked list techniques, there is no need for contiguous blocks of memory. Each item in the list would be separately heap-allocated. You ask about how make your code "abstracted". Doing so in C would be done by having the API you define accept a pointer to memory that is owned by the caller; your structure would manage the pointers between items. You said you want to write in C. Other languages make abstraction easier. If you value that, why write in a language that doesn't have very many of them? 167 Views  View Upvotes
