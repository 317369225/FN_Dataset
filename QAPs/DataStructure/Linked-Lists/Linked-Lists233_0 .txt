Why is linked list stored in heap memory?Computer’s memory is divided into heap and stack segment. Size of stack is relatively smaller than heap and is fixed. Therefore, stack is primarily used for operations such as recursion or control jumps such as goto statement. Due to this reason, recursion is not used for operations involving deep recursion levels as you may get a stack overflow error. On the other hand, linked list is having major advantage of dynamically expanding itself when needed without worrying much about memory consumption. So, heap is preferred place to store linked list’s objects. 79 Views · View Upvotes
