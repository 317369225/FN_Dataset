When is it appropriate to use a linked-list, as opposed to a different data structure in C++?In a project, I wanted to hold a list of sorted top-k items (depending on some score) that would be updated online in each iteration. Use of sorting algorithm in each iteration was a dumb idea and was an overkill. When a new item is considered in each iteration, it should move to its right location in the sorted list. I preferred using linked list over arrays as manipulating pointers to attach a node in between is computationally cheaper than shifting a reasonably large subarray to right/left. 285 Views  View Upvotes
