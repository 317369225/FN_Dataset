To check the linked list is circular what will be the loop condition? I know further process like taking two pointers. Please suggest me.Let the one pointer is traversing the list faster than the other pointer. So, we can have one slower pointer just going through every item in the linked list, and the other faster pointer traversing every other item in the linked list. In non-circular list, the faster pointer will eventually hit a null pointer. But in a circular list, the faster pointer will eventually catch up to the slower pointer because the pointers are going in a circle. considering the two pointers to be as 'faster' and 'slower'. if (faster == slower || faster->next == slower) return true; //pointer is ever equal to slow then it's a circular list else{ // advance the pointers slower = slower->next; faster = faster->next->next; } 243 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Richa Sharma
