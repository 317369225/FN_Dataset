what s the highest order datum structure perhaps this be a interesting question with explicit answer , but you probably really have a problem with `` exactly how to define this '' . a list do not directly correspond to a unique datum structure , nor do a tree . a singly link list correspond to a -lrb- sufficiently unique -rrb- datum structure , as do a binary tree . when you say multus graph , you probably want to refer to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quiver_%28mathematics%29" rel="nofollow"> quiver </a> , i.e. a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multidigraph#directed_multigraph_.28edges_with_own_identity.29" rel="nofollow"> direct multigraph -lrb- edge with own identity -rrb- </a> . a binary or ternary quiver would again correspond to a -lrb- sufficiently unique -rrb- datum structure . however , any sufficiently canonical -lrb- and efficient -rrb- realization of a -lrb- n-ary -rrb- quiver as a datum structure would probably not match well with the way datatype be handle in `` common '' programming language , where the size of a object with a certain datatype shouldn t depend on the actual content of that object . therefore , this would be the point at which i would stop to look for a higher order datum structure -lrb- than a quiver , look for function like datum structure and continuation certainly be useful -rrb- . my reason for this be that i don t see the practical usefulness of a higher order datum structure if it can not be realize efficiently within `` common '' programming language .
