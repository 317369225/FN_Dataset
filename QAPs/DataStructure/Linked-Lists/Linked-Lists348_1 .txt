Is it compulsory to use dynamic memory allocation for implementing linked lists?It is not compulsory. Take the below code snippet. #include<stdio.h> struct node {  int val;  struct node *next; }; typedef struct node nodeL; int main() {  nodeL a,b,c,*temp;  a.val = 30;  b.val = 40;  c.val = 50;  a.next = &b;  b.next = &c;  temp = &a;  while(temp) {  printf("%d\n", temp->val);  temp = temp->next;  } } Linked List is defined a set of nodes with each node pointing to the next node or null. The number of nodes will be fixed in this way. 63 Views  View Upvotes
