why be quicksort describe as `` in-place '' if the sublist take up quite a bit of memory ? surely only something like bubble sort be in-place ? in addition to gille answer , you can also make quicksort in-place with you code , if you use link list instead of array . just make sure to remove the element from the original list , when append they to one of the smaller list . the follow pseudocode assumes\/guarantees : . while there be some optimization possible from the above code , this implementation have a greater memory overhead than the array base implementation in gille answer . additionally it suffer in practice from the problem that link list typically be less localized and thus induce a greater number of cache miss than maintain the same datum in a array . however , this implementation be of advantage , if you have to maintain pointer to the element through sorting . it be also good to be aware of it , if you be store you datum in a link list for reason unrelated to sort . -lrb- if in-place-ness of sorting be of concern , convert between list and array be likely out of question . -rrb-
