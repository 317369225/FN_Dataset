What is a slow pointer and a fast pointer in a linked list?Please give examples of questions where they are used.Let me explain you with an example. Think of tortoise and a hare running on a track. The faster running hare will catch up with the tortoise if track is like loop. Suppose the question is: Check whether the linked list ends in a loop. This problem can be solved by slowptr and fastptr. Think of like slowptr(tortoise) moves one pointer at a time and fastptr(hare) moves two pointer at a time. 704 Views  View Upvotes
