What is the use of a header linked list?In header node of linked list can maintain global properties of entire list and act as utility node. a) In header node you can maintain count variable which gives number of nodes in list. You can update header node count member whenever you add /delete any node. It will help in getting list count without traversing in O(1) time. b)In addition to address of first node you can also store address of last node. So that if you want to insert node at rear end you don't have to iterate from beginning of list. Also in case of DLL(Doubly Linked List) if you want to traverse from rear end it helps. 2.9k Views  View Upvotes
