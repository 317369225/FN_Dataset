usefulness of a link list with a cycle in the case of circular link list - this might be a buffer , neat structure to handle operation that must be consecutive or form a ring -lrb- like in parallel programming -rrb- . what if not the whole list be cycle ? <br> this might be intend like conflict resolve , and thanks to cycle it will not go further . <br> it might be the case that every operation change state so there be cycle , but it will eventually resolve . if you write a turn-based game with general loop , there might be cycle if user can do something multiple time per turn . so here it be intend . and totally not constructive - cycle come from bug , so it push application into infinite computation .
