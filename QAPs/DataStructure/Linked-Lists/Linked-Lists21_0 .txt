How do I go to the middle of the singularly linked list in one iteration?Use fast and slow runner technique. Make two pointers “fast_ptr” and “slow_ptr”, for every one forward iteration of fast_ptr move slow_ptr twice. So, when fast_ptr will reach the end, the slow_ptr will reach the middle position. You can use the fast and slow runner technique in most of the linked list questions like detecting loop in a linked list. 69 Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Hardik Solanki
