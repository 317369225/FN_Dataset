How can I Create a linked list as an ADT with vectors in C++?You can do a sort of linked list using a vector - the vector is used as a storage only. Instead of pointers, you use integer indexes for "next" and "prev" - which "point" to the storage in the vector. The main difference is that when you use pointers, you can allocate and free the linked list nodes easily. If you use a vector, "allocation" is easy, just do a push_back() and use the last element of the vector as the new node. "Deallocation" is harder, you will have to swap the tail of the list with the deleted elements storage. I'm not sure this was the real intent of the assignment. But your instructor is wrong when he said "It is bad design". You can't make classic linked lists in any language without using pointers. The above technique is essentially using pointers in as much as array indices are like pointers. 530 Views  View Upvotes
