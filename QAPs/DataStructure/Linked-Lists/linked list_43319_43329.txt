what be the advantage of seperate chaining over open address ? suppose that you have a very large number of sufficiently uniform element , $ n $ , that you want to hash . we want to minimize lookup time , obviously . if we use separate chain with $ m $ link list , we lookup time will be , on average , $ o -lrb- n\/m -rrb- $ since we have $ n $ element and $ m $ bucket . the actual lookup time depend on whether we input set be sufficiently uniform or not , but for the sake of simplicity we can assume that it be . what be the downside of this ? link list and most other datum structure that we would use to do this make heavy use of pointer . a single query take $ o -lrb- n -rrb- $ pointer dereference . now consider two typical method of open address : linear probe and quadratic probe . linear probe traverse the space allot for open address and place the element that it be hash at the first available memory location -lrb- at the $ i ^ \ text -lcb- th -rcb- $ step , we look at index $ i $ to see if it be free -rrb- . quadratic probe traverse by increment the index by $ i ^ 2 $ on each step . this can lead to immense speed-up due to its cache-friendliness -lrb- as mention in the first comment , this be call spatial locality -- i d suggest <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~fussell/courses/cs429h/lectures/lecture_18-429h.pdf" rel="nofollow"> reading this </a> if you re unfamiliar -rrb- .
