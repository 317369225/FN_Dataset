What is the advantage of keeping the next pointer as first element of structure in linked list?Other than readability — you expect a linked list node to have next pointer — the only advantage I can think of for placing it as the first element is that the machine instruction for accessing it would not need an index value. Assume register rax contains a pointer to a node. We can access the next pointer with a simple dereference: movl (%rax), %ecx If next wasn’t the first element, an index would be needed: movl 0x8(%rax), %ecx This might save a machine cycle (depending on the processor architecture.) But it would only really matter for one operation: counting the elements (hopping from next pointer to next pointer until one turns up nil.) Accessing any other element would require indexing, making such efficiency moot. This shouldn’t be a concern unless performance analysis tools reveal it to be a hotspot, which isn’t likely. “We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil." — Tony Hoare 125 Views · View Upvotes
