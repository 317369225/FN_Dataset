Can somebody explain about unrolled linked lists?For avoiding space complexity in Doubly Linked List ,Unrolled linked lists came into existence. In simple terms, an unrolled linked list is a linked list of small arrays, all the same size N. Each is small enough that inserting or deleting from it is quick, but large enough so that it fills a cache line. An iterator pointing into the list consists of both a pointer to a node and an index into that node. 59 Views
