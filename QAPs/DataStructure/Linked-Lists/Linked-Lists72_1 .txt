How do I print the last ten data items in a linked list?You can do it without requiring additional buffers using two pointers as follows: - have one pointer p1 point at the eleventh element. - have one pointer p2 point at the head of the list. - while p1 != null, increment both pointers by one. - finally when p1 is null, p2 will be pointing to the tenth to last node. You can then just traverse the rest of the list with p2 and print as you go. Note: you will need to handle special case when there are less than 10 nodes in the list. 134 Views  View Upvotes
