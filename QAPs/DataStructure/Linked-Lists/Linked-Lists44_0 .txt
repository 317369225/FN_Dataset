How can i check whether a linked list is palindrome or not?When I reverse the second half of the list and compare it with the first part,I can tell that it's palindrome or not than why do I need to again join the second half with first half of the list??Case - 1 If this is a doubly linked list, this will be fairly a easy task. 1. Find the Head and Tail of the List 2. Start comparing elements from Head and Tail. Repeat till we have non matching pair or till the head and tail cross each other  2.1 - Check if values are equal.  2.2 - If equal, Traverse forward from Head and Reverse from Tail.  2.3 - Else Break the loop, saying we don't have a palindrome. 3. After end of 2, no non-matching pair found then we have a palindrome. Case - 2 If we have only a singly linked link, with only forward pointer. Then we need to read the contents as we go and store them till the pattern starts to repeat. When the pattern reverses check them with the existing content. if equal, list is a palindrome, else it is not. or if you can find the half way mark, using the length of the list, contents in the first half and the second can be matched. We need not make a new list which is the exact reverse of the first one, demands both Memory and Time. Always have a thumb rule to keep an eye on Time-Space trade off. Making a new copy involves both space and time overhead. Please let me know if you have any questions in the comments section. Cheers! 151 Views
