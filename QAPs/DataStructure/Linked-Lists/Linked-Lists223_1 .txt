What is linked list in data structure?Just as an array is the collection of the continuous memory locations of any certain type like int ,float , char or even a pointer. For eg. In C++ language, we declare an array like the following syntax : type identifier[size] ; int arr[5] ; Here, arr is the array of type integer and size 5. It will be stored in the continuous memory locations. It is mainly used when we know the size before hand. We can retrieve an element of the array by mere mentioning the position of the element in the square brackets i.e. the subscript. In the same way, linked list is the collection of nodes. The node has 2 parts : Element which has to be stored Pointer to the next node (address of the next node) The nodes are not stored at continuous memory locations unlike array but they are stored anywhere in the memory wherever the space is available. So to link one node to the other, we are having the pointer part of the node which points to or contains the address of next node. This way we can retrieve the elements of the linked list sequentially. The pointer part of the node is generally denoted as next as shown in the diagram as it points to the next node. The last node of the linked list always has NULL in its pointer part as it points to nothing and its the end of the linked list. We can also futher add or remove links to/ from the linked list and also make one node pointing to some other node. We can have multiple operations in array as well as in linked list like retrieval of elements, insertion, deletion etc. Linked list has multiple pros like no wastage of memory but on the same side , it has cons too like dangling references and garbage . Good luck ! :) 229 Views  View Upvotes
