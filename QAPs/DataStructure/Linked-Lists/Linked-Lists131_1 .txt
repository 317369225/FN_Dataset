Where are linked lists used in real life?A good example I see is web-browsers, where it creates a linked list of web-pages visited, so that when you check history (traversal of a list) or press back button, the previous node's data is fetched. Linked list are usually a basic dynamic data structure which implements queues and stacks and I hope you already know real life example for them. 2.2k Views  View Upvotes
