How do I solve the following question in Java: I have two linked lists, representing two numbers: l1: 2->3->4, l2: 7->8; add these two numbers and store the result in l1, i.e. l1 should become l1: 3->1->2?I want to do this WITHOUT reversing the lists, i.e. just using RECURSION? All answers with reversing the lists are useless for me.Here are recursive solutions for this problem: Sum of Two Linked Lists using Recursion | Set 1 Sum of Two Linked Lists using Recursion | Set 2 and here is the solution using stacks: Sum of Two Linked Lists using Stacks Algorithm using stacks: 1. Create stack 's1' by pushing all node values of the first linked list to a stack. 2. Create stack 's2' by pushing all node values of the second linked list to a stack. 3. Create an empty stack 's3' to store the result of addition. 4. Initialize sum and carry to 0. 5. Pop the top element from stack 's1'. Let this top element be 'value1'. 6. Pop the top element from stack 's2'. Let this top element be 'value2'. 7. Make 'sum' = (value1 + value2 + carry)%10 and push this 'sum' to stack 's3' and make 'carry' = (value1 + value2 + carry)/10. 8. Repeat steps 5-7 till one of the stacks become empty. If both stacks are of same size, then both of the stacks would become empty at the same time. 9. If stack 's1' has elements left in it then - a. Pop the top element from stack 's1'. Let this top element be 'value1'. b. Make 'sum' = (value1 + carry)%10 and push this 'sum' to stack 's3' and make 'carry' = (value1 + carry)/10. c. Repeat steps 9a and 9b until stack 's1' is not empty. 10. Similarly, if stack 's2' has elements left in it then - a. Pop the top element from stack 's2'. Let this top element be 'value2'. b. Make 'sum' = (value2 + carry)%10 and push this 'sum' to stack 's3' and make 'carry' = (value2 + carry)/10. c. Repeat steps 10a and 10b until stack 's2' is not empty. 11. After all the above steps are executed, if carry is greater than 0, push it to the resultant stack 's3'. 12. Create an empty linked list 'result'. Now pop elements one by one from the stack 's3', and keep appending them to the 'result' linked list until stack 's3' is not empty. Return the output as 'result' linked list. Hope this helps. 211 Views  View Upvotes
