Under what circumstances would a web developer need to use data structures such as Linked Lists, BST, and Graphs?It is always good to know standard data structures. You can may be avoid using linked lists by using an array or some abstract data structure similar to a vector. But if you need control over how memory is allocated and you like using references and pointers, it is good to know how to use linked lists (at least conceptually), so you can use some similar version of it. If you are creating a web application that provides users with something like a word document. You need to take care of how one page links to another, and you can provide faster seek operations if you have the pages physically next to one another. If you're providing webpages that the user cannot return to (something like a game/news feed where you cannot return to a previous position/location), you need a data structure similar to a Directed Acyclic Graph. If you know your data better, you might choose to implement it in the form of a tree, and if you need to search quickly through your tree you need a BST. You should know how to implement prefix trees if you're going to provide your users a faster search feature. Or hashmaps to create a password protected sign in system. You'll always be in need of data structures and either consciously or not, you'll be making use of them everyday. 371 Views  View Upvotes
