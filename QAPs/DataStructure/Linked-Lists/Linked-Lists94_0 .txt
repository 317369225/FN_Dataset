In Java, how does one create a linked list from one list with pairs of player names, another with the associated Thread, and a 3rd list associating the object ID/counter?A2A. I'm having trouble conceptualizing the purpose of the data structure you've described here. The way you are describing it makes it sound like a relation (list) on a tuple of the following attributes: [ID, counter, PlayerNamePair, Thread] I can't think of a reason why you would want to associate a thread with an individual tuple. Can you clarify your requirements a bit? 144 Views
