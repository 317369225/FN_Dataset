What is the most efficient way to randomize/shuffle a linked list?Can it be done in O(1) space and O(n) time? Or better than both O(n) space and O(n^2) time?Traverse the list once to append the addresses of each of the elements in the list to an array of 'n' entries - O(n) space. Shuffle the array like you would do always - O(n) time. Re-create the links in the linked list by following the shuffled array addresses in O(n) time. 1.1k Views  View Upvotes
