What is the use of append and prepend operations in a linked list?To write an append method reasonably means you're tracking the last node. That means you don't have to go find the last node by walking the whole list, so it's an O(1) operation instead of O(n).  A prepend operation is the only one that needs to modify the head node, so by writing it you can have an insert method that doesn't need a reference to the head node (as long as you can guarantee that "insert" never means "prepend"). 165 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Anish Tuladhar
