How can I implement circular queue by using linked list for finding number of nodes, circular queue nodes and time complexity?Circular Queue:- In a standard queue data structure re-buffering problem occurs for each dequeue operation. To solve this problem by joining the front and rear ends of a queue to make the queue as a circular queue Circular queue is a linear data structure. It follows FIFO principle. In circular queue the last node is connected back to the first node to make a circle. Circular linked list fallow the First In First Out principle Elements are added at the rear end and the elements are deleted at front end of the queue Both the front and the rear pointers points to the beginning of the array. It is also called as “Ring buffer”. Items can inserted and deleted from a queue in O(1) time. Circular Queue can be created in three ways they are Using single linked list Using double linked list Using arrays Using single linked list: It is an extension for the basic single linked list. In circular linked list Instead of storing a Null value in the last node of a single linked list, store the address of the 1st node (root) forms a circular linked list. Using circular linked list it is possible to directly traverse to the first node after reaching the last node. Using double linked list: In double linked list the right side pointer points to the next node address or the address of first node and left side pointer points to the previous node address or the address of last node of a list. Hence the above list is known as circular double linked list. 193 Views · Answer requested by Kammari Mahesh
