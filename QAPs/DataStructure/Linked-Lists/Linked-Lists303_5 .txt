How do you print a linked list backwards using recursion with classes?Are you required to use a singly linked list or can you simply use a doubly linked list? The doubly linked list may be the better choice. Start at the end and let the curser work backwards till it reaches the node after the head. Do you know the length of the linked-list? It is possible to record the length of a singly linked list by documenting (on the first pass) the linked list's length. Then, recursively, print out the individual node's value based on moving the curser length-1 for each pass with a base-case of zero. EDIT: Recursive statement, after the recursion call, often produces a "backwards answer." For example, the asterisk exercise has you print a number of spaces and a number of stars recursively. When placed before the recursive call, a triangle of asterisks form. When placed after the recursive call, an upside down triangle forms. 113 Views  Answer requested by Romeo Bismarck
