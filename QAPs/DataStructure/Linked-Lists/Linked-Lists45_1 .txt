How do I use stack to reverse a linked list?Its very simple. Start traversing your linked list element by element and keep on adding at begin of the new linked list in which u have to store the reversed linked list. Ur linked list will be stored in that new linked list in reverse order. And yes this is stack implementation as elements are added only at one end of the list. Extract From 64 Views
