What are the differences between arrays and linked lists?A couple differences are that memory is fixed during compile time with arrays and with linked lists memory is allocated during run time as you need it. Also insertion and deletion is "expensive" for arrays, but "cheap" with linked lists. This is important because with a fixed size if the limit isn't reached the program is wasting memory. Also with arrays when adding and removing elements in the middle or the front, all the elements need to be shifted over to prevent a "memory leak". This is a very "expensive" task when there are a lot of elements. With linked lists, nodes are allocated as you need them, so you never waste memory. Also inserting and deleted nodes is very "cheap" because the pointers just need to be adjusted. Another difference is that memory with arrays have continuous addresses, and with linked lists the memory is randomly picked. 2k Views  View Upvotes
