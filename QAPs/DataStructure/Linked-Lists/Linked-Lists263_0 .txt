What are some practical, real-world code use cases of a linked list?Whenever there are an unknown number of elements at run-time. Linked lists are dynamic. They can be grown and pruned. Insertion and deletion of elements are easy. Remember you can't delete an item in the middle of an array. You'd have to shift everything. Linear data structures (e.g. stack, queue) are easy implemented Lower memory overhead It's about the cost of memory allocation. With a linked list, you don't have to allocate and waste all that space you are not using yet. Or you don't have to reallocate a bigger memory block because you are growing your collection. Almost any dynamic collection of items is suitable for a linked list. Operating systems and file systems are full of linked lists. So I have to ask where they are not used at all? Example. Implement a to-do list manager. There are an unknown number of to-do items. Moreover there are an unknown number of to-do lists. 348 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Chris Purrone
