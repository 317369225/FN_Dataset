Why should the first node (the head) of a linked list be declared as a pointer rather than as an object of the structure or class?Linked lists can be thinkable as seperate datas that linked eachother. So you must know that there will be no any location similarity between them. I mean, while your first object located at the first address, your second one could be in the whole another place like the en of the addresses. So you need to link them to eachother, to walk through to them. And pointers are the ways that you can do that. In the structure that you define above, you see that there is a pointer which named "next". This variable waits for you to point it to another object, and that another object will be "id", and id's next pointer will show another id. This will survive till your next pointer points to a NULL id. That way it will understand that "now I am at the end, I must state this as a last object". Now here is the answer. If you have no any pointer in your structure, you can point it's id variable, but you can not use it's next pointer that needs to point something for you to see your next id. Hope this is clear for you. 43 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Romeo Bismarck
