Can we delete the 1st node in the linked list?Yes. You simply set your head pointer or sentinel node to point to the next node in the list. Note that if you are programming in a language that doesn’t have garbage collection (eg C) then you will need to free the memory that the 1st node used. A suitable function in C would be: SListNode *deleteFirst(SListNode *head) { SListNode *second; if (head == NULL) { return NULL; } else { second = head->next; free(head); return second; } } This function would typically be invoked with: head = deleteFirst(head); 299 Views · View Upvotes
