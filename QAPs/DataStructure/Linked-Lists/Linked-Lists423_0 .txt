Isn't a blockchain essentially a linked list?Yes, as a data structure a blockchain is similar to a linked list (but it refers to the previous block using its hash rather than using a pointer, thus strictly speaking it is not a linked list). But a blokchain is not so much a data structure as it is a protocol for arriving to a consensus in a decentralized environment. A blockchain isn't a blockchain without rules which describe how nodes validate blocks, select the best chain etc. 676 Views  View Upvotes
