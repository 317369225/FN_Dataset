How can we delete the last node in the linked list in Java, when we only have a pointer to that last node?Instances of classes cannot be deleted in Java (the JVM). The only thing you can do is hold no reference to it anywhere in your code (local variables up any thread’s stack and within other class instances). Then, eventually, the garbage collector may reclaim that unreferenced instances’s space. It may call that instances finalizer when it does so. 462 Views · View Upvotes
