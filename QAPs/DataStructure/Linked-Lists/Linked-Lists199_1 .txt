What is linked list pointer?linked list pointer is a pointer which holds the address of a linklist. lets create a structure . typedef struct linklist { char ch; int number; struct linklist *next; }NODE; so here i create a node NODE *ptr; here ptr is pointer which can hold an address of NODE. where next is a pointer which can hold the address of next NODE. there is no deference between ptr and next pointer because both will hold the nodes address. 13 Views
