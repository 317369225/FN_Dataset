What is an efficient function to search and delete a node in linked list? Could somebody write the code for it in C++?View image: Deletenode This is the function that my professor created. Is that way the only way to delete a node in a linked list?The asymptotically best function for searching in a linked list is really Ω(n), because the only way to find some element on a list is to follow the "next" pointers until you get to that element. So, an "efficient" searching algorithm on a linked list is, really, Θ(n). The search-and-delete algorithm for a singly-linked list would look like this (edited to address the issues of a comment; also, the function assumes the node's memory is managed somewhere else): struct node { node *next; int value; };   node *deleteNode(node *head, int value) { node *prev = nullptr, *cur; for (cur = head; cur; prev = cur, cur = cur->next) if (cur->value == value) break;   if (prev && cur) prev->next = cur->next;   return prev ? head : head->next; // the new head of the list } This code "deletes" the node from the list by making the previous node's next pointer point to whatever the deleted node's next pointer is pointing to. If you have a doubly-linked list implementation, you don't need to save "prev" and you can just do: node->prev->next = node->next; node->next->prev = node->prev; So, basically, this is the best you can do with linked lists, but that's the trade off of being so fast to insert and remove elements from anywhere on the list.
