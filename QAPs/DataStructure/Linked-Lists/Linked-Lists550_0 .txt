What would be the algorithm to find the middle element of the linked list without using an integer variable? Do not assume that the number of nodes is given.If you're using a classical linked list and you need to find the middle you're not using the right data structure. This is an O(n) operation because you have to do traversal. This happens even if you know the size of the list. (O(n/2) is still O(n)).
