How do I optimise linked list?First of all it depends on your data and the specific usage. In practice not all IO operations are born equal (See Memory hierarchy), You can study a little about Pages, Virtual memory, etc..., and try and optimize IO access time by your data structure. Just off the tip of my head, you may choose to make the linked list of block-nodes where each node is block-sized and contains an array implementation of a list (each item is a struct with the value and the index of the prev/next item). This way you may have to compress your list after a lot of deletes but you get a better chance to use the CPU-cache when sequentially going through your data structure. 175 Views
