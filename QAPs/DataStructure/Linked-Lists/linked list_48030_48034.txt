what be the average time complexity , for a single link list , for perform a insert ? either if you want to insert at the end of the list or at the beginning of the list , you re go to have $ o -lrb- 1 -rrb- $ complexity for that and $ o -lrb- 1 -rrb- $ space . if you want to insert at the beginning of the list , you just make the new list head the node you want to insert , and link it to the previous list head . if you want to insert at the end of the list , you can also hold the end of the list as a pointer and insert a new node after it . if you want to insert in a arbitrary place in the list , then linearly go there be go to be the best you can do -lrb- to my knowledge -rrb- . statistically you ll have to go through $ -lrb- n +1 -rrb- \/ 2 $ node to get through yours .
