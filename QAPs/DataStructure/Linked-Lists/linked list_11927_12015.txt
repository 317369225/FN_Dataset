sequential hash tree traversal you want to access every leaf in a tree , you probably do not want to start from the root every time . if you would then you need indeed $ o -lrb- n \ log n -rrb- $ time . if you only want to access all the leaf in the tree , do a depth-first-search traversal and you be do in $ o -lrb- n -rrb- $ . if you only want to have every other leaf , do the same , but ignore the `` unwanted '' element . in datum structure design one often take the leaf and put they -lrb- in order -rrb- in a double link list . this only cost a constant factor more place , but speed up sequential access .
