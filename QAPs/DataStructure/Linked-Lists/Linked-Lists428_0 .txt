How do I come up with the logic to construct a reverse print method that prints the nodes on a linked list using a recursive approach using Java?You only need to reverse one line in your program. public void print(Node head) {  if(head == null)  {  return;  }  else  {  //Call your function on the head.next then print the value in // current node.  print(head.getNext());  // element is basically the data  System.out.println(head.getElement());  } } The logic is very simple, program will go on calling itself with argument being the next head each time but will only print once all the previous function calls have returned. And first return will occur when head is tail.next i.e. null. Then, the program execution will return to the previous call when function argument was tail. and it'll print tail's value. After that program will return to the execution of the function call which has argument as the previous node of tail, and it'll print its value. And so on. Hence, linked list will be printed in reverse. 216 Views  View Upvotes
