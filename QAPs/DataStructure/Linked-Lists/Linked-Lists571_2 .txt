How do I implement a C program that uses a linked list to delete the last node which has the value "x"?I hope you've implemented the linked list already. Your linked list node structure would be like Struct Node { Element e; Node *next; }; So to delete the last node that has value x.. You do the following Function deletelastx { Node *last, *temp; temp = first; //start of linked list, global value last = (Node *)malloc(sizeof(Node)); while(temp -> next -> next != null) { if(temp -> next -> element == x)  last = temp; } temp = last -> next; //the node having x last -> next = last -> next -> next; free(temp); } // end of deletelastx 149 Views  View Upvotes
