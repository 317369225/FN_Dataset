What does it mean to reverse a linked list in a recursive "non-destructive" way? How can I code it in Java?Non-destructive way usually means you are not deleting any of the nodes in the original list to create a new one. Instead they want you just to re-arrange the pointers (or with Java, the references). In general your method would be to: 1. Change the head of the list to refer to the last node of the list and vice versa. 2. Change all the next pointers (and previous pointers if it is a doubly-linked list) to point to their "previous" node (and vice versa). 3. Test with a simple list where the nodes hold the values 1 through 10 so it is easy to see if it is reversed correctly. Best wishes! 307 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
