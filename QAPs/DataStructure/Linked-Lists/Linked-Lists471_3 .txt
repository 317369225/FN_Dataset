How do I implement a C code to insert an element at the middle of the linked list if the size of the list is not known?There can be two approaches: 1. Simple one: Traverse the list and count the number of nodes and then Traverse the list upto the half of the count. 2. Efficient one: Take two pointers, one pointer with two nodes at a time and one with one node at a time. When the first pointer reaches the end, the second one will be at mid. Insert the element. Tell me if there are more. 242 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Swati
