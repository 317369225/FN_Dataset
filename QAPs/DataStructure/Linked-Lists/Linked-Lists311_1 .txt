How can I write a C++ code that removes any duplicate values from a linked list?I've drawn many a diagram, tracing what my pointer are doing, but hitting a wall. No luck.You can write a function that copies the linked list into a new one in a sorted fashion. You can use your favorite sort algorithm to insert each node in the new list if the neighboring nodes are not duplicated. At the end, you can use the newly sorted linked list or the original one if you maintained the elimination of duplicates from both. 328 Views  View Upvotes
