datum structure as algorithm themselves a datum structure be a implementation of the adt . a adt can be assume to be a contract which guarantee certain operation in a promise amount of time . it doesn t state how it will layout the underlie datum in memory . now , it s up to the programmer to implement the adt which be know as datum structure . for example , stack be a adt and it can be implement over a linear datum structure like array or over a link datum structure like link list . regard you question i be not sure because it s say that : $ program = datum structure + algorithm $ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/algorithms_%2b_data_structures_%3d_programs" rel="nofollow"> reference </a> so , stack in itself be not a algorithm , but evaluate a postfix expression use a stack be a algorithm . it seem a subjective matter though .
