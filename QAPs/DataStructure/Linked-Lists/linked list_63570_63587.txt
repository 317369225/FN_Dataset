give a algorithm , do worst case time complexity `` class '' vary with array and link list ? note that complexity class be class of <em> problem </em> , not class of <em> algorithm </em> . specifically , complexity class be class of problem that can be solve within particular resource bound <em> by some algorithm </em> . so , for example , sort be in polynomial time because there be at least one algorithm that sort with this resource bind . -lrb- in fact , you probably know many algorithm that do this . -rrb- when it come to compare different algorithm for solve the same problem , yes , they may have different resource usage . the fact that you have random access to the element of a array but not to a link list mean that you can probably design more efficient algorithm base on array compare to those base on link list . and note that , by use different datum structure , they be different algorithm : they involve different computational step . note also that all of this be dependent on you model of computation . for example , if you re solve computational problem use turing machine , then array and link list be essentially the same thing , because we can only access the array by move the tape head sequentially through the element . typically , though , when analyze actual algorithm , we use model of computation , such as the random access turing machine , that correspond more closely to actual computer .
