order of storage of pointer for a link list of length n you have just describe the order . first you include the middle of the list . then the middle of the two half . and so on . that s the same storage convention as a heap : the child of node number $ x $ be $ 2x $ and $ 2x +1 $ , assume the first element be $ 1 $ . let s see what this mean for $ n = 7 $ . the middle of the list be element 4 , in binary 100 . the middle of the first half be 2 , in binary 010 , and of the second half 6 , in binary 110 . finally we have 001,011,101,111 . the order in binary be $ $ 100,010,110,001,011,101,111 . $ $ see if you can figure out a pattern .
