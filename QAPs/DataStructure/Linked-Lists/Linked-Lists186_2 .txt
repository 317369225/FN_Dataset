What is the advantage of keeping the next pointer as first element of structure in linked list?If the next pointer is the first field in the structure, then the you can link together objects of different types or sizes. Actually this would still be true if the next pointer is not strictly the first field, but is part of a fixed structure from which all the different types are derived. Another possibility is that the iassembly nstruction to access the next pointer is smaller and might even execute faster, because the offset is zero. This would depend on the CPU you're using, though. 124 Views
