What is the Static Linked List?Lists have two major sub categories - Linked List and Array List. In Linked List, each node is allocated memory when it is to be inserted dynamically. Each node contains a pointer pointing to the next node. But in Array List, we store values in an array and have another array storing the indices of the nodes which correspond to the next item in the list. There is one key array and one link array. Since the memory allocated to an array is constant, it is static. Edit: This is not the best definition of static. You can get better ones online :) Eg. Insert 1, 2, 3 Delete 2 Insert 4 Final Linked List 1->3->4 Array List Index Key Link 0 1 2 1 x x 2 3 3 3 4 -1 (end) 4 5 . . 889 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Ganesh Venkatraman
