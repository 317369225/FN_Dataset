How do I convert Array into Linked List?You don’t convert an array into a linked list, you copy the array element by element. (You can always delete the array afterwards if it is in heap space). The only “gotcha” about this process is that in a singly-linked list, new elements are added to the front of the list. So, if you wish the list to retain the same order as the array then you need to start at the last element in the array and work backwards. 176 Views · View Upvotes
