How do I insert a node at the end in a singly linked list in c?Follow this simple algorithm : Store the address of the 'START' pointer in some temporary pointer PTR.  2. With this PTR, traverse the linked list untill you reach NULL ie; END of  linked list.  3. Create new node and fill data in its Data Field, make its 'next field' null.  4. Make the 'NEXT' link field of the last node, point to the address of this new  node. I'd recommend you to write down your own code first, but if you still have doubts, google it, you can easily find lots of implementation of the same. Happy Learning. 134 Views  View Upvotes
