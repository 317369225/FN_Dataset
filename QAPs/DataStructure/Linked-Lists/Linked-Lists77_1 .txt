Why do I need a linked list and why is it important?The usefulness of a linked list is it's constant time insertion and deletion for any arbitrary node. Off the top of my head, queues benefit greatly from this feature, since they aren't searching for an item, and only inserting/deleting at the ends of the list. You can get away with an array, but arrays only have constant time for adding and removing the last object. Compound that with the memory and operation overhead from deleting the first element and arrays start looking pretty sour. Arrays can impose an additional cost on adding an item if the array  needs to be resized. Deletion of the last element is the only guaranteed  constant time operation†. Additionally, linked lists make some favorable tradeoffs in memory. For the added memory cost of the pointer per node, adding and deleting elements doesn't need additional memory that array resizing would require, making memory allocation more predicable for a given input. †That is, unless the library handling your dynamic array memory doesn't resize to a smaller array to minimize space. 1k Views · View Upvotes
