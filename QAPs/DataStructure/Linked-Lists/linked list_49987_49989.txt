branchless function equivalent the general answer to you question be no . consider a function which measure the length of a link list . how would you implement that without a branch ? but if you just stick with function which -lrb- say -rrb- take a machine word and return a machine word -lrb- which you example do -rrb- then the answer be `` yes , sort of '' . in fact , when analyze algorithm in the word-ram model , we conventionally assume that any function which take a fixed number of machine word and return a fixed number of machine word be constant-time , because it could -lrb- in principle , at least -rrb- be implement with a lookup table or a new cpu instruction . whether the branch-free version be more practical or not depend partly on the function and partly on the cpu s instruction set . don t forget , by the way , that pretty much all modern cpus have a conditional move instruction . some isa -lrb- e.g. arm -rrb- can do conditional execution of all , or almost all , instruction . so there s even more way to implement branch-free code there .
