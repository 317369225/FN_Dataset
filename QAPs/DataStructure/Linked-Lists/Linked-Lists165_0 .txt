What are good ways to delete node in a singly linked list (whose head is not known)?void deleteNode(Node *toDelete) { if (toDelete->next == NULL) { toDelete = NULL; return; }  toDelete->value = toDelete->next->value; toDelete->next = toDelete->next->next; } A function that pretty much does what the other answers are describing. It basically copies the value from the next element to the current one, and also it's next pointer. 968 Views
