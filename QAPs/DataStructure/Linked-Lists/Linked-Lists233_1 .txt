Why is linked list stored in heap memory?I will try to answer this question with the best of my knowledge! Linked list are created using dynamic memory allocation, say malloc. Dynamic memory allocations are made from the heap. The heap is a global resource containing all of the free memory in the system. The heap is handled as a linked list of unused blocks of memory, the so called free-list. I hope it helped! 239 Views  View Upvotes
