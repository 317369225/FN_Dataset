Given a linked list of n nodes in which the last element points to the middle element of list, how will you write a program for deleting a node in this list such that it will satisfy above property?Thanks for A2A!!! There will be two cases, one for linked list having ODD number of nodes and another one for linked list having EVEN number of nodes. I am just going to give the overview of the idea for the problem, you can code it in any programming language you want. Lets first take the case of linked list having ODD number of nodes. If a node before the middle node is deleted then nothing must be done. (I am assuming that for linked list having EVEN number of nodes, the first node of the two middle nodes will be the overall middle node of the linked list). If a node after middle node (including the middle node) is deleted, then next pointer of the last node must point to a node in front of the current middle node. In case of linked list having EVEN number of nodes. If a node before the current middle node (including the middle node) is deleted, then the next pointer of the last node must point to a node next of the current middle node. In other case nothing should be done. Hope you understand the logic I have presented here. In case of any clarification you can ping me anytime. Enjoy!!! 413 Views
