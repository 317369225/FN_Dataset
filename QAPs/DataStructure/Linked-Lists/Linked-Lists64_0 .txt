What are the applications of a singly linked list?The following are the applications of single linked list : single linklist provides an alternative to storing data using array , when your system needs to work under strict memory constraints such as low memory. Such scenarios may be encountered while designing embedded systems. linked list provides better insertion and deletion performance when it comes to implementing stack( O(1) ) as compared to array ( O (n) , if creating a dynamic variable size stack) linked list are better when it comes to storing graph as compared to array. Using adjacency matrix is not a good idea when it comes to storing sparse graph, as it leads to storage wastage. An adjacency list is better as it requires only O(E) space. 1k Views  View Upvotes
