What are circular Linked Lists? How do you create them?A circular linked list is a list with a tail node that points to the head node. A linked list, by contrast, is a list/set of items, where each item points to the next one, and you can add/remove items from the list at will without having to allocate an entire block of memory for it (as you do in an array). A typical linked-list node looks like the following: node { node next; data; } Notice, the nodes are linked as next->next->next...->next, and the payload of the node is the data. In a linked list, we typically have a head and tail node, with the head being first in the list and the tail last. To make it circular, we do tail.next=head. 237 Views  View Upvotes
