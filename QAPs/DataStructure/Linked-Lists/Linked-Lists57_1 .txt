How do I reverse elements of a linked list in groups of 'n' at a time, where n is less than equal to size of the linked list?Just use an extra count variable in a simple reverse linked list algo to make sure it reverses in groups and when counter reaches K recursively call list and make it next of first node. while(head!=NULL && counter<k) { prev=head; head=head->next; counter++; } if(counter==k) { prev->next=NULL; node *t=reverse(head1,p); head1->next=reverse_k(head,k); return t; }else return head1; } 209 Views  View Upvotes
