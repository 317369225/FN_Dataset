space complexity of direct and undirected graph it s hard to know for sure from what you ve write , but i suspect what you re do wrong be that you re consider what the space requirement would be for a complete graph . for a complete graph , the space requirement for the adjacency list representation be indeed $ \ theta -lrb- v ^ 2 -rrb- $ -- this be consistent with what be write in the book , as for a complete graph , we have $ e = v -lrb- v-1 -rrb- \/ 2 = \ theta -lrb- v ^ 2 -rrb- $ , so $ \ theta -lrb- v + e -rrb- = \ theta -lrb- v ^ 2 -rrb- $ . however , you shouldn t limit yourself to just complete graph . there be other graph that aren t complete , and have fewer edge than the complete graph . in general , the space for the adjacency list representation be $ \ theta -lrb- v + e -rrb- $ ; this fact hold for all graph , regardless of how many edge they have . why be this true ? it s because for each vertex you have a pointer to the head of a link list . that s $ \ theta -lrb- v -rrb- $ space for all of those pointer . also , the total number of node across all the link list be equal to $ 2e $ , as each edge $ -lrb- u , v -rrb- $ appear twice : once in the list for $ u $ , and once in the list for $ v $ . therefore the space need for all of the link list be $ \ theta -lrb- e -rrb- $ . add the space for the pointer and the space for the list give $ \ theta -lrb- v + e -rrb- $ . you <em> could </em> say that the space requirement for the adjacency list be $ o -lrb- v ^ 2 -rrb- $ . it s true that it will never be more than that . however , for some graph it will be much less . for instance , in a graph that be a simple path -lrb- $ v_1 \ to v_2 \ to \ dot \ to v_n $ -rrb- , there be $ v $ vertex and $ e = v-1 $ edge in total . for that graph , the adjacency list representation will need $ \ theta -lrb- v + e -rrb- = \ theta -lrb- v -rrb- $ space . thus the $ o -lrb- v ^ 2 -rrb- $ upper bind be very loose and too pessimistic .
