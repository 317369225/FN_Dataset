How do I simplify the following polynomial (linked list) in C?First of all as per the formulation of your problem, initially your linked list contains n nodes. Upon simplification it reduces to say m where m<=n. For finding m, we basically have to make comparison of n nodes which will take at least n! comparisons. Practically if n size is even 100 that would mean 93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000 comparisons. So, it appears the problem is not polynomial time solvable. Getting an exact algorithm with linked list will surely reward with some tough times. Polynomial curve fitting is one way that can try to handle the problem. You can take help of Genetic Algorithms and its variants. 176 Views
