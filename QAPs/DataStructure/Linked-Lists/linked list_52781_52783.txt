what be a limitation of use a array concern capacity ? array be define to have continous memory , so there be a need to extend it by find continous block that fit it in . <br> also the array size be give in advance . <br> the limit be the largest available continous block and possibility to index it . for example c define $ malloc $ and $ realloc $ , which seek such block -lrb- it may start in the same place as original array -rrb- . <br> $ realloc $ when find larger region in different place rewrite the content of the array . if there be no constraint about continous region - there be list of array use - smaller block connect in link list , easier to grow , but a bit slower to operate on . some language provide grow array , but internally it could be stack , list or anything else , so definition of `` what be array '' be crucial .
