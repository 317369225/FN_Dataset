How do I implement undo in C using linked lists?Depends but at a very generic level: Encapsulate the action a user does (for instane, cut in a texteditor might record where the cut was done, what text was cut, etc) Whenever the user does an action, capture it, and push it at the end of the list. when UNDO is issued, take the last element of the list (essentially, use it a a stack, push actions when user takes one, pop actions when undo is issued) Use the stored data to, restore state to what it was before the action was taken, using the recorded data. Of course, different application will recquire vastly different concrete implementation. 306 Views  View Upvotes
