How do I insert a node in a linked list in C++?Explain very very simply.When I was learning linked lists, I found that pictures helped a lot. Go ahead and draw a picture. A linked list is a set of nodes, where a node is some data plus a pointer to another node. You can draw this as a circle with your data inside and an arrow pointing to another circle. At the end of the linked list, you can draw the arrow pointing to NULL. So first draw a linked list -- circle for node A (put an A in the circle), arrow to next circle (B), arrow to next circle (C), arrow to NULL). So let's say you want to insert NEW between A and B. 1) Create a node and put whatever data you want in it. 1A) You can see that you want A to point to NEW, and NEW is going to point to B. 1B) Let's say we start to do that: you set A.Next to &NEW. That means that you erase the arrow from A to B and make A point to NEW. You don't have a reference to B any more: the only reference you had to it was the Next pointer from A. This is no good: undo this step (A should point to B again). We could create a pointer that points to B and that would work, but let's try something else first. 2) Let's say we do the other way: set NEW.Next to A.Next. Draw an arrow from NEW to B. 3) Now you can set A.Next to &NEW without losing B (because NEW.Next points to B already). Make sure this method works for inserting data between two different nodes, like B and C. Make sure it works for inserting data at the end (after C). Consider what it means to insert data into an empty list. 4k Views  View Upvotes
