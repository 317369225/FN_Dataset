How does inserting a new link works in linked lists?Before the first line: first -> (X, Y, next) -> ... After the first line: first -> (X, Y, next) -> ...   link -> (A, B, null) After the second line: first -> (X, Y, next) -> ... ^ | link -> (A, B, next) After the third line: . (X, Y, next) -> ... ^ | link -> (A, B, next) <- first After leaving the method, when link drops out of scope: first -> (A, B, next) -> (X, Y, next) -> ... I guess your issue is mostly with distinguishing references to data from the actual data. In Java, the actual objects are somewhere in the memory, the only thing you have are references to where they are, and when you do an assignment, what you actually are doing is issuing an instruction "make the reference on the left point to the result of the right". Meanwhile, you seem to be under the impression that you copy the object from link to first. That is definitely not the case. 346 Views  View Upvotes
