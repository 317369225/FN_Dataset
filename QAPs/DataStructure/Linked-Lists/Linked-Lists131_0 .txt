Where are linked lists used in real life?An interesting case many people don't think about is low level memory management (i.e. the heap as managed by malloc in C or new in Java, etc) if often implemented as a linked list, with each node representing a used or available (free) block of memory. These blocks may be of any size, change size (combine and split), be freed or assigned in any order, and reordered. A linked list means you can keep track of all of these "nodes" and manipulate them fairly easily. 3.8k Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
