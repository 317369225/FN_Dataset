How do I implement a C code to insert an element at the middle of the linked list if the size of the list is not known?There can be two approaches which can be applied to solve this problem. #1 : Traverse the whole link list to calculate the size of the list.It can be easily done by moving pointer in any direction till the end node is reached.Now,you can easily get the pointer to the middle element. #2 : Same as written by Anonymous, use two pointers one with single shift and second with double shift.When the second one reaches last node,the first pointer will be at middle node. 184 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Swati
