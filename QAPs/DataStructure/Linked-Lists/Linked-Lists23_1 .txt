What is a circular linked list in Java?Circular Linked List is when the last node in the Linked List points back to the first. An example application will be "Traffic Lights". They go like Green->Yellow->Red and then back to Green. How to create one? Really Easy! Create the base class first: public class List{ String color; List next; public List(String color) { this.color=color; } } Now that we have the base class ready if you do this is main: List list = new List("Green"); List temp = list; // we should have the pointer to green so that we can make it Circular later list.next = new List("Yellow") ; list.next.next= new List("Red") ; // now we need to set the next pointer back to the first one list.next.next.next = temp; // now the next link is the first one! Hope you understand now;) 234 Views  View Upvotes
