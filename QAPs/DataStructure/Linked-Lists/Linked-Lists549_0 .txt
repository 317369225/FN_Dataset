What is the use of a header linked list?The utility of a header node in a linked list is to simplify the functions of adding and deleting elements in the list. If you have a pointer in memory that points to the first element, then you need to pass the address of that pointer, rather than the value of that pointer, to the routines for list manipulation, because that pointer would need to change if an element were added or deleted at the head of the list. If that pointer, however, points to a special element in the list which is actually the pointer to the head of the list, then you do not need to pass the address of the pointer - you can pass its value, and it will never change. This technique "wastes" the data portion of that first element. One other use of the header node could be to store in its data value the no. of elements in the list. So, the use of header linked list lies in the utility of the header node of the linked list which is explained above. References : 1. http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is... 5.8k Views  View Upvotes
