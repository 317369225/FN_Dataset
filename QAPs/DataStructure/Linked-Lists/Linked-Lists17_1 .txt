Can we say a two dimensional array is same as a linked list; regardless of the fact that linked list is dynamic and arrays are static?No, we can’t. 2D or nD array and linked lists are completely different data structures. You can understand the difference by considering *vectors instead of arrays.  As both are different data structures, their access, searching, deletion time complexity varies. This is because arrays are contiguous and liked lists are non-contiguous. We refer arrays from a base address, and this can’t be changed. So, inserting element at beginning and in between is problematic, even if you consider it as dynamic. We refer linked lists from a reference node(head node, last node or any other in between). So, insertion is easy. 71 Views · View Upvotes
