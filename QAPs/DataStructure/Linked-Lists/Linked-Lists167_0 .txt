How do you reverse a linked list?Any language is fine; feel free to add multiple answers for multiple languagesIn perversely minimized C++ (without using the STL’s list::reverse or slist::reverse methods): for (node *tmp = NULL; swap(head, tmp), tmp; swap(head, tmp->next)); In Haskell (programming language) (without using the built-in reverse function): foldl (flip (:)) [] In SQL: UPDATE list LEFT JOIN list AS list2 ON list.id = list2.next SET list.next = list2.id; It’s all just a matter of perspective anyway: xrandr | sed -n 's/ connected .*//p' | xargs -I@ xrandr --output @ --reflect x 15.1k Views · View Upvotes
