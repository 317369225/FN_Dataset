In programming, when would you use a linked list over an array?If you are doing linear traversal much more than random access, or you are adding and deleting from random positions often, then a linked list would be preferable. If adding and deleting is rarer, and you will be doing random accesses a lot, an array is much better. All students should learn (roughly) how list and arrays work at a low level, what adding, deleting, traversing and accessing entail. It will better inform your decision on which one to use. 758 Views  View Upvotes
