sort doubly link list efficiently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mergesort" rel="nofollow"> mergesort </a> keep its $ \ theta -lrb- n \ log n -rrb- $ worst case on link list . double-linking can t help -lrb- except perhaps by improve the constant , though it s hard to see how -rrb- , because every comparison-based sort provably require $ \ omega -lrb- n \ log n -rrb- $ comparison in the worst case .
