What is disadvantage of using linked lists over arrays?Originally Answered: What is greatest disadvantage of using linked lists over arrays? They have a tendency to use more memory due to pointers requiring extra storage space Nodes are stored incontiguously, greatly increasing the time required to access individual elements within the list. Difficulties arise in linked lists when it comes to reverse traversing. For instance, singly linked lists are cumbersome to navigate backwards and while doubly linked lists are somewhat easier to read, memory is wasted in allocating space for a back pointer. 1k Views  View Upvotes
