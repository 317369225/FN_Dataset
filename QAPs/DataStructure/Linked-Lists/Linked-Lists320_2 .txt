Given two sorted linked lists, how do you find common elements of them?I will explain in two different method 1. Time Complexity: O(n^2)  For each element of 1st link list search in 2nd list untill you get the element or end of list. This method will take more time when elements are more. In asymptotic notation you can represent it in O(n^2). 2. This method is efficient but takes O(n) extra space, TC: O(n+m)=O(max(n,m)) Put each element of 1st list in hash table. Do it for 2nd too, if for any element you find element it in hash table print it, and printed elements will be your answer. I hope you got the idea. 78 Views
