What is linked list in data structure?Linked List is a linear data structure and it is very common data structure which consists of group of nodes in a sequence which is divided in two parts. Each node consists of its own data and the address of the next node and forms a chain. Linked Lists are used to create trees and graphs. Advantages: They are a dynamic in nature which allocates the memory when required. Insertion and deletion operations can be easily implemented. Stacks and queues can be easily executed. Linked List reduces the access time. Disadvantages: The memory is wasted as pointers require extra memory for storage. No element can be accessed randomly; it has to access each node sequentially. Reverse Traversing is difficult in linked list. Types: Single Linked List: Singly linked lists contain nodes which have a data part as well as an address part i.e. next, which points to the next node in sequence of nodes. The operations we can perform on singly linked lists are insertion, deletion and traversal. Doubly Linked List: A doubly linked list is a list that has two references, one to the next node and another to previous node. Circular Linked List: In the circular linked list the last node of the list contains the address of the first node and forms a circular chain. Applications of Linked Lists Linked lists are used to implement stacks, queues, graphs, etc. Linked lists let you insert elements at the beginning and end of the list. In Linked Lists we don’t need to know the size in advance. 152 Views · View Upvotes
