impact on the order of element on the cost of search in a link list i m assume cost be strictly positive . otherwise it doesn t make much sense to consider the quantity $ p_i \/ c_i $ . regard 1 : consider any order , and suppose that for some $ i $ , $ p_i \/ c_i < p _ -lcb- i +1 -rcb- \/ c _ -lcb- i +1 -rcb- $ . suppose that we switch the element $ i $ and $ i +1 $ . say that we switch between $ \ ldot , a , b , \ ldot $ and $ \ ldot , b , a \ ldot $ . let $ \ delta $ be the difference in average search cost -lrb- new cost minus old cost -rrb- . when look for $ a $ , which happen with probability $ p_i $ , we have to pay $ c _ -lcb- i +1 -rcb- $ more . when look for $ b $ , which happen with probability $ p _ -lcb- i +1 -rcb- $ , we have to pay $ c_i $ less . so $ $ \ delta = p_i c _ -lcb- i +1 -rcb- - p _ -lcb- i +1 -rcb- c_i = -lrb- p_i \/ c_i - p _ -lcb- i +1 -rcb- \/ c _ -lcb- i +1 -rcb- -rrb- c_i c _ -lcb- i +1 -rcb- < 0 . $ $ in other word , the switch be beneficial . we conclude that the optimal arrangement be to store the element in non-increasing order . <em> how i find this proof : </em> i try to construct a counterexample by try a few example on two element , but i didn t work . so i decide to write the inequality enjoy by such a counterexample , and solve they in order to find one . the solution show that in fact no counterexample be possible . regard 2 : this be quite easy to construct , especially in view of part 1 , which give a condition for optimality in case there be only two element . i m sure you can handle this part yourself .
