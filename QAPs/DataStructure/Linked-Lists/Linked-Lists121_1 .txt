What may be the application of a singly circular linked list?If you are looking for a real life application, think of storing the cities in a monopoly board game and keeping track of where the players are.. Or storing the player names in any multi-player board game, and using a pointer to indicate whose it is. For any such problem which is is inherently circular in nature, we may use this data structure. It is also used to simulate a queue, and the operating system can use it for storing incoming jobs to implement time sharing in round-robin or srtf context switching strategy. 290 Views
