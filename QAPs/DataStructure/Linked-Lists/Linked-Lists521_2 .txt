What is the most efficient way to randomize/shuffle a linked list?Can it be done in O(1) space and O(n) time? Or better than both O(n) space and O(n^2) time?You can do it in O(n) space and O(n) time by first converting the linked list to an array. Fisher-Yates shuffle or any of its variants shuffle an array in O(n) time. Convert the array back to a linked list and you are done. Update: Assuming the size of a linked-list element and a dynamic array element is about the same, then you only need O(1) extra space if you release the memory for the linked list as you perform element-wise conversion to a dynamic array. Then do the same when you convert back to a linked list. 1.4k Views  View Upvotes
