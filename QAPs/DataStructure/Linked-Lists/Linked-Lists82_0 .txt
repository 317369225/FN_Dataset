What is the use of append and prepend operations in a linked list?Prepend to a singly linked list which only allows O(1) removal from the head gets you a stack with Last In First Out behavior. That's useful for parsing (balancing quotes or parenthesis by pushing on the open and popping on the close) and when you have operations which must be undone or closed in reverse order. Append on a singly linked list gets you a queue with First In First Out behavior. Processing requests in that order is common and provides more predictable latency. On a doubly linked list which allows O(1) out-of-order removal given a pointer or reference to the node you can use them to control order, like removing then prepending items in a cache on access so you can do Least Recently Used evictions from the other end of the list. 703 Views  View Upvotes
