Can a linked list traversal run-time do better than O(n) - linear run-time?It depends how the linked list is stored in the memory and whether you care about I/O efficiency or not. The straightforward traversal of the linked list has complexity of O(N) I/O-s, the best you can do is O(N/BlogM/BN/B) O(N/BlogM/BN/B) where M is the size of internal memory and B is the size of lines that you can transfer each time from external memory. For large values of B it is much better than O(N). Look for I/O efficient list ranking algorithm. 457 Views  View Upvotes
