implement queue with a link list ; why would it be bad to insert at the head and remove at the tail ? remove from the head and insert at the tail be both constant time operation with a singly link list , assume head and tail pointer . insert at the tail be also constant time . but remove from the tail mean move the tail pointer toward the head , and since you don t have a back pointer you can t do that without traverse the whole list to find the element previous to the tail . this make insertion a linear time instead of a constant time operation and that s why it s worse .
