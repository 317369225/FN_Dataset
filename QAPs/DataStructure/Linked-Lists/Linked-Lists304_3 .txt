What is an efficient function to search and delete a node in linked list? Could somebody write the code for it in C++?View image: Deletenode This is the function that my professor created. Is that way the only way to delete a node in a linked list?The style is a little weird, but that's basically right. In order to delete a node from a singly linked list, you need to do two things - First, you need to find the incoming pointer to the node you want to delete. This search takes linear time, because you have to examine each node in order to find the one you want to delete. Second, you need to remove the node from the list. This means updating the incoming pointer so that it points to the following node, and any cleanup of the node itself (freeing memory, adding the node back to a pool of unused nodes, whatever). This takes constant time. Linear time plus constant time equals linear time. In big-O terms, this algorithm is optimal - you're not going to find a better-than-linear solution. Note, if you already have a reference to the (incoming pointer to the) node, say because you searched for it previously or were already traversing the list, you can perform just the removal in constant time. Here's a (perhaps) easier to read version: template<typename T> void SinglyLinkedList<T>::RemoveVal(T remove_me) { // incoming_ptr is the pointer that needs to be fixed up when we delete Node<T>** incoming_ptr = &head; Node<T>* cur = *incoming_ptr;  // find the (first) node that maches remove_me while (cur && cur->val != remove_me) { // move to the following node incoming_ptr = &cur->next; cur = *incoming_ptr; } if (!cur) { throw new NotFoundException(); }  // patch the link between the previous node and the next node *incoming_ptr = cur->next;  // clean up the found node ReleaseNode(cur); } 299 Views  Answer requested by Romeo Bismarck
