In what situations are singly linked lists the preferred data structure?Is it just stacks?Linked Lists are the preferred data structures when you do not know the number of elements that you are going to store in a list during compile time and will come to know only during the run time. By using Linked Lists, we can dynamically allocate the memory and use these data structures. For example, suppose you have to read a file containing some items and you have many such files. Each file may contain different number of items. In this case, you do not know how many items will be there in each file. So just read each file, assign memory dynamically, store the items and process them. This will work if multiple files with variable number of items are added at a later point of time. However, if the inputs are large, then you may have to go for BSTs. 404 Views  View Upvotes
