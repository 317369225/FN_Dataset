Why do we use struct node in linked lists and trees?node is generic terminology for linked list and tree data structures. You can use your terminology also. Like for stack operations we generally use push, pop and peek operations. you can use insert, delete, printTop. reason why we use structures here is, we have some predefined data types in programming languges like int, float, char etc. but what if you want customized data type to store various predefined data types. here we can use structures. i hope itâ€™s clear now. any doubt please comment. 160 Views
