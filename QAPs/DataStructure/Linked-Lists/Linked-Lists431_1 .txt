Is it possible to write a method that displays all the elements in a circular linked list?Yes. It indeed possible. A circular linked list is a linked list in which the last element points to the head of the linked list. So when you iterate through the list, just make sure that head of the list appears only once. void display(Node *head) { if (head == NULL) { return; }  Node *curr = head->next; printf("%d ", head->data); while (curr != head) { printf("%d ", curr->data); curr = curr->next; } printf("\n"); } 190 Views  View Upvotes
