hash table collision : why use a link list if we can use a hash set ? a hash set be a hash table . use a hash set to handle collision in a hash table be equivalent to use a bigger hash table , with a hash function which be a combination of the hash function of both level . in other word , you d probably be better with a bigger initial table -lrb- for instance there be no risk of resonance between the two hash function which could lead to a higher collision rate than expect at the second level -rrb- .
