What is a circular linked list in Java?Circular Linked List Circular Linked List is little more complicated linked data structure. In the circular linked list we can insert elements anywhere in the list whereas in the array we cannot insert element anywhere in the list because it is in the contiguous memory. In the circular linked list the previous element stores the address of the next element and the last element stores the address of the starting element. The elements points to each other in a circular way which forms a circular chain. The circular linked list has a dynamic size which means the memory can be allocated when it is required. Implementing Circular Linked List Implementing a circular linked list is very easy and almost similar to linear linked list implementation, with the only difference being that, in circular linked list the last Node will have it's next point to the Head of the List. In Linear linked list the last Node simply holds NULL in it's next pointer. class Node { public: int data; //pointer to the next node node* next; node() { data = 0; next = NULL; } node(int x) { data = x; next = NULL; } } 172 Views
