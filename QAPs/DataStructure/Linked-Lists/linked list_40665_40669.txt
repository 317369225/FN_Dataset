why the pointer in link list be of structure type ? you can use a untyped pointer if you wish , but the advantage of have a pointer to a structure be type safety it help you protect yourself from misuse the pointer . when implement in machine code , the pointer be indeed untyped . it s not a terribly good idea to implement a pointer as a integer , however , since the size of both be implementation dependent and could differ . on you system a particular type of integer have the same size as a pointer , but on another system that same type of integer have a different , perhaps smaller , size . sometimes you even have to worry about several type of pointer .
