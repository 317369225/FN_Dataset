How do linked lists work?Let's take up a real life example. Suppose you are a teacher and you decided to take 15 students for an educational movie and luckily you find that there were only 16 seats left. But unfortunately, the vacant seats are not in order. They are spread all over the hall. Being the teacher, it's your responsibility to keep track of all the students. But it's really difficult to remember all the seat numbers. An amazing idea strikes into your mind. You remember the seat number of only 1st student and tell the first student to remember the seat number of the second student and so on... Basically you ask the student to remember the seat number of the next student. So, if you have to reach 10th student, you go to the first one, take the seat number of second and repeat the same steps until u reach 10th student. Let's try connection this to Linked List. Students are like the nodes. Seat numbers are like the address of the nodes. Nodes contain two parts. First part is where the data is stored and in the second part, the address of the next node is stored. Nodes can be a structure or class with a pointer, pointing to itself, as it's member. For example, in C++: struct node { int a; //data node *next; //pointer of type node }; In linked list, first node has some data and also the address of the second node. Suppose we create a node. This is the first node and we store 17 in it. Now, as this is the first node, the pointer should be initialized to NULL. Then, we create another node and store 23. At this point, the pointer in the first node should be made to point to second one. Like this we create 4 more nodes and store 55, 72, 14 and 62 respectively. The pointer of the last node should be NULL. 227 Views  View Upvotes
