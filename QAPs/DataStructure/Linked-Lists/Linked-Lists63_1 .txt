Why do we use a circular linked list when we can achieve the same implementation just by starting from the head again when we reach the NULL node?Honestly it is a bit vague to answer why or why not Circular Linked List instead of a Straight Chain Linked List. Both have their pros and cons. Say if you are implementing a queue, you can maintain a pointer to the last inserted node and front can always be obtained as next of last. Hence here is an advantage. Another place where we can exploit the advantage is Operating Systems where we adobt scheduling algo's which involve allocating a small part of the CPU burst cycle to a process and then keep oit waiitng while the other Process. Ins short, QUEUE again ;) Another such application is 'Fibonacci Heap'. 110 Views
