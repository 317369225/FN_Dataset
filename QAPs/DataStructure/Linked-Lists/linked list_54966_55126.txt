dijkstra s algorithm on huge graph there be library available to compute shortest path on such graph . how do they do this ? more specifically , how do they load the required part of the graph to run dijkstra s algorithm ? you can use a db , a custom file format to be read from disc and a in-memory setting . but from my experience use a db be roughly 5 to 10 time slower and a lot more memory intense than write you own file format base on a simple link list format . the good thing be there be several software framework use osm which be open source so you can look right into the code e.g. see <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/routing"> here </a> . in the <a href="https://graphhopper.com/"> graphhopper open source route engine </a> it be very easy to switch from a memory map setting -lrb- disc base -rrb- to the in-memory setting - both use the same format . the `` mmap '' set even allow usage on memory restricted mobile device and the latter perform a lot faster if you have the necessary ram e.g. on a server . e.g. for a world wide graph -lrb- > 100mio node -rrb- you then need around 8-10gb ram , plus lot of more ram if you want to speed up everything further e.g. with contraction hierarchy - roughly 5-8gb more for every vehicle you want . the format be very simplistic and basically store only the datum you need with a few trick to make it compact . read more about it <a href="https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/master/docs/core/technical.md#2-the-graph"> here </a> . disclaimer : i m the author of graphhopper . regard the other answer : dijkstra algorithm while applicable be regard as not optimal for this problem the normal dijkstra can perform very reasonable -lrb- < 1s for country-wide query like you 3mio node example -rrb- and be <strong> optimal </strong> in the theory sense but need a bit tuning to get fast in production scenario . and technique like contraction hierachy use a bidirectional modification of it and perform very well . road network be hierarchical and planar . road network be hierarchical for car only and not planar -lrb- bridge , tunnel , ... -rrb-
