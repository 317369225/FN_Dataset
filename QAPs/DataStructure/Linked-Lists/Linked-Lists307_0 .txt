Is there a more efficient method of moving my first two values to the end of a linked list?You can make a double - linked list and make the backward pointer of head node point to tail and vice versa for tail node. In this way we have a circular linked list kind of data structure where you just need to change the position of start pointer to the third position instead of first. 187 Views  View Upvotes
