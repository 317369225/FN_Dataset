run time - link list polynomial the multiplication algorithm have a characteristic of $ o -lrb- \ log -lrb- n -rrb- -rrb- $ because the actual multiply operation can be divide into separate sub problem , `` multiply '' . but , the complexity become worse when you have to go through the entire result list again in the `` insertterm '' subroutine which be call in the inner while loop of the nested loop . that make the datum count $ n ^ n $ and the complexity become $ o -lrb- \ log -lrb- n ^ n -rrb- -rrb- $ which be equivalent to $ o -lrb- n \ log -lrb- n -rrb- -rrb- $ .
