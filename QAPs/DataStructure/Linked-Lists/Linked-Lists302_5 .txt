When is it appropriate to use a linked-list, as opposed to a different data structure in C++?The singly-linked list is more of an introductory topic to data structures where each node contains link pointers to similar nodes. When compared to arrays, linked lists are easier to grow and insertions/deletions are quicker if you know the node that you are after. Conversely, searching for a node in a singly-linked list always takes linear time which usually nullifies any time advantage that the list would have over an array. In general, if an array just won't do, you are more likely to use some form of tree or multiply-linked list than the basic singly-linked list. 744 Views
