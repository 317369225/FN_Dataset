How do I simplify the following polynomial (linked list) in C?Try this , it solves the problem in in two passes of your linked list. (O(n)). 1) In first pass identify the order of your polynomial. Say Degree d. 2) Now create a Array of size (d+1) each element initialized to 0. This array works as Direct Address Table where each index will represent the coeffient of your polynomial in the answer. 3) Now again traverse the linked list this time at index i :  A[node->exponent]+=node->coeff; 4) Now traverse this array (reverse order) and update your linked list's coefficient and its exponent. Hope this helps. 193 Views
