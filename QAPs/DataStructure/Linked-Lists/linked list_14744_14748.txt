linklist and memory issue assume that the record be really store in the disk , you can use radix sort . divide you integer into byte , and start with the lower-order byte . open 256 new file , and start go over you database in order , sort the file accord to the lower-order byte . then do it again with the next byte , this time read you 256 file in order . if memory be not at a premium , you could always allocate a array - that will actually be more memory-efficient than a link list . -lrb- why would you use a link list for such a big array anyhow ? the overhead be 200 % . -rrb-
