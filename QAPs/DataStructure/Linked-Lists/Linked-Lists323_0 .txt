How we can append the alternate node of linked list at the end and reverse the list?A simple approach : Here head is starting location of linked list, and consider its data type to be LL* (following C/C++ notation), (assumed the structure of LL suitably) LL *cur = head->next; LL *new_list; while(cur && cur->next) { if(cur->next) { insert_end(&new_list, cur->data); delete_node(cur->next); } cur = cur->next; } cur = reverse_list(cur); append_last(cur, new_list); 181 Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by Shekhar Choudhari
