Does using a doubly linked list help to reverse the stack in constant time? How?All nodes have "next" and "previous" pointers. Keep also pointers to the head and tail of the list, and the current direction as follows. Default direction is "forward". Add items to the front of the list as a normal stack implementation based on linked list. When a reverse operation is performed, switch the direction to "backward". As long as the direction is "backward", the tail pointer is the actual top of the stack. New nodes are added after the tail and pops move the tail back (using the previous pointers). 1.1k Views  View Upvotes  Answer requested by 1 person
