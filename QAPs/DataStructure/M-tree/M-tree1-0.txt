What is the expected depth of a randomly selected key in a random m-ary search tree?
[math]\Theta(log_m n)[/math] by recursion.   This assumes that the upper value of m is a fixed finite number set at tree creation time. What application do you have in mind? Proof: 1. Let [math]T_0[/math] be a tree node of type tNode (defined below). 2. Let tNode be defined as a payload and a branch list of up to m-paths. 3. By the linear search algorithm, we know that at least half the items in the branch list will be filled, and this produces a depth that is linear to whatever the space complexity of tNode is log n. Divide by n each time. 4. Thus, the total depth of [math]T_0[/math] is [math]log_m n[/math] QED.
