What are some interesting theoretical limits?
Dunbar's number: A theoretical limit to the number of stable social relationships of one person, with proposed values ranging from 100 to 230. Dunbar first suggested a relationship between group size and neocortex size in 1992 (http://www.sciencedirect.com/sci...): It is suggested that the number of neocortical neurons limits the organism's information-processing capacity and that this then limits the number of relationships that an individual can monitor simultaneously. When a group's size exceeds this limit, it becomes unstable and begins to fragment. This then places an upper limit on the size of groups which any given species can maintain as cohesive social units through time. This is especially interesting because in our world, Facebook "Friend" counts numbering in the thousands isn't uncommon. Similar concepts appear in Malcolm Gladwell's Tipping Point (2000 book) -- Connectors are people "with a truly extraordinary knack [... for] making friends and acquaintances" and typically have networks of over one hundred people. But for a more humorous and sensationalized take, see Cracked.com's "What is the Monkeysphere?" for the claim that all the ills in the world are caused by Dunbar's number.
