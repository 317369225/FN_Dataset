What is the one thing you would like to do if you came to know you had only 24 hours left with you?
This would be the time when my list would not match the time. So I will keep it very simple and lively. Firstly, I would dress my best. I love to do this at times, and will get a photograph clicked along my family members, friends, and all those people who've been a part of my journey. :) Thereafter, I'll write letter for all my family members,and friends about my true feelings towards them,thanking them for being awesome all this while. Then, I'll eat the best foood I ever could. Especially, one made by mum, dad and sis ! :') I'll dance & sing like a mad man one last time with my loved ones, and will make sure they record it as well. So that they have something to cherish after I'm gone. I'll write down all my email id and password on a piece of paper, and will ask my sis to run my account on twitter, quora,fb, snapchat, ask, tumblr,insta etc etc ! :D Lastly, I would hug everyone for the last time, will kiss them, and smile like never before ! :) Somewhat like this ! :D As big as I could ! :') ​ ​ Thank you. :)
