What are the connections between the lives of Lahiri Mahasaya and Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa?
We also know that both Lahiri Mahasaya and Sri Ramakrishna have met Trailanga Swami. Also i found this wonderful page talking about how Sri Yukteswar was friends with Swami Vivekananda etc! Enjoy! http://forum.yogananda.net/index...
