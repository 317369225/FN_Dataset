Arranged Marriages: Why do many Indian parents insist that their daughters get married?
I will try to answer the question from the point of view of the parents of an Indian girl. In a country like ours, if a girl is young, unmarried and beautiful, chances are high that she's being pursued by a handful of hopefuls, or maybe she's having a boyfriend. I'm not saying that's always the case. But it's likely. This, is a worrying thing for them. It may lead to rumors in the society which can deter future suitors. There's an age limit to girls getting married. If a girl is 30, most Indian men will be wary of marrying her. In fact, his parents will most likely oppose it. The supposed reason can be that the biological clock dictates that a woman is most fit for delivering children in her twenties. Societal pressures. When they see other people marrying off their daughters early on, it can be a pressuring thing and they feel the need to find a suitor for their daughter too. Relatives don't hesitate in adding oil to the fire and suggest matches left, right and center. There may be other reasons too. These are just the more common ones.
