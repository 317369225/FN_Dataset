What is the best book on data-structures for beginners?
I read several books to learn data structures. Data Structures Using C and C++ (2nd Edition): Yedidyah Langsam, Moshe J. Augenstein, Aaron M. Tenenbaum This was the reference book in our university, so I had to study it thoroughly. It is not particularly a bad book, but the explanations were not usually great. Rating: 3/5 Data Structures: A Pseudocode Approach with C: Richard F. Gilberg, Behrouz A. Forouzan A very neat book. Lot of things are explained with examples and they even give a detailed pseudocode which you can use to implement the data structure yourself to further your understanding. I used it mainly to learn the tree data structures viz., BST, AVL and M-way trees. Rating: 3.5/5 Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis in C++: Mark A. Weiss Another nice book. I used it mainly to learn splay trees, hashing, priority queues and disjoint sets. However, the real plus in this book for me was the chapter on "Algorithm Design Techniques". It was one of the nicest introductory expose on Algorithm Design I had ever come across. Rating: 4/5 Having said all that, these days you can find almost all the information on the internet. I would probably recommend: The Algorithm Design Manual: Steven S Skiena It is like a comprehensive list of algorithms and data structures with little information but gives enough references to look up (in your local library or internet) and gain the information. Also, has lot of code and links to libraries etc. Comes in handy, when you just want something to quickly refer to. Updated 95w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Anonymous
