What is the one thing you would like to do if you came to know you had only 24 hours left with you?
Just one thing. Sign up for organ donation. Now you're wondering, "24hrs and he does this?". Well after watching a lot of anime(dont gimme that look) and visiting hospitals(had an accident) for a while now, I've seen how there are people who are willing to impact/change the world if they are given a second chance at life. ​ ​ It's a selfless gesture i believe everyone should do, i dont have complex or elaborate reasons to tell you why you should do it, but know that there is a choice of helping someone even in death. In that 24 hrs, I'm gonna help someone live a lifetime. I dont see any other better way for spending my final breath knowing that i helped someone live their life.(irrespective of what or how my life ever was). ​ ​ Pics reference: google P. S: I already signed up, answer written to project the reader's view if they did too. Be happy for the wonderful life you're blessed with, instead of complaining about difficulties.
