How many trees are there on Earth?
Going Out On A Limb With A Tree-Person Ratio : NPR This is a reference to the 400,246,300,201 figure.  The estimate was done in 2005. I believe this estimate and I do not believe the people that are saying trillions.  It sounds like they made a fairly sophisticated calculations and measurements to come up with that number.  As for trillions, keep in mind trees are big there are not a thousand of them per person.
