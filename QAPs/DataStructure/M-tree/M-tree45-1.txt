How many trees are there on Earth?
A rough estimate yields about 1 to 10 trillion trees. I will assume that the majority of the world's trees are in forests.  According to Wikipedia, about 10% of the earth's surface is covered in forest (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest).  It seems that the density of trees in a forest can vary greatly depending on the type of forest and whether it is actively managed or not.  The numbers seem to roughly range from 100 to 1000 trees per acre.  An acre is about 4000 m^2, so this range corresponds to an average spacing between trees of about 2 to 6 m.  Sounds reasonable to me.  The total area of the earth's surface is about 1.3*10^11 acres.  This results in an estimate of about 1 to 10 trillion trees. I believe it is common practice to not only count trees, but to count how many trees there are above a certain size.  It is possible that the 400 billion figure quoted in other answers (which is about a factor of 2 smaller than my very rough lower estimate) might only refer to somewhat larger trees.
