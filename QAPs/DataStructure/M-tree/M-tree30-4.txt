What is the most beautiful tree, in the physical or fictional world?
The baobab. Native to Africa, giver of life through nutritious fruits and leaves, shade and bird habitat. They are truly breath-taking in person. Fun baobab facts: Shelter: Large trees with hollow stems have been used by people for centuries for various purposes including houses, prisons, storage barns and even shops. Water:  The clefts of the large branches are used for the collection of rainwater and the local people of dry arid regions use this as a valuable source of water. It has been recorded that in some cases the centre of the tree is purposely hollowed out to serve as a reservoir for collecting water during the rainy season.  One such reservoir was recorded as holding 4 546 litres of water. Local people use pieces of grass, similar to a straw, to suck the stored water from the tree. When the wood is chewed, it also provides vital moisture to relieve thirst, by humans and by certain animals in times of severe drought. Food: The leaves are said to be rich in vitamin C, sugars, potassium tartrate, and calcium. The local people cook the leaves as a vegetable or dry and crush it for later use. The sprout of a young Baobab tree can be eaten like asparagus. The root of very young trees is also reputed to be edible. The seeds are also edible and is roasted for use as a coffee substitute. Caterpillars, which feed on the leaves, are collected and eaten by African people as an important source of protein. Wild animals eat the fallen leaves and fresh leaves are said to be good fodder for domestic animals. The fallen flowers are also eaten by wild animals and cattle alike.
