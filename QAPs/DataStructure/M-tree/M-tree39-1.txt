What can I learn/know right now in 10 minutes that will be useful for the rest of my life?
Didn't go through all the answers, so forgive me if few of my answers are already mentioned. 1. Travel in time: Send a letter to your future self with Write a letter to the future 2. Why celebrate just birth-days? Celebrate birthmonths & birthseconds.     with Nerdiversary - Is Today a Special Day? I celebrated my 800 millionth second recently, and I am planning to celebrate my 1 billionth second after 6 years. (Already sent a reminder email for that using FutureMe. Refer point 1) Regarding computers: 3. Customize your taskbar in Windows 7 & 8: Install 7+ Taskbar Tweaker. (not spam) Can ungroup similar items, enable seconds on the clock, always reserve space on taskbar etc. 4. All useful commands in RightClick: Download - FileMenu Tools. 5. Windows logon background: In Windows Run, go to %WINDIR%\System32\oobe\info\backgrounds\, paste your desired image, and rename it as backgrounddefault.jpg. That's it. (As per my experiments, image size should be less than 300 kb) 6. Create a shortcut for Windows Shutdown & abort: Right click, create a new shortcut, type shutdown.exe -s -t 3600 and save it. Click on the shortcut and Windows will shutdown after 1 hour (the number is in seconds). Now go to Rainy Mood. Windows will shutdown after you fall asleep enjoying the rain. Create another shortcut with command shutdown.exe -a to abort shutdown caused by accidental click of the previous shortcut. 7. Open notepad in web browser: Type data:text/html, <html contenteditable> in the address bar of a web browser, and you have a temporary notepad .. like a clipboard. 8. List of Chrome shortcuts: Type chrome://chrome-urls/ in Chrome's address bar. 9. Password-protect MS word / excel files: Click Save-As, Click Tools -> General Options to the left of Save button. Enter password for read & write options, and save. Note: Do not forget the password. Microsoft doesn't provide any password recovery tool. 10. Print ASCII characters: Go to: http://www.asciitable.com/ for ASCII codes of the characters. You can print them through the Numpad of your keyboard. For eg, ASCII of Alpha (α) = 224 . To print α, Hold down ALT and press 224 with Numpad. You can do this for all ASCII characters 0 - 255. Works only from the Numpad section. Updated 55w ago • View Upvotes
