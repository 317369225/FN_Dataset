What are some cheap and creative ways to have fun and enjoy your trip to Singapore?
Dine at coffee shops or hawker centres at non-touristy areas (there may be affordable outlets at some touristy areas) Visit free entrance places like Buddha Tooth Relic, Singapore City Gallery, most parts of Gardens by the Bay Plan your itinerary close to the places you intend to visit to minimise the transport cost Purchase the tourist pass for unlimited public transport such as bus or MRT rides at the Ticket Counter of Changi Airport Mrt station Visit at least a HDB area to see how majority Singaporeans reside It really depends on what you are looking for during this visit. There are tourists who look for shopping tips, ticking their checklist of places of interest, and many other kinds. It's good to be clear which will help you better during your planning. For me, when I travel, I find it enriching to learn about the culture and how things work. Hope the above tips help.
