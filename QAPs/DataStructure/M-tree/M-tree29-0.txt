Could it be possible that space is an illusion but time is real?
No, you can't change space and time in that way.   Space is a physical property of every object. We can measure it after defining a unit for length, height and width (=cm or m). All tree are linear values. If space would be an illusion the object would be an illusion.   Time is not a physical property - It's only a result of measurement by comparing of movement.
