I am short. Is that the reason why I am still single?
Well, I am going to be honest and say that height is one of the criteria people look for. But that's not the only one. So don't be upset. I am sure there must be other qualities good about you that interests people. Don't let this bring you down. I know a lot of people who are short and have girlfriends/boyfriends. A few of them are even out of their league. But that's only because they never really gave importance to their height and tried to be better from the inside. There is nothing you can do to grow taller if you're past 20 years, so just be positive rather than feel bad about it.
