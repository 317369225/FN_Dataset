What are some examples of M-Trees applied to real world problems?
They are useful when you need to carry out a loseless (i.e., all true answers are found) similarity (nearest-neibhor or range) search in a metric space. However, in many cases people  1)  care only about the very specific metric space, i.e., L2  2) don't care about searching being fully accurate. This is why the use non-exact approaches such as k-means clustering (which can actually be seen as the L2 variant of the M-tree) or LSH. k-means clustering is a part of the well-known library Flann. Some relatively recent experiments indicate that better performance (at the expense of longer indexing time) can often be devliered by knn-graphs (also known as proximity graphs). In addition, knn-graphs seem to work well in many non-metric spaces. I maintain the similarity search library where we have two implementations of the knn-graph (the master branch has only one implement, the develop branch has an additional one): searchivarius/NonMetricSpaceLib
