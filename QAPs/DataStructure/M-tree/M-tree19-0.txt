What are some interesting theoretical limits?
I would like to add another limit that pairs nicely with Vikramaditya's answer: The Shockley-Queisser Limit describes the theoretical limiting power efficiency of a single p-n junction silicon solar cell, which is 33.7 % . In case we have a solar cell with an infinite amount of layers, the corresponding limit is 86 % . See more on the relevant wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol... . There are also two theorems in mathematics that tell us something about the very limitations of mathematics/mathematical logic itself: These are called Godel's Incompleteness Theorems . For a very nice explanation of these theorems, see the following quora question: What's the easiest way to understand Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems? And the wikipedia article for more information: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C... Updated 125w ago • View Upvotes
