How many trees are there on Earth?
3 trillion. This is according to a new study which has used far improved ground-truth data that takes more accurate forestry density information to build its estimate. This involved using 400,000 different local and national data resources, and is a great example of the power of big data. The study concludes that there ~1.39 trillion tropical and subtropical forests trees, ~0.74 trillion in boreal regions and ~0.61 trillion in temperate regions. In total, this is more than 3 trillion trees globally, making at least 420 trees per person. Of these trees, approximately 1.39 trillion exist in tropical and subtropical forests, with 0.74 trillion in boreal regions and 0.61 trillion in temperate regions. Interestingly, the highest tree densities were seen in the boreal regions (see below).   ​ ​ ​ ​The new data should prove useful in allowing more accurate climate and ecological modelling in the future.
