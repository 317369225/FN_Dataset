What are the little known things about some famous logos?
The most known thing about the Bayerische Motoren Werke AG or Bavarian Motor Works (BMW) logo is that the logo is based on a rotating airscrew. The logo has been portrayed as the movement of an aircraft propeller with the white blades cutting through a blue sky—first used in a BMW advertisement in 1929, twelve years after the roundel was created—but this is not the origin of the logo itself. Its just a myth that has carried on along with the evolution of the logo. The origin of this interpretation is the cover of a BMW aircraft magazine. This picture (shown below) was taken in 1929, years after the logo first came into existence. Respect for the publicity department back then for the fact that the airscrew myth continues today.    The origins of the logo is a different story. The circular blue and white BMW logo or roundel evolved from the circular Rapp Motorenwerke company logo, from which the BMW company grew, combined with the blue and white colors of the flag of Bavaria (Bavaria is a state in Germany where the industrial base of BMW lies). The little known thing about the origins of the logo in the words of Kai Jacobsen, Automobile Historian, BMW group “As Rapp grew into BMW, BMW assumed all the business segments, and the company wanted the logo to be oriented on Rapp’s logo. As you can see here on this example, Rapp has a black horse as a symbol on its logo. BMW chose the Bavarian national colours as a symbol, but arranged the letters exactly like Rapp. So you can see very clearly how the BMW logo was developed.” Rapp Motoren Werke logo, Bayerische Motoren Werke logo Flag of Bavaria References BMW BMW logo evolution Bavaria Updated 141w ago • View Upvotes
