What is the craziest story about North Korea?
There is a massive hotel, 105 stories tall, that sits almost in the middle of downtown Pyongyang. It was started by the North Koreans but the construction was poorly done and it never got past the point where the outer shell was completed. The financing ran out and the building was never completed. That's not the strange part. The strange part was that you could buy pictures and postcards of the building lit up at night,but these pictures were retouched to make it appear that way when it was not. Also, the North Koreans apparently studiously avoid speaking about the structure and tourists weren't supposed to take photos of the building, even though it dominates the skyline. In 2009, glass was added to a single face of the hotel, leaving the opposite sides unfinished. In October 2011, it was announced that hotel would open (it's apparently partially opened now) but no date was given for its completion. Here are pictures of the building: 2009 2002 2011
