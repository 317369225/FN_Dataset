Could it be possible that space is an illusion but time is real?
And what if time is an illusion and space is real. It is a hypothetical question. But it is true, that in our perspective, (at least) 3 dimensions do exist. We consider time as fourth. Even if it's an illusion, something must be creating it, and then this something must exist. Reality does exist. If not in one way, then in another! But sometimes I feel like we are in a closed and isolated room, and we are trying to configure from just inside that how does this room looks from outside.
