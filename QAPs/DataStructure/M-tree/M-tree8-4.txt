What are some cheap and creative ways to have fun and enjoy your trip to Singapore?
1. Eat at some of the neighbourhood coffeeshops. The food is delicious and is always at a very good value for money. 2. Travel around using the public transport. Singapore has a very efficient public transport system that can take you almost everywhere you'd want to go. 3. Visit some places of interest to learn about Singapore. 4. Shop at some local shopping centres, especially the ones near housing estates. 5. Embark on a heritage trail. 6. SENTOSA!! (So Expensive, Nothing To See Already, as they say, but there's always something to see)
