What is in general time complexity of random forest? What are the important parameters that affect this complexity?
Assuming you mean the complexity of building the model, it's an ensemble method, so it's going to be close to the sum of the complexities of building the individual decision trees in the model. If the models all have the same complexity, then it would be the complexity of the individual model times the number of models you build. Usually the trees in RF models are unpruned CART trees. There's a good explanation of the complexity of decision tree induction in Data Mining by Witten, Frank and Hall. From that book - if you have n instances and m attributes, the computational cost of building a tree is O(mn log n). See the reference for more details. If you grow M trees, then the complexity is O(M(mn log n). This is not an exact complexity, because the trees in the model are grown using a subset of the features, and additional time may be added in to handle the randomization processes. However, this would get you close to the complexity. Again the parameters here are n, m, and M - the number of instances in the training data, the number of attributes, and the number of trees you build. The number of trees is a parameter you set yourself when you run the model. If you choose a very high number, the model may converge before it reaches that number. In my experience RF models converge pretty quickly. For a deeper analysis of the mathematics behind the model, check out Analysis of a Random Forest Model, Gerard Biau, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2012.
