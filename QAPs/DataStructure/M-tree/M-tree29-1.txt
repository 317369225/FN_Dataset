Could it be possible that space is an illusion but time is real?
We do appear to live in a 4 dimensional universe where there is, relative to the observer: up-down right-left forward-backward spacetime. Take away space and the other 3 dimensions disappear as well. Without dimensions, there's no need for time because nothing can really move, so everything exists in the eternal Here and Now. All I can tell you for certain is that is not how I perceive our Universe and I'd have no idea how to function, or even what functioning would mean, if I suddenly found myself in such a universe.
