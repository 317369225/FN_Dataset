What are some interesting theoretical limits?
There are some interesting limits in astrophysics: The Chandrasekhar Limit, which specifies the maximum mass for a stable white dwarf star. Though its actual value can vary slightly, depending on the temperature and chemical composition of a given star, the 'generic' value usually quoted is around 1.44 solar masses. Above this mass, electron degeneracy pressure cannot prevent the gravitational collapse of the star into a neutron star or black hole. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cha... The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) Limit, which is similar to the Chandrasekhar Limit, but applies to neutron stars. It is approximately 3 solar masses, above which neutron degeneracy pressure cannot prevent the gravitational collapse of the neutron star into a black hole. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tol... The Roche Limit, which is the distance from a planet (or primary) within which an orbiting body (or secondary) - e.g. a moon - will be torn apart by gravitational tidal forces (its debris possibly forming a set of rings like those around of Saturn). Its value depends on the radius of the primary (or secondary) and the ratio of their densities (or masses). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc... Updated 95w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
