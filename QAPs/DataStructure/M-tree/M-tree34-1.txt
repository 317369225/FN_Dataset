What is a good substitute for buttermilk in a recipe?
Plain milk works just as well as buttermilk in any recipe. If you're looking for the extra tang of buttermilk, you can clabber your milk before using it: add 1 T white vinegar to a 1 cup measure add milk to make 1 cup let it sit for 5 to 10 min and you've got clabbered milk, or essentially buttermilk without the butter.
