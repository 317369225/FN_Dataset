Quora Credit Co-Op v2.0:Â Who are great new users to follow in December 2011?
I'll throw my noms into the ring. Some aren't brand-new, but they don't get the prominence that they deserve. James Martin (cool answers in writing and books) Fred Zimmerman (great answers in publishing) Will update soon!
