Which movie or book can change your life forever?
BOOK: "The Elegant Universe" It changed the way I see the world around me forever.  Gave me such an unbelievable appreciation for the complexity of the world we live in.  It's incredibly approachable explanations of ridiculously complicated ideas is perfect.  The lessons this book teaches are invaluable. __________ MOVIE: "Synecdoche, New York" Something about this movie lingered with me far, far after I watched it.  It has incredibly deep themes, that are presented with exceptional writing, directing and acting.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is just fantastic.  It begs to be watched and rewatched.
