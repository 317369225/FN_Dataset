How many stars can an eagle see at night?
Interesting question! The eagle is a diurnal (daytime) bird of prey. Their eyes are adapted to resolving small things in the daytime. For instance, an American Kestral can see a 2mm insect from the top of a 18 m tree in the daytime. But their night vision is probably worse than ours. Humans can see between 2000 and 6000 stars at night (give or take, largely depending on the viewing location). Certainly the eagle will see far less than that. Night vision acuity is determined by the number of rod cells in your fovea. For comparison, humans have about 38,000 rods per square mm. The American Kestral has 65,000. Eagles have a much higher percentage of cone cells, so even though they can see better than us in the daytime, we can see better than them at night. And while eagles have upwards of 1,000,000 rods and cones per mm, humans only have about 200,000. By the way, did you know that an eagle's eye is about the same size as a human's? But what about nocturnal birds, such as owls? How many stars would they see? Owls have about 56,000 rods per square mm, so I would estimate that they would see about 50% more stars than we do, or about 3000 to 9000 stars.
