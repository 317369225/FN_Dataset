What is the one thing you would like to do if you came to know you had only 24 hours left with you?
I will taste that glass of water instead of gulping it. Take a walk down the alley and breathe in that scent of nature that I took for granted so long. Sit there for a while and listen to my most favorite music and think about everyone I came across my life and thank myself for being myself. Call my friends for one last night out and tell them how much they mean to me. Hug and thank my parents  for making me who I am. And finally, plant a tree, so that everyone who might miss me after I am gone can sit under its shade and know I m still around there somewhere loving them.​ ​ Updated 48w ago • View Upvotes • Not for Reproduction
