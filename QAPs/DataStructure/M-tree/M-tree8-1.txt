What are some cheap and creative ways to have fun and enjoy your trip to Singapore?
I assume you are 1) a tourist and 2) have at least a few days. 1. Travel around by public transport. You will get to see more sights from the bus (especially the double-deckers - take the front seats at the top if possible) and it is really, really cheap to do so. 2. Eat at our open-air coffee-shops and hawker centers whenever possible. It may not be as comfortable, but it is cheap and most importantly, authentically Singaporean cuisine with choices that will spoil you. 3. Forget the tourist-magnet Sentosa. We Singaporeans joke that the place is So Expensive, Nothing TO See Also (yes, it's an acronym). Go to the Zoo (and Wildlife Safari), to the Bird Park, to the Botanical Gardens, to Little India and Chinatown (the latter having become seriously commercialised, unfortunately). If you are coming here to work, however... 1. Your accommodation is going to be a huge concern. It is seriously expensive here, and I really have no recommendation on what you can do to save. Even a room (not an apartment, but a room!) which you share with perhaps another person, may set you back $600. 2. #1 and #2 for tourists will still work for you. Welcome to Singapore!
