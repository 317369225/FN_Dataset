What are some of the application of splay trees?
In addition to Venkata Koppu NR's answer, splay trees are useful for the following things Implementing link/cut trees and Euler trees Computing range aggregates in O(log(N))* Removing ranges of a tree in O(log(N)) (Logically) Reversing a range of a tree in O(log(N))* Merging (inserting a tree in-between two existing elements) two trees together in O(log(N+M)) Querying faster than O(log(N)) for highly biased query distributions * Common to most BSTs Edit: Added a note about which operations are unique to Splay trees over most BSTs.Â  Though certainly being able to do them all at the same time is also a feat in itself.
