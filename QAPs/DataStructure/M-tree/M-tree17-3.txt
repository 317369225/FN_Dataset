What's the difference between between and among?
Between is usually used with two — and sometimes more than two — separate and distinct things.  For example: The map is between the palm tree and the hut. What is the difference between hate, loathing, and disdain? Among is used to portray the idea of being in a group or in the midst of a group.  For example: I want to live among like-minded people. Share these sweets among yourselves.
