You hold a plane mirror 1.0 m in front of your eyes and are able to see a 15 m high tree behind you. If the mirror Is 20.0 m high, and the tree Image completely fills the mirror, how far are you standing from the tree?
Your question is of course wrong. In Plane mirror , It's magnification is null, hence the 15 m tree behind you will only occupy 15 m in a 20 m high mirror, if it is a spherical mirror, then it is totally different matter, then you will have to include it's focal length. Conclusion- The question is wrong, the height of object an image remains same in a plane mirror, the there is no question of increasing image height of tree to 20 m from trees's 15 m height .
