Health Tips: What should I do to treat a rash from tea tree oil?
Allow the skin to heal itself by keeping it moist eg with organic coconut oil. If it is infected and not healing then see a doctor. The usual creams are cortisone , anti fungal and antibacterial, depending on the suspected cause. Skin has a memory. If you can get back to a healed  state and keep it that way ( eg coconut oil to keep it happy, or other neutral product) , then it is less inclined to break out. Updated 24w ago • View Upvotes
