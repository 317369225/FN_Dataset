Health Tips:Â What should I do to treat a rash from tea tree oil?
It looks like you may have contact dermatitis, which means your body does not like the substance you apply on your skin therefore you get the red raised bumpy rash. Sometimes they do go away on their own after you stop using the culprit substance (in this case the tea tree oil). However, I would suggest you consult a doctor or dermatologist to get yourself checked so the best treatment option can be recommended. Using Neosporin may not be the most appropriate treatment.
