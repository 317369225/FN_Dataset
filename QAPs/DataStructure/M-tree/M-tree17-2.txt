What's the difference between between and among?
Between applies only to pairs or dyads.  You can have 100 billion people, but as long as you are referring only to a pair at any given time (any pair), between is correct.  It's similar to a call-and-response in jazz. Among refers to interplays/interrelationships involving more than two people (you could use it for two, but that's a mathematically degenerate case for which between does the job).  Between the two of us, but among the three of us.  Between each of us (even if there are hundreds of us) retains the dyadic relationship, however.
