What are some interesting theoretical limits?
In communication theory, it is Shannon's channel capacity theorem, which defines the maximum bandwidth of a communication channel.given a noise level. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cha... and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noi... Another interesting theorem is the Nyquist sampling theorem, which states that if a signal has bandwidth B, a digital representation of that signal requires a sampling frequency of only up to 1/2B.  This explains why when the first CDs were made, the sampling frequency was 44.1 khz, about twice the maximum human hearing frequency of 20 kHz or so. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyq...
