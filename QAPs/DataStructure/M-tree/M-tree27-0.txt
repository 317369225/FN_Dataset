Health Tips: What should I do to treat a rash from tea tree oil?
You know that the more you're exposed to an antigen, the more likely you're to develop an allergy to that.  This could fit your story getting an allergy to tea tree oil nicely. Having had an allergic rash, it doesn't seem smart to expose your diseased (and most likely more permeable) skin to antibiotics only to be used as a Topical medication without any infection present, and raising the risk of an allergy to these drugs too. There are some doubts on the efficacy of Neosporin see A comparative study of the effect of dif... [Indian J Plast Surg. 2012] so if needed I would go for Chlorhexidine and not Neosporin. If you stop (and never touch again) tea tree oil the rash will go away by itself within a few days to 1 week, if it persists a weak steroid cream e.g. hydrocortisone cream 1% locally applied twice to thrice daily for a week or so could help speed this up.
