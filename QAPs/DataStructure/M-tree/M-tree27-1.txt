Health Tips: What should I do to treat a rash from tea tree oil?
It is probably now not an infection or an allergic reaction, but a reaction to the full strength tea tree oil. I would not recommend the Neosporin - could make it worse. It should go away by itself, but if it persists, see your doctor. From Wikipedia  - "A small number of people experience allergic contact dermatitis as a reaction to dermal contact with tea tree oil. In an Italian study of 725 consecutive patients, patients were patch tested with undiluted, 1%, and 0.1% tea tree oil. For undiluted tea tree oil, nearly 6% of the patients observed positive reactions of skin irritation. Only 1 of 725 patients observed a positive reaction of skin irritation with the 1% dilution. None of the 725 patients observed adverse reactions with the 0.1% dilution.[22] Allergic reactions may be due to the various oxidation products that are formed by exposure of the oil to light and/or air. External application of tea tree oil undiluted and/or at inappropriate high doses has been associated with toxicity, including death, in cats and other animals, due to ingestion during grooming. Use of the oil itself, as opposed to the unextracted plant material, did  not become common practice until researcher Arthur Penfold published the first reports of its antimicrobial activity in a series of papers in the 1920s and 1930s. In evaluating the antimicrobial activity of M. alternifolia, tea tree oil was rated as 11 times more active than phenol. Phenol is sometimes used as a strong chemical peel, and can exfoliate the skin down to the level of the dermis. It is no longer popular because of side effects."
