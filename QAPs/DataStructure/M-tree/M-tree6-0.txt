In a square area with sides equal to 5 m, one has to plant mango trees. The distance between two consecutive trees should be 1 m. What will be the total number of trees in that area?
1. Take a ruler which is half foot long. It must be 6 inches long, which you can see on inches side where  maximum number marked is 6. 2. Now, count the total points on inches side. It must be 7. Because, we have to add the starting 0 while counting. 3. Which implies that the number of points in length x is x+1. 4. Till now, we were playing in one dimension. While the question is for a square. Which is two dimensional shape. 5. The area of a square of side a  is defined as a^2. So, area of x+1 must be (x+1)^2. 6. Now let's put the value given in the question. The value we've is side of square, given as 5. 7. So, putting value in formula (x+1)^2 will give us (5+1)^2. Which is same as 6^2. 8. 6^2 is nothing but 6*6. Which is 6 times 6. 9. 6 times 6 are 36. 10. So, 36 trees with 1meter gap between each can be planted in a square of side 5 meters. Sorry, for such a long answer of a simple question.
