Given an in-order traversal of a special binary tree having property that the node is always greater than its left and right child. How can we reconstruct the tree efficiently?
This is a well known problem in CS, and the structure you describe is called a cartesian tree. There are well known algorithms that run in time [math]O(n)[/math] that can convert between the in-order and the tree representation.
