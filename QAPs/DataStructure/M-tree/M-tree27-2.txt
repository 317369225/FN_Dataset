Health Tips:Â What should I do to treat a rash from tea tree oil?
A2A Well, you're really not supposed to use anything like that undiluted because it can be pretty damaging and irritating to your skin, which you seem to know...so, stop that. The other thing I'm a little confused by is that you started the whole tea tree oil thing for folliculitis and now you have a rash that sounds an awful lot like razor burn...which is also basically folliculitis. How is this new rash really different than the old rash?
