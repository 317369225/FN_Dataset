I am short. Is that the reason why I am still single?
I don't think that being a 21 year old girl and having a baby face have anything to do with you being single. If anything at all, they are in fact your strengths. Coming to the short height part, I believe it's more of a psychology thing. Don't believe me? Let me introduce you to Peter Dinklage, popular for playing the role of Tyrion in GOT. The lady you see with him is his wife. He got married much before GOT happened. When asked about his height in a 2003 interview, Dinklage said: "When I was younger, I definitely let it get to me. As an adolescent, I was bitter and angry, and I definitely put up these walls. But the older you get, you realize you just have to have a sense of humor. You just know that it's not your problem. It's theirs." Since you have not mentioned your height in the question, I cannot comment anything specific on that. However, be assured that it's more important how you see yourself. As far as being single is concerned, I'd suggest you to wait till the time you meet someone who loves you for who you are - as you are !!
