Can anyone help me prove that, if a graph G has two different minimum spanning trees T1 and T2, then there must exist at least two edges e1 and e2 in G that have the same weight?Mimic the proof of Kruskal's algorithm to prove the contrapositive, i.e. "A graph with distinct edge weights has exactly one minumum spanning tree". Consider any tree that differs from the one produced by Kurskal's and show that following the algorithm's steps would have resulted in a lighter tree.
