Can anyone help me prove that, if a graph G has two different minimum spanning trees T1 and T2, then there must exist at least two edges e1 and e2 in G that have the same weight?Justin's hint is sparse but excellent -- Indeed, using Kruskal's algorithm, a minimum spanning trees is constructed in a greedy fashion by taking the next smallest edge that does not create a cycle. Hence if all the edges were all distinct you would have no choice what to do at each step, and the tree would be unique.
