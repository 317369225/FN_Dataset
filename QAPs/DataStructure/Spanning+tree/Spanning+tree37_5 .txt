What are the 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm challenges/puzzles?Following are the Algorithms/Concepts that one must know(Especially a programmer) to solve CS puzzles: Lists, Arrays, Stack Trees- Binary, k-ary, AVL, B and B+ tree Sorting and Searching- esp. QuickSort, RadixSort, Binary search and indexing Priority Queues- Heaps Pattern Matching and Parsing- Regex Hashing- Hash Functions Disjoint Sets Graph Algorithms and Data Structures- Problems like computing the minimum spanning tree, determination of the shortest path between two nodes, matching, and the detection of cut vertexes will arise in a number of situation. Google’s PageRank, for example, is a very concrete application of graph algorithms. Dynamic Programming- Closely related to graph algorithms, Dynamic Programming exploit the fact that the optimal solution to a large problem can be expressed as an optimal combination of sub-problems. State Space Search Algorithms- limited depth search, Breadth-first search, A*; Artificial Intelligence; Genetic algorithms
