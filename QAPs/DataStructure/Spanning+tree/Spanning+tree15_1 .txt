Would Spanning Tree protocol offer Level 2 redundancy in a wireless point to point network?该网页不存在附加信息...If you have a 3 node network made out of point to point links shaped like a triangle ... spanning tree will help you. In that scenario the switch in node A provides the root for the switches at node B and node C. Each pair of switches has a distinct path to one another (like a triangle). When one link fails, the traffic that otherwise would be going across that link is "automatically" reestablished the other way around the tree. That doesn't sound like what you are describing, so I don't believe spanning tree will help you. What I infered was a single wifi ap (at the corporate office) using range extenders to hit the two other locations. This is a single broadcast domain, and if you are losing the link to the corporate switch then everybody is single threaded and you are done. There is no alternate path.
