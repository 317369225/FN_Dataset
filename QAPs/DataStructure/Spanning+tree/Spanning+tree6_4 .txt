How can I prove this property of Minimum Spanning Trees?该网页不存在附加信息...Think about Kruskal's algorithm. It processes edges in ascending order by weight. It will always select the smaller weights to connect the nodes, thus minimizing the bottleneck of the whole spanning tree (hence between all nodes). I'm not really able to prove this formally, but I think it goes along this line: Suppose there is a bottleneck shortest path between 2 nodes such that this path has a bottleneck which is smaller than the corresponding bottleneck on the path between the 2 nodes on the MST of the graph. This is a contradiction because such bottleneck shortest path would yield a smaller spanning tree than the MST of the graph.
