What is the proof of correctness of the number of edges in minimum spanning tree, as |V|-1 where V is the number of vertices in the given graph?Spanning tree itself is a tree and to prove a tree with v vertices has exactly v-1 edges u can try this: 1.let tree has more than v-1 edges then it forms a cycle i.e not a tree 2. let tree has less than v-1 edges now the tree is no more connected
