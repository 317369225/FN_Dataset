What is the best algorithm to find the single source's shortest paths in a spanning tree?Here, I have given a spanning tree. I want to know the shortest distance and shortest path from single source to every vertex. Also can I extend this to all pair shortest path in spanning tree directly or there is better solution in that case?If you want to know single-source shortest paths for a tree with N nodes, breadth first search (BFS) will give all distances in linear time, O(N), which is asymptotically optimal. If you want to know the shortest paths for all pairs, you can't do much better than running the BFS multiple times. There are algorithms that work faster if you're interested in only a small number of paths.
