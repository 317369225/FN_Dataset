What are some tips, tricks and gotchas in using minimum spanning tree algorithms for graphs?Here are some of the MST properties - 1) Cut property of minimum spanning trees [1] 2) Cycle property of minimum spanning trees [2] 3) Minimum cost edge property [3] 3) The fact that [2],[3] can be derived from [1] 4) There are many algorithms which solve this problem. This is a direct consequence of [1]. Also there is no unique MST. 5) Using union-find data structure to implement Kruskal's algorithm. Doesn't help with the worst-case bound (which is dominated by sorting the edges), but I think it's pretty cool. Using MST to generate random mazes[4]. I am sure they many other applications too [5].
