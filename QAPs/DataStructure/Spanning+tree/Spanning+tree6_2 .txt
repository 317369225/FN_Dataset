How can I prove this property of Minimum Spanning Trees?该网页不存在附加信息...You can argue about this using the fact that a MST cannot have an edge which is the heaviest weight edge in any cycle in the original graph (This is a direct consequence of the cut property[1] of the MST). Combined with the fact that if you add any edge in an MST, it yields a cycle, it should be straight forward to show that any path between 2 edges in an MST would be a bottleneck shortest path.
