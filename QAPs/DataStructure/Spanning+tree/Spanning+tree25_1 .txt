Why does running a minimum spanning tree not always produce the shortest path from a single source?This is a question I got in a test today.  Show an example where running a minimum spanning tree algorithm doesn’t produce the shortest path from a single sourceLet be vertices, where for every n between 1 and 5, there exists an edge  and there also exists an edge . (The graph is a cycle). Now run minimum spanning tree, by first adding the edge . You have created a minimum spanning tree, but it does not give the shortest path from to (Which is a single edge). There are actually Prim-Dijkstra algorithms, trying to balance between finding the minimal spanning tree and the shortest path.
