Does running BFS on a graph always leave us with a tree? Is that the same as spanning a tree? What is the name of the specific tree?If the graph is strongly connected, a BFS will always result in a tree because each node is visited exactly once, so has exactly one parent; so it is quite clear how this forms a tree hierarchy. For this reason, it should be clear this is true of any search algorithm, not just BFS. Since the graph is strongly connected, this tree will also be a spanning tree because it will be able to reach all nodes. It will not, in general, be a minimum spanning tree (you added minimum spanning set as one of the topics, so I assume you were asking about minimum spanning tree. Minimum spanning set is something different). If the graph is not strongly connected, then after traversing all of the nodes in a given component, you will randomly choose from another component, make another tree and so on. This results in a forest, or a disjoint union of trees. Hope that helps.
