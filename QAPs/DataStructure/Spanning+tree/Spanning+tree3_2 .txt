Graph Theory: How do spanning trees constructed from Prim's differ from spanning trees constructed from Kruskal's?该网页不存在附加信息...One thing to note here is that you may want to change your terminology. Let's start with what you call your implementation of Kruskal. Here, you actually implemented a minimum spanning tree algorithm. Your step "permute the order of all edges" is equivalent to, for example, "we assign a random real number from [0,1] to each edge". Now, given that no two edges have the same weight (which happens with probability 1 for our random reals), the minimum spanning tree is always unique. If you were to run Prim's algorithm (*) given the same set of edge weights, you would end up with exactly the same spanning tree. What you call your implementation of Prim is actually a different algorithm that only looks similar. (*1) A more proper name to use is Jarnk-Prim's algorithm. Give credit where credit is due.
