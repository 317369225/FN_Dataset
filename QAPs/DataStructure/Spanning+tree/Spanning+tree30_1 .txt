What is the proof of correctness of the number of edges in minimum spanning tree, as |V|-1 where V is the number of vertices in the given graph?The minimum spanning tree is a special type of tree, and a tree has the specific property of having exactly |V|-1 undirected edges. Adding one more edge would definitely lead to a cycle in the graph which cannot be true in the case of any tree. You might want to have a look at the general properties of any tree here: Tree (graph theory). Furthermore, number of vertices of the tree being one more than the number of edges can be proved using induction as provided here: Size of Tree is One Less than Order.
