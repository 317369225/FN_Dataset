What is the difference between spanning tree protocol and rapid spanning tree protocol?As you would expect, Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol is a lot faster than STP. Some are the upgrades and changes from STP include: Faster root switch failure detection Possibility to set ports to transition to forwarding state automatically (as when they're connected to a LAN) While STP can take from 30 to 50 seconds to achieve convergence of the entire topology, RSTP generally takes 6 seconds (with default time values).
