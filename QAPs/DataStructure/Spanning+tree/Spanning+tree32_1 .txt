Let (u,v) be a minimum weight edge in a graph G. How do I show the (u,v) belongs to some minimum spanning tree of G?*A2A* Assume that none of the minimum spanning trees contain the edge (u, v). Pick a minimum spanning tree S. It will contain a path from u to v. Pick any edge (say (w, z)) in that path and remove it. This will create two disconnected components - one contains u and other contains v. Connect these two components with the edge (u, v). This new graph is a spanning tree S' (Can you see why?). Weight of S - Weight of S' = weight of (w, z) - weight of (u, v) >= 0 (Can you see why?) Therefore, weight of S >= weight of S'. Contradiction! (There are two contradictions here, can you see?) Hence proved.
