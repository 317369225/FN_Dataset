How can you describe (a) root bridge election and (b) spanning tree mode?Spanning tree is a protocol that allows for redundant links to exist between switches in a network. It analyzes the network to determine the best least cost routes to get to each switch and shuts down redundant links until they're needed. Root bridge election is the process that all the switches on the network go through to determine which switch will be the root bridge -- essentially the spanning tree administrator, it determines which links to disable.
