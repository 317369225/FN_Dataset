How do I get a second minimum spanning tree?Details with Example?We can achieve this in O(E * log(N)) time using heavy-light decomposition. E = Number of Edges You can find more about heavy light decomposition here : Heavy Light Decomposition Basically for every edge which you consider to add into the MST(Minimum Spanning Tree) to make it second minimum spanning tree, let us say it connects two vertices A and B. Now after adding this new edge we need to remove one edge which is the smallest among the edges that lie in the path between A and B in the original MST. This can be achieved using Heavy Light Decomposition on the MST in Log(N) time for one edge. So it takes O(E * Log(N)) total time.
