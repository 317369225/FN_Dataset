How should one approach the problem of finding minimum spanning trees assuming that one is good at logic but inexperienced at computer science?If a node has multiple edges that connect it to the rest of the graph, the shortest/lightest one should be in the Minimum Spanning Tree. That is the Cut Property, and the intuition behind the implementation of any MST algorithm. We need to find the shortest edge that connects any given node to the rest of the graph, without creating a cycle. The Cut Property
