What are some examples of graphs, which do not have a spanning tree?Followup Does running BFS on a graph always leave us with a tree? Is that the same as spanning a tree? What is the name of the specific tree?All graphs that are connected have a spanning tree. By connected I mean any node can be reachable by any other node. So a graph without a spanning tree would be a disconnected graph where the edges connect 1 - 2 2 - 3 1 - 3 1 - 4 5 - 6 6- 7 here nodes 5 6 7 are disconnected form the nodes 1 2 3 4 so this graph won't have a spanning tree. Also in such cases there aren't spanning trees but spanning forests instead. Read more: Spanning tree
