Is there a Python implementation for euclidean minimum spanning tree?A simple one for 2d (planar) points?You can use the networkx library's minimum_spanning_tree - NetworkX 2.0.dev20140927000009 documentation which is an implementation of Kruskal's algorithm. Since it works on general graphs, you have to implement a pre-processing step which creates a complete graph and then use the networkx function. If you want to implement your own version and you're looking for some pointers, the source code is at https://github.com/networkx/netw...
