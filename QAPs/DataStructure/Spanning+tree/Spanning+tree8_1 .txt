What is an intuitive explantion of the O(m alpha m) algorithm for computing the minimum spanning tree of a graph?I'm referring to the algorithm described here: https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ch... (Note: this is distinct from Kruskal's algorithm which only takes time O(m alpha m) only after sorting.)The intuitive definition is mentioned in the paper itself. It is viewed as computing over the semigroup over paths in a graph. Over an arbitrary semigroup, such a time complexity is necessary.
