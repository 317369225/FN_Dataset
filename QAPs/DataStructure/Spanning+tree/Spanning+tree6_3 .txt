How can I prove this property of Minimum Spanning Trees?该网页不存在附加信息...Say, you have a graph and a minimum spanning tree (MST) of it. Suppose, there is bottleneck shortest path between some two nodes, A and B, the largest edge of which is smaller than the larger edge of the path between these two notes within the MST. Call this largest edge E. Remove E from the MST. The MST would now be two disjoint trees. Now look at the path between A and B in the whole input graph. One of its edges would connect these two halves of now broken MST. And it would by definition be shorter than E. Which means your MST was not really an MST. Contradiction, QED.
