If the computer can't do it, they need to find another way to do it. The only exception that I know of to this is the occasional instances where Google bans or penalizes domains that are violating their guidelines (Such as the JC Penny situation after the 2010 holiday season.) In general, anything in the Google search algorithm is something that they were, well, able to build a computer algorithm for. 187 Views Â· 3 Upvotes
