What are the most popular Nearest Neighbor Search algorithms?
LSH Locality sensitive hashing is a good approximation solution that is very efficient. KD Trees and other spatial indexes degrade very badly as the number of dimensions increases they are quickly equal or worst than a linear brute force search. An interesting approximation that is easy to deploy is a greedy walk. You need first to pre-process the points inserting them in a graph, you attach each new point to its k-nearest neighbors. To find the nearest neighbor for a point you start from a random node in the graph and greedly move to the neighbor node that is closest to your target. When... (more)
