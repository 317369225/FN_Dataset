Which Are The Best Fastest And Efficient Searching Algorithm For Searching Through Database in PHP?

Best either use the database's build in full text indexing features (see e.g. MySQL's Full-Text Search Functions) or use a dedicated search engine such as Sphinx or Solr. Thank you for your feedback!
