What are the most popular Nearest Neighbor Search algorithms?
For Euclidean distance, KD Tree and Ball Tree are the very best[1]. But, they can be only used for Euclidean distance nearest neighbor search due to their data structure. Further, b0th of them tend to perform poorly on high dimensional datasets (eg: dimension > 60). Their performance can be even worse than brute force approach in such scenarios. Locality sensitive hashing[2] the most popular approximate nearest neighbor search method, which can be used effectively with high dimensional datasets. This can be used for most of the distance metrics (Euclidean, Cosine, etc.) by selecting the co... (more)
