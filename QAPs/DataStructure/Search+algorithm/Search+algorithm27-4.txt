Can we implement an AI search algorithm other than a tree or graph structure?
I don't feel comfortable commenting after the others and after Mr. Norvig himself, but I feel that the root for the answer is in the fact that the searches are done over the "space of possible worlds" which depends on the concrete task and the chosen representation. If the representation is with a graph, then graph search is most appropriate. Sometimes the representation with graph won't be effective (e.g. n-dimensional space). Then AI search can still be applied - using some heuristic for selecting the next investigated point. You can check the other comments for examples of such algorithms. 352 Views
