Can we implement an AI search algorithm other than a tree or graph structure?
To me, "Search" means that you are trying to find a solution, but you don't have a linear path of steps that is guaranteed to find the solution.  So: computing a square root is not search, because there is an algorithm that computes the answer with the same steps every time (although with different numbers and perhaps a different number of iterations).  But finding, say, a set of assignments for a 3SAT formula (that is, finding true or false values for boolean variables that makes a logical formula true) can only be done by trial and error: you might start out by assuming that A is true a...
