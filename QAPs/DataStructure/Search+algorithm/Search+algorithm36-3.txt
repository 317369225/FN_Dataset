Search Algorithms: Why can't there be an algorithm faster than binary search?
This result is actually independent of whether or not non-comparison-based techniques are allowed. It assumes: You  already have a sorted list and must search that. Faster searching may  be possible if you stored your data in a different data structure to begin with, such as a hash table. Looking at one entry  in the array takes at least 1 unit of time. In other words, we're not working in some weird model of computation where we could actually look at the whole array in one operation or do massively parallel operations. Supoose you're looking for a target value T in a list A. You can't l... (more)
