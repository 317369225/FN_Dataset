Can we implement an AI search algorithm other than a tree or graph structure?
Well, Gradient descent is a search algorithm (local I admit) and does not have explicitly a graph structure or a graph. Mainly because it does not assume that your search space is graph itself but instead accept continuous search spaces which just have an objective function which is to be maximized or minimized. In general when the space you have to explore is hard to convert accurately into a graph structure your search algorithm may not rely directly on such graph to explore it. I can envision a search, again not necessarily complete, based on particle filter or monte carlo to go toward ... (more)
