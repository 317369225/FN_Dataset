How come in most C++ books they do not go over many data structures? Such as linked lists binary trees stacks, etc.
Data structures are not language unique, for the most part.Â  Therefore, it makes more sense for a book to be written on the theory and application of data structures and a separate book to be written on the syntax and intricacies of languages.
