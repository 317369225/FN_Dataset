What is linked list concept in data structures and what are its real time applications?
very basic answer but thought of explaining. Linked list is helpful in allocation of memory. Lets say we have 10 MB of total memory of which 5 MB is already used and we need to save a document of 5 MB. 5 MBÂ  is available and ideally, we should be able to save a document of 5 MB, but we will not able to save it if memory is available like shown below, we are not able to save a document of 5MB because contiguous block of memory is not available. With the help of linked list, 5MB of file can be stored in memory by dividing it in 1 MB chunk and store it at 5 blocks. Other real time usage is explained by Jigyasa Grover
