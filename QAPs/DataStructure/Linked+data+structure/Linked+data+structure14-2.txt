In what situations are singly linked lists the preferred data structure?
When one can afford slow deletions and additions as compared to arrays, primarily to reduce strain on memory (remember that arrays need contiguous memory). Also sorting on linked lists is a big no-no, since we are talking about when to use them, there are several uses and limited only by one's imagination. Linked lists are the most basics of data structures... can be used with other such simple data structures to form complex and powerful ones. For instance, linked lists can be used with hash tables for collision resolution. Its called separate chaining, IIRC.
