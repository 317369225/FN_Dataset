Is there any application of linked list and array in data structures?
Lot of applications because many, not all, of the known efficient algorithms are either implemented using arrays or linked lists... I will try to list some: 1. Sorting: You can safely assume all the applications need this and sorting indeed uses array 2. Searching: Same as (1) but can use array or a linked list --KK
