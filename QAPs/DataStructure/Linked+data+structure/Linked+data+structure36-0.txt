I have done a link list, a stack and a queue. What else should I do in data structure?
What you learnt is nothing when compared to what lies head. Now a days Link list ,stack and queue are History they are replacing with the Graph Structures . As it has more Implementation and scope for Inventing Something New In it. Go with the Graph thats What i Suggest. Graphs Graph Adjacency list Adjacency matrix Graph-structured stack Scene graph Binary decision diagram Zero-suppressed decision diagram And-inverter graph Directed graph Directed acyclic graph Propositional directed acyclic graph Multigraph HypergraphOther Lightmap Winged edge Doubly connected edge list Quad-edge Routing table Symbol table
