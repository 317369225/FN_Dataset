How do I use data structures like linked lists in Javascript interview questions?
Well, this will vary from interview to interview and from question to question. For example, I was asked to rebuild a binary tree given an array representation of the in-order and post-order traversals of the tree. For this problem, the interviewer was testing my knowledge of traversals, not my knowledge of the implementation of a binary tree. I recommend you ask about everything that you can make assumptions about. I asked if I could make an assumption that we already had a binary search tree class and that we had access to class members, etc. These were fine assumptions, but I had to ask first. A second example is I was once asked to design a data structure that supported insertions, deletions, and lookups all in log(n) time. I recognized that an AVL tree would fit the bill, but I couldn't just assume there was an AVL tree class already written, since the goal of the question was to see me implement the data structure. You always want to ask if you can assume a certain class exists. Without asking, your best bet is to assume that you don't have access to these classes.
