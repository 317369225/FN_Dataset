Data Structures: When is a singly linked list more useful than a doubly linked list and vice versa?
The advantages and disadvantage of a data structure depends on the usage. In a singly linked list you can traverse only in one direction. If traversing in one direction suffices for your use case then why waste extra space (unless you are using Xor-linking) and increase the cost of elementary operations like delete, add.
