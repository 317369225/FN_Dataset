Where can I find implementations of standard data structures and algorithms in C++?
If you don't mind reading pages through Google translate, then one of the following two: Arhiva educationala: great archive with all almost all commonly used algorithms. Includes explanation, reference source code, and an online judge to test your own implementation. The only bad thing that I have to say about this is that the code quality is sometimes uneven, but this is very minor. MAXimal :: algo: Russian archive of algorithms and data structures. No online judge, but includes more topics than infoarena, and is written by just one guy (correct me if I'm wrong). For more advanced topics, you could look into the course materials offered by Jeff Erickson here: Algorithms Course Materials (this one's in English). Finally, if none of the above work for you, you can check out my attempt to write them in a "formal" way: https://github.com/sebastian-cla.... It's not finished, and I didn't exactly write it with other people in mind, but if it's useful to you, great!
