Are basic data structures like linked lists, queues and stacks really used in software engineering projects?
In database engines, you use all these structures and more (pretty much every "design pattern" you've heard of will be used in a db engine), and when I was doing embedded system databases, I wrote all my libraries myself as common libraries were too big.
