I wish to study Wikipedia page link structure as it evolved over time. But the current page (http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/) does not have data older than 2012. Does anyone know where older page links data can be found?
Look again, it does have data older than 2012. It has no dumps created before 2012, but (some of the) dumps contain the full edit history of all pages, back to 2001. Look for the section saying "All pages with complete edit history". There are no convenient snap shots, however. You'll have to parse and analyze several hundred million page revisions to get what you want. But the data is all there. Updated 152w ago â€¢ Asked to answer by Anonymous
