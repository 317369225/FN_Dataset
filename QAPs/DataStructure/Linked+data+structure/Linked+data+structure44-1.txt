When we have an RDBMS like MySQL with excellent features for storing data, why do we need data structures like linked lists in real time applications?
All the data structures you read about are usually maintained in RAM, the volatile memory. On the other hand, RDBMS like MySQL store data into files into persistent storage (disk). In your applications, once you get data out of MySQL, RAM utilization and performance is your prime concern. Also, most of data structures are coupled with algorithms. Say sorting is best done with binary trees. Recursion is implemented only by using stacks. So for overall computing performance you need that data structure in RAM.
