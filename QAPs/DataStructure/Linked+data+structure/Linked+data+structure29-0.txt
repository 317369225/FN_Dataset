How does data structure (stack, queue, linked list) help in placements?
I don't know how much programming you did, but it's quite evident that you deal with numbers/characters a lot. So the way you access and manipulate these would define how good your program is, taking the algorithm out of the picture. So, every data structure is unique and has it's own advantages.         Coming to your question in detail. The concept of recursion is dependent on Stacks. Read a standard text book why. And also in DFS which is a searching algorithm which is fairly popular. Queue is basically a parent of Priority queues and other variants which are again used in building other data structures like heaps. Again priority queues are used in building spanning tree problems which is core to any CS problem now a days. This way, it doesn't matter what the DS is but it's sort of extended to other DS's and also to solve problems easily which may be a head ache to solve without that particular DS. I hope I made my point clear!
