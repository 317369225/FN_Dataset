What is your favorite video lecture series on Algorithms and Data Structures?
I think Dr. Madhavan Mukund's NPTEL course on Design and Analysis of Algorithms is one of the best, if not the best. Normally, I don't like NPTEL courses since they are slow paced, and the accents are really irritating. However, Madhavan's course breaks all those stereotypes and his brilliance clearly comes out. True to first impression being the best impression, I think his first couple of lectures are mind blowing. The beauty, breadth, and elegance of algorithm design clearly comes across. The examples he gave to motivate the importance and scope of the course were very well selected and brilliant to say the least. I highly recommend that everyone try out at least the first set of lectures, and if things go as I suspect, you will be totally hooked to the course. Link: NPTEL :: Computer Science and Engineering
