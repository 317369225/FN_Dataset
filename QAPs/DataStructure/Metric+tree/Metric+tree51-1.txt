Do trees really reduce air pollution levels of VOCs, NO2 and other compounds in addition to reducing levels of CO2?
Trees really do reduce pollution! According to treeinabox.com, "trees act as a filter, cleaning the air by intercepting airborne particles, and absorbing air pollutants like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide." There are many pollutants that can be absorbed by trees, not to mention things like sound pollution or light pollution. Trees also absorb water and slowly release it, thereby preventing flash flooding. Essentially, trees absorb all kinds of things that may be harmful to people or animals.
