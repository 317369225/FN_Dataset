Do trees really reduce air pollution levels of VOCs, NO2 and other compounds in addition to reducing levels of CO2?
Trees lower levels of several pollutants: Trees help cleanse the air by intercepting airborne particles, reducing heat, and absorbing such pollutants as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Trees remove this air pollution by lowering air temperature, through respiration, and by retaining particulates.[1] The impact of trees can be significant: There is up to a 60% reduction in street level particulates with trees. [2] In one urban park (212 ha.) tree cover was found to remove daily 48lbs. particulates, 9 lbs nitrogen dioxide, 6 lbs sulfur dioxide, and 2 lb carbon monoxide ($136/day value based upon pollution control technology) and 100 lbs of carbon. [2] One sugar maple (12" DBH) along a roadway removes in one growing season 60mg cadmium, 140 mg chromium, 820 mg nickel, and 5200 mg lead from the environment.  [2] Air quality improvement in New York City due to pollution removal by trees during daytime of the in-leaf season averaged 0.47% for particulate matter, 0.45% for ozone, 0.43% for sulfur dioxide, 0.30% for nitrogen dioxide, and 0.002% for carbon monoxide. Air quality improves with increased percent tree cover and decreased mixing-layer heights. In urban areas with 100% tree cover (i.e., contiguous forest stands), short-term improvements in air quality (one hour) from pollution removal by trees were as high as 15% for ozone, 14% for sulfur dioxide, 13% for particulate matter, 8% for nitrogen dioxide, and 0.05% for carbon monoxide.[5] Shade trees planted in parking lots reduce evaporative emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from parked cars. Scientists suggest that increasing tree cover from 8% to 50% in Sacramento parking lots may reduce evaporative emissions by 2%.[5] In 1994, trees in New York City removed an estimated 1,821 metric tons of air pollution at an estimated value to society of $9.5 million. Air pollution removal by urban forests in New York was greater than in Atlanta (1,196 t; $6.5 million) and Baltimore (499 t; $2.7 million), but pollution removal per m2 of canopy cover was fairly similar among these cities (New York: 13.7 g/m 2/yr; Baltimore: 12.2 g/m2 /yr; Atlanta: 10.6 g/m 2/yr). These standardized pollution removal rates differ among cities according to the amount of air pollution, length of in-leaf season, precipitation, and other meteorological variables. Large healthy trees greater than 77 cm in diameter remove approximately 70 times more air pollution annually (1.4 kg/yr) than small healthy trees less than 8 cm in diameter (0.02 kg/yr) [7] Of the 1821 tons in New York City of air pollution that trees remove daily during non-precipitation periods, 506 tons is ozone, 470 tons is particulate matter, 510 tons is NO2, 238 tons is SO2, and 97 tons is CO.[11] The effect trees have on various pollutants is highly variable and depends on the species of tree: Among the 70 taxa, the value of NO2 assimilation capability differed by a factor of 122 between the highest (Prunus yedoensis; 0.061) and the lowest Cryptomeria japonica; 0.0005).[4] Trees can also be highly effective when it comes to air pollution from VOCs.[4] Some trees can remove some VOCs from the environment, while some trees produce some VOCs. Plants exposed to oVOCs increased their normal uptake of the compounds, absorbing 40% more than expected. Although scientists suspected that plants consume small amounts of oVOCs, this study provides the "first concrete data," ... In another set of experiments, the team showed that stressing out the plants—by exposing them to ozone pollution, for example—also increased their uptake of oVOCs. This suggests, says Karl, that deciduous trees provide good negative feedback for atmospheric pollution: The more polluted the atmosphere becomes, the more oVOCs the plants take up. However, he says, there is a limit to how much pollution plants can handle. Karl and his team now plan to look at pines and other coniferous trees to see if they also suck up oVOCs and other pollutants.[10] Scientists have known for years that trees and other vegetation produce certain hydrocarbon compounds, such as monoterpenes and isoprene. These volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the source of the appealing scents associated with pine needles and cut grass, are used by plants to attract pollinating insects or to repel leaf-eating ones.  Research shows that VOCs play a significant role in the formation of one of the most damaging pollutants, ground-level ozone, which is the major component of what is more commonly known as smog. [5] areas where farmland has been abandoned during the last century have early generations of trees that produce higher levels of VOCs than older growth forests.[6] Emissions of volatile organic compounds by trees can contribute to the formation of ozone and carbon monoxide. However, in atmospheres with low nitrogen oxide concentrations (e.g., some rural environments), VOCs may actually remove ozone[8] natural sources emit 88% of the world’s VOCs[9] poplar, eucalyptus and oak...emit more volatile organic compounds than they absorb. ... The right trees include ash, apple, birch, hawthorn, hackberry, maple, pear and peach.[11] When selecting trees to plant in given area, the ability of the trees to remove pollutants has to be balanced with other considerations such as the aesthetic impact of the trees and the ease of managing the trees.
