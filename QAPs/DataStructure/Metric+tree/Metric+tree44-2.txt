Natural Language Processing: How would you programmatically parse a sentence and decide whether to answer "that's what she said"?
Chloé Kiddon and Yuriy Brun wrote a paper entitled "That’s What She Said: Double Entendre Identification" that deals with this very topic. Worth reading! http://www.cs.washington.edu/hom... In particular, they used of a corpus of erotica that allowed them to develop "sexiness" ratings for nouns, verbs and adjectives, and trained their machine learning algorithm with corpora from twssstories, fmylife, textsfromlastnight and Wikiquote. They found their model, DEviaNT, to have a precision of over 71.4%. Some more from their results, where they compared the most likely TWSSes from several models: DEviaNT returned 28 such sentences (all tied for most likely to be a TWSS), 20 of which are true positives. However, 2 of the 8 false positives are in fact TWSSs (despite coming from the negative testing data): "Yes give me all the cream and he’s gone." and "Yeah but his hole really smells sometimes." Not bad! (I would be remiss not to thank Patrick Thomson for seemingly coincidentally tweeting a link to the paper: https://twitter.com/importantsho...)
