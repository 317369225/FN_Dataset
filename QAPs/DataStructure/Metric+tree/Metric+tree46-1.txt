What are some measures of complexity?
Perhaps graph density: the number of connections in a system expressed as a ratio or percentage of the maximum possible number. This would be an indicative measure of structural complexity, but maybe not behavioural complexity. I found it interesting to compare this to Alex Kamil's point 3. Degree of complexity may be the inverse of degree of organization. That is, few connections between components could be a measure of a higher level of organization - according to some of the work by William Ross Ashby, anyway. To give an example, imagine an army where any soldier could give orders to any other soldier. This would be a very high level of complexity: if we ignore soldiers giving commands to themselves, then in a platoon of 10 soldiers there would be 90 direct lines of command. A structural complexity of 90%, by the above measure. In real platoons, there are only 9 such lines of command. So they are much less complex (only 9%), but much better organized. It is interesting to wonder which if these two platoons would be capable of the most complex behaviour. I suspect that the 90%-complex unit would get gridlocked virtually every time it tried to do anything. Updated 20w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
