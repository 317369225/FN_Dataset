Do trees really reduce air pollution levels of VOCs, NO2 and other compounds in addition to reducing levels of CO2?
Trees absorb carbon dioxide, so effectively yes as it prevents global warming. It also does so indirectly as deforestation is often done for factories and other businesses that pollute the environment.
