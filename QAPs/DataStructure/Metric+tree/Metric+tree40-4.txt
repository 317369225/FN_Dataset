What makes Bangalore the best city to live in India?
First & foremost, the weather. Though nowadays Bangalore is turning out to be a hot oven..but the weather here is pleasant most of the times. There are many wonderful things about Bangalore. We are multicultural,  multi-class and multi-commercial. Bangalore has always been positioned as the “city of the future”. Many  things which India is famous for globally stem from this city—be it the  iconic Infosys, Wipro and Biocon, or brands/business models such as MTR,  Café Coffee Day, Reva and Air Deccan, or civic movements such as  Janaagraha and BangaloreOne. Bangalore is a friendly city and does not have the aggressive  pro-Kannadiga and anti-outsider attitudes that are seen, or can be  sensed, in other cities. Bangalore is in an eminent position not only from an IT  perspective, but has also become a distinguished center for education  and different industries. Bangalore has a rich tradition of Carnatic and Hindustani music; people  still visit traditional places such as Bangalore Gayana Samaj, where  music concerts are held. I think Bangalore has a more discerning public compared with other  metros. If we can hang on to our individuality in having the facilities  of a metropolis while keeping some small-town values intact, the city  would remain a homogenous whole, rather than being fractured into areas  or suburbs.
