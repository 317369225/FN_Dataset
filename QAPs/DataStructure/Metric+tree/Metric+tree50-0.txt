The College and University Experience: What is it like to major in physics?
I found it fun, but a bit isolating. There's a great thrill in learning the material that feels like you're learning some of the great secrets of the Universe and following in the footsteps of great scientists. There was always a thrill getting to a new topic that was in the popular vernacular and then learning the details. Classes are typically small, my upper-division courses typically had 5 to 10 students in them and sometimes as few as 3. You're typically surrounded by intelligent interesting people who are interested in learning material and most people aren't focused on questions like "what is this used for?" There is typically a lot of personal attention given to majors because there are relatively few of them. If you're reasonably successful, you're routed towards graduate school by professors. Classes are structured around homework sets.  Most courses give out weekly sets that typically take a few hours each.  There is very little reading or writing. You get asked "oh, you must be smart?" a lot. There are a lot of opportunities for research (usually paid). Grading is usually pretty lax. If you fall behind in a class, you're in deep trouble. It's nearly impossible to catch up from behind. The majors usually form a clique because there is such a small group of them. There are few women majors and there are major gender disparity issues that are still being worked out.  I feel like physics is about 2-3 decades behind where it should be.
