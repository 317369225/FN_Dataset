How should I prepare for statistics questions for a data science interview?
These are first level topics that are part of a general data science interview, where statistics is one of the skills being brushed over, but not the primary one. These are not for evaluating expertise in statistics, just familiarity and reasonable coherence to apply correctly. Data exploration How do you summarize the distribution of your data? How do you handle outliers or data points that skew data? What assumptions can you make? Why and when? (i.e When is it safe to assume "normal") Confidence intervals How they are constructed Why you standardize How to interpret Sampling Why and when? How do you calculate needed sample size? [Power analysis is advanced] Limitations Bootstrapping and resampling? Biases When you sample, what bias are you inflicting? How do you control for biases? What are some of the first things that come to mind when I do X in terms of biasing your data? Modeling Can you build a simple linear model? How do you select features? How do you evaluate a model? Experimentation How do test new concepts or hypotheses in....insert domain X? i.e. How would evaluate whether or not consumers like the webpage redesign or new food being served? How do you create test and control groups? How do you control for external factors? How do you evaluate results? Updated 88w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
