When should I use Boosting instead of SVM?
Boosting is very, very slow if implemented naively.  This makes it nearly useless in large scale settings However  Boosting and SVMs are both examples of convex optimization problems with different loss functions and regularizers.  You can get close to what most people call Boosting by solving the associated convex optimization problem, using exponential loss and an L1 regularizer Both SVMs and (this form of) Boosting can be solved under the same framework, such as a Bundle solver: Bundle Methods for regularized Risk Minimization (BMRM) So pick a solver that can do both, and just experiment with what works best
