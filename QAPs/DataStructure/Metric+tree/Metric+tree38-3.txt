What is the most annoying thing about the USA to a person from another country?
Tipping. First of all, it's discriminatory and unfair. The Freakonomics podcast on tipping talks about this in detail. But essentially, as you'd expect, blonde white females achieve higher tips than others regardless of the quality of service. Secondly, if the price of opening a bottle of beer isn't included in the price of the beer, I'll do it myself. If I'm not over the moon with the service I receive, I don't see why I should pay extra for it. It's the business' responsibility to remunerate their staff properly, not mine. Tips should be a bonus for extraordinary performance, not an expected addition to a pay packet that servers can't make rent without. I'm with Mr Pink on this one. Although, unlike him, I play ball. Because I know these people need it. I just don't think it's right. Updated 85w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
