What are methods to make a predictive model more robust to outliers?
There should be many effective methods to do that: Use different metric (example: median instead of mean, absolute deviation instead of standard deviation): this method is mostly applied when outliers probably distort the distribution. Opt for confidence interval: usually 3~5 times of standard deviation, the outside are probably outlier, but this method work fines with Gaussian-like distribution (normal, student,...) Use transformation: if outlier is an inseparable part of your data set, it is okay to use log or more robust transformation. Try other models, some are resistant to outliers: tree, random forest, clustering, k-nearest neighbors... they're all in handy.You can read useful answers from similar questions have been asked: What are methods to make a predictive model more robust to outliers?
