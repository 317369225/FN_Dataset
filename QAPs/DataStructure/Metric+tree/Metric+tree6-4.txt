Are 80% bounce from Google PPC and 60% bounce from Bing PPC normal?
Bounce Rate is a diagnostic metric, basically something you only compare against itself under similar circumstances.  So, in reality, you would just be comparing bounce rates for the different traffic sources for your site.  Comparing it to outside sources really won't tell you much because there are too many other factors that could throw the numbers in one direction or another (same goes with any percentage based metric, like CTR, CR, etc.). In reality, 80% could be totally fine for your line of business, if your ROI lines up, which is ultimately what you're looking to solve for in the end.  If you're not making money, then you start stepping through all the diagnostic metrics in the name of optimizing the system.  Bounce Rate, Conversion Rate, CTR, CPC, etc. etc. That said, since 100% bounce rate is the worst it could be, 80% would be pretty high for just about anyone; however, that just tells you it is high, not what is making it high... could be the page, could be the keywords, etc.
