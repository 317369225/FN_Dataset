How exactly is machine learning used in recommendation engines?

One of my favorites is "Programming Collective Intelligence" by Toby Segaran and O'Reilly Media.  It guides you through some examples and actually does a much better job of teaching you the machine learning techniques than one would expect if that's a secondary goal of the book.  It does NOT cover all the various recommender approaches, just a couple, but covers those well. (I have no connection to the author/publisher/others and don't personally benefit by promoting the book).
