Natural Language Processing: How would you programmatically parse a sentence and decide whether to answer "that's what she said"?
hmmWiki = build Hidden Markov Model from Wikipedia corpus using n-grams as featureshmmROMP = build Hidden Markov Model from ROMP corpus using n-grams as featuresfunction TWSS(sentence):   if prob(hmmWiki,sentence) < prob(hmmROMP,sentence):      return "that's what's she said"   else:      return None Also, maybe add an epsilon threshold to prevent uncertainty resulting in lots of TWSS jokes. note: a ROMP corpus is an adult novel Updated 248w ago • View Upvotes
