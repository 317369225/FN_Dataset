Which is the most underrated state of India? Why ?
The Seven Sister States - Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura a.k.a. the North East states of India. The states are as much Indian as any other states but still many people have no knowledge about them. Heck! I am sure many wouldn't even know about the state capitals of the state. They are underrated in people's mind with lack of knowledge. This lack of knowledge about the states, is kind of blessing in disguise. Tourists don't flock these places in herds and hence, the virginity of nature is still intact. They are underrated in tourism industry. Several popular figures M.C. Mary Kom, R.D Burman, and many hockey players have been the pride of India and yet not many have been acknowledged for their contributions. Thus, they are underrated in sports and culture field. I don't belong there, nor I have been there. But I love the North East. :) Links: The Seven Virgin Sisters of India Thanks for asking Shubham! :)
