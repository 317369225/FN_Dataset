What are some remarkable facts about Switzerland?
That the annual CO2 emissions per capita is around 5-6 metric tonnes. That's astounding efficiency for a developed nation. Compare that to 18-19 for the United States and 9-10 for Germany, 8-10 for Japan in recent years [1]. That the individual recycling rate of all recyclable materials in Switzerland is above 94% for glass, 91% for aluminium, 85% for paper and cardboard, 80% for PET plastic, and 69% for batteries as of 2010 [3]. I read these numbers off a chart, so they may be +/-1%, but astounding numbers nonetheless. I don't think the United States comes even close. (Even here at MIT, supposedly a world class research institution, students, future CEOs, and even professors and deans routinely refuse to recycle.) Switzerland's power grid is about 56% hydroelectric and 39% nuclear as of 2008 [2]. That's less than 5% thermal, which typically account for the most pollutive sources. Compare that to the United States which runs on 41% coal and 25% natural gas, or China which runs on 69% coal. Switzerland has 5,063 km of rail transport network. Over 99% of those tracks are electrified [4] and 75% of the railway power grid is hydroelectric [6], which means that a huge chunk of Swiss transportation is zero carbon and almost completely non-polluting. Also, 90% of those trains are less than 3 minutes late [5]. Switzerland has over 60,000 km of signposted hiking trails. Hiking is very much a national pastime from what I observed in my time there, and I feel it definitely contributes to their appreciation and respect for nature. I think we all can learn a thing or two from the Swiss about sustainability and stop hitting the economic battles and political barriers we keep fussing about elsewhere in the world.
