What are the advantages of using a decision tree for classification?
I would also add that decision trees: Easily handle irrelevant attributes through information gain, which is a commonly used metric for decision tree learning. Are robust against skewed distributions. Imagine learning a Naive Bayes classifier with skewed variable. The skew of the variable will affect the correctness of the learnt (Gaussian) distribution. Decision trees, on the other hand, handle skewed variable gracefully since they do not make assumption on the variable's distribution when constructing axis splits. Decision tree Thinking about data
