What are the key characteristics of Norwegian culture?
Everything which Alexander wrote:) Aside from that I'm not sure whether there exists such a thing as a Norwegian culture. As of today, I think one can only talk of a Western, eventually European, culture, partly americanised with slight differences/leftovers from a mostly forgotten past. I suspect that some younger people may live with an illusion that Norwegian culture as of today has anything to do with the Vikings of the past. Well, it hasn't. It's mostly about keeping up with the Joneses (only their name is Johnsen), watching the last series on the telly and binge drinking on Saturday. And what Alexander wrote. Aside from that, the Norwegian mindset is conservative. Not politically, but hostile to too much change.
