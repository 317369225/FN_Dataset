What are some remarkable facts about Switzerland?
Switzerland's Military Defense Involves Blowing Up All Roads Into The Country Switzerland can blow up its roads to prevent an invasion ! They have engineered their nation to collapse all roads going into the country as a defense mechanism. The Swiss are completely willing to do whatever it takes to make an invasion tiresome and difficult for possible invaders. To interrupt the utility of bridges, tunnels, highways, and railroads, Switzerland has established three thousand points of demolition. Primacord fuses are built into the bridge. Hidden artillery is in place on either side, set to prevent the enemy from clearing or repairing the damage. As a nation that maintained neutrality since 1815, through dozens of European wars, two world wars, and the Cold War it's important to have a very secure insurance policy against overeager invaders. In short: Switzerland is devoted to extreme neutrality. But were a nation to test that, they're prepared to mess an invader up. Updated 108w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
