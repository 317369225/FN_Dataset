The College and University Experience: What is it like to major in physics?
For some of us a major in physics is just the lazy, and easy way, to go. What it's like is almost like cheating to get good grades.  Google "The Tale of the Man Who Was Too Lazy to Fail" . Let me explain. I started college in 'pre-med'. Biology is interesting, loved it, but there was too much memorization and competition. Same for Chemistry. O-Chem is very interesting but also hard to get an A. P-Chem is really just a physics class :-) I don't even want to mention how I got massacred in psychology, and history class. Meanwhile, my math and physics classes were just a simple series of puzzles to solve and, once that is done, an A is guaranteed and huge numbers of hours spent studying are not necessary. More time for girls! Yay! So, I switched majors. Graduated with honors. Perhaps I loved physics since I was 9 and didn't know it. The posts below are all excellent explanations but I think that if you are a kid who is naturally good at certain kinds of 'puzzles' then physics will become obvious to you naturally as a potential major. If you are not that kind of person then it will be one big uphill effort to be a physics major. Then there's comp-sci. That was not an option where I was in college but I do that now and I might have done that back then as another easy way to get an 'A' and to not have to spend hours memorizing stuff.
