What is the minimal ecosystem necessary for human survival in a space colony?
Warning: Really rough estimates ahead. A minimum viable human gene pool requires thousands of contemporaneous individuals.  Add in higher mortality rates from space hazards--radiation, catastrophic accidents, psychosocial stress and its effects on health and violence, difficulty developing blastocysts in low gravity (e.g. on Mars), opportunistic murder in the absence of an impartially huge state leviathan, etc.--and you probably need 50,000 people. That's one reason Elon Musk originally pegged his ideal initial Mars population at around that number. Each of those 50,000 people would need around 10 metric tons of water; plant mass equal to around 20 trees to secure oxygen/CO2 and nitrogen cycles; plant mass equal to another 10 trees to feed and offset insects for the human's protein needs; and (on cold Mars at least) 1 megawatt of power to maintain that human, their plant biomass, sewage treatment, and industrial processes to create and maintain the structures and machinery to house and sustain it all.  Other people may quote you lower numbers.   Do not listen to them!  Their approach is budget-beholden to a deadly degree, and they wouldn't agree to live in their own design.
