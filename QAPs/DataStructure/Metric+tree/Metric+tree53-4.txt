How exactly is machine learning used in recommendation engines?
The above answers are correct in some sense that we seek to reformulate the recommendation problem as a regression problem.  Here is a presentation on using machine learning for personalized recommendations Applied Machine Learning For Search Engine Relevance , where this is done using a very general formalism called the Effective Operator Formalism Dimensional Reduction via an Effective Operator Here, we combine both linear regression and matrix factorization into 1 formal method More generally, we want convex optmization problems though, not just linear regressoons.  For example , with matrix factorization (i.e. NMF), we want to avoid just using ALS alone because it is not convex and has convergence problems.  The traditional solution is to use the Kmeans++ or NNDSVD seed (as in Scikit Lear), but we can also reformulate the problem as a convex optimization Advances in Convex NMF:  Linear Programming However, there are still people trying to using more traditional statistical methods (really methods from statistical physics) For example, this is an example of using machine learning for music recommendations Music Recommendations and the Logistic Metric Embedding
