Why hasn't the United States switched to the metric system?
Here's how I see the difference: Socket Head Cap Screw, 316 stainless, 4-40, 3/8" long: $6.74 for 50: McMaster-Carr Socket Head Cap Screw, 316 stainless, M3 x 10, $9.99 for 50: McMaster-Carr Both screws perform the same function, are about the same size, weight, strength, etc. But one is 50% more money. It's not just screws. It's O-rings, sheet metal ... it's even car tires. The tread, which could be switched to metric without affecting other things, was switched. But the wheel diameter is still measured in inches. Thus we have 255/50R16 tires, 255 mm wide, height 50% of width, which fit in 16 inch wheels. When I'm specifying parts, if the part doesn't add much to the system cost, I use metric. If it does ... I think about it. Sometimes the wrenches that operate on those bolts cost a lot more than the bolts.
