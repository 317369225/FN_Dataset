What are the best bands from the past 15 years?
1. The Shins - This indie rock band has made consistently good music. Two of their albums - Oh, Inverted World and Wincing the Night Away - should rank among the best produced albums in the last 15 years. Classic stuff. 2. Kings of Leon - A slightly more popular band that has produced some hit singles but has primarily stuck to its sound and has again made more good albums than bad ones. 3. Wolfmother - This Australian hard rock band has a sound that most rock fans will happily accept. Some great songs that you'll keep coming back to from time to time. 4. Arctic Monkeys - One of the more famous bands of today, Arctic Monkeys have made likeable, mainstream music without being afraid of experimenting sometimes 5. Whatever Jack White does - Jack White is one of the best guitarists/musicians  of our times. He has made some memorable music with The White Stripes, The Raconteurs and his current The Dead Weather. (Edited: 7/30/2014) 6. Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros - Alex Ebert's made some great music in the last few years and with this group he achieved more mainstream success. Awesome sound and songs that you can sing along too. *Only Rock Bands were considered for this answer Updated 79w ago • View Upvotes
