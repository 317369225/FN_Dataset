How many trees would it take to reverse climate change?
More than we can possibly plant. Although planting trees (and stopping  cutting down the ones we currently have) will help some, the amount of CO2 we  are putting into the atmosphere exceeds the amount we could possibly plant  enough trees to consume. Mike Barnard has down an excellent job of crunching the  numbers. The only thing I can really add is to point out that in addition to  CO2, we are also dumping other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, such as  methane, nitrous oxide, and CFCs. Even if we could plant enough trees to  sequester all the CO2 we are releasing, there is no such mechanism for removing  these other gases.
