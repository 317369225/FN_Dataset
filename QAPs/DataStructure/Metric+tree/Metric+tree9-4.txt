How should I prepare for statistics questions for a data science interview?
Thanks for A2A. Actually bunch of people have written good answers and i personally liked that of Jeffrey Wong and Nigel Clay. Just to add my two cents, when it comes to selecting right candidates, i personally give emphasis on mainly two things: the conceptual understanding than mere theory, and passion to learn new things. i have seen enough people in my life who are just too good at theory but when it comes to practical implementation, they can not apply that knowledge to solve the business problem. And by chance if you stumbled upon such person in the interview who is looking for specific answer only and doesn't care about the systematic approach, i would say that company (or at least that person's job) is not for you! There are few opportunities in life which you have to let go so that some much better opportunity is waiting for you in the future! Its not just philosophy but i have (and am) experienced (and experiencing) it! I am sure the original questioner's interview must be over long back but still all the best for future interviews of all the readers! :)
