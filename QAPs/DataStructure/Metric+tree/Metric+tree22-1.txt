What should US travelers know about visiting Bangalore?
1. Public Travel facilities are still developing - Auto (3 wheeler) guys are generally not so nice. So don't be worried if you land up asking 4 of them before 1 agrees to take you. DO NOT argue with them, stick to the meter billing or best take pre-paid autos (generally available around shopping malls). Metro has just started operations but isn't of much use, so don't go around looking for it. The bus stations are a good option to travel via public transport but then again majority of them list their destination/ boards in Kanada (local language) however the conductor/ drivers are helpful. Ask for help and you shall receive it. 2. Must Visit Places - A few options inside Bangalore - Lalbagh (a big garden), Vidhan Shoudha (state parliament), Banergatta National Park, Commercial Street (shopping heaven for females), etc. Otherwise there are many must visits landscape regions.. outside Bangalore like waterfalls, river beds, temples, etc. Entertainment options are very limited - malls/gardens/temples/bowling/go-carting are the major ones. Plan trips for weekend outside Bangalore. Tons of places. 3. Night Life - One word "ZERO". Shops start shutting down by 9:30pm. Pubs/hotels/restaurants have to close by 11:00pm. Pubs do not allow patrons to dance - So, don't try that. Public transport is ZERO at night, thus book a cab, do not try to engage with an Auto driver. 4. Weather - I think, the one and only best thing about Bangalore is its weather. It's mostly in the range of 21-25 degree Celsius. So don't worry about summers/winters - there isn't much of both here.
