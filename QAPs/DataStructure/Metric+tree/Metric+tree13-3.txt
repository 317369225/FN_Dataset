What are methods to make a predictive model more robust to outliers?
Another way to transform your data to be robust to outliers is to do a spatial sign transformation, which works as follows: [math]x^*_{ij} = \frac{x_{ij}}{\sum_{j=1}^{P}x^2_{ij}}[/math] As shown in this website below, after the transformation, the predictors are projected to a unit circle, which is evidently robust to outliers. Pre-Processing You can do that easily using the 'caret' package in R. Before doing that, as pointed out by the author, you'll typically need to center and scale the predictors first and, since it's a group transformation, it's better not to remove any predictors afterwards.
