How does one physically make a CPU?
Thirumal Venkat posted a great link about the topic. I would start there. [Disclaimer - my information might be a little old, but you will get the big picture] Basically, once you have the gates and wiring you have something called a "netlist". The netlist is then given to a Backend Engineer to great the physical layout. The result is a blueprint for the location/size of every transistor and wire in the design (called GDSII). The fabrication process turns this blueprint into an actual physical device. The chip structure, starting from the bottom, is a silicon base, transistors on top of that, and then multiple layers of wiring to connect the transistors together. To make the chip the initial silicon wafer goes through numerous stages, where each stage builds another layer on the device. Basically, for each layer there is a photo-lithography stage where the geometries are drawn. a stage where some material is deposited, and then a cleanup stage to remove unwanted material. The actual process is very complex, involving around 150 steps to complete a wafer. We now have a wafer than contains possibly hundreds of the same device. Testing is done directly on the wafer. Bad devices are marked. The good devices are cut out of the wafer and then put into a package (which are all the black devices you see when you open your computer). Testing is done on the package and the process concludes.
