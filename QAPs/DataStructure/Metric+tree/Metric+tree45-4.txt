What are the best bands from the past 15 years?
Low - masters of slowcore   The Roots - A rarity in Hip Hop, an actual band   Fucked Up - the thinking persons hardcore band   Yo La Tengo - A favorite of record store clerks everywhere.   The Libertines - The name says it all   Galactic - Norleans eclecticists   Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds - Grinderman is good and all, but the Bad Seeds in any incarnation are GREAT.   Because the OP asked specifically for "Bands", I really focused my answer on the band aspect. How the band interacts and works as a unit. Several of these selections have rotating/changing membership and both the Libertines and the Bad Seeds are driven by strong central personalities (Doherty/Barat and Nick Cave respectively) but they still have a collective sound.
