How many trees would it take to reverse climate change?
Summary: To cover this year's CO2 emissions alone, we would have to cover 2.7% of the Earth's surface with newly planted trees, just under 40 billion of them or about 5.4 trees for every human on Earth. We would run out of Earth to plant trees on in under 20 years. To bring us back to pre-Industrial Revolution levels of 250 ppm, we would have to plant about 353 billion trees covering 24% of the Earth's surface and stop burning all fossil fuels right now. In both cases, it would take 40 years before the trees absorbed the CO2. There are two scenarios: don't stop burning fossil fuels and leave CO2 levels alone, or stop burning fossil fuels and return to pre-Industrial Revolution levels. Don't stop burning fossil fuels scenario Well, let's make some assumptions: Only tree planting will be used to combat climate change. Carbon emissions will continue at their current rate. We are okay with the locked in global warming which is already going to occur because of increasing CO2 from 250 to 400 ppm in the past couple of hundred years. Now let's look at how much CO2 a tree can sequester: A tree can absorb as much as 48 pounds of carbon dioxide per year and can sequester 1 ton of carbon dioxide by the time it reaches 40 years old.Tree Facts How let's look at how much CO2 is being put into the atmosphere annually: Global emissions of carbon dioxide from the combustion of fossil fuels will reach 36 billion tonnes for the year 2013. http://cdiac.ornl.gov/GCP/carbonbudget/2013/ One tonne is a metric ton, or a 1000 kilograms, or 2,240 pounds. A ton is an imperial ton, or 2000 pounds. Just so we get our math right, it's useful to work this out. Let's start with the reductive assumption that we are willing to wait 40 years for a tree to remove a ton (or 0.907 tonnes). This would require 39.7 billion trees to be planted every year forever. That's just over 5.4 trees per person, every year, forever. Let's round that up to 40 billion to make the next bits of math easier. How much space is required for mature trees? Turns out that close spacing is about 10 meters. Spacing - Site Analysis - Planting - Landscape plants - Edward F. Gilman - UF/IFAS 40 billion trees could be put with once again simplistic assumptions, on a surface area 2,000 kilometres by 2,000 kilometres (1,250 miles by 1,250 miles). That's 4 million square kilometres or 1.56 million square miles.  That's 5.7 times the size of Texas, 9.5 times the size of California. That's 40% of the USA, 23% of Russia, 52% of Australia, or 42% of China. That's 2.7% of the total Earth's surface. That means if every part of the Earth's surface could support trees, we would run out of Earth to plant trees on in 37 years. Given that perhaps 50% of the Earth's surface can actually grow trees, it's really more like 19 years. Just to keep the CO2 levels of the atmosphere from rising. Oh, and with trees every 10 meters, there would be no room for cities, farms,  roads, factories, golf courses, etc. And assuming we didn't want to wait 40 years before today's CO2 emissions were sequestered, we'd probably have to plant 40 years worth of trees this year. Except we can't because there isn't enough room for them. Stop burning fossil fuels scenario Let's look at this with different assumptions: We stop emitting any additional CO2 by burning fossil fuels. We target 250 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere, the amount prior to the industrial revolution.We are now at about 400 ppm, so we have added 150 ppm to the atmosphere. How much is that? To convert from ppm to gigatonne of carbon, the conversion tables of the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center advise that 1 part per million of atmospheric CO2 is equivalent to 2.13 Gigatonnes CarbonComparing CO2 emissions to CO2 levels That means that 150 ppm is equal to 319.5 gigatonnes of CO2, or to use the same measure as the earlier calculation and to smooth it out a bit, 320 billion tonnes. The math is straightforward then. You would have to plant 353 billion trees, about 50 for each person, covering an area of 35 million square kilometres or 13,672 square miles, or about 24% of the total Earth's surface.
