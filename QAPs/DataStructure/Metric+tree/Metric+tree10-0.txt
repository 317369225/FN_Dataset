How does Yandex MatrixNet work?
MatrixNet uses' an oblivious' tree or 'matrix' instead of a regular decision tree as a weak learner. Its loss function is constructed directly from the target (search quality) metrics. See details here http://romip.ru/russir2009/slide... http://www.ashmanov.com/arc/sear... And MatrixNet is highly parallelizable at run-time http://prezi.com/w9lyxnmem_4c/ba...
