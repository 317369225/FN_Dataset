Are some people better than others?
Welcome to the Game of Better-Than. The spirit of the question is that we all really want to be better than those around us. Why? Because we feel that being better makes us more deserving of the things (and people) that we really want. I'm sorry, but there is no "better". There is only "better at". Being a better member of society doesn't make you a better person overall. It just makes you more valuable to society. Case in point: "Bob is a doctor (and a firefighter on the weekends) who gives half his salary to charity." Perhaps Bob is also a chauvinist and bigot who feels that, because he does such wonderful things professionally, that he deserves the opportunity to lord his superiority over other people in his spare time. Perhaps he's a smug jerk who everyone finds intolerable. Maybe he really is that awesome, but spends all of his social time describing bacterialogical minutia to the point that everyone around him is drooling with boredom. Maybe he's James Bond and is awesome at everything, but uses his skills to support a corrupt and socially damaging government. There is no "overall better". You have to take a person's entire existence into account, and that's impossible. My perspective is that, if there truly are people who are overall better than those around them, that a prerequisite to that superiority is that they not expect such a thing to be recognized.
