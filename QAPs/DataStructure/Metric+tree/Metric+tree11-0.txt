How many trees do I need to plant to offset the carbon dioxide released in a flight?
For a New York to Berlin flight, you would need to plant 11, 21 or 213 trees, depending on how you choose to consider the sequestration capacity of planted trees. If you go with a robust tree planting carbon offset program, 11 is most likely. If you stick a seedling in a field and walk away, I'd go with 213. If you stick a seedling in a decent field, properly spaced in a place unlikely to be lumbered and walk away, I'd go with 21. Let's look at the numbers: A tree can absorb as much as 48 pounds of carbon dioxide per year and can sequester 1 ton of carbon dioxide by the time it reaches 40 years old.Tree Facts That's about 22 kg / yr or 455 kg / lifetime for the Imperial-challenged. The calculator assumes greenhouse gas emissions of ¼ [metric] tonne CO2 equivalent per hour flying. Aviation sources That's about 550 pounds for the Metric-challenged. Let's use 8h 30m. How much Co2-e will you be in debt for due to the flight? 8.5 hours x 550 kg = 4,675 kg (10,285 pounds) How many trees will you have to plant? That depends on whether you consider a single year carbon abatement (very conservative), half a tree lifetime of carbon abatement or a full 40 years of tree carbon abatement). Many programs follow up on planted trees and certify that they are sequestering the full carbon lifetime, including planting new trees if a tree dies for any reason. Assuming one year load: 4,675 kg / 22 kg = 213 trees (rounding up) Assuming median life: 4,675 kg / 228 kg = 21 trees (rounding up) Assuming full life: 4,675 kg / 455 kg = 11 trees (rounding up) Updated 36w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Turan Birol
