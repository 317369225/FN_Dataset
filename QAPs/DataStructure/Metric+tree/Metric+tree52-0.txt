Is saying an area has high biodiversity the same as saying it has high species diversity?
No. Species richness is just the simplest way of quantifying biodiversity. Species diversity metrics, like the Shannon-Wiener index and the Simpson index, also account for the evenness of species composition based on abundance data. But the identity of the species, and their similarities and differences from one another, are still ignored. For example, say you have Forest A which has five maple species and no other tree species. Forest B has a maple, an oak, a hickory, a beech, and a cherry. Which has more tree species? Well, they both have five. But Forest B has higher taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity - its tree species represent more of the evolutionary diversity of plants. Imagine that Forest 1 which has a lot of fast-growing, sun-loving trees with light wood and large, thin leaves. Forest 2 has both fast-growing trees and shade-tolerant trees with denser wood and thicker leaves. We might say that Forest 2 has more functional diversity - its species represent a greater variety of ecophysiological strategies available to plants. Simply counting the number of species also ignores the extent of genetic diversity within each species. And if the place that we're talking about has lots of spatial heterogeneity, we can also talk about alpha, beta, and gamma diversity - but that's an answer to a different question.
