What are the advantages of different classification algorithms?
Instance based learning techniques (e.g. nearest neighbor) Take up a lot of memory to run (storing all the instances) Work well for a small number of dimensions, but not a high number of dimensions Decision trees and divide-and-conquer algorithms May overfit data May get stuck in local minima so need ensembles to help reduce the variance SVM Picking/finding the right kernel can be a challenge Results/output are incomprehensible No standardized way for dealing with multi-class problems; fundamentally a binary classifier Neural networks Picking the correct topology is difficult Training takes a long time/requires a lot of data Output/issues are incomprehensible Logistic regression Limited expressive power Fundamentally a binary classifier Hard to make incremental Naive Bayes Very simple representation doesn't allow for rich hypotheses Assumption of independence of attributes is too constraining (although, see Domingos' paper on why it's not so bad) Bayes networks/Graphical models Determining the topology of dependence is difficult
