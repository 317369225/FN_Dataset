How do I know whether I am ready for a data science interview?
Data Science is a relatively new field and every company has its own interpretation of what it is. In short, you need to know some statistics, some machine learning, some programming, some SQL, some signal processing, some RDBMS, some packages (Weka, R etc) , some python/Java, some data mining, some feature engineering, some cloud computing, some Hadoop...and so on...Best idea is to carefully read what the job specifically needs and then prepare accordingly. Interestingly, I met a Data Scientist on a thread on Quora and he was struggling to understand the concept of cross-validation to optimize parameters. That's the dark side of 'some' knowledge in every field :-) Edit 20 Questions to Detect Fake Data Scientists Updated 2w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Jose Miguel Arrieta
