What are some remarkable facts about Switzerland?
Switzerland is a 'Third World Country'. This fact might come as a shock to some. Currently, proper definition that stands for the outdated term 'Third World', comes from the nature of a country's political alignment during the Cold War; when 'Third World' was used to define the non-aligned countries. Switzerland was one among them. First World: the United States, United Kingdom and its allies. Second World: the Soviet Union, China, and their allies. Third World: neutral and non-aligned countries. During that time, most of the poor African countries were non-aligned; thus, the term later became popular, perhaps through internet pop-culture, and came to be known (Correctly or Incorrectly) for defining the backward economic status of a nation. Dumbed down to, First World: Rich countries. Third World: Poor countries. Source: Third World (Wikipedia)
