When will it be too late to stop Global Warming?
Politically directed efforts will always be 'too little too late'. The only way of averting such phenomenon is to do as much as possible, as soon as possible, until there is clear evidence that enough has been done. Political efforts are always restricted to futile 'ball chasing'. --------- As far as specifics: climatologists chose a target of <2 degrees, as they were of the opinion that any increase over this would have unpredictable consequences. The latest data indicate that the rate of warming has occurred twice as fast as expected and as a consequence, a 2 degree rise is inevitable. In which case: our future is unpredictable.
