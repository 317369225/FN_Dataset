How many trees do I need to plant to offset the carbon dioxide released in a flight?
I love trees. I've planted 50 or more. But this carbon sequestration stuff is mostly flim-flam. When you burn million-year-old petroleum, you increase the CO2 in the air. When you plant 1000 trees and let them grow to age 40, you remove this CO2. Then the trees die and rot, releasing the CO2 again. If your trees live to be 200, you hold the CO2 longer, but it still gets released. The climate change people are (or should be) thinking in terms of centuries. One solution would be to cart all the used newspapers and plastic to someplace flat that needs a mountain, and cover it up for 1000 years. Or pump CO2 from power plants deep into the earth. Or maybe we could convince plankton and clams to build more calcium carbonate shells. Or let the CO2 build up, and distribute rings of particles in orbit around the earth like Saturn to block sunlight. Trees are nice, but they won't stop global warming.
