Are some people better than others?
Yes.  But that comes with a giant asterisk (*).  What is "better"?  See, the thing is, there rarely are objective(ish) standards on "better".  We normally are left with a set of subjective standards that come down to personal values or the objective standards that are rooted in utility.  If utility makes a person better, then every individual surgeon is better than every individual farmer.  But is the collection of surgeons better than the collection of farmers?  Probably not.  Farmers are more important to the actual existence of society than surgeons.  We've gotten by for a long time without surgeons, but civilization would literally end without farming.  So, this then presents us with conflicting answers.  Inevitably we're left with individuals making their subjective judgements on matters.  We are left with an obvious reason why in free nations, individuals are all equal before the law because all judgements on inequality are, frankly, not good for society.  You're free to judge people how you see fit, but there is just no way to say categorically who's better and who's worse.
