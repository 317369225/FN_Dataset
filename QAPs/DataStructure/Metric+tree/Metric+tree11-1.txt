How many trees do I need to plant to offset the carbon dioxide released in a flight?
I will give you another figure. The average annual carbon footprint for  North Americans is 20 tons. This figure can vary considerably depending on what  you count as a person's contribution, such as how you count CO2 indirectly  produced by consuming things, but it is a working figure. 1,000 trees will  absorb this much CO2 each year, so if you plant 1,000 trees, you have  effectively offset your carbon footprint for life. A good way to plant 1,000  trees is through Trees for the Future, an organization that plants 1,000 for  $100. Link: http://www.treesforthefuture.org/
