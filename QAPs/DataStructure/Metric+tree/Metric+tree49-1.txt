What are the key characteristics of Norwegian culture?
Obsession with equality. If somebody is rich or successful (except in sports or music) it is regarded as an offence, and s/he is expected to behave and have the self esteem like everyone else. Failure to comply with this causes envy. The antropologist Thomas Hylland Eriksen has written some books about the subject. Here sone essays: "From obsessive egalitarianism to pluralist universalism?
