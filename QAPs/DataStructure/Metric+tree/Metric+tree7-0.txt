Why hasn't the United States switched to the metric system?
There's also the political angle, too, believe it or not. I clearly remember that when I was in junior high (early 80s), there was a push of some sort to accentuate the metric system over the imperial system -- emphasis on metric measurements in textbooks and teaching, even outside of science and math. What I found interesting was that we kids at the time were pretty much fine with this; heck, multiplying and dividing by powers of ten was a lot easier than slogging through much-more-confusing conversions within the imperial system.Â  But our parents and grandparents (in the aggregate) were apparently furious, even branding the new emphasis "un-American" and (I kid you not) "Communist!" So while there were (and remain) substantial economic reasons holding back a U.S. movement towards the metric system, I believe we shouldn't overlook the strength of tradition and, yes, American pride in our stubborn adherence to what most would agree is a depressingly inferior measurement system.
