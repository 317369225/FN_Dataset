How should I prepare for statistics questions for a data science interview?
The best way to succeed in an interview would be to demonstrate your knowledge and how it can be used to solve business questions.  In addition to knowing theory be ready to talk applications.  Here are some common business situations that all statisticians should know of 1.  The business wants to take advantage of all its data and build a super predictive model.  What should they know about using a large feature space?  In the case of OLS how does the variance of the error term change with the number of predictors?  What is the curse of high dimensionality?  What is the computational complexity of algorithm X in terms of the number of features.  What dimensionality reductions can be used for preprocessing the data? 2.  The business wants to build a classifier.  They do something really easy and find that they correctly predict the labels 99% of the time.  What might be wrong here? 3.  The business is surprised to see that variable X is considered a significant predictor of Y whereas Z is not.  How might this happen? 4.  As the business scales they are starting to see diminishing returns from their resources.  How can you model this? 5.  In time series modeling how can we deal with multiple types of seasonality like weekly and yearly seasonality?  What if there is a major change to the business and the seasonality changes? 6.  The business wants to do an ab test where a third party organization will randomly assign people to a control group or an experiment group.  How can you verify that the assignment truly was random?
