Do trees really reduce air pollution levels of VOCs, NO2 and other compounds in addition to reducing levels of CO2?
Trees also generate electrostatic charges that attract dust and pollutant particles from the air.Â  They also generate oxygen during the day when the sun is shining, so the more trees you have, the better the air quality is.
