Why hasn't the United States switched to the metric system?
My conspiracy theory: Food companies. All quarts would have to become liters, which is a little more than a quart. All pounds would have to become a half-kilo, 1.1 pounds. All food deliveries would have to INCREASE in size to go metric, and the price would be expected NOT to increase. If a liter was a little LESS than a quart, or a half-kilo a little LESS than a pound, we would have switched years ago since that would be a source of instant profit while pretending to be civic-minded. The soda companies are the only exception, having made the jump with the Two-liter bottle.  Since the soda is so cheap to produce, the costs savings afforded by the internationally modeled 2L bottle versus the classic 64 oz glass bottles dwarfed the costs incurred from addition of extra product. Alcohol also made the jump, since 750mL is less than the traditional 1/5 of a gallon (757mL) unit of alcohol sale. It's all economics.
