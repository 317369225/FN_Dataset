What are the top 10 data mining or machine learning algorithms?
This paper (Page on cornell.edu) reports an empirical comparison of 10 supervised learning algorithms on a large scale basis using 8 performance criteria. These include "SVMs, neural nets, logistic regression, naive bayes, memory-based learning, random forests, decision trees, bagged trees, boosted trees, and boosted stumps on eleven binary classification problems using a variety of performance metrics: accuracy, F-score, Lift, ROC Area, average precision, precision/recall break-even point, squared error, and cross-entropy". The brief observation is: The empirical results are surprising. To preview: prior to calibration, bagged trees, random forests, and neural nets give the best average performance across all eight metrics and eleven test problems. Boosted trees, however, are best if we restrict attention to the six metrics that do not require probabilities. After calibration with Plattâ€™s Method, boosted trees predict better probabilities than all other methods and move into first place overall.
