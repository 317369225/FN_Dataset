What are some Machine Learning algorithms that you should always have a strong understanding of, and why?
I think machine learning covers very wide areas - supervised machine learning, semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, ... All these paradigms are very different from one another. I would say the best way to start would be to pick up some basic book on machine learning, and go over the basic machine learning techniques discussed there. For instance, Tom Mitchell's book on Machine Learning covers the following topics: - Decision Trees - Artificial Neural Networks - Bayesian Learning - k-Nearest Neighbours - Locally Weighted Regression - First-Order Inductive Learning - Q learning The list misses few important ones like - Logistic Regression - Support Vector Machines - Random Forests - k-means - EM algorithm among others. So it is a good idea to check out several books to get a list of basic ML algorithms. Here is a list of (not necessarily important or basic) machine learning algorithms : List of machine learning algorithms Why is learning these algorithms important? Because most other algorithms use intuitions and concepts developed in the basic algorithms. Once you have some understanding of these algorithms, go on to more complex state-of-the-art algorithms, in areas like probabilistic inference or deep learning. There is no definite answer to which algorithm is the best or most important to learn. If at all that question needs to be answered, I think the most important ones are the most basic algorithms, because they help you understand the unfamiliar algorithms better.
