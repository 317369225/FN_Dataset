What are some Machine Learning algorithms that you should always have a strong understanding of, and why?
I think one needs to have a competent knowledge of 1-2 techniques in: Regression Classification Clustering Collaborative filtering (Bonus) Inference via graphical models Certainly, it's valuable and important to understand simple Linear regression . Gradient descent is important because it underpins common classifier techniques like Logistic regression. Also: the Support vector machine.   I also strongly encourage people to have a working knowledge of Random forest classification / regression. It's inherently an ensemble method, effective, and has different properties from the above. K-means++ clustering is a must. For collaborative filtering, neighborhood methods are simple enough that almost don't deserve mention. I would try to understand latent factor models based on low-rank matrix factorization like the Singular value decomposition  or simple alternating least squares (http://yifanhu.net/PUB/cf.pdf) Bonus: MCMC methods (Markov chain Monte Carlo) for graphical models.
