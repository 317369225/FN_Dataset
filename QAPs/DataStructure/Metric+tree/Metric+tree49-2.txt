What are the key characteristics of Norwegian culture?
Weird food (dried, rotten, salted, boiled to death, hung or otherwise bashed to pieces of mostly fish or sheep), quirky characters (watch the documentary on Norway called "Fl√•klypa Grand Prix", or in English "Pinchcliff Grand Prix"), cold and wet country and people, small spaces and houses, bizarre folk music (drones on a violin, singing embracing the bad parts of jodeling, knife fights and jews harps. It's a blast!), too expensive to visit or live there, always jealous of Swedes and Danes for their coolness, terrible service all over, no sense of manufacture or of anything important (except, perhaps, Jarlsberg cheese), grumpy, self-centered, goody-two-shoes, weekend boozers, racist tendencies over national values poorly understood, horrible sense of history unless it's vikings, and, of course, they still all think they're bloody vikings. Oh, and I'm a Norwegian. :)
