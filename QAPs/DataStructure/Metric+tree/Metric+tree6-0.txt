Are 80% bounce from Google PPC and 60% bounce from Bing PPC normal?
Nope. Those campaigns are failing and are a bad sign that your campaigns are wasting money. Unless you are running campaigns for a massive spending account and the DM doesn't care about performance. Branding: People are clicking ads and leaving immediately. These people are not receiving a positive brand experience or they will forget the brand exists in 2 seconds. Branding campaigns should be about getting people to read a page and go into the site or watch a video/signup for a newsletter/like on facebook. Conversions: With high bounce rates, I doubt any of your conversion actions are getting people pushed into your sales funnel or for that matter, purchasing your service/product. My guess is that your paid campaigns are getting tons of clicks on mobile devices and driving unqualified traffic that are most likely accidental clicks.
