What makes Bangalore the best city to live in India?
I don't know about universally applicable metrics, but here is why I prefer it over other tier 1 cities in India. Bangalore v/s All tier 1 cities - weather. Bangalore beats all of them by a huge margin on this one. Bangalore v/s Mumbai - less poverty, squalor, overcrowding, insanely high-pressure life, etc. More trees. Less expensive - don't need to live 50km from the centre of the city to be able to afford a decent-sized apartment. Bangalore v/s Delhi - can be out alone after 8pm without fear of getting raped (and I'm not even a woman!). People are nicer in general - you never hear of toll-booth attendants getting shot at. Bangalore v/s Hyderabad - There is at least some semblance of people following traffic rules on Bangalore roads. 24-hour English and Hindi FM channels. Cosmopolitan. Bangalore v/s Chennai - I already mentioned weather in the overall comparison, but will put this again here because Chennai weather really sucks. Also, Bangalore is somehow "cooler" (not in the weather sense) than Chennai, though its hard to pinpoint why. Bangalore v/s Kolkata - not stuck in the 19th century. No communism. Bangalore v/s Pune - Not suffering from an inferiority complex of Big Brother Mumbai. Also, more cosmopolitan.
