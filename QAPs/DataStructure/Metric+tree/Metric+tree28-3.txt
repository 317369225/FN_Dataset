What are some remarkable facts about Switzerland?
This may serve as an example of the various defense systems mentioned by Meenakshhi Mishra in her answer : The above images are a part of the 10-km long defensive line of dragon's teeth that was built during the second world war between Bassins and Prangins, in the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland. These can be found all over Switzerland, but predominantly in the border areas. Their purpose was to stop tank invasions. A total of around 3000 concrete blocks, each weighing around 9 tons were installed. Seen the shape somewhere eh? Well, the name of this defense system is the Toblerone Line. The line has been left to nature since its construction, and it was decided to keep these concrete blocks to make a hiking trail along. As an appendage I would like to add that the logo of Toblerone was inspired by the shape of the Matterhorn mountain in the Alps: Also, the logo contains a hidden bear, symbolizing the place(Bern) of its origin : Sources : Toblerone Matterhorn Updated 141w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
