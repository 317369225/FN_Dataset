What are good ways to learn how to solve Marathon problems on top coder?
The best way to learn how to solve problems is, well, to go solve some problems :-) On a serious note, the approach is similar to learning to solve Algo problems: practice makes perfect. Look at the problem, try to write a stub of a solution, think about how you can improve it. Remember that Marathons are about optimizing the solution, not getting it "correct" from the first try. Once you feel you can't do any better, read the forum thread with discussion of approaches taken by the top competitors (and the editorial, if one is available). Think about what they tried and how you could repeat this; try to implement this. If you're stuck, look at the actual submissions. Extract typical ideas and try to figure out how you can apply them to new problems. You can also read Cookbook forums http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/... , especially the recipes related to Marathons, and try to learn that.
