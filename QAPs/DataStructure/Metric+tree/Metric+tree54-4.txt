When will it be too late to stop Global Warming?
Nobody knows. The extra energy (heat) trapped in the atmosphere will most likely act in quite unpredictable ways on the enormously complex climate systems of Earth. The notion that climate will change in a slow, progressive manner in which humanity has time to adapt is not necessarily true. As I understand it, most climate scientists believe that 'tipping points' may exist, that would exert a domino effect on each other, and that would quite rapidly flip our current 'holocene' era climate into something quite different. Such a scenario would make mass human survival unlikely in the longer term, and extinction possible. Nobody really knows for sure which tipping points (should they come to pass) would happen first, nor when/how rapidly. They could take centuries, or mere decades. I have seen it illustrated as holding a microphone closer and closer to a speaker. You can't tell exactly where the feedback will suddenly kick in until you move the microphone too close (ie too late to prevent the runaway effects). In light of the above, the precautionary principle suggests early action.....which we are not seeing.
