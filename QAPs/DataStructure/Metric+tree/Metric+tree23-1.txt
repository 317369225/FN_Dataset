What are the things Civil Engineers know while others don't?
Every structure you see around you - be it a residential building, a shopping mall, or the tallest tower you've ever beheld - is slowly sinking into the ground below - little by little, every day of the year.  (Unless of course the structure is built on pure sand - in which case, this phenomenon is absent)   That happens because of a process called Consolidation. It basically means the time-dependent volume change of soil due to a constant load applied on it. When the load is initially applied (i.e, the structure is just constructed), an immediate settlement occurs - this is due the distortion of the soil without any volume change. With the passage of time, the water trapped in between the voids in the soil starts to escape, and this results in a decrease of the overall volume. It is not a quick process because the voids in a clayey soil are not that well inter-connected, so it takes a long time for the trapped water to find its way out. So the next time you set foot anywhere, remember that your weight is adding some extra load on the building, making it sink into the ground somewhat more than it would have done without you. Scary thought, I know! But not to worry too much. All structures are constructed in a way so as to limit the maximum settlement to very small allowable limits - mostly of the order of a few millimeters even after thousands of years of sustained loading.
