The College and University Experience: What is it like to major in physics?
It is both stressful and exhilarating.   You need a strong will to overcome several pervasive sources of frustration   As I see it, the stress and frustration arises mainly from three sources: (a) Seemingly intractable Physics problem sets. (b) Incompetent instructors (profs or graduate teaching assistants). The latter may also be  belittling, dismissive, outright racist and/ or misogynistic. Unfortunately, Physics attracts (and tolerates?) a lot of social misfits. The pressure to "publish or perish" also leads to a lot of instructors who treat teaching undergrads as an unpleasant chore. (c) Weird data from improperly maintained equipment. A lot of Physics departments suffer from budget cuts, which results in inadequate lab equipment, especially for undergrad labs.   If you have gotten through a Physics program without ever having to deal with ONE of these sources of frustration, consider yourself amazingly blessed.   Amidst the many moments of frustration are times you experience the sheer joy of being a part of the Physics community   The exhilaration comes from (a) Finally getting the hang of concepts (at least at your required level), thereby gaining a glimpse into the elegant laws that underlie a wide range of phenomena. (b) Being able to make significant inroads into challenging problems. (c) Having inspiring instructors and peers, getting to talk with well-known AND approachable Physicists who may work in, or visit, your department. If you are competent and lucky, you'll get to work on a research project at your school or in a Summer progam at another school or research lab. This opens up a wider community of Physicists for you. You may even get to attend a Physics conference to present your findings! (d) Getting good data from equipment that works reliably. (e) Getting to enjoy some good Physics jokes, and anecdotes about famous Physicists.   ********************************************************************************************   Advice to prospective Physics majors   I really don't have much to add to the wonderful responses on this thread, other than to give some advice to prospective Physics majors. (I know, there are other Quora threads on that issue, but let me belabor the point and beat my favorite drum again, in the hope of salvaging one more soul before it's too late.) Take a LOT of math. I would suggest taking college level Calculus I, and possibly II,  in high school, and using your freshman year to get done with Calc III, Ordinary Differential Equations, and Partial Differential Equations. Then in your sophomore year take Real Analysis, Complex Analysis, Abstract Algebra and Special Functions (or Math Methods). In fact, if Theoretical Physics is even marginally on your list of interests, I strongly suggest that you double major in Physics and Math.   A few words of caution   The sources of stress I have mentioned can really get one down. In some cases they may lead to serious repurcussions that need extended psychiatric intervention. It is very easy to get completely wrapped up in a very narrow outlook and neglect your physical and emotional health. Do not let this happen! Updated 129w ago • View Upvotes
