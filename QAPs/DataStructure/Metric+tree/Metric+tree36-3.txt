Are some people better than others?
Good question!  Obviously some people have more utility than others.  So if we define 'better' as being useful to the community, then this is an easy Yes.  In fact, some individuals are such a detriment to society at large that we incarcerate them so they can't cause any further harm. But you can actually use this same argument to devastating effect on anyone.  Take a tree.  It never commits murder, never does drugs, never insults anyone, it just peacefully reverses environmental damage for its entire life.  Does this mean the tree is better than people? Ultimately, the value of people has to be measured against their effect on other people.  Your hypothetical Joe Public might be a pimple on the butt of society, but maybe he is the world to his daughter, who (for the sake of the argument) he actually puts in the effort to raise as best as possible given his circumstances. Of course, if we use my metric, that means that reality television stars are worth something after all.  Maybe I need to change my position....
