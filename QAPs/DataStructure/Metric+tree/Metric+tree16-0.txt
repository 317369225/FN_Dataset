I'm doing a math project in high school requiring data regression. I'm using a gaussian function to make my SSres a minimum. What data should I get?
*some human metrics: length, weight, shoe size, number of bench-presses, running-distance time,... * some metrics in nature: tree size (by type), leaf size, liters a cows produces per day, number of rabbit droppings,... * the distribution of 12 six sided dice results Actually, the sum of N random and independent variables always leads to a normal distribution (if N increases). So many things in life that have a lot of contribution factors will have a normal distribution. because of that, if you repeat an experiment a lot of times, and compute the mean, the mean will have a normal distribution. So... plenty of choice
