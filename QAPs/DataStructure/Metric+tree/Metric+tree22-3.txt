What should US travelers know about visiting Bangalore?
Bangalore is a cool, almost a cosmopolitan city with lots of global exposure.  So you should generally find people here more understanding, helpful and in-sync with the rest of the world. There's nothing like a specific do's and dont's.  The only thing which I want to caution you about is the traffic.  It can be pretty bad during the peak office hours.  And with the metro train construction happening in several places, you'll find roads dug up, further adding to the traffic bottlenecks. The other thing is shopping.  You'll definitely find interesting things to buy.  Its a good practice to have your Indian friends take you out for shopping, as they can help you choose better stuff.  They might also lend a good hand if bargaining is required (this is again not specific to B'lore.  Its true for any new place, esp. when you don't know the language.) Water: In all likelihood, you will be served bottled water in your workplace, hotel etc. So you shouldn't be worrying too much about this.  Bottled water is easily available in most places, so you should be fine. Crime:  Is minimal.  Its not normal that people get mugged on the roads or otherwise.  For all practical reasons, you will not experience any. The city has its fair share of parks and small palaces, but the cities around Bangalore are even more interesting.  If you have time, definitely visit Mysore, Belur, Hallabed, Shravanabelagola (all within 200 Kms from Bangalore).  These are fantastic places to catch some glorious examples of ancient Indian architecture.  If you'd like to wander into the wild, then try Bandipur Tiger reserve or Kabini.
