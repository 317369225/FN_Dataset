If you could make an army using 1 ton of any animals for a battle to the death, what would your army look like?
I'm going to go for an all-Australian selection here. A menagerie of doom from my home country! First up: some shock and awe. Five cassowaries (around 300kg) will charge the opposition. They might look like mini Ostriches in drag but these guys are probably the closest living thing to a velociraptor. Five of these running at you at over 30mph would be a terrifying sight. Meanwhile close air support would come in the form of ten wedge tail eagles (around 35kg) would be soaring above ready to finish off any injured foes or take out any smaller ones. Actually, who knows what they'd do, as they're known to attack paragliders and pretty much anything: Meanwhile, the armour is rolling in: salt-water crocodiles. A single crocodile can weigh over 1,000kg so let's just go for two 'smaller' ones at around 250kg. (these are obviously African crocodiles, but Australian ones are just as big!) Let's look at our infantry now: the inland taipan. Only the most poisonous snake in the world: Fifty of these bad boys weigh in at around 150kg. To mix the tactics up a bit, let's add some cane toads. Not native but unfortunately now a plague in Northern Australia. Not very scary? Nope. But these toads would be on a suicide mission as they are incredibly poisonous when eaten and can even kill crocodiles: 25 of these add up to an even 25kg. That leaves me with around 5kg... so why not finish the army off with 20-odd funnel web spiders: (No wonder so many people are too scared to visit Australia!)
