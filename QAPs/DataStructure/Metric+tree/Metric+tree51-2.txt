Do trees really reduce air pollution levels of VOCs, NO2 and other compounds in addition to reducing levels of CO2?
While growing to maturity a tree will have a positive uptake of C02, however, strictly speaking, the literature argues that a mature forest may approach or become "carbon neutral" such that it intakes as much C02 as it produces. While a mature forest serves many other functions than C02 uptake, it could still be considered an unstable sink; for risk of fire and/or mountain pine beetle infestation. While a more reliable carbon sink may be in the treated hardwood of your computer desk.  If mature trees were harvested by proper selective harvesting techniques, it may actually assist in overall carbon uptake of the forest. Just a quick alternative look at things, its foolish to argue one side of a two sided story.  :D
