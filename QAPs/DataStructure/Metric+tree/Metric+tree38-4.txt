What is the most annoying thing about the USA to a person from another country?
Food, and the culture of food. Huge portions, huge people. Food everywhere, all the time. Excessive sweets that are described as "sinful" for all the chocolate they have. Supersizing. Sweetened drinks, syrups, sauces, breads, etc. Fruit that is large and perfect and available year-round, but has almost no flavor. The year I moved back to America (with my British wife, who pointed out most of these food things) I gained 15 pounds, because I finished the portions put in front of me.
