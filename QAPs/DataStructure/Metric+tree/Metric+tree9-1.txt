How should I prepare for statistics questions for a data science interview?
A candidate who really impresses me would be knowledgeable in: Statistics: Confidence intervals, parameter estimation, p-value, hypothesis testing. Common metrics: Engagement / retention rate, conversion, similar products / duplicates matching, how to measure them. Useful cost functions: Log-loss, other entopy-based, DCG/NDCG, etc. Basic machine learning: Classification / regression / ranking problems, overfitting, convex optimization, trees, ensembles, boosting, collaborative filtering, etc. Tools: R / Python / Mathematica, Weka & similar. Code up something yourself would help too, Kaggle is very useful. Mathematics and complexities: Eigenvectors, singular values, PCA, LDA, Gibbs Sampling, Information Bottleneck et. al. Real-life numbers and intuition: Expected user behavior, reasonable ranges for user signup / retention rate, session length / count, registered / unregistered users, deep / top-level engagement, spam rate, complaint rate, ads efficiency.
