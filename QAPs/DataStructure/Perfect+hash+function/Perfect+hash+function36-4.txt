How do giant sites like Reddit verify that a username isn't taken so fast?
This is one of those difficult sounding things that are actually extremely easy for a computer to do. First of all, computers simply are incredibly fast. In fact, a computer could simply go through the list of 8 million usernames one by one and check the new name against all the names in the list. That will take maybe a tenth of a second! Who cares! But it's not necessary to have the computer do so much work if you organise things more cleverly. One very powerful trick that may be used is called hashing. The idea is to define a function that maps any string to some number between one and ten million. The number should look pretty much random, except that whenever you calculate the number for the same string, you get the same number. Then the next step is to make a list of lists. The list is 10 million entries long. The nth entry contains a list of all usernames that the function mapped to n. There will only be a few such strings! Here is an illustration. So when a user enters a new username, its hash number will be calculated quickly, and the new string is checked against the few other strings that happen to have the same number. Such a solution is in fact so fast as to be practically instantaneous.
