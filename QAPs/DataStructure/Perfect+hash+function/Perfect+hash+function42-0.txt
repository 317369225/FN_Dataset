What roles do probability and information theory play in cryptanalysis?
In cryptography, probability and information theory provide ways of assessing the strength of cryptographic functions. To provide a simple example, a good hash function should be hard to reverse: the probability of randomly guessing a hash pre-image should be as small as possible, given the hash output size. If it's any larger, the hash function is flawed. Information theory helps provide bounds and absolute limits on the strength of functions: for instance, Shannon used it to prove that perfect encryption is possible with a one-time pad. In practice, we normally use accepted cryptographic primitives because they have no known weaknesses and good statistical properties, not because they are rigorously proven to be unbreakable. However, if you want a look at some of the theory, and see how probabiliy helps define cryptography from the ground up, I recommend Goldreich's book "Foundations of Cryptography".
