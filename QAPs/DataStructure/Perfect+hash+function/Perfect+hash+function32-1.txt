What would be a good choice of bit vector size and number of hash functions to create a Bloom filter of 208 million URLs?
What rate of false positives are you willing to accept? Given the details you provided, you would get a false positive rate of approximately 0.0000726 assuming your hash functions are perfectly independent. If you are getting much higher false positive rates than this, you should choose better hash functions. In general if you use [math]k[/math] hash functions, hash [math]n[/math] items, and use [math]m[/math] bits, your false positive rate will be approximately [math]\left(1 - e^{-kn/m}\right)^k[/math], assuming perfect independence.
