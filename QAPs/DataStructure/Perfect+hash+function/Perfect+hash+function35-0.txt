What feature of C is used very often by experienced programmers but not so much by a newbie?
Here's a few: Bitfields. Cast to and from blobs of memory (because you're formatting some sort of contiguous mass of memory such as a network packet or database storage page). Variadic (varying number of arguments) functions (not named printf). Writing your own printf-ish thing to write to logs that has % specifiers for your own data structures (using variadic args API). Function pointers. goto (Greg Kemnitz's answer to Do we have any way to handle exceptions in C or C++ like we have in Java? ) Pointer arithmetic.
