As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?
I think CLRS is fine just the way it is, and the third edition is no less relevant today than it was five years ago. I also think consistency is valuable. For example, CLRS is the canonical reference on red-black trees, and it would be a shame if that section were removed, even if you agree with people who think the space is better spent on AVL trees. So I would strongly favour leaving the red-black trees in. (In contrast, Sedgewick's Algorithms is frustratingly inconsistent between editions, although I do love that textbook too.) Anyway, if consistency isn't really a concern, I'd advocate removing theÂ  "Advanced Data Structures" section (which doesn't really sound very "introductory") although B-trees and disjoint sets are useful so those chapters could be moved whereas Fibonacci heaps and van Emde Boas trees could simply be removed. For what to add, perhaps a chapter on string parsing, e.g., how to match regular expressions and context-free grammars. This is the most useful thing I can think of that is not covered in the third edition. I'd also add in Bloom filters, as someone else already suggested, which are pretty basic yet very useful practically. (I am rather fond of segment trees and binary indexed trees, personally, but uncertain of how useful they are outside of competitive programming.)
