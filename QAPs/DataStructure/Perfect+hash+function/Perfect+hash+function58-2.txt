What does it mean to add a "salt" to a password/hash?
Salting password hashes is a SecurityCounterMeasure against PasswordFileTheftAttack. i.e. If an Attacker manages to steal your PasswordFile then it makes it harder for them to decyrpt the passwords contained within it. It is just one of many SecurityCounterMeasure(s) however that are possible to protect against PasswordFileTheftAttack. If you are storing password hashes in your system though you should be salting them. See Michael Jameson - Google+ for how difficult it is to safely store passwords. Storing passwords safely should be left to specialist IdentityProvider companies. We need #FederatedAuthentication and we need it now!
