What feature of C is used very often by experienced programmers but not so much by a newbie?
Pointers - they are in fact a watershed. Once you know and understand them you newbie no more - you are junior :) Pointers are one most most powerful features of C language yes people dislike them as they tend to introduce errors if not handled correctly but they allow incredible flexibility in programming. Example Let's consider one of library functions from C standard library: qsort ( void * tab, size_t num, size_t size, int ( * comparator ) ( const void *, const void * ) ); It takes pointer to function, a function (comparator) that it tells qsort() how to sort. With that feature you can sort arbitrary objects taking advantage of very good algorithm instead making one yourself.
