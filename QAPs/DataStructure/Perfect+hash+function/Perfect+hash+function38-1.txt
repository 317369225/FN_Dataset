What is the best way to store passwords?
Like Jeff Hammerbacher said, a hash function is generally the best bet. The reason behind it is that hash functions like MD5 cannot be reversed. That is, if someone gains access to your database of usernames and password hashes, there is no straightforward method for them to "decrypt" the passwords. The only way for them to determine what password composed any given hash is for them to hash different combinations (commonly in a "dictionary attack" rather than "brute force" due to time constraints) and compare the hash from the database to the hash they just created. Just for clarity's sake, I want to add the following information about how a login system works when the passwords are hashed. Keep in mind that a hash will always be the same when it is created from the same content and (in a perfect system) every word's associated hash will be unique. The MD5 hash of "password" will always be "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99." The login process: A user registers at a website with the username Alice and the password "password." The website calculates the MD5 hash of the password and stores it alongside the username Alice in the database. Alice returns at a later date and tries to log in with the username Alice and the password "password." The website retrieves the hashed password for Alice from the database and now hashes the password she just entered. When the website compares the two hashes, it knows that the passwords are the same, and it lets her log in.
