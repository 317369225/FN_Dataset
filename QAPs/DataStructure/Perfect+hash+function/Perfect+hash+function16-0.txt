What is an easy way to understand perfect hashing? What practical problem does it solve or is it useful for?
Hash function is a function that maps items from a given domain into a smaller range. In prefect hash function, no two items in the domain are mapped into the same range (there are no collisions). Of course, that cannot be done if the number of the mapped items is larger than the range size. Note that if the mapped items are known in advance, you can construct mapping by a look up table that will be a perfect hash function. Hash functions are usually used for look up in Hash tablesÂ  or item identification. In such cases the less collisions you will have, the better performance you'll get and therefore Perfect hash function are desired. However, since it is desirable to use general hash function and not "tailored made ones" and due to the mapping size constraint, most of the times the hash function is not perfect. If you can control your range size, you can choose it so the probability of collision will be as low as you want. This way you will get a function that is very close to perfect hashing, paying in range size (which usually means paying in space).
