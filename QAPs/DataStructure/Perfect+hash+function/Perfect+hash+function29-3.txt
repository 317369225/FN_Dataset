Software Engineering:Â  What are the downsides of using my own hashing function instead of popular ones available?
Lots of things you don't look out for could go wrong. For example, you have a MAC use case but did you check the algorithm you designed for collisions or is it truly irreversible? These are just some of the few things you need to look out for. A simple additional inversion function in a well studied algorithm could affect it reversibility if done wrong. It is generally best to study algorithms that have been carefully vetted and reviewed for properties that make a hash good and secure.
