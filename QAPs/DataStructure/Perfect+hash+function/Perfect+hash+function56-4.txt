Could God prove his existence and how?
It would be pretty impossible to tell the difference between God and any alien powerful enough to make the question interesting.  If you're dealing with an entity that powerful, one that is possibly bent on deceiving you, it would be unwise to believe your own faculties.  The ONLY answer you ought to trust yourself to give is, "I can't tell."
