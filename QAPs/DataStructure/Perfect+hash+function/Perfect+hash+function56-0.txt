Could God prove his existence and how?
This is a very interesting question. Touches on Arther C. Clarke's axiom that, "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." How magic do you have to be to be considered God? For God to prove himself to me, personally, he'd have to convince me that he's capable of doing something supernatural. Something that defies the laws of physics such that no technology could be capable of doing it. But the problem is that the scope of our scientific knowledge is limited, so there would be no way for us to test whether something we thought was impossible was in fact impossible or just something we haven't figured out how to do yet. He could make a bush appear to burn without burning, or turn water into wine, or predict the future, or bring us back from the dead, but how would we know these were signs of divinity or, as you suggest, just a really advanced alien technology used to trick us? But... any alien technology would have to have some limitations, whereas God wouldn't. So I might be satisfied if a certain scope was reached. If "he" could tell me what I was thinking and turn back time and transport me somewhere and .... some other fun stuff, I might admit he was god. But this leads to another question. If we encountered an alien technology so advanced as to convince us it could possibly be god, would it matter whether or not it really was? It would be _almost_ all powerful and _almost_ all knowing and could certainly kick my ass. It would make sense to treat it as if it were, in fact, god.
