What is hashing in simple terms?
Maps are great way to provide uniqueness and in terms of time complexity O(1). Now Maps simply means mapping between two data types like, int ==> string string ==> list int ==> dict h(int,string) ==> tuple simple means a unique data type mapped to single or multiple data entries, [key] ==> [value] Now value can be multiple nodes linked together like linked list. "hash" in hash table is going to be unique key calculate. Consider it as "hash() <== key", Hash() is a function that is going to return you unique key for your hash table, provided that its fast.
