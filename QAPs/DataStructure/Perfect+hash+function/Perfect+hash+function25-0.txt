Imagine I had a large, strictly ordered set of sparse integer numbers, without duplicates. Can I write a function that returns the position in the set of a given number, without 'storing' the full list of numbers as part of the function?
A friend told me about an open source utility named gperfs http://www.gnu.org/software/gper... that creates the source code in C programming language for perfect hash functions over a set of values, given that set as an input. Whatever the programming language, the algorithm implemented by gperf is, in theory, the ideal answer to my original question.
