Does Flame imply SHA-1 is no-longer secure?
Yes. I agree with the premise of the question - that if an attack on a cryptographic algorithm is proven in the wild, it should be the final nail in the coffin (the previous nail was in 2004 when this was shown to be theoretically possible). This event, should it be independently proven, should signal vendors to get off SHA-1 and standardize on the next crypto hash function. Note - it must have taken an enormous amount of compute time to build a hash that perfectly collided. At this time, the only threat is the US government (NSA resources no doubt). Here we have the US government creating a massive piece of software weaponry impersonating Microsoft in order to attack Iran and stave off Israel from bombing Iran during a US election year. Wow. Just... wow. Updated 190w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
