Could God prove his existence and how?
Assuming we're talking about an omnipotent omniscient God, of course he/she/it could. Being Omnipotent, God could prove his/her/its existence easily. Omnipotence has its perks, after all. In fact, that's what Omnipotent means: any Omnipotent being could do anything. The only limit on Omnipotence is that it's incapable of creating a circumstance that proves it's not Omnipotent, since that would mean that its not Omnipotent. Now, the real question is this: why would an omnipotent being bother provingÂ  its existence? I can't think of anything that would matter less to a being that could do literally anything.
