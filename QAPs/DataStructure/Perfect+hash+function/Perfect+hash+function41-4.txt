Could advanced machine learning put data scientists out of the business?
Yes and no. Will new solutions do away with tasks most data scientists focus on today. The answer is yes. The reason is that although everybody talks about the sexy algorithm they worked on. The reality is that ETL, data normalization, programming map-reduce, etc. are the tasks most data scientist spend the bulk of their day doing. Me too data scientists that just run some basic algorithms will be out of a job thanks to solutions that will automate these tedious activities. However if the question is can a computer substitute a data scientist, then the answer is not for many years to come.
