Is it 16 too late to become cracker/hacker?
It's never too late to learn. You're 16, you can learn anything else beside hackong such as the piano, languages. If I were you, I would learn programming. Python is a good language to start with. Once you know a programming language it's not hard to learn another one like java, C, etc. algorithm are the same, only the syntax, usage, some technicalities are different. Probably it takes at least 1 year to be good at coding, learn the theory behind it, write codes everyday, learn what recursion is, sorting algorithm (important for brute force), etc. I would try to get computer certification such as CCNA, comptia A+, and get a real life experience in working at computer and networking. Learn how build a website is also good, if you wanna hack a website, learn how to build first. Then go to college study computer science. Learn the malicious side once you have a strong background in programming. Because you will learn how to write exploits and such thing.
