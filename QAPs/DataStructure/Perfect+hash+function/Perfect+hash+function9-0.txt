What are the best jokes on the Rahul Gandhi interview with Arnab Goswami?
I wonder what transpired that Rahul agreed to give the interview. If he wanted to prove himself so much, he could have gone to Roadies. Credits : Sreeraj Jayarajan Credits : Ramesh Srivats  This interview involving a potential Prime Minister really cleared my thoughts. I WANT ARNAB AS PM. Arnab: Is it true Rahul, that when it comes to you, the nation wants to "no"Credits for following : All India Bakchod This interview is so unproductive that they might as well call it Koffee With Arnab. Rahul Gandhi's answers makes Manmohan Singh's silence look good. Rahul  Gandhi is so repetitive that Rahul Gandhi is so repetitive that Rahul  Gandhi is so repetitive that Rahul Gandhi is so repetitive that Arnab: Why did the chicken cross the road?  Rahul: Gujarat government aided chicken in crossing the road.We need to bring RTI into chickens Arnab: What came first, chicken or the egg?  Rahul: The safety of chickens is what concerns me most. I want to change the poultry. Rahul Gandhi walks into bar and lowers it.All jokes apart, I'll give him credit for not walking away from interview like NaMo. Not everyone is a good orator.
