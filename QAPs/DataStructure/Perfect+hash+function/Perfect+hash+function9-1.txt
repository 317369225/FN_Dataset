What are the best jokes on the Rahul Gandhi interview with Arnab Goswami?
1. Arnab Goswami : What is difference between 2002 and 1984 riots? Rahul Gandhi : (If only I could have learnt subtraction!) ........... # Answer Key : 18 riots! but to his ill-fate he had no life-line as in KBC! 2. Rahul might have better remained silent than to speak and remove all our doubts. Story is ---- Rahul Gandhi was angry over himself, because he missed a trivial answer to an easy question thinking that TV interview is like IIT-JEE so even though question appears trivial, it's answer must be complicated --- Q. How are 1984 and 2002 riots different? Answer that was going on his mind --- A. Because timeline (dates) of these riots are different.Â  But due to nervousness and JEE analogy he answered something else. 3. 4. Joke 1 is from Bhuvi-Jain's comment. :) Joke 3 is from Faking News - Timeline Photos | Facebook
