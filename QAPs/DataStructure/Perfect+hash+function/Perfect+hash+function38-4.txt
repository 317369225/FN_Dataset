What is the best way to store passwords?
LastPass is very popular nowadays.  But I happen to share Max's concern about eventual system breach.  The system (and many such systems) are effectively taking a "probably good enough" cryptographic hash, and running that hash 200 times or 500 times or 2,000 times in sequence.  Better than nothing, but I still don't fully trust it. Post-Its or under-keyboard notes are potentially even worse.  (I sometimes joke in my lecture(s) that the Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) character in 1990's film Ghost was, in fact, killed for the computer password written down in his wallet.  But it's only half a joke.) On those occasions when I absolutely must remember something, and can't fully trust my own memory 100% (perhaps it's too long, or too complex, or I will need it at some far-future point), I will sometimes write down 'indirect references' on a piece of paper -- maybe the original code-phrase is "Manchurian Howitzer," so I will write "Mountainous Asia Big-Bore" or some similar -- enough for me to remember, but (probably) beyond most attackers' capacities to brute-force or dictionary-attack.  Your mileage may vary.
