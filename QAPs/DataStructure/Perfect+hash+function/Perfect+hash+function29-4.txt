Software Engineering:Â  What are the downsides of using my own hashing function instead of popular ones available?
You mentioned security so this post is looking at hashing from that angle. First of all, some of the greatest minds in the world have spent a considerable amount of time creating and proving these algorithms. The likelihood that you have come up with something truly novel is exceedingly small, it is much more likely that you fell into a common trap. Secondly, in the odd chance you did make a groundbreaking discovery, how will you get the world to use your algorithm? Even good inventions are ignored without backing. Finally, any deterministic algorithm can be "cracked" given enough time, the goal is to make it not worth the effort.
