Why do Hash Tables need to store the Key of a record?
Without the key, we can't access the hash directly. And, because hash tables are designed exactly for that reason: "A hash table is used when you need to access elements by using key, and you can identify a useful key value. Each item in the hash table has a key/value pair. The key is used to access the items in the collection."
