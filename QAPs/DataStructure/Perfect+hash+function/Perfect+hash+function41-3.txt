Could advanced machine learning put data scientists out of the business?
To the contrary. Rather, advances in ML tend to increase the demand for data scientists, as it increases the value of their work. In general, solving a ML problem is not that interesting, and very effective techniques have been around for decades. Recent advances make many of these techniques possible on larger and larger data sets, and in some cases improve the model itself. But then, as today, the hard part is rarely solving a well formed problem. Rather, the problem is to formulate your real world problem as one that can be solved by a known algorithm. This turns out to be quite challenging, and will be so for quite a while. A general optimization solver, that could take a arbitrary problem and solve it using the best techniques possible, would truly be an achievement. Alas, such a technology is nowhere near the market. Even then I doubt it would do any more damage to the career prospects of data scientists than scripting languages did to programmers. Which is to say, none at all.
