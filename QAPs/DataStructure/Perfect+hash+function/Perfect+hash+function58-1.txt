What does it mean to add a "salt" to a password/hash?
"Salting" is a security practice of adding random data (a "salt") to a password before hashing it and storing the hashed value.  The salt is stored in plaintext. It's common to use assumed one-way functions (typically a hash function) for storing passwords, because you never need to recover the encrypted password - you only need to verify that a candidate password is correct. This fact - that hashes are deterministic - presents a problem with unsalted password strings.  In the simplest case, if two people chose the same password, then I can tell that their passwords are the same.  More importantly, if I am trying to crack a large number of hashed unsalted passwords, any result could hit any of the passwords. By salting, a successful attack can be applied to only one password at a time, and it is difficult to tell whether two passwords (with different salts) are identical.
