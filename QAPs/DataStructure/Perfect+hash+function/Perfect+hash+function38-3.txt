What is the best way to store passwords?
I posted number of options in my answer @ Nilesh Raghuvanshi's answer to What are the best free tools for individuals to keep passwords? . I'm sure one of those will definitely fit your need. You can ignore cloud based and paper based options as you are not interested in those. There are number of good options like Secure Password (Secure Passwords v2.0). As mentioned by creator "Secure Passwords is available as a web app that you can use from any browser on any device, as a Chrome extension, as an Android App that you can sideload or you can download the single-page app and save it to your Dropbox for offline use." As suggested by few others here, KeePass is obviously one of the best options. Being open source is icing on cake as one can read the code and make sure that there are no backdoors. You can always sync using tools like Dropbox. They also have app available for Android and iOS which is good enough. 1Password is another contender which comes at a price but have loyal followers who swear by it.
