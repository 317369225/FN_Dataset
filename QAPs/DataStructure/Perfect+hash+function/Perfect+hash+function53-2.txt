Is cryptography an art or a science?
Take a Rubik's cube and write a plaintext message of limited letters, one  on each colored square,that means M in english. Now jumble it as randomly as you please,letters in the current order mean M' ,which may be null (no meaning). M' is encryption of M. (DIY : did the entropy increase?) Decrypting it back to it's original state (M'->M,with/out knowing M) may take,combinatorics to Hamiltonian paths to group theory  to elliptic curves (?) to graph theory to number theory (to divisibility theorems) to stochastic calculus, depending on your approach. Take your pick. Updated 21w ago • View Upvotes
