How do giant sites like Reddit verify that a username isn't taken so fast?
The way Reddit does this is likely via a form of index. Most databases store data in rows - just like rows of a table (in fact, they're called tables for just that reason). You can then assign an index to each column if you so desire. The database will keep the index up to date whenever the rows in the table are changed. The index is a quick look-up mechanism; given a value, it tells you which rows contain that value. Usually indexes are built on a datastructure called a B+-tree. The details aren't tremendously important, but they're an optimized form of a binary tree. And by design, they store data in a sorted fashion, automatically, as a consequence of the data structure itself. Inside the binary tree (going from the root to the leaves), each branch splits the data in two, with the left side referring to half of the data in the index, and the right side containing the other half. These trees try to stay balanced when you insert or delete things from them, so that they always have about half of the items in each branch further towards the leaves. So if you have 1,000,000 items, the first branch splits them into 500,000 items. The next splits it into 250,000 items. The next splits it into 125,000 items. Then 62,500 items. Then 31,250. Then 15,625. Then 7,812. Then ~3,906. Then 1,953. Then 976. Then 488. Then 244. Then 122. Then 61. Then 30. Then 15... So that's 16 checks, not 1,000,000, to get down to 15 things to look at. You could go further; most B+-trees don't - the leaf will contain a list of items. For most of these you don't even need to check the entire string either; just as many characters to see if it's less than, greater than or equal to it. Even better... There's a quicker way still - you can use a Bloom filter. This is a probabilistic hashing structure which never returns false negatives. So if the username isn't taken, you can perform a single check and know immediately most of the time. It does occasionally have false positives, which means you might still need to do some work to know for sure in some cases.
