Where can I find effective hash functions for strings?
Well, the hashing algorithm's effiectivenss depends on your sample input. For simple input I personally prefer the Bernstein Hash. In case you're using Java, use hashCode() to get the hash value. If you want to have a good insight into the thing, I recommend you to have a look at http://eternallyconfuzzled.com/t...
