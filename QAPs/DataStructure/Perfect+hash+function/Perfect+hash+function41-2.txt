Could advanced machine learning put data scientists out of the business?
I agree with Shane and Jack The idea that there are machine learning algorithm that can be fed raw unstructured data and derive a predictive model is a fallacy. A lot of companies these days use the A.I. buzzword to draw attention. There is no one size fits all algorithm that can solve any problem. In any data science problem common sense and intuition are key to confront results with what you expect. You need to choose the right models that will fit the problem. This part is not trivial at all and requires deep understanding of the ML algorithms: the implementation, the outputs, the uncertainty on these outputs, the caveats of the algorithms. Most of ML algorithms are similar to (smart) combinatorics and it is easy to end up overfitting if you did not filter and normalize the data you  fed to the ML algorithm. It is important to do an exploratory analysis first to create "clean" variables (e.g in finance use returns instead of spot price). Then these  variables can be used in a ML algorithm to capture complex non linear interactions. So I think that, on the contrary, advanced machine learning will increase the need for data scientists.
