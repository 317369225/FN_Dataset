Is cryptography an art or a science?
Your view on this will depend substantially on whether you think that mathematics is an art or a science. Inventing new systems is an art. But proving that those systems have particular security properties is probably more of a science. Now when I say "science", I am not saying that a great deal of creativity doesn't go into the process. Creativity is an important part of science. But the result (security theorems, etc) are things that can then be analyzed by anyone with sufficient training. It's attributes are not in the eye of the beholder.
