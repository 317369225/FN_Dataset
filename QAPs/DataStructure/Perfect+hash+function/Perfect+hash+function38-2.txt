What is the best way to store passwords?
I'm here also recommending LastPass https://lastpass.com/ to store all your passwords. - It's on the cloud, you have access from their web interface, from browser extension, mobile and desktop application; - It also stores locally your password, so you don't need to be connected to have access to your passwords; - LastPass doesn't have access to your passwords, they are encrypted on the client before being transferred and stored in their servers; - It creates a unique password for each site. You just need to remember your master password; - It allows you to white-list from which country/ies you use LastPass, so it reduces the number of "bad guys" attempting to access your database; - You can (shall) use a two-factor authentication like Google Authenticator or, even better "Authy" https://www.authy.com/, to avoid someone guessing your master password; - You are not limited to store passwords only: I use it to store credit card numbers, PIN codes, PGP keys, confidential documents; - LastPass keeps you informed when a website suffered any attack and credentials where stolen: it proposes you to change your password; - LastPass helps you running a security check to tell you if your passwords are weak. It asks for your authorization before executing any scan and it happens in front of you; - You can also share your password/note/attachment with someone else which is also using LastPass (even the free version). You can decide if the person can see the password or only click on the URL and get the password field automatically filled with it; FYI, I'm premium user (paid) since Sept/2009, I have hundreds of passwords stored on it, and I'm very happy with their service. I don't have any other relationship with them.
