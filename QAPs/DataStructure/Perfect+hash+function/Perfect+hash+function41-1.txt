Could advanced machine learning put data scientists out of the business?
I'll take the route of classical data mining to provide a solution to this problem: A pattern is considered to be interesting if it is easily understood by humans, valid on new or test data with some degree of certainty, potentially useful, novel, or if it validates some hypothesis that a user seeks to confirm (Piatetsky-Shapiro, 1991) I think the underlined section of this statement is why this process and many other exploratory processes will continue to be human driven. I recall my education in operations research where we were taught that at the end of the day even if you minimize f(X) s.t. C(X)= Y where f(X) is a utility function and C(X) is a set of constraints, the solution may not be 'useful' - for example imagine if you told your manager that the best cheapest way to transport 100,000 kg of coal is to not mine it in the first place! I guess the overall statement is, modelling has been and will always be human driven when the problem is non-trivial.
