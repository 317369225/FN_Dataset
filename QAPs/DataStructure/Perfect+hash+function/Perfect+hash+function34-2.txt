How would you implement a hash table in C from scratch?
Implementing a hash table requires understanding of 1. What would be the type of input pair (key,val) hashed into that table ? like whether value will be alphabet, string, alphanumeric , same for key. 2. What would be the hash function / shuffling function ? 3. What would be the size of the hash table , or rather will the hash table grow dynamically or statically ? 4. What would be the type of hashing needed based on ease of implementation , hash table collision rate accepted,  time available , complexity ? 5. Ability to scale for high number of operation on your database 6. Would there be a need for a multi-key hash table or single unique key would identify the value in the hash table ? 7. Thread Safety ? After having thought of these basic questions,  one can start to implement it , sample codes are available online.
