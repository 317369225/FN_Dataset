Why do Hash Tables need to store the Key of a record?
The other answers already make it clear why you have to store the key if you are using the hash table as an associative array: whenever two keys collide (have the same hash value), you need to be able to tell which of the associated values belongs to which key. However,Â  hash tables can also be used in other ways. For example, take a look at Bloom filters. This is an example of a hash table that does not store the keys of inserted items. However, this design choice then implies that the data structure cannot give you exact answers about its contents.
