What is the highest level of encryption present?
The highest level of encryption today and maybe also the future is the one-time pad (OTP) is a type of encryption that is impossible to crack if used correctly. Each bit or character from the plaintext is encrypted by a modular addition with a bit or character from a secret random key (or pad) of the same length as the plaintext, resulting in a ciphertext. If the key is truly random, at least as long as the plaintext, never reused in whole or part, and kept secret, the ciphertext will be impossible to decrypt or break without knowing the key.It has also been proven that any cipher with the perfect secrecy  property must use keys with effectively the same requirements as OTP  keys.However, practical problems have prevented one-time pads from being widely used. - copied from One-time pad This technique is mathematically proofed the safest algorithm. But in practice (mostly) useless. In practice the European equivalent of the American NIST (which has lost a lot of reputation during Snowden/NSA Affaire) called ENISA recommends the following algorithms (available here Algorithms, Key Sizes and Parameters Report): Public-key cryptography Elliptic Curve Cryptography is recommended: Transactions -> 160 bit, mid-term storage -> 256 bit, long-term storage -> 512 bit RSA still can be used, recommendations are: legacy systems only -> key size smaller than 3072, mid-term storage -> minimum 3072 (!), long-term storage -> 15360 (corresponds to 256 bit key symmetric encryption) Symmetric-key cryptography Block Cipher -> AES 128, long-term AES 256 bit Stream Ciphers -> Rabbit + Snow 3G (RC4 to be removed) Cryptographic hash function Hash Function -> SHA-256, long-term SHA-512 (Camellia, SHA-3 and Whirlpool are discussed)
