In a realistic Trie implementation, how is a node stored compactly and efficiently?
You may try doub-array trie or its variants if you are dealing with a large alphabet (e.g., CJK character set). It is fast and space efficient in look-up, though a bit slow in updating. It does not support returning all the child node of a trie node though.
