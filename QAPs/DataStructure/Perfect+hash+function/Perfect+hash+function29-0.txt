Software Engineering:  What are the downsides of using my own hashing function instead of popular ones available?
Because, an insane amount of research went into making the current hash functions as secure as possible, and anything you come up on your own will likely be cracked almost instantly.   The first rule of secure programming is don't get creative, making your own system, not until you are a real expert. Sorry, real-life programming isn't like movies or commercials. The products of makeshift, inexperienced creativity are *ALWAYS* worse than using the standard, tried-and true stuff even if the standard stuff is less than perfect.
