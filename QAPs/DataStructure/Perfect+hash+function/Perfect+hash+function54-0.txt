Is it 16 too late to become cracker/hacker?
No, it's never to late to do anything except obtain perfect pitch and even that appears to be breaking down now. As far as what to learn, it all depends on what you want to do. Knowing how to program and having a CS degree-level of knowledge about how software systems work will help with *all* of them. Exploit discovery and development: learn how to program, learn assembly language extremely well and learn how to use tools like Ollydbg(OllyDbg v1.10) and Ida(Page on hex-rays.com), get a CS degree. Network penetration: learn network protocols (CCNA information to start), cryptography(see below), network pen-testing tools such as Penetration Testing Software, Pen Testing Security | Metasploit and get lots of IT experience. Break cryptosystems/make your own: learn all of the number theory you can, learn existing systems and how they work. Specifically Block cipher mode of operation, Block ciphers, Public-key cryptography, Cryptographic hash function. And of course you should definitely only use your powers for good.
