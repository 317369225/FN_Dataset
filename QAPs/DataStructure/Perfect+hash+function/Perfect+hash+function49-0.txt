How do I generate an unique id using sha algorithm in an application?
Sha1 or SHA is a hashing algorithm used to store information in an encrypted form, which is usually used for storing passwords in a database or testing the integrity of a file. You can run any data such as a string through a hash function like SHA1 or MD5 and get an encoded output. Example: Plaintext: cat SHA1: 9d989e8d27dc9e0ec3389fc855f142c3d40f0c50 The thing about hashes it that you cannot decrypt or reverse the process used to derive the hash in the first place which makes it perfect to store passwords in a database. Encode a string using a hashing algorithm and store in the database and during authentication, hash the user input and compare it to the hash stored in the database. To generate a unique id, you need not use a hashing algorithm, you can use any pseudo-random number generator and append it to the current time(or any varying value) to always end up with a unique id. Purely using a hashing function to generate a unique id might work for some time but you can always run the risk of collisions i.e different sets of data yielding the same hash output. That's because the combinations that can be encoded is infinite but the hash output is in a limited ASCII range which can result in a collision.
