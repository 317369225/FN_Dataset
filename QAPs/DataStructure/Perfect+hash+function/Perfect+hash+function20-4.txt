Does Facebook know my password?
As others have pointed out, because of the hashing technique, they don't know your password. To be more precise, i'd like to rephrase it: Facebook are unable to get at an user's password ad-hoc. However! during sign-on, unless the password hashing/etc happens in the user's browser (/app/etc.), Facebook DO RECEIVE your password in a readable form. And it's their promise to you, as part of their dedication to keeping your account secure (people's accounts are their main asset at the end of the day), not to store it in a data store (or log it or what have you), but only to use it for quickly computing the hash, to be used for authentication, and, as soon as that's calculated, erasing all memory arrays containing your plain text password.
