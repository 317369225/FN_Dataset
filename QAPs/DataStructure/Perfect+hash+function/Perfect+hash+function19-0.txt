How do I use switch case if there are three letters inside the case?
You mean 3 letters as in an array of characters? I guess you could cast them in one go to an integer (since an integer is a 4 byte value, at least when it's a 32bit int), then switch on that. Though you'd need to pad your array with \0 chars to ensure such cast doesn't read "random" data beyond your array. Though be careful, such casting depends on if your system is BigEnding or LittleEnding. And if you have to do all sorts of run-time alterations to accommodate these differences I'd guess you're going to loose any form of performance gain between a switch and a chain of normal ifs.
