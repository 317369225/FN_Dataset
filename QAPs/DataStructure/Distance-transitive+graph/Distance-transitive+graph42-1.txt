How can I learn to think faster while solving algorithmic/coding problems? How can I better visualize and solve the coding problems?
Most obvious advice - practice a lot; this works same way in most kind of activities, not only in competitive programming. Obviously practicing will improve your coding speed, and you mentioned that you want to improve it. I am not sure what you mean by think faster, probably improving your overall level will also make you thinking faster. But still practice will make you faster anyway - you will learn which part of problem you should focus on, how to approach some kind of problems, what math.model is usually hidden behind some kind of stories (like cities and roads are often about graphs) and so on. When you have some experience in problem solving - it often happens that after reading a problem you think I saw similar task before, I guess I have to try same approach this time. And the more you practice - the more often you will face this situation.
