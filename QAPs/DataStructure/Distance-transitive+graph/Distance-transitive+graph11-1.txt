I waste a lot of time on Facebook instead of focusing on my goals. What should I do?
Same issue, my friend. However, I have some pieces of advice for you. Delete the phone app: seriously, you'll never understand its effect unless you remove the whole app and try to maintain self-discipline. It's okay to open the web Facebook at the beginning, but because you will find it boring and not as addictive as the app, you may get bored by time. Unfollow as many people as you need: this is a great technique to reduce Facebook usage. When I got so sick of reading and scrolling down my newsfeed, a friend suggested this. And guess what? I unfollowed most of my friends and only kept the pages/groups/people who offered me something truly useful. I unfollowed some of the closest people to my heart, but who were posting too many distracting things there. So, why not? Come to Quora more often: I am not in the Quora team or anything. I just noticed that when I started visiting Quora more often I realized how shallow Facebook gets. Quora offers me comments of intellectual people and people whom I'll never meet but will always carry respect for. However, don't visit it to the point of addicting it; otherwise we would be going to point zero :) Follow the Pomodoro Technique if you want to achieve something during the day: give yourself rewards on Facebook every 20 minutes of studying/working. This way you will achieve both. Good luck!
