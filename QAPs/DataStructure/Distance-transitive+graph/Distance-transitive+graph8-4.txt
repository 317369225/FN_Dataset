If you replaced 2 train tracks with a dedicated 2 lane road and ran passenger buses would it be more efficient?
They've tried this on the disused Cambridge-St Ives lines in Cambridgeshire, England. It may not be more efficient for large numbers of people but is a sensible way to take cars off the road when the usage is relatively sparse (relative to the ideal number of people using a two or three carriage train, that is). Also, since the route is guided, the bus speeds are more-or-less constant and thus more efficient. http://www.sibp.co.uk/guidedbusw...
