What are some common errors involving the incorrect use of words in the English language?
The phrase "begging the question." It actually means ... to argue in a circle. As in: "The Bible is true because it is God's word, and we know God exists because the Bible tells us so." But it seems to mean ... to beg for the question. As in: "Reverend Jones never answered Professor Smith's argument, which begs for the question: why not?"Many people, in the second example, would have said: "...which begs the question..." That is incorrect. "Begs for the question" would have been right. To keep the correct meaning in mind, think of it as "begging of the question for the answer" and you will see it as a circular argument. That is one of the most commonly misused terms ... though misusing "literally" is arguably the most misused. As you noted in the question. Thanks for the A2A, Nihal Mohammed.
