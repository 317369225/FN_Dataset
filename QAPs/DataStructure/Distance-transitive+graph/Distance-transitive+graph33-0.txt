How can I improve my algorithmic coding skills?
Here are a few things you can try Thoroughly look into what is implemented in c++ stl. Implement all the algorithms you've learnt in as many ways as possible. As you said implementation is your main problem, you might be messing up with the corner cases. Be careful with them. Try to solve codeforces contest archives. Spend some time on each of them and then look into the editorials. This will help a lot if you plan to take ACM ICPC. You can also try out topcoder algorithm tutorials and contests. You may want to go through the 2nd half of my answer on a different question: Sai Teja Pratap's answer to Where can I find difficult algorithm/data structure problems? Here are a few  useful sites for practicing algorithmic programming. HackerRank (previously www.interviewstreet.com ) No-so-easy questions , most of them are challenging. Solving one question requires multiple concepts. Companies come for hiring via codesprints in interviewstreet Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ)  Use www.problemclassifier.appspot.com to search for problems of a concept and then solve the questions Contains more than 10K questions has questions of all levels. Codechef Contains questions of all levels. There will be monthly contests. http://algomuse.appspot.com/archive They conduct non-programming contests once a while (may be around 3 months) Moderate and difficult questions. http://community.topcoder.com/tc Very good community. High quality tutorials. There will around 2 contests per month. Contains questions of all levels(archives). http://www.codeforces.com (similar to topcoder) projecteuler.net Contains many easy questions in the beginning. But the questions after the 200th are challenging. One can start with this (questions numbered <100) and move on to other sites once he/she gets confidence. Updated 121w ago • View Upvotes
