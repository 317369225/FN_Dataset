What are the good ways to learn Data Structures?
Read,read and read. Understanding the purpose of each structures(advantages it brings in optimizing some particular data oriented function) and where it can be applied is essential. Literature is just about everywhere Some examples: Coursera, Open course wares(MIT, Stanford,Harvard). Search for introductory class to anyone of these ,  just pick one and follow it holistically.  Then try and implement those DS in an HL-Programming language. Again , most  important point is to know why and where is a particular data structure most suitable and learning to compare with other DS analytically. Cheers.
