Which are the top blogs to follow to explore about algorithms and data structures?
Check out Algorithms Repository - contains mashup of information from many online resources about algorithms of different categories. It has articles, description, implementation and videos etc. Some of the common algorithms -: 1. Searching and sorting algorithms - Sorting algorithms include Quicksort , Merge sort, Heapsort, Bubble sort,Insertion sort, Radix sort. Other imp soting algorithms are Topological sort, Counting sort, Shell sort Important searching algorithms include breadth/ depth first  search, binary search etc. A comprehensive list can be found here 2. Dynamic Programming -- To name a few DP problems, Longest Common Subsequence problem, Knapsack, travelling salesman problem etc. A list of dynamic  programming algorithms can be found here. 3. Graph algorithms -- Important graph algorithms are Dijkstra, Prim, Kruskal, Bellman-Ford. A comprehensive list can be found here. There are many brilliant online sources which are contributing to this repository such as http://apps.topcoder.com/wiki/di... http://www.personal.kent.edu, http://www.geeksforgeeks.org, Wikipedia, http://www.algolist.net, http://www.cprogramming.com, http://www.codingunit.com, Website of Bruno R. Preiss, Stoimen's Web Log, The Object Oriented Programming Web, FSU Computer Science, http://www.codeproject.com, Code n Learn and many other resources. Thanks :)
