If you replaced 2 train tracks with a dedicated 2 lane road and ran passenger buses would it be more efficient?
The city of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada where I grew up built dedicated transit lanes for our bussing system citing increased versatility over rail in that it would be easier to adjust the capacity per demand (by adding / removing buses) as compared to trains (adding/removing trains or even cars to a train is time consuming and complex due to rail switching). The plan would have worked well, I think, except that in places the dedicated lanes ran through the city core and were subject to traffic light controlling. This created congestion through the system which led to inefficiencies. Further limitations to door placement (two entry/exit points vs. several) and vehicle size (narrower, shorter) made the system inefficient. Answering the question more directly, though: assuming that we're using today's conventional models of trains and buses, a train should always be more efficient as the ratio of of passenger area / vehicle mechanics will be greater. One could presumably design smaller trains or larger buses to overcome this inequality, I suppose.
