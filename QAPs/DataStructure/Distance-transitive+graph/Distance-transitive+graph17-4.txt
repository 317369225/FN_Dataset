How can Data Structure and Algorithms be just studied in an easy way?
Though existing answers provide proper link, What I want to say is  Mathematical  "Visualization" of things  happening around you is very much important. (Ask this Question on Quora  :) :) ) Why do we do Rote learning, Just because we are not able to visualize. Never miss any basic concept while learning. Learn Mathematics, don't read theory too much,  start with competitive programming ,  Coding is also an important part,  Theory without practical is overkilling. Once you start programming then you will automatically understand which data structure to use. Even for a small program keep corner cases in Mind. Basic example: Add Two Number/Multiply two number, May give Overflow so Program accordingly. So it is not one day process, Takes time but once you grab it, Will Enjoy This Combination  (Maths/Programming/DS/Algo)
