How might self-driving cars determine the most efficient route?
Current  cars do not do such routing, but they will do so in the future.   In  general, they will use systems very similar to the systems people use  today, such as Waze. Tools  like Waze, Google Navigation and many others have a combination of maps  of all road segments combined with historical data on the typical  travel time over those segments at various times of day.   This is  combined with live traffic data indicating what the travel time on the  segments is at the present time.  More sophisticated systems will  predict what the travel time will be when you get to more distant  segments of your route. From  that, there are well understood algorithms in graph  theory which can  take a complex "weighted graph" (ie. a set of road segments and the  amount of time it takes to traverse them) and find the optimal route  through them. Optimal  routes might mean shortest travel time.  These systems also factor in  total distance (which can reduce other costs such as fuel and  maintenance) and may in the future factor in the uncertainty of the  travel time predictions and other factors.  More sophisticated systems  will have good estimates for transitions between segments, timing of  traffic lights, and multi-segment travel times. Users  might also specify if they want the fastest, most efficient or most  scenic route.  Some occupants of robocars may wish a slower route with  fewer turns or fewer stops, so they can focus on work or even sleep.
