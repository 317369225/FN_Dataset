Why is the slope of the line tangent to a point on a distance vs time graph equal to the instantaneous speed at that point?
Because that's the definition of speed. Speed is the ratio of distance over time. Slope on a distance vs. time graph is also the ratio of distance over time. By the transitive property of equality, speed and slope on a distance/time graph are the same thing. Similarly, average speed is the ratio of the total distance you travelled to the total amount of time you took to do it. That is, the ratio of the difference between your starting and ending distances and starting and ending times. Which is the slop of the line connecting the starting and ending points.
