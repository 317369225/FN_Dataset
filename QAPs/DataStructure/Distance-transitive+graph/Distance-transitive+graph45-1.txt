What are the most learner-friendly resources for learning about algorithms?
Online Resources: Google Code's edu initiative is worth a look: http://code.google.com/edu/algor... I have to admit I haven't used it, as I prefer books over online material. But nothing beats David Martin's http://sorting-algorithms.com Apart from that, you always have helpful folks over at Wikipedia to rely on: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sor... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis... ** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis... And the StackOverflow community has developed pretty good collection of algorithms Q&A over the years: http://stackoverflow.com/search?... (Wikipedia article on Hash Tables is very well written and makes for a good introductory text on the subject. Though, for a much more comprehensive understanding you'd need to buy books: My suggestions below). Update: I dug deep into my bookmarks, and unearthed these gems: Algorithmist: http://www.algorithmist.com/inde... A free Advanced Algorithms book: http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazi... ----------------------------------------------------------------- Books: I think the best book on the market as far as algorithms are concerned is by far CLRS -- Introduction to Algorithms[1]. You should definitely try that one. I got started by learning/implementing algorithms in C first, then moved on to Java a few years back, and use Java to date as it has better error-checking, automated memory management and is almost as fast as C, and def faster than Python, PHP and the like. If you ask me, you should start with C too. It will help you develop your programming skills and help you understand data structures better [*]. I picked up Robert Lafore's Algorithms in Java[2], which is a very basic text on algorithms. I found Robert Sedgewick's work[3][4] to be more interesting and challenging to read. If you're looking for a C++ book, I can tell you that most of the guys at Uni preferred Adam Drozdek[5] and Mark Allen Weiss[6] (in that order). In fact, I have seen a lot of interviewers ask questions from Mark's book. [*] http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms... [1] http://www.amazon.com/Introducti... [2] http://www.amazon.com/Data-Struc...
