What are the hottest topics in applied math?
I did my PhD in Applied Math with a concentration in Quantum Computation and Information Theory. This is a very hot topic and having a degree in Applied Mathematics can be a big advantage when dealing with difficult problems in Physics. Topics like compressed sensing feature big in quantum state tomography, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The Fourier Transform has been used successfully to solve long-standing problems related to the stability of matter. Concentration of measure bounds have been instrumental in proving some of the most spectacular results in the theory of entanglement and quantum information in general. There is lots of work to be done to build fault tolerant quantum computers and Applied Math has a big role to play in this endeavor.
