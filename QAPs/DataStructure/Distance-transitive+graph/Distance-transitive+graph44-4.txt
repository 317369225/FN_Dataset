What do intelligent people do with their phones?
Here are some things I do with my phone: I set the default language to English I am not a native english speaker (I am from Brazil), so it is important for me to always keep practicing english so I don't forget. And by setting the default language of my phone to english I ensure that I will get daily contact with the language. I use apps for studying Anki is one of the most useful apps I've ever used. Having it in my phone helps me on studying frequently. Another great app for that purpose is the Kindle App (and readers for epub and pdf files), I use it when I don't have my kindle around and want to keep reading. And recently I started using Word Fireworks and I loved it. It is helping me a lot on learning Japanese. I listen to podcasts Listening to podcasts is awesome. it is one activity where I can learn new things, entertain myself, and(in some cases) practice my listening skills in a foreign language. I find transportation I do not own a car, but I live in a huge city (SÃ£o Paulo). So with my smartphone I can track buses (and avoid spending a lot of time at bus stops, specially on violent neighborhoods), and get taxis or Uber rides. It really saves me from a lot of trouble. I get in touch with my loved ones I hate having a conversation with someone on a chat (Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, etc) when I can talk to the person face to face. But sometimes I can't talk to my loved ones face to face, and in those cases WhatsApp (and similar apps) really help me. Being smart is worth nothing if I can talk to the ones I love. I use Quora I can, at basically any moment, read great questions and answers from people much smarter than me. This is great. I don't consider myself a very intelligent person. But I can use my phone to get smarter.
