What are the hottest topics in applied math?
I'm on thin ice here, but I would expect to see compressed sensing (CS) on such a list. Basically CS allows you to sample certain types of signals with a lower sampling rate than what was previously thought possible. In standard signal processing there is a fundamental lower limit (the Nyquist frequency) on the sampling frequency, after which you are not able to theoretically recreate your signal from the sampled version. However CS theory has shown that, under certain conditions, it is possible to perfectly recreate a signal sampled at sub-Nyquist frequency. This does not violate the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem because the theorem assumes that the samples are spaced by a fixed time interval (the sampling time). An area where CS has a lot of potential is in MRI. One of the disadvantages of MRI today is the time it takes to do a scan. The main reason for the high scan time is the number of samples needed. Thus by employing CS in MRI, you have the potential to speed up MRI scans, something that will have a significant impact on the medical imaging industry
