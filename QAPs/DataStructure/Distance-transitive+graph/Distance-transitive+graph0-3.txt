What are the top five facts everyone should know about oil exploration?
In this paper "Oil is Important" the figure "World energy comsumption" indicates a total (curve not shown) of 3 TW  in 1965 and 14 TW  in 2005. This is a growth factor of "only" about 14 within 40 years. In 1965 the internet did not yet exist. For the period from 2007 til 2030  (a little more than 20 years) it has been predicted, that - if current trends continue - the electricity consumption of just only our ICT infrastructures will grow by a factor of 30, reaching more than the energy consumption of the entire world to-day. See the graphics in the PATMOS call: http://fpl.org/CFP7/   Beause of such coming unffordable electricity cost we have two choices for the future:      1) much less computing and much less communication, or,      2) massively improved power-efficiency of ICT technologies and                applications. This point 2 is the subject of the PATMOS conference:  http://fpl.org/CFP7/ Best regards, Reiner
