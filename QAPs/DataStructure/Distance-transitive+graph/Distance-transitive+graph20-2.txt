Is it hard being a transgender parent?
I have 2 daughters who still call me Dad, even if we're all wearing matching outfits while dining out to celebrate both Mother's and Father's Days.  My wife of 29 years died suddenly 2 years ago,and I started transition  18 months ago. Neither of my kids were surprised at my    doing so, my younger daughter told me it was obvious to her that I would ultimately transition because I "was so  trans-parent". My other daughter coined the term  "Mawther" to describe my new-found status, she says she'd always thought of me as more motherly than fatherly and isn't all surprised at the outcome. Both their boyfriends seem to accept me with an attitude of "what else is new ?"and seem oblivious to my ever-changing appearance. I have been shunned by my surviving brother and sister and wouldn't be at all surprised if I found a Bible leaning against my front door someday.  Someday, I may have to answer to God if  He even bothers to ask the question.                             Peace  & Love,  Shelli Anne
