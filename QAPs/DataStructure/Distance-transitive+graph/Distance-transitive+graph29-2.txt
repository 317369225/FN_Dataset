Are there any good sites for learning algorithm/programming concepts every day (similar to the SAT question of the day)?
The obvious best way to learn programming is to just do it. Topcoder is a very good website where you can practice and learn programming. You also get to look at the code of best programmers in the world and learn from it. There are Match Editorials available for archived problems here http://apps.topcoder.com/wiki/di.... SPOJ is also a very good resource for learning programming/algorithms. To learn some theory you can refer to following links apart from regular textbooks. http://community.topcoder.com/tc... http://www.codechef.com/wiki/tut...
