Why don't airlines award loyalty points based on dollars spent rather than miles flown?
Besides Virgin, Southwest Airlines' restructured Rapid Rewards program also uses a points per dollar structure (http://www.southwest.com/rapidre...). But you are right that a majority of airlines offer points based on miles. I suspect there are a few reasons behind this: 1. Airline ticket price has frequent and wide fluctuations depending on the time and channel of purchase. By rewarding points for miles instead of dollars, airlines' loyalty programs essentially reward frequent travelers instead of highest payers. The former is more in the spirit of what an airline wants to capture as its "loyal customers". 2. Because of the many different channels possible for purchasing an airline ticket, it is simply easier to manage the program by looking at the miles flown. Information on miles flown, no matter where the ticket was purchased, is always known to the airline, making it easier to track and less error-prone. This is similar to My Coke Rewards that rewards consumers for each bottle purchased instead of price paid for each bottle. 3. It is also a tradition in the airline industry to report based on miles. For instance, for airline data in the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, you will notice that airlines do not report their dollar sales. Instead, they report their passenger miles flown. This traditional focus on miles could have driven the decision to reward points based on miles, making it more consistent with the rest of the business operation. 4. Possibly some copycat mentality is also at work here. When American Airlines launched its AAdvantage program, it used a mile-based structure. The other frequently flyer programs that came afterwards basically copied the structure.
