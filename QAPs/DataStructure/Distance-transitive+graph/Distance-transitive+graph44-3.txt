What do intelligent people do with their phones?
Thanks for the (ironic?) A2A, but I don't think there's a number of things intelligent people do on their phones that others don't. My father, a brilliant computer scientist who heads teams of PhDs, used a rickety old Nokia-esque phone till 2015 that only allowed for calling and messaging. It was a phone a colleague once described as "so bad, my maid wouldn't want it." The reasoning was simple- dad refused to be addicted to whatever it was that was sucking up everyone else's time and attention, hence freeing more time on his inscrutable work. He finally relented when we less-smart people peer-pressured him into it. Muahaha! Bigfoot uses it for conference calls, checking his stats, staying connected, observing the markets, playing Lumosity, and Peak. He stopped the last one when I kept beating him. Well, I hope nobody takes that previous sentence out of context. Me, I just use it to sniff out places to have lunch: Thanks, Bradley! It's not stunning, world-altering, mind-bending stuff- but I don't think intelligent people are like a different species.
