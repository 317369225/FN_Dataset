What's the significance of the cliché "six degrees of separation"?
The phrase "six degrees of Kevin Bacon" was a popular meme that flourished in the early 1990's.    It was based upon someone's noticing that the actor Kevin Bacon had appeared in so many movies,  with so many actors,  new and seasoned,   that one could scarcely find any film actor in Hollywood history of whom one could not claim to have had either worked with Bacon,  dated him,   or have had worked with someone who did.     It was observed that the link between Bacon and any film star...   never went beyond six linking persons,   or "six degrees of separation",  and one was invited to prove it for oneself by selecting any Hollywood film-star,  old or new,  then linking the degrees of separation that actor might have,  in terms of film appearances (or romantic dating),  with Kevin Bacon.   The remove never,  the originator of this meme promised,   went beyond six "degrees",  or six linking personnel. Nowadays the meaning of "six degrees of separation" has been enlarged to become applicable to any two people in the world.     For example,  one might say,  "I have never met Barack Obama personally,  but my aunt's hairdresser has;   therefore,  there are only three degrees of separation between me and the POTUS." Could it be mathematically proven that no more than six persons...   link you to any other human in this world? The "six degrees" phenomenon perhaps invites us to reflect on just how "small" the world is,  and getting smaller,  especially in the rise of social media.   It makes us reconsider just how powerful any one of us actually might be;   perhaps we each are more powerful than we'd supposed.   Perhaps we matter.
