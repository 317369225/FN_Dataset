Why is the slope of the line tangent to a point on a distance vs time graph equal to the instantaneous speed at that point?
Why is the slope of the line tangent to a point on a distance vs time graph equal to the instantaneous speed at that point? The slope of the line tangent to a point [math](x,f(x))[/math] on a graph is defined as a limit, assuming it exists, as follows:      [math]\lim\limits_{h\to0}\dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{(x+h)-x}[/math] Since in a distance vs time graph, [math]x[/math] is a time and [math]f(x)[/math] is a distance, the units of this slope are distance/time or speed. Speed is the derivative of distance with respect to time, [math]f'(x)\equiv\frac{\text{d}f}{\text{d}x}(x)[/math]. The instantaneous speed at some point is the value of this derivative at that point. The definition of the derivative at a point is equivalent to the slope of the tangent at that point. Average speed over a journey is total distance travelled divided by total time taken. This is trivially the slope of the line connecting start point to end point on a distance vs time graph. If you have some other definition of average speed you would have to show that was equivalent.
