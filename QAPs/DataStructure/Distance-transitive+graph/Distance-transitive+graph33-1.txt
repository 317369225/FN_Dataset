How can I improve my algorithmic coding skills?
I would strongly recommend Peking Online Judge (http://poj.org/) There are thousands of algorithmic problems, and you can submit your code. You can immediately check if your solution is okay or not. Your code should 1) yield the correct output AND 2) fast enough. This resource was actually used in one of the Stanford classes (CS 97SI) to teach algorithmic coding skills. I learned so much from it. You can use the language of your choice, including C++. Also, you can gauge how difficult each problem is by reading the statistics - what percentage of submissions were correct, how many solved the problem, etc. I hope that helped!
