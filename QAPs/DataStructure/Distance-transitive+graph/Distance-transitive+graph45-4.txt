What are the most learner-friendly resources for learning about algorithms?
Just to add to Alex's answer,  you can refer to "Algorithm Design" by Kleinberg and Tardos. It is not encyclopaedic like Cormen et al but Kleinberg is a great teacher. Also, for an abstract view of how to wrap head around algorithms, "how to think about Algorithms" is really good. I personally find Sedgewick big and boring.  And Knuth well, climbing Everest will probably be easier. Updated 244w ago • View Upvotes
