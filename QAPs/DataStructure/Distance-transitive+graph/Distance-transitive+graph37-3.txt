How would a war between the US and China play out?
Remember "MAD" from the Cold War? Mutually Assured Destruction. Both China and the U.S. are nuclear powers. The "Cold War" was all about MAD.  An Operation Barbarossa: The invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany, won't happen, because the ICBMs and anti-satellite weapons, not to mention all the cyber/software weapons...will be launched. It is an old, but valid saying that: "Generals plan for and expect to fight the last war".  In a perverse way, it is fortunate that all the things I mention here (and more) will mean that China and the U.S. will never go to war the way that the Axis and the Allies did in World War II. MAD is the inevitable outcome.
