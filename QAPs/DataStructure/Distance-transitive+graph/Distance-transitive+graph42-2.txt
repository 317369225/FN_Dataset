How can I learn to think faster while solving algorithmic/coding problems? How can I better visualize and solve the coding problems?
Personally, I consider myself a deep thinker but not a fast thinker. I see no reason for understanding things fast. Computers do things fast - that is what we built them for. I am slow, but deep. It may take me days rather than hours, but I understand, not merely learn the headline facts. In design, speed in not a virtue. Take your time, understand - and then show your power. If I have truly grokked a subject, I flatten the opposition. But only because I took my time.
