Life Advice:Â  I'm 23 and I still dont know what I want to do in my life.?
Not knowing what to do with one's life and dreaming about earning a lot of money is not out of the ordinary. The fact though, that you are 23, and still are dreaming about making lots of money doesn't promise much. If you actually wanted to make lots of money you would already have taken up some kind of venture, no matter what, to achieve your goal. It seems you mainly like dreaming, like most people do. Furthermore: to be able to know what you want/need/have to do in your life you need to know who you are, and apparently you still don't have clue. The most efficient way to find out who you are is by being uncomfortable. By finding yourself in unknown situations, with unknown people at an unknown place. You'll know who you are real quickly. So pack up your bags and go somewhere to do something useful. It doesn't have to be impressive or financially profitable, it's just a mean to get some insights. You can fill out all kinds of questionnaires, but they will probe your self knowledge, which is obviously limited, so the answers won't reflect your true wishes and capabilities. Better get out there, and do some living and learning.
