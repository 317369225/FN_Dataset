What are the best and efficient ways to learn algorithms for beginners?
You want to learn something well?  Try to teach it.  Take your algorithm learning material, rewrite it into your own words in a way that someone unfamiliar with it can understand. Share code snippets and build an example.  Use it to showcase it and make it clear for someone to understand. The benefit will be that you've now published something others can use as reference, and since it's written in your own words, if you start to forget, you can return easily to your publication and refresh yourself (and perhaps add a bit more as you go). Especially useful if a lot of what you may do day in and day out doesn't necessarily have much to do with algorithms, but you want to stay fresh.

Something like this would both be a great learning tool as well as something fun to emulate to get a good understanding of various algorithms and to be able to visually see how they work.
