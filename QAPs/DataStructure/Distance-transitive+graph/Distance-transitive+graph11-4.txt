I waste a lot of time on Facebook instead of focusing on my goals. What should I do?
Acknowledge that spending time on FB is wasting time is the first step, since most people don't realize that (see Stop procrastinating by asking yourself this one simple question ). Now do something else, preferably one that does not involve using a computer/ smartphone. and set a timer for 1 hour, during which you are not allowed to chekck for FB updates. after an hour set a timer for 10 minutes and Facebook to your heart's content. Then repeate... with time the addictive need to check for updates will subside.
