What are some great online tools for creating presentations?
Thank you for asking, Amily! Here I've already mentioned some tips on how to create a successful presentation and apps that would help in it. So here are online tools for creating presentations I can suggest: It is better to work on presentation together. Use Google Slides. A good old PowerPoint alternative, use Google Slides to cooperate with your team members to create your presentation or ask for suggestions and improvements when it is ready. Your team members’ approval will make you sure the presentation is ready to be shown. Be more engaging and memorable with Prezi. Effective presentation does not have to be boring. Try to be not only a presenter, but also an engaging storyteller. Use Prezi as a creative way to present a project and make it truly memorable. If you are afraid of being too casual, choose professionally designed templates (yes, Prezi can be professional too). However, please do not overdo your project plan with animation and media elements. Do not be afraid of being different. Create video presentations with PowToon. Not every presentation you will be able present in person. When it comes to a distanced presentation, engaging the audience makes all the difference. Try to do something different instead of sending your potential investors PDF or boring PowerPoint presentation: create animated presentations and videos with PowToon or another animation software. Visualize your project plans with GanttPro. Use GanttPro, online Gantt chart software, to visualize your data and project schedule. Easily add the created charts to your presentation and instantly share them  if needed. SlideShark will let you share your presentation instantly. So you’ve decided to use PowerPoint to create your presentation. Well, you can create a great and demonstrative one with graphs, charts and stuff (hello, GanttPro!). Okay, but what about instant sharing of your presentation in case of need? Try to use SlideSharkto present and share PowerPoints via chosen devices. Its features include cloud storage integration, sharing and tracking views, broadcasting or presenting over the web, creating annotations on the slides, and of course presenter mode. Other tools are: SlideRocket - one of the killer features is the ability to embed interactive content, such as from your Twitter feed. You can also add effects to almost any element of your presentation. A pro feature is the use of interactive forms within the presentation. Zoho Show is easy to use for anyone familiar with PowerPoint. It includes master slides, templates, customization, the ability to insert video and images, transitions and animations. HelloSlide creates automatic audio for your presentation from your typed text and can translate it with the click of a button, giving your content even greater reach. Jux is an image based storytelling tool that looks great on a tablet or large screen. Knovio allows users to upload static PowerPoint presentations and add video and audio online. Updating...
