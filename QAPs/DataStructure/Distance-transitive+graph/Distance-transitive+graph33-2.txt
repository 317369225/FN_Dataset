How can I improve my algorithmic coding skills?
I'm Average Programmer . So my advice is for Average Chaps like me. In terms of Learning Algorithms.  Its Limitless , it takes long term commitment. So if you have to see any progress you have to wait till a year at minimum. So Here's my algorithm to learn Algorithms. 1. Kill All your Goals.     ---------------------------     (If you have any goals like i have to learn all algorithms within a year or Learn Don Knuth's multi volume within a year and get laid,  you got to denounce it.) Literally you should not have any goals at all. If you have goals you will not enjoy. It will kill all your enjoyment. You will never play. you will never discover. you will never travel a new path. you will not discover new ways to do old stuff. 2. Realize that there is no schedule ,no syllabus no Table of Contents to follow.     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     (You cannot find Bottom or Top of anything, Bottom would be Quantum mechanics, Top would be Multiple Light years of Galaxy. No matter who you are, you are always in middle . So don't waste your efforts to find The Basics of Basics of Basics.) Learn as you go. (I Usually wasted huge time like Find Basics learn about them and Find basics of Basics then Learn them and atlast do Linked list traversal kind of plan.) ie., You can start from anywhere from Bit Manipulation to B+ Tree. 3. Take any algorithm .Understand the concepts. Try to implement it yourself.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     (Don't worry about it.It will not be perfect. Some times you never could do. But Give a Try. It is most hardest thing for me in my life. you have to face your fear, it will crush you. it will kill your confidence. It will bring you suicidal thoughts). But do it anyway. Take your own time.If its hard you can skip this step . but its worth it. It will beat the crap out of your Ego. 4.  Once completed step 3. Search in Net,Books  for Better implementations.      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Try to understand why its best. Observe the best practices.      Now you realize why we call a Master a Master. This is were you learn different approaches. 5.  Repeat  3,4 for multiple years.      ------------------------------------------- The above algorithm looks like some philosophical bull s***. But This is only way which works for me. I have tried many ways wasted my years on other methods. For Ex: ---------- When i learn merge sort . It took me around 5 Weeks. But i learned Merge sort, K - Way merge. Sorting 5 GB of File using External sort, Learned File manipulation in C etc, Bit wise operation to speed up Average Calculation. Implemented Merge sort in OpenCL(GPU), Studied Optimizing Techniques etc. And I Enjoyed a lot without any bad feelings. Some times i bypassed step 3. but it was OK to break a rule. ;) These way of learning brings me Joy, Sorrow, Depression, Happiness the whole yin and yang qualities in my life. But my skill to code is like sky rocketed from then. i'm not great guy but this method works for me. Acquiring any great skill like Algorithms, Compilers, Computer Graphics , Artificial Intelligence is life long skill . you would never get in short time. But its worth it. Just enjoy the journey. P.S If you guys find any method which worked better than mine let me know.
