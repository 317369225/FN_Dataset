What are the best and efficient ways to learn algorithms for beginners?
To quote Dimitris Andreou of StackOverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questio... / emphasis mine) Well, looks like an awful lot of data, with a perhaps prohibitive cost to store all frequencies. When the amount of data is so large that we cannot hope to store it all, we enter the domain of data stream algorithms. Useful book in this area: Muthukrishnan - "Data Streams: Algorithms and Applications"[1] By the way, Motwani, of Stanford, was an author of the very important "Randomized Algorithms"[2] book.
