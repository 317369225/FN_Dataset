Why don't airlines award loyalty points based on dollars spent rather than miles flown?
Many actually do so indirectly by applying a correction factor on the number of miles flown depending on the price category you've flown in. That way, you'll end up only earning a fraction of the miles on a discount ticket, but this is still preferred to explicitly returning a percentage of your spendings as this, like Bevan Audstone explains, will discourage people to stick with the program, either because: they'll realize their true earning amounts to less than the average return of a convenience store card, and/or because it makes the customer realize all too well their search for cheap tickets means no significant reward in terms of frequent flyer bonus, discouraging the enrollment in the program even further.
