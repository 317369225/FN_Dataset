What is the logic behind making military boot camps so intensive?
At West Point, every cadet candidate has been forced to memorize the "definition of leather" for 100+ years. Hidden inside this definition is our answer to "why basic training" or in our case, Why Plebe (freshman) year.  It has been 15 years since I memorized this quote, but I can still write it from memory. "If the fresh skin of an animal is cleaned and divested of all hair, fat, and other extraneous matter, immersed in a dilute solution of tannic acid, a chemical combination ensues; the gelatinous tissue formed is impervious to and insoluble in water. Sir, this is leather." Fresh skin -> right out of High school Hair -> buzz cut Fat -> getting in shape Extraneous matter -> other habits from childhood Tannic acid -> harsh basic training environment Chemical combination -> fundamental change Impervious/insoluble -> you emerge as a tougher, more resilient person This has always been one of my favorite pieces of West Point knowledge.  I truly believe that the shared experience changed my worldview and my ability to handle difficult situations to this day.
