I waste a lot of time on Facebook instead of focusing on my goals. What should I do?
My suggestion is: remove the app from your phone or disable its push notifications, and make this your bookmark for Facebook on the computer: Log into Facebook | Facebook  (new Quora editor won't let me remove that title from the link, but it takes you directly to notifications and bypasses the news feed page).  Check your messages and notifications once a day; it's going in and out every time you get a notification that really sucks up the time, especially if you start scrolling through News Feed. And you should probably avoid Quora too, if wasting time is to be avoided!
