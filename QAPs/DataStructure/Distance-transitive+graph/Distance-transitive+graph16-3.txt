What is the logic behind making military boot camps so intensive?
Short version, USAF variant:  Put people in a mental pressure cooker for six weeks, break them all down to about the 9-year-old level by the end of day two, detach them from old habits, see if they can learn to do detailed, finicky procedures in that environment.  If they can handle that, then we *might* be able to trust them to maintain aerospace vehicles and weapons systems.  We sure don't want them working on jets if they can't even iron their own socks.  We need to discover these things early. Basic training also provides a common cultural base.  The military pulls in people from all walks of life, but by the time they've made it through basic and tech school, they've picked up a whole new set of mannerisms and language.  It's not just "military bearing", it's common jokes that everyone recognizes, ways of seeing the world and thinking about things, even if they came from completely different backgrounds and went through basic years apart.  U.S. civilian society manages to reinforce genetic and cultural differences.  U.S. military training clears that noise out of your head real quick.
