What are some common errors involving the incorrect use of words in the English language?
Besides the "would of" for "would have" that Becky Midgley brings up, many people do not understand how to form the pluperfect tense or when to use it. The pluperfect or past-perfect tense is used when one event precedes another, but both happened in the past. Ex: I had just finished painting the floor when the dog ran through the room. "Had finished" must be in the pluperfect tense because I painted BEFORE the dog ran through. Or this classic example: Ex: If I had known you were coming, I would have baked a cake. I usually see this incorrect structure instead: Ex: If I would have known you were coming, I would have baked a cake.
