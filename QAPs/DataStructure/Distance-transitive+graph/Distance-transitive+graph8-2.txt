If you replaced 2 train tracks with a dedicated 2 lane road and ran passenger buses would it be more efficient?
Amar Prabhu provided an excellent answer, but there is one extremely important factor that hasn't been considered yet: boarding time. Dedicated bus lines do not work for high passenger loads because it takes too long to board busses. Even if you have capacity for multiple busses at one bus stop, the one with the slowest boarding time will hold all the other busses up, whether it is at the start of the station, or even the end (a bus can't move up to the start of the station while it boards). In this way, a dedicated bus road is actually less efficient than using regular road infrastructure, because in the latter a full bus waiting behind one that is boarding can pull around the boarding bus (I see this all the time in Montreal during rush hour). If you try to solve this problem with longer/chained busses with multiple entrances/exits, you end up with a rubber-tyred metro. You can't really run these above ground with the same road infrastructure becase now you can't make tight corners anymore and trains are limited in size to city block length (also a real problem for road-level light rail systems). Montreal, Paris, and I believe some Japanese metros are rubber-tyred, but their stations are all below ground. Certainly in Montreal one big problem for an above-ground rubber-tyred metro (and busses as well!) would be snow clearance. Weather is generally not a factor for rail (except for falling vegetation, which can build up like slime on the rails and cause derailments). So that's another factor to consider. So in summary, boarding time and waiting time between arriving vehicles are two other factors you have to consider when evaluating the efficiency of transportation systems.
