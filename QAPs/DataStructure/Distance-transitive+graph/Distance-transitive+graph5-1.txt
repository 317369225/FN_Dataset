What are some great online tools for creating presentations?
I tested a lot, in some years making presentations here's what works: 1º Slides – Create and share presentations online : is very good, if you want to "wooow" people. 2º Google slides are efficient and simple, if you want to work some specific palette, i recommend it. 3º PowerPoint, it works, simple as that.
