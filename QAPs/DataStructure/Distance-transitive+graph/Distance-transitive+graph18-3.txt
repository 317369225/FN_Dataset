Hypothetically, if there is intelligent alien life, with the knowledge and means to traverse space and travel to Earth, what would be their reasons for not making contact? (Please read details.)
A different answer is at the end of Childhood's End by Arthur C. Clarke I don't think it's fair to give the answer here. Edit:  I'll assume everyone has read Asimov's Foundation trilogy or at least heard the main ideas.  Maybe we are "the opposite end of the galaxy" and being kept separate so we can develop psychohistory.  Maybe Asimov was a nucleating agent. Edit:  Another book with aliens in secret contact with a few humans, and developing our race for a rather creepy special purpose is Ballroom of the Skies, one of only two SciFi stories I know of by John D. Macdonald, creator of Travis McGee. Edit:  David Brin's story, "The Crystal Spheres," gives not one but two reasons why we haven't been visited. Edit:  Calculating God by Robert J. Sawyer contains an answer for why some alien races haven't visited us.  Even better, it contains a reason that some alien races will visit us. I won't give away any of these answers, either.  You know where to look. FYI:  Both Brin and Sawyer answer questions on Quora. Edit:  Alien interests are probably different from ours.  Maybe they don't share our interests in exploring, and touring, and learning new things. Suggest Edits Updated 84w ago • View Upvotes
