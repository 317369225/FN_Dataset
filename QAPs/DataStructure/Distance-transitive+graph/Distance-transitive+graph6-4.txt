Why is the slope of the line tangent to a point on a distance vs time graph equal to the instantaneous speed at that point?
Cause the slope of line of a given point in a curve is calculated by considering the small factor dt which means the time period is very small almost instantaneous as of why the slope of the line by the inital and final is the average velocity it's because you are dividing the distance dx by the time spent so dx/dt is velocity the average one you can prove that by the using the formula of the average function involvingÂ  the integral from t1 to t2 of the curve x(t) dt
