What are the hottest topics in applied math?
Note: My answer will of course be influenced by the realm of my own research Do note that Oleg Khutoryansky has a very good list of topics. I'm going to explain some of the topics I think are interesting. Compressed Sensing: The big elephant in the room has already been excellently introduced by Thomas Børstad. From a mathematical perspective, compressed sensing gives us conditions under which we can approximately solve a sparse linear problem (think [math]\mathsf{A} \vec{x} = \vec{y}[/math]). This has a lot of implications for things like Fourier Transforms and general linear optimization. We've already seen some amazing applications to MRI, but what's next for Compressed Sensing? Connection to Harmonic Analysis: Heavy-weights of the field such as David Donoho, Emmanuel Candés and of course Terence Tao [0] have shown that compressed sensing in very closely tied to Harmonic Analysis. Using fairly sophisticated techniques from Real Analysis and Probability Theory, Tao and Candés were able to show that some very compelling bounds on the sampling frequency and spectra of certain sparse linear operators. Applications to Non-linear problems: Can we only solve linear problems with Compressed Sensing? Probably not! It might be possible to find non-linear generalizations of the techniques in Compressed Sensing to things like the Wavelet Transform, giving applications a lot more flexibility. Moreover, by extending Compressed Sensing to non-linear problems, a larger class of image processing and recognition problems will become feasible. In terms of applications, algorithms for Feature Detection in Images and Videos might be revolutionized Relationship to Concentration of Measure: Oddly enough, Compressed Sensing showed up during Candés and Donoho's investigation into large dimensional statistical problems. Roughly speaking, since the 1960s, people had believed that it is impossible to correctly sample probability distributions on large dimensional spaces. As we've been collection an ever increasing collection of large dimensional data that don't necessarily fit in the the framework of classical frequentist statistics (e.g. DNA microarrays), one might think that our analysis of this data is hopeless. However, there is a phenomena known as concentration of measure [*] which roughly means that as one increases the dimension of their data, the non-zero probability mass is located (concentrated) on a smaller volume of space. When one has concentration phenomena, one can find sparsity and wavelet-like structures in this large-[math]N[/math] limit, and an interesting question to ask is, Do Compressed Sensing methods always work when there is a concentration phenomena?  [1] These phenomena might give a sufficient condition for Compressed Sensing and might help us understand the limits of this technique Kantorovich Mass Transport and the Social Sciences Ingrid Daubechies [2] recently put out a paper on how one can compare teeth with some fairly sophisticated mathematical techniques. The goal was to see if one could compute how morphological changes to a species' teeth are connected to the evolution of said species.  The goal is to perform comparisons between computerized versions of teeth (treated as Riemann surfaces) so that one can quantify the 'amount of evolution that has occurred' in a precise manner as opposed to some of the ad hoc heuristic tools used in Anthropology These techniques boil down to finding a good metric or distance between certain sets of two-dimensional surfaces. Daubechies idea is roughly the following: Take a surface and consider a maximal chart (e.g. set in the surface that is diffeomorphic to [math]\mathbb{R}^2[/math]) on the surface. Apply the uniformization theorem and map said surface to the Poincaré disk (e.g. the standard disk in [math]\mathbb{C}[/math] with a specific hyperbolic metric). Do the above two steps with the surface to be compared Compute the Möbius transformation to take the hyperbolic disk measure of one surface to the hyperbolic disk measure of the other surface There is a natural norm on the set of Möbius transformations (after all, it is just the Lie Group [math]\mathsf{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})[/math]) and we can use this to define a distance (or in a more general case a dissimilarity) between surfacesThis problem (in a more general setting) is known as the Kantorovich Mass Transport problem. While this result is pretty recent, it is amazing that Anthropology and the theory of Riemann Surfaces could collide! This also provides a very good foundation for properly comparing scanned/digitized versions of 3-dimensional objects. Digital comparison of 3D objects will be possible. Transition Path Sampling One of the hardest problems in classical many-body Physics and Chemistry is the problem of transition paths. Recall that we usually think of a many-body system as a system of [math]N[/math] particles each with a position and velocity. We are used to thinking of a potential energy that is a function of all of the positions and velocities of these particles. The question is, Which allowed energy configurations are most likely? If there are a lot of degenerate (e.g. equal energy) configurations, how does the system travel between them? These paths between degenerate energy configurations are called transitions paths. Many new methods have arrived in the last few years, but one of the most successful is the String Method [3]. Transition paths are important because if one considers a system of a drug and a protein a natural question to ask is, What is the transition path? Does the drug affect the protein? If transition path methods are made better, we might be able to revolutionize Computational Drug Discovery. [0] See: E. J. Candés and T. Tao. Reflections on Compressed Sensing.

[*] The most famous Concentration of Measure result is the fact that the uniform measure on the [math]n[/math]-ball, [math]\mu_{n}[/math] converges to the measure on the [math]n[/math]-sphere as [math]n\uparrow \infty[/math]
