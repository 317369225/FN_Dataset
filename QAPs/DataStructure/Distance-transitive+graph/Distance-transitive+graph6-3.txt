Why is the slope of the line tangent to a point on a distance vs time graph equal to the instantaneous speed at that point?
The second part is the easiest. The average velocity is the total distance traveled divided by the amount of time it took. The total distance traveled is the vertical distance between the starting point and end point on the graph, and the total time is the horizontal distance. So if we draw a line connecting those two points, the slope is exactly the total distance divided by the total time, so we get the average distance. The velocity is how fast the distance increases per unit of time at that point. Basically, we are asking "if our velocity would not change from what it is at this point, how much distance would we cover per unit of time ?". If we would draw that hypothetical line representing the situation where our velocity stays exactly as it is right now, that gives us a line tangent to the original curve at that given point. As with the explanation above, the slope given us the average velocity for the scenario represented by that straight line, which is equal to the velocity for the original curve at that point.
