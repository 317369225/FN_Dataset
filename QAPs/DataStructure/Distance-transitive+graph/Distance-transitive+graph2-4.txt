I read in a popular science book that an electron disappears in one orbit and appears in another? Is that really true? Is that an example of teleportation?
It is not true. What you are referring to is called electron jumps and it was one of the arbitrary elements of Bohr's model which introduced special orbits in a rather ad hoc way. In Bohr's model, electrons can move like planets around the sun in certain fixed orbits with well defined position and momenta and upon excitation simply "disappears" from one orbit and reappears in another with higher energy. In modern understanding of quantum mechanics, electrons don't have a 'position' and all we know is a spatial probability density which encodes the likelihood that an electron will actually be found there upon inspection. If you supply energy to the system, the probability density of electrons around the nucleus changes. Nothing is 'jumping' from one place to another.
