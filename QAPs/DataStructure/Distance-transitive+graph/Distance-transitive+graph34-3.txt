How many years of oil do we have left to run our industrial civilization, keeping in mind that oil is a resource and has an economical end?
The problem is not that we are going to run out of fossil fuels anytime soon, it's that we are going to poison the environment and change the climate as we keep finding new ways to get at the fuel.  Fracking is a very intensive method of getting at natural gas.  It involves many dangerous chemicals and industrial-level development in areas where it is being carried out.  If we are going to get at all the shale gas that the industry claims is down there, we will have to have gas wells dotting the landscape.  You don't have to believe me, go google Anthony Ingraffea.  He's an environmental engineer at Cornell University and has done a good number of presentations around the country about shale gas.  The same goes for other methods, like tar sands extraction and deep sea drilling.  Remember the Deepwater Horizon spill?
