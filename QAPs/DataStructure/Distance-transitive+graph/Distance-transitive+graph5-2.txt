What are some great online tools for creating presentations?
I'm a bit late in answering this, but would like to offer my two cents nonetheless since this is a field I'm now heavily investing in! In order to create great presentations, first you have to know what to say. This prerequisite is critical before you can even go on making a presentation. Yet, here's another important thing, even if you know what you want to say, the tools you use may end up confusing your initial message because of how difficult they can be to use.  These are the tools I found to be most conducive to great presentations because you focus on clear content before anything else (videos, motion slides, style, etc): Slides – Create and share presentations online I like Slides for its bold design and it's relatively easy to use. It's also a good example of interactive presentations that works well online and offline. Curator Curator is a beautiful online presentation tool aimed at storytelling. The obvious thing about it is that it's very pretty due to its focus on visuals - great if you're planning to do all the talking. Swipe – make your presentations personal & interactive A bit biased, but relevant nonetheless. One of the reasons we made Swipe was because we wanted a tool that is quick and easy to use, with a content first, appearance after approach. I hope these help!
