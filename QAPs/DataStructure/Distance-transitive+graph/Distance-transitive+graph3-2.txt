What are the hottest topics in applied math?
I'm really surprised that no one has mentioned applications of mathematics to biology on this list. This topic is much broader than those mentioned by others, and falls more into the arena of "mathematical modeling" rather than actual "applied math" (whatever that term means). As we generate ever more biological data, it will be the quantitative scientists (i.e. applied mathematicians, etc.) who will be called into make sense of it. While this may just be statistics, building models of such systems generates more insight. Sub-topics of mathematical biology that I think are particularly hot right now are computational neuroscience and computational systems and synthetic biology.
