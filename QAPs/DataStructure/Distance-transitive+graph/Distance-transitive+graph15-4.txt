What are the challenges of automatic text summarization?
This is one interesting topic, that i have been reading on, off late. One important thing to be acquired in ATS is retaining the quality of the text. This depends on the quality of the classifiers employed. Few other challenges could be, one - word sense ambiguity, this is the ambiguity created sometimes due to abbreviations that can have more than one acronym. Here, depending on the subject we have to match the acronym for better understanding. I think, word sense disambiguation algorithms play a part here. Another challenge, is interpreting long sentences and jargons. another interesting challenge is.. evaluating the summary.. it has to be benchmarked with the human generated summary, then with the source itself, etc. Challenges are plenty. Get hold of publications on Automatic Text Summarization.. for more info.
