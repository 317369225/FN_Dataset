How can I learn to think faster while solving algorithmic/coding problems? How can I better visualize and solve the coding problems?
Programming, like any other skill takes practice, but you wouldn't know that the ways it's managed. When you started to read could you hold the entire novel in your head? Did you read it at the same speed as you do now? When you learned to draw, were you as fast at identifying light, shadow and shape as today? With a musical instrument could you play a piece at full speed, from memory on day one? For some, lucky people the answer to those questions is yes. For the rest of us it's practice. Years and years of practice. We follow the same paths in our minds and muscles to the point where the gap between having a thought and expressing it is instinctual. It sounds like you have a certain amount of coding experience already. My guess is the musical equivalent of a Grade 5, a blue belt in karate or your first public showing in an art. You get better at this point by enhancing your theory, making your practice routines harder and by practicing... a lot. Oh and fucking up. Do a lot of that too.
