Why don't airlines award loyalty points based on dollars spent rather than miles flown?
Recall that many airline loyalty programs were started decades ago and predate credit-card 'point' programs linked to spend amounts.Â  The airlines sought to recognize frequent fliers...ie: those people that fly a lot....which was easily measured by flights and miles...and may have been challenged to track/reward based on $ spent...especially since many/most of these frequent travelers traveled for business and their tickets were paid out of corporate accounts like UATP...and often those fares were corporate-negotiated fares, and it would have irked corporate travel managers to have airlines rewarding flyers for choosing more expensive flights in order to earn more points.
