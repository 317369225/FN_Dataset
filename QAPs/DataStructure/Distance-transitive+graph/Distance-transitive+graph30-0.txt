How can ARPES get information about the electronic structure of the material from the electrons near the surface?
If this question is asking how ARPES works, I previously discussed that here: What kind of qualitative and quantitative information can be obtained from ARPES? If this question is asking how ARPES can get information about bulk band structure as a surface sensitive probe, that is a question that has vexed many a confused peer reviewer. This is a valid question because electronic band structure is calculated on a torus, and the surface breaks translation symmetry, so we might expect bulk wavefuntions to be strongly affected by the surface.  Moreover, in some materials, the surface will 'relax' in an orderly way, such that a distinct surface band structure develops.  However, as it turns out, ARPES has a pretty good track record of uncovering/confirming/assessing real physics in agreement with bulk probes when it is not specifically studying surface states, so concerns about surface sensitivity are often unfounded.  I will address this in three ways: How surface-sensitive is the technique really? On what sorts of materials has it been deployed (i.e. does it really matter if it is surface sensitive) A quick calculation How surface sensitive is ARPES really? It depends on the photon energy used to 'kick out' electrons in the experiment, as illustrated in the 'universal curve' below. ​ ​ Inelastic mean free path of  electrons in a solid (many different materials are compiled in this graph) in nanometers, as a function of the electrons' kinetic energy.  Source:  M. P. Seah and W. A. Dench, Surface and Interface Analysis, Vol 1, P2-11 (1979) ARPES is based on the photoelectric effect: photons in, electrons out (see my earlier answer for more details).  The photoemission process is modeled by the three (sequential) step model: photon excites an electron in the bulk to a higher energy level (i.e. gives it an energy kick) electron travels towards the surface electron escapes from surface, at which point it loses energy equal to the work function of the materialThe mean free path (mfp) of the electrons (y axis in the graph above) tells you how deep in the sample ARPES can gather electron, and the energy of the photons used in the experiment tells you the approximate kinetic energy of the electrons (x axis in the graph; note that ARPES generally studies electrons within ~1 eV of the Fermi level, where the binding energy is zero, so the photon energy is taken to be the kinetic energy for this discussion, even though it might be different). What kind of photon energies are used in ARPES?  From 6 eV up to keV energies, depending what you want to study precisely (different materials have better cross section when studied with different photon energies).  According to the universal curve above, the worst case scenario is if you use ~30 eV photon energy, and the electron mfp is ~0.5 nm.  If you use 6-7 eV photons, the electron mfp is more like ~2 nm and if you use 200 eV it is ~1nm.  ARPES with keV photon energies is considered to be a bulk probe, more or less, which is not really reflected in the curve above.  Note that these are just approximate values, and there is some materials variation.  As reference, for highly symmetric materials with simple unit cells, the height of a unit cell might be 0.5nm. However, one thing to keep in mind is that the concept of an electron mfp in a solid is an expression of an exponentially extinction process: [math] \propto e^{-z/\lambda}[/math].  That is to say, a majority of electrons in an ARPES experiment (~65%) should come from the first mfp-deep layer, but there will diminishing contributions from deeper layers as well (23% of electrons will come from up to two mfp-deep.  Thus, an ARPES experiment (depending on photon energy) might well be seeing contributions from up to 10 or so unit cells.  Hardly the most surface sensitive probe out there. What sorts of materials has ARPES been used to measure? ARPES is a very versatile technique used on a variety of materials, but arguably is has been most powerful for learning about quasi-2D materials and surface states (which are intrinsically 2D).  This includes cuprate and pnictide high temperature superconductors, graphene, the surface state of topological insulators, certain classes of charge density wave compounds such as rare-earth tritellurides and transition-metal-dichalcogenides, just to name a few.  When a material is perfectly two dimensional,  the surface doesn't really matter because only translation symmetry in the plane is of consequence.  When the kz dispersion is weak (almost two dimensional), the surface matters less than in a truly three dimensional material by a similar argument.  Thus, ARPES is very good at extracting relevant electronic information because it is commonly deployed to measure materials for which it is intrinsically well suited.  That being said, people are increasingly pushing the technique to study 3D materials and learn about out of plane dispersions, and a nice discussion of how that works can be found here. Quick calculation of how a surface affects the potential an electron feels at a certain point Source: Ashcroft and Mermin, Solid State Physics At a given position, r, the potential due to all the other unit cells distances R away (assuming a primitive cell with one atom per cell) is given by [math]U^{inf}(\mathbf{r})= \sum_\mathbf{R} v(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R})[/math] where [math]v(r)[/math] is a coulomb potential [math]v(\mathbf{r})=-e\int_C \rho(\mathbf{r}')\frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|} d\mathbf{r}'[/math] The integration is taken over a unit cell C, and the charge density [math]\rho[/math] incorporates both electron and ion charges. One then takes a multipole expansion of [math]\frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}[/math] which gives [math]v(r)=-e\frac{Q}{r}-e\frac{\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{r}}}{r^2}+O(\frac{1}{r^3})[/math] here Q is the total charge per unit cell (zero for a neutral unit cell) and p is the total dipole moment (which vanishes for a unit cell with inversion symmetry).  If the unit cell has cubic symmetry, the [math]1/r^3[/math] term will vanish too, and the [math]1/r^4[/math] term will also vanish if there is inversion symmetry.  Thus, the contribution of unit cells further away falls off quite rapidly ([math]1/r^5[/math] best case scenario and [math]1/r^3[/math] worst case scenario, assuming inversion symmetry).  Therefore, the presence of a surface will not adulter the band structure too catastrophically several unit cells down in most cases.
