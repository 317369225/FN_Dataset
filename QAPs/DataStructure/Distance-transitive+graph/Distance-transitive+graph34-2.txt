How many years of oil do we have left to run our industrial civilization, keeping in mind that oil is a resource and has an economical end?
I think the short answer is: No one knows. I have been trying to make sense of the analysis here and other websites and a couple of things spring out: 1) People have different interpretations of what peak oil is 2) Little thought is taken into explaining the mathematics of how much it will cost to produce the same amount of energy using different sources 3) Social economic changes i.e. increase energy demands from developing countries and underdeveloped countries 4) Overestimating efficiencies and improvement - 1% is very different than 10%
