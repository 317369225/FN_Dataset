What are the challenges of automatic text summarization?
I've also been looking at how recent machine learning methods apply to language analysis.  Techniques using tensors (meaning here, multidimensional arrays) are being adapted from image applications to language applications.  One typical difference is that the tensors are large and very sparse. For example, the vectors may represent words and the relationships between them -- there are many words but most of them are not directly related to each other. The following article discusses some of the uses of word embedding in the context of several state-of-the-art methods for text summarization. Better Summarization Evaluation with Word Embeddings
