What are the most learner-friendly resources for learning about algorithms?
You learn Algorithms by doing them. So find a resource that provides Algorithms problems and guidance in solving them. If you want a textbook, check out the Algorithm Design Manual, which also has an online Algorithm Repository. If you prefer an online course, Udacity offers a python-based Algorithms course, while Coursera offers general and Java-based ones. Since the important part is practicing Algorithms, you can skip the video courses and just solve challenges. It's great if you have a resource that provides Algorithms challenges and help with solving them. I created Learneroo for this purpose. You can explore Algorithms on Learneroo or start learning the Recursion Tutorial.
