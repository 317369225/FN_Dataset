Can PCA be used for graph clustering or community mining?
PCA is a data reduction technique and to be used prior to any clustering technique. PCA /Factor analysis helps reduce your various attributes into principal components/ factors - which are then to be used for regression/clustering methodologies. (See an example  SAS Annotated Output) This method avoids multi-collinearity issues (which will lead to model instability in models developed without taking multi-collinearity into consideration). Coming to clustering there are countless methods to cluster.  Choose methods based on the business situation that you are trying to model, the software that you have - and the documentation available on the same. It would behoove one to understand  the underlying statistics of a given methodology in applying it to a situation - and choose a method that would provide the most stable model for a reasonable time.   K-means works quite well in most situations and is something that we use as a baseline prior to exploring other options.
