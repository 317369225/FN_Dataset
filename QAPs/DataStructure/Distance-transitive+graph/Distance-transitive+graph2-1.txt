I read in a popular science book that an electron disappears in one orbit and appears in another? Is that really true? Is that an example of teleportation?
Since joining Quora 2 months ago, I have read a lot of physics answers, and because Barak Shoshany's answers are among the best, I followed him. So I am very nervous right now to disagree in any way with his answer. He knows a lot more physics than I do. But I think you can understand it better than just by accepting that an electron "doesn't have a well defined position", or that after a transition the electron's position "doesn't actually change in any meaningful way". When an electron is in an "orbital" it is in a stationary state, which just means a wave function that doesn't change with time (that's why we call them orbitals, not orbits). That wave function can tell you the probability that the electron will be found in a particular position, let's say a distance r from the nucleus. Now the electron can absorb or emit a photon, and move to a new orbital. After that transition the probability that you find it at a distance r from the nucleus has changed. So in that sense, it really did move position. When the electron is in a stationary state, it is restricted to energy levels that differ by a whole "quantum"; the only stable states are the ones with discrete quantum numbers - corresponding to the "orbitals". A very good analogy you might have seen is to standing waves, for example in a drum skin. These waves have to take discrete values, otherwise they wouldn't be "standing still". But the thing is, if an electron is not in a stationary state (that is, if its wave function is changing with time) then it is not a "standing wave", and it is not so constrained to take any particular values. So there is nothing to stop electrons smoothly transitioning  from one "orbital" to another, and during the transition they are effectively between the two orbitals, that is, neither in one orbital nor the other. The process I am describing would take place in an incredibly short time - femtoseconds I think, or even less - but it's not discontinuous, which is the thing that is quite rightly bothering you. [Edit - added further explanation] The reason this can happen is that in the transition from one energy eigenstate to another, the electron will be in a superposition of the two states (at least*). So the electron starts in a state [math]\psi _{1}[/math] and then moves to a new state [math]\psi _{2}[/math], say by emitting a photon. Although [math]\psi _{1}[/math] and [math]\psi _{2}[/math] are both stationary states, the superposition of them is time dependent. The mixture will be some linear combination:  [math]\psi _{12} = a\psi _{1} + b\psi _{2}[/math] where in the initial state b = 0 and in the final state a = 0, and during the transition a and b take non-zero values. The probability density for the mixture of states will be: [math]{\psi_{12}}^{*}\psi _{12} = a^{2}{\psi_{1}}^{*}\psi _{1} + b^{2}{\psi_{2}}^{*}\psi _{2} + ab({\psi_{1}}^{*}\psi _{2} + {\psi_{2}}^{*}\psi _{1})[/math] The first term is the pure stationary state1, the second term is the pure stationary state2  and the third term is the time-dependent contribution. It has factors of the form [math]e^{i\omega t}[/math] that do not cancel out. Recall that the classical problem of the stability of atoms was explained by quantum mechanics - electrons in a stationary state can not radiate. So the time-dependence is in a sense necessary for any transition to happen. *(I think a deeper analysis shows that in fact the electron will momentarily be in a superposition of many possible states, not just the two.) [Edit #2] I just found a good graph online which shows the probability of finding the electron at different distances from the nucleus, for three orbitals. The 2s to 1s transition is not allowed because of conservation laws, but the 2p (red) to 1s (purple) is the main transition to the ground state. This illustrates the sense in which the electron "moves". [Edit#3 ]in response to comments (to avoid repeating myself) I said in the transition (for example) |2p> -> |1s> the mixture of the two eigenstates moves smoothly from one pure eigenstate and the other. It is true that it is smooth, but it is also periodic. In the expression I gave for the probability density of the mixed state, [math]{\psi_{12}}^{*}\psi _{12} = a^{2}{\psi_{1}}^{*}\psi _{1} + b^{2}{\psi_{2}}^{*}\psi _{2} + ab({\psi_{1}}^{*}\psi _{2} + {\psi_{2}}^{*}\psi _{1})[/math] the last term, the interference term, is basically [math]\psi (r,\theta,\phi) e^{\frac{-i\Delta E}{\hbar}t}[/math] where [math]\Delta E[/math] is the difference in energy levels, about 10eV. Now if we take this superposition, including the interference term, as the "real" electron, it all becomes very natural: The electron's position expected value is oscillating at a well defined frequency [math]\omega = {10eV}/{\hbar}[/math] Because the electron is charged, and its position is oscillating, we have an oscillating dipole, and, by classical electromagnetism, we know that it can emit a photon (like a radio antenna). In fact the wavelength of the photon will be [math]\frac{2\pi c}{\omega} = 0.122\mu m[/math]. So we can picture the electron, first in state1 (2p orbital), then for some time the electron is oscillating between state1 and state2. While it is oscillating it can emit a photon. When it does this, it is now in state2 (the 1s orbital). So there is no question of instantaneous changes, or teleportation, or any other mystery. Updated 32w ago • View Upvotes
