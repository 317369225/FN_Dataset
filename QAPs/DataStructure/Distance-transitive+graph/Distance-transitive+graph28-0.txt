Quantum Chemistry:Â Does a transition from a pi bonding orbital to an antibonding one weaken the bond between the two atoms?
Indeed, it does. Basically, exciting an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO orbital means that the electron is now higher in energy. Higher energy suggests that it is attracted less strongly by the nuclei, so it is more likely to escape the potential well created by them. This is what chemists call reactivity. It is then able to relax back to the initial state or undergo a chemical reaction, possibly achieving a more stable state. http://de.theoriefinder.wikia.co... The source website is in German but the image is clear enough on its own. Those plots show the relationship of potential energy as a function of internuclear distance. The potential energy is considered zero at the point where the electron no longer 'feels' the presence of any nuclei. It becomes a free particle. According to Coulomb's law in electrostatics, a point charge is not interacting with another point charge at infinite distance. This is why the curve becomes skewed and tends to zero as the distance goes to infinity. As you can see, the lower graph corresponding to the ground state is deeper than the one that describes the vacant orbital. Marked with v are the vibration levels. An electron occupies a particular orbital, however, there are some small energy variations that correspond to bond vibrations. That is - small fluctuations in the distance between two nuclei from the optimal configuration. As energy increases, vibrations become more prominent. The curve becomes wider, so the bond is being eloganted to a greater extent.
