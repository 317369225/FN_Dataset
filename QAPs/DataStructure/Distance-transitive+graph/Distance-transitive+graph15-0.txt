What are the challenges of automatic text summarization?
I wrote a literature survey on automated multi-document summarization for my dissertation proposal. Here are some of the useful papers that were on my list. I include historical perspective on summarization, papers on different types of approaches to (mainly, multi-document summarization) and also some about how to properly evaluate summaries both manually and automatically.
