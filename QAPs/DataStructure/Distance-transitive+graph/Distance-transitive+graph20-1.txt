Is it hard being a transgender parent?
Of course! Being a parent is always hard, especially if one tries to do it well.Â  But yes, adding transgender to the job discription does add complications. There were initial adjustments, such as showing my kids that they would not lose me when I transitioned. Fortunately, it didn't take long for them to see that I am the same person and same parent I always was. On of the biggest ongoing challenges is that we've lost the luxury of simplicity. Divorced straight single dad and his kids is a paradigm that most people understand. Divorced transsexual lesbian and her kids who still call her "Dad," is much more challenging for people to get their heads around. There aren't nearly enough boxes on my kids' schools forms to address our reality. It has also created social challenges for us. My boys worry that other kids will make assumptions about them based on who I am. Just imagine being a teenage boy, going through puberty in one direction, while your dad goes through it in the other. My 14 year old still hasn't come out as having a trans dad to any of his friends, other than the kids I helped coach in soccer in a previous incarnation. My 19 year old waited until he went away to college and had a grown up girlfriend before coming out to her and to his roommates. It probably helped that one of his roomies has two moms.
