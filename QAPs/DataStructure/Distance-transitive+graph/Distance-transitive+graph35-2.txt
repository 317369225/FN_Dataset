Why is the order parameter of lipids in the bilayer important?
The phospho-lipid bilayer has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. The bilayer exists as a sheet. The lipid part is responsible for making the cell membrane selectively permeable. The phospho part (hydrophilic) helps in formation of a stabilised layer with hydrophobic portion facing each other and hydrophilic region interactions with surrounding environs. If this were reversed, the cell membrane won't exist and neither will the cell. The hydrophobic lipid part won't be able to interact with mostly water-based surroundings and close upon itself forming micelles. Also, the entry of ions surrounded by water will be restricted.
