What is the meaning of the Ascendant conjunct North Node?
Very frankly, they are not conjunct at very first place. It is just that the degree of north node is quite close to ascendant which means it is going to affect your personality quite a lot (North node is going to move from Aries to Pisces and it has already covered 28 degrees of Aries and just 2 degrees is left to travel. ). It is a basic observation that when a planet is having a close degrees to the ascendant they have a major impact on the life of a person. It might create some kind of confusion in your mind as it is a planet who masters in creating in illusions or making them behave in an unusual manner. day dreaming and achieving anything by hook or crook can also be seen if the impact of north node is too high.
