Why is the slope of the line tangent to a point on a distance vs time graph equal to the instantaneous speed at that point?
Okay, so lets say we have some very simple distance vs time graph: So, lets calculate the slope: [math]\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{3-0}{1-0} = 3[/math]. So we have a slope of three, lets see what the slope actually is. For this we use dimensional analysis. [math]\Delta y[/math] is the distance in of the y coordinate, obviously this is given in whatever dimension (units) y has, lets say meters. [math]\Delta x[/math] is the distance of the x coordinate, in this example it has the dimension of time, lets say seconds. [math]\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}[/math] is then the fraction of both, so it will have units of meters per second: speed! If I have a speed of 3 meters per second, how much distance will I have covered in half a second? How about a full second? This is exactly as the graph above. The slope resembles a rate of change (how much the distance varies with the time, in this case) and for a distance-time graph that rate of change has to be a velocity by analysis of the units. Conveniently (of course, it's all made in such a way that it works) the velocity you get is the actual velocity of whatever the graph shows, not some arbitrary velocity. Once you get further in Calculus, you will learn about derivatives, which allows you to calculate the slope of any function at any point directly. In essence, it's just a generalized idea of what I did above. As for the matter of average speed, this is basically by definition. Lets say you have a graph that connects both end points, but is not a straight line: Lets see what the slope of the purple graph does. When it leaves zero, it grows slowly (slower than the straight line), so its slope must be lower as well. However, you can see that the function starts to increase, but starts increasing faster (after all, it will connect with the straight line somewhere, it will have to grow faster since it started slower). So the slope must increase. The slope of the blue function will be the same everywhere (3, in this case). Now, what is the definition of average velocity? It's the constant velocity you need in order to cross the distance in a certain amount of time. The blue line had a constant slope (velocity) the purple line had a slope (velocity) that wasn't constant. As such, the blue line, the straight line that connects the two end points will always be the average velocity, since it's the only line that has a constant slope.
