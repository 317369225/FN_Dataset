Are there best practices to merge products?
The marketing cost of renaming a product is equal to twice the cost of naming it originally. That is, you have to get people to UNlearn the old name and LEARN the new name. Think of the renaming as a brand launch. Do everything you would normally do to launch a new product. Ideally you want to make the migration both free and easy to clients and it should appear to be an upgrade from their old systems. Therefore, the new brand has to be superior in at least one aspect to the old ones. The launch message is "New capabilities. New name." I had this situation a few years ago and most of my problems were political rather than technical. Some VPs and sales people were aligned with one product while others aligned to the other. Gad. The developers were the easiest: they chose based entirely on technical strength.
