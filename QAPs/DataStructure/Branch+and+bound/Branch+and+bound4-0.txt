What are some good problems for practicing the branch-and-bound technique?I've recently read a few introductory articles on branch and bound, and I think I see how you can solve a travelling-saleshuman problem with it. Can anyone recommend some other good problems to practice with? It seems to me like the key is figuring out a good upper/lower bound heuristic.
One problem I distinctly remember in my practice for branch-and-bound was the 15-puzzle [1]. (Funny how your first encounters with a particular algorithm always sticks with you.) It was great because it was a pretty well-known puzzle, simple enough to understand and implement, and most importantly, has an admissible heuristic which is a requirement for effective pruning. At the same time, it was also pretty challenging because you need to do some memory management, and for speed, you might even need to consider a double-ended version of a regular branch-and-bound algorithm. That would be great for reinforcing your understanding of the basic premise of the algorithm. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fi...
