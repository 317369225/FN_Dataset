In branch and bound, how is the upper bound calculated and updated? How is the upper bound used to reduce the search effort?
Upper bound is the maximum possible profit that you can possibly get with the current configuration of your state. Think of it as a function on a state. You pass in a state to a function f  that gives you the maximum possible value you could get by exploring the current sub-tree. (Note that this is an upper bound, the actual value that you might get from this sub-tree could be lower) This function f  depends on the problem you are trying to model. Now imagine that you have already found a better solution somewhere else in the tree. If that is the case, there is no point further exploring the current sub-tree. That is the intuition.
