Does naive linear search work better than branch-and-bound and space partitioning algorithms in Nearest Neighbor Search?I have heard about linear search generally performing better when the search space dimensionality is high. But is it always true?
Yes, it's the curse of dimensionality. In general spatial indexes degrades to linear search as the number of dimensions grow. LSH is a good way to aproximate the nearest neighbor search problem in sub-linear time.
