Does naive linear search work better than branch-and-bound and space partitioning algorithms in Nearest Neighbor Search?I have heard about linear search generally performing better when the search space dimensionality is high. But is it always true?
Read this: "We  have shown that, as dimensionality increases, the performance of partitioning index methods degrades to that of a linear  scan." Weber, Schek, Blott. "A quantitative analysis and performance study for similarity search methods in high dimensional spaces". http://www.vldb.org/conf/1998/p1...
