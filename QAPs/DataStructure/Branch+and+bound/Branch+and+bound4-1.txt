What are some good problems for practicing the branch-and-bound technique?I've recently read a few introductory articles on branch and bound, and I think I see how you can solve a travelling-saleshuman problem with it. Can anyone recommend some other good problems to practice with? It seems to me like the key is figuring out a good upper/lower bound heuristic.
Branch and Bound Algorithms can be used to solve a variety of questions seeking optimization. You can use branch and bound for a number of NP-Hard problems: Integer Programming Nearest Neighbour Search Knapsack Problem Bin Packing Job Assignment Problem MAX-SAT Problem and many others. Branch and Bound Heuristics are also used in solving game trees like Sudoku, Tic Tac Toe. If you want to practise Branch and Bound, I recommend you read the problems really well at first, the problems require complete understanding before you can figure how to use Branch and Bound to solve them. Good Luck!!
