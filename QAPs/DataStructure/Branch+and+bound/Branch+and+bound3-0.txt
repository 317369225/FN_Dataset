What are the differences between LIFO and FIFO branch and bound techniques?
In LIFO BnB Depth First Search Schema is used, Whereas in FIFO BnB Breadth First Search schema is used. (First point in description: in case DFS and BFS is not known to the Questioner) In LIFO BnB- newly formed Live Node is explored before completely exploring the current E-Node , while in FIFO BnB all the child nodes of E-Node are formed first and then Live nodes are explored further. In LIFO BnB State Space Tree proceeds laterally while in FIFO it proceeds horizontally. *Even I'am an amaeture mind in this field so any corrections are acceptable :)
