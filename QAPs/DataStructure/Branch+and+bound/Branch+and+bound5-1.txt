What are some good resources for learning backtracking, branch-and-bound and dynamic programming algorithms?CLRS doesn't seem to cover bactracking/branch-and-bound. I tried several resources online, though I get the idead behind these, I am unable to write code for, let's say, Knapsack problem.Â  So, I want something that, may be, takes a problem and solves it with these 3 approaches and at least gives pseudo-code. Or any resources that you think will be helpful.
