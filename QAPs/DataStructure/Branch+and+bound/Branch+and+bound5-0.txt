What are some good resources for learning backtracking, branch-and-bound and dynamic programming algorithms?CLRS doesn't seem to cover bactracking/branch-and-bound. I tried several resources online, though I get the idead behind these, I am unable to write code for, let's say, Knapsack problem.Â  So, I want something that, may be, takes a problem and solves it with these 3 approaches and at least gives pseudo-code. Or any resources that you think will be helpful.
I published a series of articles targeting the average student and software engineer explaining dynamic programming technique in low level details. Here is the first part http://www.8bitavenue.com/2011/1... from there you can follow up to the last one. I hope this will be helpful.
