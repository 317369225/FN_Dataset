Is the set of all ordered pairs of the form [math](x,0)[/math] with the standard operations in [math]\mathbb{R}^{2}[/math] a vector space?
So you know the axioms.  Let's list them out and check it. 1. Commutativity: x+y=y+x  x+0=0+x=x, check 2. Associativity of vector addition (x+0)+z= x+(0+z)=x+z, check 3. Additive identity 0+x=x+0=x, check 4.additive inverse x+(-x)=0, check 5.associativity of scalar multiplication r(sX)=(rs)X, check 6.distributivity of scalar sums (r+s)X=rX+sX, check 7. Distributivity of vector sums r(X+0)=rX+rO=rX, check 8. Scalar multiplication identity 1X=X, check So yea, it is a vector space.  r and s above are scalars/constants.  z doesn't exist in your space, you can remove it.  I should've been consistent with my uppercase X, but I'm too lazy to go back and change them... I hope it helps.
