Besides the order of pairs, what is the difference between a TIA/EIA 568A and TIA/EIA 568B?
Here's pretty much all that matters to most of us: If you were to make a cable that had one end A, and the other B, you would have a cross-over cable.  If you were to attach two cross-over cables together (via a straight-through female to female connector), you would have a straight-through cable. You can use A cables or B cables.  As long as each end of the cable is the same, it doesn't really matter.  For some reason, most cable you buy pre-made in the US are of the B variety.   Maybe South of the Equator they go the other way.  Never used a computer under those conditions.
