Why were complex numbers invented?  Were they invented to explain a physical phenomenon or do they really "exist"
Do numbers really exist? Have you or I seen the number twenty three? We consider them to exist thanks to the analogy we see between things in the real world and the world of numbers. Imaginary and complex numbers were invented for purely mathematical reasons, because people saw some ugly asymmetries in mathematics with only real numbers. Not all quadratic equations had two roots, for example. Once you bring in complex numbers, lots of things became a lot neater. That made mathematicians really happy. If that was all there was, most of us would've never heard of these things. It turns out that complex numbers are two-dimensional rotations, and things in real life which are best modelled as two-dimensional rotations have neat complex models. For one example, sinusoidal waves tend to be neatly modelled as complex numbers due to their properties. This can be explained due to similarities in sinusoidal arithmetic and complex arithmetic. This means electrical engineers spend a long time learning to use complex numbers. Even more interestingly, complex numbers may be fundamental to  quantum mechanics. The wave formulation of quantum mechanics is based on complex numbers, but magically transforms to real numbers when a "measurement" is performed - an operator is applied on the wave function. I am not sure *why* this is, and I'm not even sure there is an answer. It may be a coincidence, or it just might be a pointer to an underlying (complex) reality that we can only experience in a limited (real) sense.
