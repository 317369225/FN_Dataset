How would you read α := (m, n) ↦ mn: ℕ × ℕ  → ℕ?
It is a function which takes a pair of natural numbers and multiplies them. There are two parts to the declaration. Looking at [math]a:\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}[/math] on the left hand side of the arrow is the domain (i.e. input) and the right is the codomain (i.e. output). [math]\mathbb{N}[/math] is the natural numbers, i.e. positive whole numbers and zero. [math]\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}[/math] is the Cartesian product of the two, this simply means taking a pair of two natural numbers. So [math]a:\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}[/math] means a function which takes a pair of natural numbers as input and gives a natural number as output. The second part [math]a:(m, n) \mapsto mn[/math] is what the function actually does. On the left we have the variables for the two inputs, (m and n) on the right we have the output [math]mn[/math], the product of the two.
