Why is 9 a rational number?
Strictly speaking 9 is not a rational number but I am being very strict... A rational number is an ordered pair of integers [math](p,q)[/math] with [math]q\neq0[/math]. There happens to be a very simple equivalence between the integers and rationals: [math]p\equiv(p,1)[/math] and we are in the (bad?) habit of using this equivalence implicitly. We often write the ordered pair [math](p,q)[/math] as [math]\frac{p}{q}[/math] and further confuse the issue by equating this with the number [math]p\div q[/math] which, depending on your definition of division, could be various types of number but mostly would be a real number. Being pedantic like this about the precise set of numbers being discussed is not always useful, but comes in handy when people start asking silly questions about "dividing by zero" or "infinity being a number".
