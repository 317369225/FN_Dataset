How does the square root of a negative number have an "imaginary" answer?
If you just look at what we call the "real numbers", meaning 1 and -1, 1,000 and -1,000, 0, pi and -pi, etc, we can't find a square root for a negative number.  1 squared is 1.  -1 squared is 1. Mathematicians decided it would be interesting to just make up a number, "i", to say that i was the square root of -1, so that i*i=-1, and see what they could do with it.  It turns out that they could do quite a lot. This also turns out to have useful applications in electronic engineering, and in other areas I'm sure.
