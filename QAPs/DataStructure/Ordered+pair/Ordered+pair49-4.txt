What is a "point" in calculus? As in "a line is tangent to the curve at one point"?
Any axiomatic system requires starting with fundamental objects that cannot be defined. Usually, these objects are intuitively understood by the way we relate them to the world around us. Since we are using these fundamental objects as a starting point, we cannot define them precisely with words. Definitions require words, but we cannot require each word in every definition to have its own definition. If we try to define every term or phrase, we either get stuck in a definition loop where one word to defines the other, or we just keep going further and further down the rabbit hole, needing a new word to define the previous one. So getting back to your question, a point is a fundamental geometric object that cannot be defined, but that we all understand intuitively. They are dimensionless, we often locate them with some type of coordinate system, and we use them to construct and define other geometric objects.
