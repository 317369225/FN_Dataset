P and Q are two digit numbers. Their product equals the product of the numbers obtained reversing them. None of the digits in P or Q is equal to the other digit in it or any digit in the other number. The product of tens digits of the two numbers is a composite single digit number. How many order pairs (P,Q) satisfy these conditions?
Here a step-by-step solution, if it helps :) Let - P = 10a + b Q= 10m+n Given:  1) (a,b,m,n) four distinct digits               2) P x Q= product of P and Q with digits reversed               3) a x m is a single digit composite (not prime) number Solution : Keeping in mind 1) above, lets start looking for possible pair of digits (a,m) for condition 3) (a,p) could be- (1,4), (1,6), (1,8), (1,9), (2,3), (2,4), eliminating prime pairs Now if you think about it, in P x Q, the hundreds place digit will be 'a x m' and in Q x P, the hundreds place digit is 'b x n'. If both the numbers are equal, 'b x n' will not only give the same digit as 'a x m', but it also has to be a SINGLE digit. Now, applying that condition, looking for possible (b,n) pairs for each (a,p) from above- (a,p) = (1,4), (1,6), (1,8), (1,9), (2,3), (2,4) (b,n)=  (---), (2,3), (4,2), (---), (1,6), (1,8) No digits match (1,4) above for example, and we are left with only 2 unique pairs- 1)  (1,6) and (2,3) 2) (1,8) and (4,2) Those 2 pairs give us 8 unique (P,Q) pairs and hence 16 ordered (P,Q) pairs. Answer is 16 8 unique number pairs- (12,63), (21,36), (14,82), (41,28), (21,48), (12,84), (13,62), (31,26)
