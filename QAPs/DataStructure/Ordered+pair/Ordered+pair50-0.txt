How can you prove negative numbers exist?
How can you prove negative numbers exist? How do you prove any numbers exist? In Mathematics we create objects by definition. That includes the positive numbers (also known as Natural numbers) which are created by starting from somewhere (say zero) and, given one number, always having a next one (produced by a successor function). (See What is a natural number?) Creation of the negative numbers is a little more complicated. You can get away with just saying there is always an "additive inverse" for any number but, if you want to create the Integers using Natural numbers from the bottom up, you need ordered pairs and equivalence classes. (See What is an equivalence class of an equivalence relation?) An Integer is an equivalence class of ordered pairs of Natural numbers under the equivalence relation      [math](a,b)\sim(c,d)\Leftrightarrow a+d=b+c[/math] Informally it represents the difference between two Natural numbers. So the difference between 5 and 3 is equivalent to (informally the same as) the difference between 9 and 7 because 5+7=9+3. We identify the equivalence class of [math](a,0)[/math] with the number [math]a[/math]. We identify the equivalence class of[math](0,b)[/math] as a negative number and use the shorthand [math]-b[/math]. Does [math](0,b)[/math] exist? Assuming you agree [math]b[/math] exists, [math](0,b)\equiv-b[/math] certainly exists: we just invented it...
