What is a "point" in calculus? As in "a line is tangent to the curve at one point"?
The intent of the concepts Points in mathematics are abstract concepts, not physical ones.  Likewise curves and lines are abstract, not physical, as are surfaces and planes. A surface is not meant to have a thickness.  A curve is not meant to have a width or thickness, just a length. A small stretch of a curve is still a curve; it's not a point. A point is not meant to have an extent in any dimension—no thickness, no width, and no length. Two intersecting straight lines are meant to intersect at a point.  A straight line and a circle can be tangent, and that means that they intersect at one point. ​ Image source: Geometry: Tangents and Secants at Free Math Homework Help Concepts as they're determined in an axiomatic approach Euclid, in his Elements, gave no useful definition for points or lines.  Their meaning came from his postulates for geometry, such as Two points determine a line and All right angles are equal.  From the postulates (also called axioms), and a few implicit assumptions, he proved lots of propositions in geometry.  By 1900, all his implicit assumptions had been made explicit.  In an axiomatic system like that, the basic concepts like point don't have to be defined in terms of something else, but their meaning derives from the axioms. Concepts defined in terms of other concepts An alternate way of defining points etc. is in terms of something that's already been defined.  For geometry, you can do that with coordinates building on the theory of real numbers  [math]\mathbf R.[/math] The plane is then defined as [math]\mathbf R^2[/math] which consists of ordered pairs [math](x,y)[/math] of real numbers.  A point is defined as one one these ordered pairs.  A line is defined as including all the points satisfying a linear equation such as  [math]3x+4y=5.[/math]  A circle is defined as including all the points satisfying an equation of the form  [math](x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=c^2[/math]  where [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] are real numbers and [math]c[/math] is a positive real number. You can show that these two different approaches—Euclid's axiomatic approach and the coordinate geometry approach—lead to the same theory for plane geometry. Updated 47w ago • View Upvotes
