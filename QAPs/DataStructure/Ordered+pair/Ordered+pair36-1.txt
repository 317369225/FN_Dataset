How would you read α := (m, n) ↦ mn: ℕ × ℕ  → ℕ?
To add a bit to Brian's answer: if I were the editor of the book you're reading from, I'd tell the author/typesetter to reformat this definition on two lines, roughly (because Quora doesn't support multiline environments like \align) as follows: [math]\alpha \colon \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}[/math] [math] \langle m,n \rangle \mapsto m \cdot n[/math] Ideally, these should be aligned so the arrows match. This notation asserts three things: the domain of the function, the codomain, and the definition of the map itself.
