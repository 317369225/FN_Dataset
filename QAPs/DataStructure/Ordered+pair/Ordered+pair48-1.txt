How do you prove rigorously that [math](a,b)=(c,d)[/math] if and only if [math]a=c[/math] and [math]b=d[/math]?
Most people will take [math](a,b) = (c,d) \iff a = c \wedge b = d[/math] to be the definition of equality for ordered pairs. Hence there is no need for a proof. However, from a set theoretic point of view, we can prove this. The textbook (i.e. commonly accepted) definition of an order pair is given by: [math](x,y) := \{ \{ x \} , \{ x , y \} \}[/math]. The proof that [math](a,b) = (c,d) \iff a = c \wedge b = d[/math] follows easily from that definition. Hence, this is a theorem to some mathematicians. I'll leave the proof as an exercise for the reader. As my Professor used to say, "I do not wish rob from any of you, the pleasure of proving it yourself". Updated 33w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
