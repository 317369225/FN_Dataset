How many pairs of X and Y is possible in the number f 763X4Y2 if the number is divisible by 9?
11 pairs are possible. Explanation Rule of Divisibility by 9 : The sum of digits of Number should be divisible by 9 then only the number itself will be divisible by 9. e.g.  Number 729 Sum of Digits = 7+2+9 = 18 (as 18 is divisible by 9, Number 729 will be divisible by 9) Here, The given number is 763X4Y2 sum of number = 7+6+3+X+4+Y+2 =22+X+Y Now, X can be any number between 0 - 9 also Y can be any number between 0 - 9 so, Possible values of  X+Y is any number between 0 -18 Hence, Sum of digits (22+X+Y) will be between 22(22 + 0 where both X and Y is 0) and 40 (when both X and Y is 9). Now, in the range of 22 and 40, only 27 and 36 are divisible by 9. Hence, X+Y must be 5 or 14. Thus the possible combinations are For, X+ Y = 5 X=0, Y =5 X=1, Y=4 X=2, Y=3 X=3, Y=2 X=4, Y=1 X=5, Y=0 For X+Y=14 X=5, Y=9 X=6, Y=8 X=7, Y=7 X=8, Y=6 X=9, Y=5 Possible pairs are 11.
