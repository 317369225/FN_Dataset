For certain ordered pairs (a,b) of real numbers, the system of equations ax+by=1, x²+y²=50 has at least one solution of ordered pair (x,y) of integers. Is the number of all ordered pairs (a,b) divisible by 2/3/5/7?
Each ordered pair (a,b) determine a unique straight line. If for some fixed (a,b) the system of equations has exactly one solution, then the straight line ax+by=1 is a tangent to the circle x²+y²=50. Else if the system of equations has exactly 2 solutions then the straight line must be a chord of the circle.(Note:There can't be more than 2 solutions) The non-negative integral solutions to x²+y²=50 are (1,7) and (5,5). Hence there are 12 integral solution of ordered pairs to the equation of the circle. The solution set is: S = { (1,7), (-1,-7), (1,-7), (-1,7), (7,1), (-7,-1), (7,-1), (-7,1), (5,5), (-5,-5), (5,-5), (-5,5) } Any two of these points determine a unique straight line. But the 6 straight lines determined by { <(1,7),(-1,-7)>, <(1,-7),(-1,7)>, <(7,1),(-7,-1)>, <(7,-1),(-7,1)>, <(5,5),(-5,-5)>, <(5,-5),(-5,5)> } pass through the origin whereas no straight line determined by the equation ax+by=1 passes through the origin. Hence there are (12 *11)/2 - 6 = 60 chords that intersect the circle at points with integer co-ordinates and do not pass through the origin. Also there are 12 tangents to the circle at the 12 points in S. Hence there are 60 + 12 = 72 ordered pairs (a,b). 2 and 3 divide 72.
