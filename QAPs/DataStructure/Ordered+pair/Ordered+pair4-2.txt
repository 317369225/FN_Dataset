How do you determine the shortest distance from the ordered pair (1,4) to the graph of y = x^2?
Another easy solution is using the logical reasoning that the point at which tangent to the curve is perpendicular to the line joining the point to (1,4) results in the shortest distance. Given curve is y=x² at any point (x’,y’) dy/dx=2x’ ( Slope of tangent at (x’,y’) to curve y=x² ) Slope of line joining (x’,y’) and (1,4) = (y’-4)/(x’-1) For perpendicular lines, product of slope is -1. Hence (y’-4)/(x’-1) × 2x’ = -1 Substitute y’ = (x’)² and simplify to get 2(x’)³ -7x’ -1 = 0 This equation has three roots out of which only one lies in the first quadrant, x’=1.9385. Now you can easily get the distance corresponding to this point.
