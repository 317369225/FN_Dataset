I need to order a pair of shoes and my size is 12 according to UK/India, but the size available is 12C and 13 C. What does that "C" mean?
In UK shoe sizing system which is also Indian C, D, E, F, G, H, is not generally used but in rare case like you because 12 is not normal size so manufacturer use these terminology this is only segmentation within the number. Like E or F is considered as medium H is largest and C is smallest this means 12C is smallest size of 12 and 12 H is largest. As per my advice please buy shoe after a trail whether it fits you well or not.
