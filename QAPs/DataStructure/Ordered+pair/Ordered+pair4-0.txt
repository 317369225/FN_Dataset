How do you determine the shortest distance from the ordered pair (1,4) to the graph of y = x^2?
You've got the formula for the distance to an arbitrary point (x,y) on the curve in terms of x.  You want to find which point on the curve is closest, so minimize that distance.  Take its derivative, set it to 0, and solve the resulting equations.  That will tell you where the closest point on the curve is. Here's a suggestion to simplify the computations whenever you want to minimize the distance of something: minimize the square of the distance instead.  You'll get the same value for x, but the derivative is easier to compute.
