How do you prove rigorously that [math](a,b)=(c,d)[/math] if and only if [math]a=c[/math] and [math]b=d[/math]?
You take a Kuratowski definition of an ordered pair: [math](a,b)=\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}[/math] and proceed using the set theoretical properties of [math]=[/math]. The proof will be in two parts one of which [math](a=c\wedge b=d)\Rightarrow(a,b)=(c,d)[/math] is almost trivial due to the explicit properties of [math]=[/math]. The whole rigorous proof by contraposition of [math](a=c\wedge b=d)\Leftarrow(a,b)=(c,d)[/math] will take 18 steps in one case ([math]a\neq c\Rightarrow((a,b)\neq(c,d))[/math]) and more than 50 in other ([math]b\neq d\Rightarrow((a,b)\neq(c,d))[/math]). However, it is not so difficult as one can believe.
