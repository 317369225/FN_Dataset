Is there an equation to represent a set of ordered pairs [math](x,y)[/math] in which  [math]x = n, n+1, n+2, n+3, \ldots [/math] and  [math]y[/math] is equal to  [math]n, 2n, 2(2n), 2(2(2n)), \ldots ?[/math]
For an actual equation, [math]y=2^{x-n}\cdot n[/math]. Then, as Alan said in another answer, any [math]n+k[/math] yields [math]2^k \cdot n[/math]. Of course, this is assuming n is a constant, and not a variable, in which case you would need a three-dimensional equation. Also, this is an equation containing the ordered pairs mentioned, but is not exclusively those ordered pairs.
