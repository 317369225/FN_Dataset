What are the most profound jokes ever?
There is another on business sense: A city boy, Raju, moved to the country and bought a donkey from an old farmer for Rs 100.00. The farmer agreed to deliver the donkey the next day. The next day the farmer drove up and said, "Sorry son, but I have some bad news, the donkey died last night." Raju replied: "Well then, just give me my money back." The farmer said: "Can't do that. I went and spent it already." Raju said: "OK then, just unload the donkey.." The farmer asked: "What ya gonna do with him?" Raju: "I'm going to raffle him off." (Note: To raffle is to sell a thing by lottery - draw lot - to a group of people each paying the same amount for a ticket) Farmer: "You can't raffle off a dead donkey!" Raju: "Sure I can. Watch me. I just won't tell anybody he's dead." A month later the farmer met up with Raju and asked, "What happened with that dead donkey?" Raju: "I raffled him off. I sold 500 tickets at two rupees a piece and made a profit of Rs. 898.00." Farmer: "Didn't anyone complain?" Raju: "Just the guy who won. So I gave him back his two rupees." PS: Read that years back somewhere. For Quora, I felt very lazy typing so copied the story from http://blogs.siliconindia.com/Ga...
