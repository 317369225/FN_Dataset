What are some of the most ridiculous proofs in mathematics?
Here's a proof I learned during a class on the foundations of math. It uses the von Neumann ordinal definition of the natural numbers. Claim: For all natural numbers [math]a[/math], [math]a \not < a[/math]. Proof: We use strong induction. [math]0[/math] is the empty set, so it contains no elements. In particular, it does not contain itself. Now suppose that for all [math]b < a[/math], we know that [math]b \not < b[/math]. Suppose [math]a < a[/math]. Then by the inductive hypothesis, [math]a \not < a[/math]. QED Updated 167w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
