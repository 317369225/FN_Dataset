What are some of the most ridiculous proofs in mathematics?
Let's prove the uncountability of the real numbers. Actually, let's play a game! I'll even let you go first. Here's how it works. You and I each take turns picking numbers in the interval [math][0,1][/math]. Your numbers have to keep increasing but always be less than my numbers, and my numbers have to keep decreasing but always be greater than your numbers. That is, if your [math]n[/math]th number is [math]a_n[/math] and mine is [math]b_n[/math], we require [math]a_{n-1} < a_n < b_n < b_{n-1}[/math]. Before the game starts, we pick a subset of the interval [math]T \subseteq [0,1][/math] to be a "target" set. You win the game if and only if [math]\lim_{n \to \infty}a_n \in T[/math]. If I can stop that from happening, I win. Lemma. If [math]T[/math] is countable, then I win. Proof. We can enumerate [math]T[/math] as [math]\{t_0,t_1,t_2,\dots\}[/math]. On turn [math]n[/math], I pick [math]b_n < t_n[/math] if I can, which makes your limit less than [math]t_n[/math]. If that's not a legal move, then [math]t_n \leq a_n[/math], which makes your limit greater than [math]t_n[/math]. Therefore, your limit isn't [math]t_n[/math]. But I can do this every turn, so your limit isn't in [math]T[/math], so I win. Lemma. If [math]T = [0,1][/math], then you win. Proof. Duh :). Corollary. [math][0,1][/math] is uncountable! In addition to its extreme cheekiness, I like the intuitive picture this proof gives me. True, we need the somewhat complicated machinery that is the completeness of [math][0,1][/math] to guarantee that the limit of your sequence exists, but I think that reliance is also a strength: it's exactly because of the completeness that there are "too many" numbers for me to block all of them. The paper this proof is from, Matthew Baker's Uncountable sets and an infinite real number game, follows that intuition to generalize this result. Updated 93w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
