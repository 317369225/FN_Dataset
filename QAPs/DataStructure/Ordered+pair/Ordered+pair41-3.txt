How do you formally define integers?
Here's how Charles Pinter does it in A Book of Abstract Algebra. What we want to do is find the minimum set of axioms that describe the integers uniquely. First, from basic abstract algebra we know the integers are an integral domain: a ring with the cancellation property ([math]ab=ac \Rightarrow b=c[/math]). That's a good start, but what else makes the integers the integers? Another important axiom is ordering, so we stipulate that the integers are an ordered integral domain: an integral domain with a relation [math]<[/math] that satisfies several commonsense axioms (for example, exactly one of the following is true for a particular [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math]: [math]a=b[/math], [math]a<b[/math],Â  or [math]a>b[/math]. One final property of the integers that seems innocuous but is extremely important is the well ordering property: every nonempty subset of positive integers has a least element. Let's call an ordered integral domain with the well ordering property an integral system. Now what? Here's the kicker: every integral system is isomorphic to the integers. That implies that an integral system is the integers! We've found a set of axioms that describes the integers uniquely. Notes: the selection of which axioms to use may seem to be a bit arbitrary; how did we know that the well ordering property was the axiom we needed instead of something else? It turns out that the well ordering property is the underlying basis of many other important basic theorems about the integers: the division algorithm, the principle of mathematical induction, and others.
