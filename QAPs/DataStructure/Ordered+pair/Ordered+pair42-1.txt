Two 1×1 squares are chosen from an 8×8 chessboard. What is the probability that they belong to the same 4×4 square?
The number of favorable cases is different depending on the position of the square in the chessboard. We can represent each square of the board by a pair (x, y) in terms of its coordinates. With the table below one can calculate the number of surfaces specified in square 1x1 depending pairs (x, y). Then the probabilities for each case: P = number of favorable outcomes / total number of cases. Example: (3.3)   --> P = 49/64 (0.0)     -->  P = 16/64. explanations: For a pair of coordinates (x, y) the square or rectangle corresponding to the favorable cases can be calculated: W (width) = f (x) H (height) = f (y) if   x [0 ... 3] => W = x +4 if   x [4 ... 7] => W =-x +11 ditto for H:  if y [0 ... 3] => H=y+4 if y   [4 ... 7] => H=-y +11 For any pair (x, y): Number of favorable cases= WxH and probability P = WxH / 64
