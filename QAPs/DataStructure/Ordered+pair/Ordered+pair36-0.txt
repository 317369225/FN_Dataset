How would you read α := (m, n) ↦ mn: ℕ × ℕ  → ℕ?
If by "read" you mean "read out loud", there is no standard; I would say, Let alpha be the function from N squared to N such that alpha of m and n equals m n If you really meant, "what does this mean", let's break it down. α :=The := symbol introduces a definition; what follows is the definition of [math]\alpha[/math], not an equality between two pre-existing quantities. (m, n) ↦ mnThe [math]\mapsto[/math] symbol means roughly "maps to". This expression denotes the function that maps (m, n) to mn. : ℕ × ℕ  → ℕThe colon is used to indicate the domain (before the arrow) and codomain (after the arrow) of a function. Here the domain is [math]\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}[/math] and the codomain is [math]\mathbb{N}[/math]. [math]\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}[/math] represents the Cartesian product of the set [math]\mathbb{N}[/math] with itself. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of ordered pairs where the first element comes from the first set and the second element comes from the second set; therefore [math]\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}[/math] is the set of pairs of natural numbers, also notated [math]\mathbb{N}^2[/math]. So the overall meaning is: let [math]\alpha[/math] be a function from the set of ordered pairs of naturals to the set of naturals, such that when it acts on the ordered pair [math](m, n)[/math], the result is [math]mn[/math].
