How can we multiply the tuples (ordered pairs)?
There are many ways to define multiplication of ordered pairs, and the one you use depends on what you're using it for. Multiplication is an operation that occurs in monoids, groups, rings, and other algebraic objects.  If you have two of these objects [math]A[/math] and [math]B[/math], then you can often form another one by defining a multiplication operation on [math]A\times B[/math], the set of ordered pairs where the first coordinate is an element of [math]A[/math] and the second coordinate is an element of [math]B[/math]. The most common definition is to define multiplication coordinatewise.         [math](a_1,b_1)(a_2,b_2)=(a_1a_2,b_1b_2)[/math] When [math]A=B[/math], there are other multiplications that can have useful applications.  For example, when [math]A=B=\mathbf R[/math], the field of real numbers, you can define        [math](a_1,b_1)(a_2,b_2)=(a_1a_2-b_1b_2,a_1b_2+b_1a_2)[/math] and that gives a multiplication corresponding to multiplication of complex numbers. For another example, when [math]A=B=\mathbf Q[/math], the field of rational numbers, you can define        [math](a_1,b_1)(a_2,b_2)=(a_1a_2+2b_1b_2,a_1b_2+b_1a_2)[/math] and that gives a multiplication corresponding to multiplication on [math]\mathbf Q[\sqrt2][/math], the field of rational numbers with [math]\sqrt2[/math] adjoined.
