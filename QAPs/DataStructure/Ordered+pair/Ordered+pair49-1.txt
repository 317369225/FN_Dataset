What is a "point" in calculus? As in "a line is tangent to the curve at one point"?
You're thinking of a point in one dimension. A point is a 0 dimensional object. Compare to a line- a line is a 1 dimensional object and, although it has to have width in order for you to see it when you draw it on paper, it isn't correct to think of it is a really thin 2D object. Think of a point as the intersection of two lines and a line as the intersection of two planes. Now, more appropriately, a point is an object in a space. Imagine that we have a finite, discrete space- the 2D space of all integer values of x and y with |x| ≤ 5 and |y| ≤ 5. Each pair of x,y coordinates is a point and we have 25 total points. Now extend this to R2. You now have an infinite number of points with an infinite number of points between any two initial points, but the definition of a point in terms of coordinates still holds. (0,1) is a point, (5,0) is a point and (e^2,√2) is a point. If you define a line by an equation, than a point on that line is an ordered pair of two numbers that will satisfy that equation. A line tangent to a curve at a point is similar to a line intersecting a curve at that point. Because a line and curve are both 1D (along with some existence/uniqueness theorems), their intersection will be 0D (i.e. a point). The special thing about a tangent, though, is that it passes through a single point without intersecting the curve. Even though it does not intersect, though, it still only crosses at a single point. A tangent line is sort of like the turning point for an intersecting line where it goes from intersecting on one side to intersecting on  its other side.
