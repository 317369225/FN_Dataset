Two 1×1 squares are chosen from an 8×8 chessboard. What is the probability that they belong to the same 4×4 square?
Probability of Two 1×1 squares belong to a 4×4 square = Probability (Vertical distance between the squares <= 4 and Horizontal distance between the squares <=4) Since the vertical distance between the 2 squares is completely independent of the horizontal distance, we can consider them as 2 independent events and apply the rule P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) P (Vertical distance between the squares <= 4) × P(Horizontal distance between the squares <=4) Lets calculate P (Vertical distance between the squares <= 4). For this we can consider the chess board to just have 8 squares in a single line. If we pick any 2 of those 8 squares, we need to calculate the probability that their distance is with in 4 squares. Lets say we pick square 1, the second square can be 3 of the remaining 7 squares. Hence the probability becomes 1/8 * 3/7. Applying the same logic, I am just adding up the probability for choosing every square in order 1/8*(3/7 + 4/7 + 5/7 +6/7 +6/7 + 5/7 + 4/7 +3/7) = 1/8 * ( 36 /7) =  9/14 P(Horizontal distance between the squares <=4) is also the same. So the answer is 9/14 * 9/14 = 81/196 If the same squares are allowed to be chosen again, P (Vertical distance between the squares <= 4) becomes 1/8*(4/8 + 5/8 + 6/8 +7/8 +7/8 + 6/8 + 5/8 +4/8) = 11/16, which makes the answer 121/256
