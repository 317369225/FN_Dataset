Let [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] both be positive integers less than or equal to 2015. For how many distinct ordered pairs [math](a,b)[/math] is the following expression also an integer? [math]\frac{a^2+b^2}{13}[/math]
The simplest method to attempt this would be to consider all the Pythagorean triples between 13 and 4030. Then we can factorise all of them and find those that are divisible by 13. Doing this method we can see that there are 600625 solutions as the vast majority of the Pythagorean triples are 0 (mod 13). Remember that in essence modular arithmetic is basically simple arithmetic but with everything divided by a factor, which is the mod in which the equation is solved.
