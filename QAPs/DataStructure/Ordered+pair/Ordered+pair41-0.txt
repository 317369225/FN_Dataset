How do you formally define integers?
It's not clear what your question is, so I'll interpret it one way. First, by integers you mean to include not just the positive ones but zero and the negative ones. I'll start by defining the term ring, then define ring homomorphism, then define the ring of integers. After that, an integer will be any element in the ring of integers. Definition. A commutative ring with unit (which we'll just call a ring) [math]R[/math] is a set equipped with two binary operations, addition and multiplication, denoted in the usual manner, which are both commutative and associative, both have identity elements (the additive identity denoted [math]0[/math] and the multiplicative identity denoted [math]1[/math]), addition has inverse elements (the additive inverse of [math]x[/math] denoted [math]-x[/math]), multiplication distributes over addition, and [math]0\neq1[/math]. In any ring you can define [math]x-y[/math] as [math]x+(-y)[/math] and prove many other properties of addition and multiplication such as the uniqueness of 0, the uniqueness of 1, uniqueness of negations, multiplication distributes over subtraction, and [math]0x=0[/math]. Definition. A ring homomorphism [math]f:R\to S[/math] between rings is a function that preserves addition, multiplication, and [math]1[/math]. That means [math]f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)[/math], [math]f(xy)=f(x)f(y)[/math], and [math]f(1)=1[/math]. You can prove ring homomorphisms will also preserve negation and subtraction. Definition. A ring of integers [math]Z[/math] is a ring such that for each ring [math]R[/math] there is a unique ring homomorphism [math]f:Z\to R[/math]. Given two rings of integers, there is a unique ring homomorphism from each to the other, and those ring homomorphisms give a one-to-one correspondence between them (a bijection). Thus, they may be thought of as the same ring of integers [math]\mathbf Z[/math] with different names for their elements. An integer, then, is just an element of [math]\mathbf Z[/math].
