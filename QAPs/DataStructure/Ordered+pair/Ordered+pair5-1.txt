How do I find the number of ordered pairs in the following problem?
1458000=2^4*3^6*5^3 I am making an assumption that x1,x2...can be equal too. [which makes the problem rather simple]. Also assuming that 1 is not being considered as a possible factor. [i'll try to develop further without these assumptions if time permits] let me try [correct me if i'm wrong]. we'll start with finding in how many ways we can put these 13 items in 5 different boxes. Since none of the boxes can be empty, we first need to fill them with at least one item= 13*12*11*10*9 =!13/!8 rest of the 8 items have 5 choices of boxes each= 8^5 every ordered sequence will have !5 permutations present in the groups formed above. hence number of possible such sets = {!13/(!8*!5)}*8^5=42172416
