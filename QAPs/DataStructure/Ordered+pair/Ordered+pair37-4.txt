Should interracial pairing be encouraged in order to eliminate all vestiges of what we call race?
Would you like to be Chinese or Indian? There are over 1 billion Chinese in the world. There are over 1 billion Indians in the world. What you're basically asking for is for every other ethnicity to get their blood completely washed away by the tidal wave that is South/East Asian numbers. The only place you'll be able to find blondes is if they stuffed the last living specimen in a museum. "Here is a reconstruction of a 'red-head' from fossil evidence. Their daily life consisted of watching football and avoiding direct sunlight." And once everyone in the world is either Chinese or Indian, you combine those two to get... well Thai people basically. Actually if everyone on planet earth was Thai that's a pretty cool outcome
