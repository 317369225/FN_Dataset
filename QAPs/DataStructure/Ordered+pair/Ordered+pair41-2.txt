How do you formally define integers?
Lets assume you have the natural numbers [math] \mathbb{N} [/math] at you disposal and now you want to construct the integers. The basic problem here is to  introduce a 'negation' operation and a 'subtraction' but you cannot define this directly on the naturals. The good thing is, we have an 'addition' operation [math] + [/math] defined on the naturals, so lets begin.. Start with the Cartesian product [math] \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} [/math] and define a relation ~ on its elements as follows: For [math](a,b), (c,d) \in \mathbb{N} [/math] we say [math](a,b)[/math]~([math]c,d)[/math] if we have [math]a+d=b+c[/math]. (You can see that the definition is rigged exactly so that [math]a-b=c-d[/math] but beware, we do not know subtraction yet!) Now, ~ has some very good properties: For [math]a,b,c,d,e,f \in \mathbb{N}[/math] [math](a,b)[/math]~[math](a,b)[/math] because [math]a+b=b+a[/math]. ( [math]+[/math] is commutative on the naturals!) This is the reflexive property. If [math](a,b)[/math]~[math](c,d)[/math], then [math]a+d=b+c[/math], so by commutativity again, [math]c+b=d+a[/math]. Thus, [math](c,d)[/math]~[math] (a,b) [/math]by definition. Thus, ~ is symmetric. Suppose [math](a,b)[/math]~[math](c,d)[/math] and [math](c,d)[/math]~[math](e,f)[/math]. Then we have [math]a+d=b+c[/math] and [math]c+f=d+e[/math], so adding the two equations (and using commutativity,associativity) we get [math]a+f+c+d=b+e+c+d[/math] and finally we can cancel out the [math]c+d[/math] in the ends to get [math](a,b)[/math]~[math](e,f)[/math]. This is called transitivity. A relation which satisfies the three properties listed above is called an equivalence relation. Why are these relations interesting? This is because if you have an equivalence relation on the elements of some set [math]X[/math], then you can partition [math]X[/math] into equivalence classes of elements. (*) As an example, if we look at our construction, what is the equivalence class of the element [math](1,0)[/math]? Its easy to see that it consists of precisely the elements [math](1,0), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3), \cdots[/math]. (and that this class is going to be called the integer [math]1[/math]!) What about the equivalence class of [math](2,4)[/math]? Is this class disjoint with the equivalence class of [math](1,0)[/math]? This should give a hint about what is going on. It is not hard to prove (*), try it! So, now that you can partition  [math]\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}[/math]  into equivalence classes, we have finally arrived at the definition of an integer. An integer is simply an equivalence class in  [math]\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}[/math], ~. That's it, that's the formal definition. But there is more to it. Now we can do much more things (using our 'prior knowledge' about how the integers should behave). Suppose that [math]C_1, C_2[/math] are equivalence classes, i.e, integers, and pick elements [math](a, b) \in C_1[/math], [math](x,y) \in C_2[/math]. We can negate integers; define the negation of [math](a,b)[/math], [math]-(a,b)[/math] to be [math](b,a)[/math]. We can also add and multiply integers, define addition as [math](a,b)+(x,y) := (a+x,b+y)[/math] and multiplication as [math](a,b) \cdot (x,y) := (ax+by, ay+bx)[/math].   The only thing to be checked here is that these definitions make sense, or in math terminology, are well-defined. That is, if I took some other element [math](a',b') \in C_1[/math], and since [math](a,b)[/math],[math](a',b')[/math] represent the same integer, I'd like to have [math]-(a,b)[/math] and [math]-(a',b')[/math] to represent the same integer as well, that is, we want [math](b,a)[/math]~[math](b',a')[/math]. But this is true because [math]a+b'=b+a'[/math]. I'll leave the addition and multiplication for you to check. And now, we can identify the natural numbers in the integers: By the definitions above,  [math](m,0)+(n,0)=(m+n,0)[/math] and [math](m,0) \cdot (n,0) = (mn,0)[/math]. Clearly, we can identify the equivalence class of [math](n,0)[/math] with the natural number [math]n[/math] and in this way the integers can be regarded as the set [math]\{ \cdots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \cdots \}[/math]. In a similar way, you can construct the rational numbers from [math]\mathbb{Z}[/math] now. The equivalence to use should be obvious, [math](a,b)[/math]~[math](c,d)[/math] iff [math]ad=bc[/math].
