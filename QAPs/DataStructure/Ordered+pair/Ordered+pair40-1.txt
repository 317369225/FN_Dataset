Set Theory:Â How can I prove that [math]\{a,\{a,b\}\}=\{c,\{c,d\}\}[/math] implies [math]a=c[/math] and [math]b=d[/math]?
Two sets are equal when all their elements are equal (by definition). Hence if {a, {a,b}} = {c,{c,d}} then we have that either: a = {c,d} and {a,b} = c a = c and {a,b} = {c,d} The first option leads to problems, if a = {c,d} and {a,b} = c. Then c = {a,b} = {{c,d},b}. Depending on what level you are studying this, you either declare it as impossible or need to do some work to show it disagrees with the axioms of Set theory. Since the first option leads to a wrong conclusion, the only remaining option is the second, an it is exactly the thing you need to prove.
