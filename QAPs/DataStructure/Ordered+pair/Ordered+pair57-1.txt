Why is the cross product of two sets all the combinations of their elements?
While I like Joseph Abrahamson's category-theory answer very much, I feel it's ahistorical, sort of like appealing to epsilon-delta proofs to explain calculus.  It's a rigorous foundation but it explains how we think of products now, not how the convention came to be.  And as a definition it's unique only up to isomorphism! The cross product, or Cartesian product, has its roots in Descartes' (and Fermat's) analytic geometry.   Even before the notion of a set was well-developed, mathematicians developed the idea of using a pair of coordinates (or a triple in three dimensions) to represent geometric points.  The general notion of Cartesian products was developed to match this notion of "tuples" and make it more rigorous.   (The set-theoretic definition of Cartesian products of arbitrary sets was developed by Cantor at the end of the 19th century.) In other words, the convention exists so that [math]\R \times \R[/math] is the Cartesian plane.  (Which, notably, does not have any missing points unless you're into projective geometry.) Set cross-products exist to provide a framework for making the intuitive notion of tuples into a well-founded mathematical object.
