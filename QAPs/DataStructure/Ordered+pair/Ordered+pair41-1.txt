How do you formally define integers?
The simplest formal definition of the integers, [math]\mathbb Z[/math], is as (equivalence classes of) ordered pairs, [math](a,b)[/math], of natural numbers, [math]a,b\in\mathbb N[/math]. The natural numbers themselves are typically defined by a primitive symbol for zero, a primitive "successor function" (together with some uniqueness axioms), and a definition for addition, [math]+[/math]. The equivalence classes are defined by the equivalence relation:      [math](a,b)\sim(c,d)\Leftrightarrow a+d=b+c[/math] Informally [math](a,b)[/math] is the difference between [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] or [math]a-b[/math]. We typically identify the equivalence class of [math](a,0)[/math] with [math]a[/math] and we write the equivalence class of [math](0,b)[/math] as [math]-b[/math], the additive inverse of [math]b.[/math] As a result we get the usual number line with negative integers heading off to the left and positive integers or natural numbers heading off to the right:
