Is the characterestic of the ring [math]\mathbb{Z}_3 \times 3\mathbb{Z}[/math] an ordered pair?
No, the characteristic of a ring is a natural number. The characteristic of a ring [math]R[/math] is the smallest number of times you need to add [math]1_R[/math] (the multiplicative identity) with itself to get [math]0_R[/math] (the additive identity). In your case,Â  this ring doesn't have a unit (obviously) because [math]3\mathbb{Z}[/math] doesn't have a unit. However, some authors, define the characteristic to be the least natural number [math]n[/math] such that [math]x+x+\ldots+x=0[/math] ([math]n[/math] summands) for every [math]x[/math] in the ring. If such a number doesn't exist, then we define the characteristic to be [math][/math]. This way, we can bypass the non - existence of a multiplicative identity. Now, I think it's obvious that in your case, the characteristic is [math][/math]. Indeed, for every [math](x,y)\in\mathbb{Z}_3\times 3\mathbb{Z}[/math], we have that [math]n\cdot y\neq0[/math] for every [math]y\neq 0[/math]. Therefore, the characteristic is [math]0[/math].
