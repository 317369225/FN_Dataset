How do you formally define integers?
You could define each integer as a set of ordered pairs of natural numbers: [math]0=\{(0,0), (1,1), (2,2),\cdots\} [/math] [math]1=\{(1,0), (2,1), (3,2),\cdots\}[/math] [math]-1=\{(0,1), (1,2), (2,3),\cdots\}[/math] [math]2=\{(2,0), (3,1), (4,2),\cdots\}[/math] [math]-2=\{(0,2), (1,3),(2,4),\cdots\}[/math] and so on. Assuming you have already constructed addition on N, you can formally construct the set of integers Z using the axioms of set theory: [math]\forall x\space [x\in Z \iff x\in P(N^2)[/math] [math]\land \exists a\in N \space[\forall b,c\in N \space[(b,c)\in x \iff b+a=c][/math] [math]\lor\forall b,c\in N \space[(b,c)\in x \iff c+a=b]]][/math] This has the advantage that you do not have to introduce a new form of equality outside of set theory.
