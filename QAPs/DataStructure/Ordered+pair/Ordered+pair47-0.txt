How does the square root of a negative number have an "imaginary" answer?
The adjective "imaginary" is a rather poor one to describe these numbers.  It is an historical artifact and we are stuck with it, but it is confusing. Imaginary numbers were first used as intermediate steps in solving cubic equations.  Just as there is a quadratic formula that solves all quadratic equations (of the form [math]ax^2 + bx + c = 0[/math]: [math]x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}[/math] (which may be somewhat familiar from high school) so there is a cubic formula, but it's kind of hairy (see The Cubic Formula). Even when the solutions to the cubic are "real" numbers, the numbers under the square root signs are sometimes negative.  At the time (the 16th century) this was a big problem (even negative numbers took a while to be accepted).  What was going on?  Those numbers didn't exist!  But the formula worked!  Oy vey! So, mathematicians said that the numbers were imaginary - they would be used in intermediate steps, but could not show up in a final answer. Then, gradually, these complex numbers got to be more accepted.  There are various other ways to represent complex numbers (e.g. as ordered pairs or as points on a plane) and the "real" and "imaginary" are now just anachronisms. On a broader note: I think this whole question illustrates a problem with how we teach math.  We teach math as if it was "obvious" or as if it is ordained.  But the best mathematicians on Earth were deeply confused by these issues for a long time.
