Is the set of all ordered pairs of the form [math](x,0)[/math] with the standard operations in [math]\mathbb{R}^{2}[/math] a vector space?
Yes, it is a vector space.  It's a subspace of  [math]\mathbf R^2[/math] of dimension 1.  Every straight line through the origin is such.                               Four 1-dimensional subspaces of the plane Likewise, every line passing through the origin in  [math]\mathbf R^3[/math]  is a subspace of dimension 1 in  [math]\mathbf R^3,[/math] and every plane passing through the origin in is a subspace of dimension 2. The origin itself is a subspace of dimension 0, and it's the only subspace of dimension 0.
