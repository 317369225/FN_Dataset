How do I find the number of ordered pairs in the following problem?
Basically the question is about how many ways to factorise 1458000 into 5 factors, where the order matters. [math]1458000 = 2^4 \times 3^6 \times 5^3[/math] Now consider only the power of 2, which is 4. How many ways to split or partition 4 into 5 pieces (for the 5 factors) ? eg 4+0+0+0+0 3+0+1+0+0 1+0+0+2+1 0+0+0+4 etc There are [math]\displaystyle\sum_{m=1}^{4+1} \sum_{n=1}^{m} \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}[/math] or 70 ways to do this. Now consider only the power of 3, which is 6. How many ways to split or partition 6 into 5 pieces (for the 5 factors) ? eg 6+0+0+0+0 5+0+1+0+0 1+0+0+4+1 0+0+0+6 etc There are [math]\displaystyle\sum_{m=1}^{6+1} \sum_{n=1}^{m} \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}[/math]  or  210 ways to do this. Now consider only the power of 5, which is 3. How many ways to split or partition 3 into 5 pieces (for the 5 factors) ? eg 3+0+0+0+0 2+0+1+0+0 1+0+0+1+1 0+0+0+3 etc There are [math]\displaystyle\sum_{m=1}^{3+1} \sum_{n=1}^{m} \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}[/math]  or  35 ways to do this. The number 1458000 is the product of these 3 sets of factors, so multiply 70 & 210 & 35 to get the total number of ways as 514500. EDIT: For a power P, I used [math]\displaystyle\sum_{m=1}^{P+1} \sum_{n=1}^{m} \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}[/math] The reasoning is as follows: For splitting P into 1 piece, there is only 1 way. For splitting P into 2 pieces, there are P+1 ways. ((sum of P+1 previous terms)) For splitting P into 3 pieces, there are P(P+1)/2 ways. ((sum of previous P+1 terms)) For splitting P into 4 pieces, there are [math]\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{P+1} \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}[/math] ways. ((sum of previous P+1 terms)) For splitting P into 5 piece2, there are [math]\displaystyle\sum_{m=1}^{P+1} \sum_{n=1}^{m} \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}[/math] ways. ((sum of previous P+1 terms)) RANT: this tiny text box is not easy for writing mathematics in proper format !!!!
