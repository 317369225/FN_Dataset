Should interracial pairing be encouraged in order to eliminate all vestiges of what we call race?
Bigfoot and I volunteer. We're self-sacrificial to the extent that this herculean task seems a mere trifle. Like, totally. We'll even act like we invented birthing and strut around like we're the first two to "make brown people". Just for you. Now, don't bring Hitler into this. Don't invoke Godwin's law before the discussion has even begun. People within a single race aren't somehow inbred, as you suggest. And no, Adam's video most decidedly doesn't "clearly show" how Hitler's plan was "fatally flawed". Because he was talking about dogs mating with their own parents, and even that was too disgusting for Hitler. Original question: Shouldn't we be making more brown people?
