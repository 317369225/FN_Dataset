Set Theory: What are Cartesian products?
The Cartesian product of sets A and B is the set of pairs whose first element comes from A and second element comes from B. (And also, in the same way, we can take a Cartesian product of any number of sets). Why call it a product? Well, there are a number of ways in which this relates to the web of other things in mathematics called products, but the most basic connection is that, in the familiar case where A and B are finite, so that we can think of their sizes as natural numbers, we find that the size of their Cartesian product is the product of their individual sizes. Why call it Cartesian? Well, René Descartes famously revolutionized geometry with the idea of representing the points in a plane by ordered pairs of coordinates (which lets us translate geometric questions into algebraic ones). Because of this, we attach his name to things involving ordered pairs (thus, in modern language, we could say his insight was to represent a plane by the Cartesian product of two axes).
