Which ordered pairs are in the relation R = {(x, y) | x > y} on the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4}?
You just have to analyze each possible pair of numbers! There are [math]2\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}=4*3=12[/math] different possible ordered pairs in this set such that in [math](x,y)[/math] we have [math]x\neq y[/math], by the Rule of product. Let's take a look. We have the 12 pairs: [math](1,2) or (2,1)[/math]; [math](1,3) or (3,1)[/math]; [math](1,4) or (4,1)[/math]; [math](2,3) or (3,2)[/math]; [math](2,4) or (4,2)[/math]; [math](3,4) or (4,3)[/math]; Do you agree these are all the pairs we have to analyze? All the pairs to the right satisfy [math]x>y[/math]. Thus, they are the answer pairs! Hope to have helped!
