How does the square root of a negative number have an "imaginary" answer?
The square root of a negative number has an "imaginary" answer in the same way that: The number added to four to get zero has a "negative" answer; The number you multiply by three to get one has a "rational" answer; The number squared that gives you two has an "irrational" answer; The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter has a "transcendental" answer; and [math]x^2+x+1=0[/math] has two "complex" answers. Don't confuse the words used for labels given to mathematical objects with the meaning of those words in English. They were connected once, but so were Christmas presents and Santa Claus :-) [math][\alpha_\beta][/math]
