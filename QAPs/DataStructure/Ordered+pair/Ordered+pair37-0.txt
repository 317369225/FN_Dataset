Should interracial pairing be encouraged in order to eliminate all vestiges of what we call race?
No. For several reasons: Interracial relationships would not eliminate racism or discrimination, even if everyone were the same skin tone. Look at European countries or Asian countries. Everyone looks fairly similar but there still are ways to distinguish/discriminate against people (skintone, hair color, social status, etc.). Interracial pairings wouldn't "eliminate all vestiges of what we call race" anyway. There would still be physical differences in people that could be categorized as racial differences. For example, all of these people have one white parent and one black parent: Troian Bellsario Shemar Moore Blake Griffin They all look nothing alike and would probably each be perceived as being different races.
