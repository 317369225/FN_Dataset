Are "equivalent" and "equal" the same?
Not quite. But there is an equivalence that makes them equal :-) An equivalence relation, [math]\sim[/math], is a binary relation on a set that is Reflexive: [math]x\sim x[/math] Symmetric: [math]x\sim y\Leftrightarrow y\sim x[/math] Transitive: [math]x\sim y\land y\sim z\Rightarrow x\sim z[/math] Two elements of a set are said to be equivalent (under a given equivalence relation, [math]\sim[/math]) if [math]x\sim y[/math], sometimes written [math]x\equiv_{\sim}y[/math] or just [math]x\equiv y[/math]. But members of a set are equal, only if they are the same element of the set. Given any equivalence relation, we can create a new quotient set in which the members of the set are equivalence classes from the parent set. Two elements in the parent set are equivalent if and only if they are the same element (equal elements) of the quotient set. The best known example is the rational numbers, [math]\mathbb Q[/math], which can be defined as a quotient set on ordered pairs of natural numbers, [math]\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}[/math]. As ordered pairs of natural numbers we define addition and multiplication by: [math](a,b)+(c,d)=(ad+bc,bd)[/math] [math](a,b)\times(c,d)=(ac,bd)[/math] So, for example, we have [math](1,3)+(1,3)=(6,9)[/math], but we would like this to be equivalent to [math](2,3)[/math], so we define an equivalence relation on our ordered pairs by      [math](a,b)\sim(c,d)\Leftrightarrow ad=bc[/math] Then [math](6,9)\sim(2,3)[/math] because [math]6\times3=18=9\times2[/math]. We take the quotient set of the ordered pairs under this equivalence relation and write elements of the quotient set with a special notation in which:      [math]\frac69=\frac23[/math] which means [math](6,9)\equiv_{\sim}(2,3)[/math] We then forget the whole notion of equivalence classes and write things like:      [math]\frac12+\frac13+\frac16=1[/math] where the [math]1[/math] on the right hand side is "really" an equivalence class of ordered pairs like [math](n,n)[/math]. Sometimes I will write things like      [math]x^2-y^2\equiv(x+y)(x-y)[/math] as an equivalence rather than an equality to emphasize that the equality applies to all members of the sets from which [math]x,y[/math] are chosen, whereas      [math]x^2-y^2=(x+y)(x-y)[/math] is, strictly speaking, only true for some quotient set defined on algebraic expressions. It's all rather pedantic and formal. It only really matters if you want to get very rigorous which most of us want to do on only rather rare occasions :-) Updated 9w ago • View Upvotes
