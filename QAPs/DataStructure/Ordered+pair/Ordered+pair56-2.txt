Are complex numbers and vectors over [math]\mathbb{R}^{2}[/math] (2-tuple) the same thing?
Not at all. What must have got you confused is, I am guessing, [math]1+2i[/math] is sometimes represented as (1,2) in literature. But the (1,2) of [math]1+2i[/math] is not the same as the (1,2) of the [math]R^2[/math]. They're just using the same representation to talk about different things. This is like saying, since French and English both use the same Latin-derived alphabet (A,B,C,D...) they're both the same language. For example, the operation [math]i*i = -1[/math] (where * stands for multiplication) has no equivalent in the [math]R^2[/math] system. (0,1), which is the representation of  [math]i[/math],  cannot multiply (I am only considering dot and vector multiplications here) with itself and output (-1,0). Oh, and by the way, 2-tuples don't necessarily mean [math]R^2[/math]. They're just an ordered collection of 2 objects. You can read about it here Tuple
