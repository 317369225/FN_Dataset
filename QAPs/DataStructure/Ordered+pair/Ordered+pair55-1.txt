How many pairs of X and Y is possible in the number f 763X4Y2 if the number is divisible by 9?
763X4Y2 is divisible by 9 means (7+6+3+X+4+Y+2)=multiple of 9 i.e. X+Y+22=9k k can't be 0, 1 or 2 for obvious reasons. It can't be greater than 4 either as X, Y are digits not numbers. So, k=3, 4. X+Y=5 yields 6 sets of values: (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0); X+Y=14 yields 5 sets: (5, 9), (6, 8), (7, 7), (8, 6), (9, 5) So, total 11 (X, Y) pairs.
