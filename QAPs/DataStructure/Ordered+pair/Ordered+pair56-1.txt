Are complex numbers and vectors over [math]\mathbb{R}^{2}[/math] (2-tuple) the same thing?
As vector spaces, they are isomorphic. That means they are essentially the same as long as you don't want to do anything more than add things together and multiply them by real numbers. If you want additional structure, for example full multiplication, they they aren't the same at all. Complex numbers multiply together in a very specific way. Vectors in R^2 either cannot multiplied (if you think of it as just a vector space) or are multiplied in a completely different way (if you view it as the full Euclidean plane).
