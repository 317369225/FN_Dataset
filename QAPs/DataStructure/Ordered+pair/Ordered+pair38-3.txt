Set Theory: What are Cartesian products?
A Cartesian product is an operation which returns a set from multiple sets.  This is what my high school math teacher told me which confused me to death.  Later that afternoon, my mom explained this to me in terms I could understand.  She took a deck of cards and showed me the that each card consists of a value and a suit.  The values are one set of 13 and the suits are another of 4.  If you take the product of those two sets you get the set of 52 cards as ordered pairs, Ace of Spades, three of hearts etc. The actual operation looks like a rectangle with 13 values on one side and 4 on the other making 52 ordered pairs.
