P and Q are two digit numbers. Their product equals the product of the numbers obtained reversing them. None of the digits in P or Q is equal to the other digit in it or any digit in the other number. The product of tens digits of the two numbers is a composite single digit number. How many order pairs (P,Q) satisfy these conditions?
Let P = 10a+b        Q=10x+y so,  as per question (10a+b)(10x+y)=(10b+a)(10y+x) on solving we get ,  ax=by  and also a,b,x,y are all distinct. (given) a*x lies in {4,6,8,9}  a/b = y/x     Keeping , this in mind and taking values a*x , such that all a,b,x,y are distinct and a*x lies in {4,6,8,9}  we can get our solution.
