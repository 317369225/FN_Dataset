How do you determine the shortest distance from the ordered pair (1,4) to the graph of y = x^2?
Minimizing the distance between two points is equivalent to minimizing the square of the distance between two points. In that case the quantity we want to minimize which we will denote by [math]{s^2}[/math] is [math]{s^2} = \Delta {x^2} + \Delta {y^2}[/math]. In the case you specified, where we are calculating the distance between any point on the curve [math]y = {x^2}[/math] and [math](1,4)[/math], the distance formula takes on the form: [math]{s^2} = {\left( {4 - {x^2}} \right)^2} + {\left( {1 - x} \right)^2}[/math] Let's go ahead and minimize this value with respect to x. [math]{{d{s^2}} \over {dx}} = 2\left( {4 - {x^2}} \right)\left( { - 2x} \right) - 2\left( {1 - x} \right) = 0[/math] Cleaning it up a bit, we get that [math]4{x^3} - 14x - 2 = 0[/math] Solving this equation gives us that x = -1.795Â  x = - 0.144 x = 1.939 Our minimum value is one of these three. The other two correspond to the local maximum of the distance. Sure, we can do second derivate tests but the best way to do is to look at quadrants, the point (1,4) is in the first quadrant. The only solution also in the first quadrant is when x=1.939. Crossing our fingers, let's go ahead with this as the value of x that minimizes the distance. In fact we can check it graphically: We can see that the the distance is between the point and the curve is pretty damn small. Therefore the point on the curve that's closest to the point (1,4) is [math](1.939,{1.939^2})[/math] Hope that helps
