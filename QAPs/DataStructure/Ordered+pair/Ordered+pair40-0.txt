Set Theory: How can I prove that [math]\{a,\{a,b\}\}=\{c,\{c,d\}\}[/math] implies [math]a=c[/math] and [math]b=d[/math]?
The axiom of regularity, also called the axiom of foundation, is needed to prove this theorem. Two important consequences of the axiom of regularity are No set is an element of itself. For any two sets, at most one can be an element of the otherWe'll need both of those. From the first one, [math]a[/math] is an element of [math]\{a,b\}[/math], so it cannot equal [math]\{a,b\}[/math]. Therefore, the set [math]\{a,\{a,b\}\}[/math] has two distinct elements. Likewise, the set [math]\{c,\{c,d\}\}[/math] has two distinct elements. We are given that [math]\{a,\{a,b\}\}=\{c,\{c,d\}\}[/math]. Since this set has two elements, there are two possible cases: Case 1 in which [math]a=c[/math] and [math]\{a,b\}=\{c,d\}[/math], and case 2 in which [math]a=\{c,d\}[/math] and [math]\{a,b\}=c[/math]. Take those two cases in turn. Case 1. [math]a=c[/math] and [math]\{a,b\}=\{c,d\}[/math]. We can write the second equation as [math]\{a,b\}=\{a,d\}[/math] Either this set has one or two elements. If one element, then [math]a=b=d[/math]. But if it has two elements, since one of them is [math]a[/math], so the other has to be [math]b=d[/math]. So, whether it has one or two elements, [math]b=d[/math]. Case 2. [math]a=\{c,d\}[/math] and [math]\{a,b\}=c[/math]. Here, [math]a[/math] and [math]c[/math] are each elements of the other, contradicting the second bullet point above. So case 2 never happens. Since case 2 can't happen, and in case 1 both [math]a=c[/math] and [math]b=d[/math], that proves the theorem.             Q.E.D. This is an important theorem since it allows an ordered pair [math](a,b)[/math] of sets to be defined as the set [math]\{a,\{a,b\}\}[/math]. The theorem implies that the ordered pair [math](a,b)[/math] is equal to the ordered pair [math](c,d)[/math] if and only if both [math]a=c[/math] and [math]b=d[/math].
