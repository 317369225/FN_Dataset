Why were complex numbers invented?  Were they invented to explain a physical phenomenon or do they really "exist"
The major impetus behind the development of imaginary numbers was the solution for the general cubic equation [math]ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0[/math].  There is a general solution, but unlike the quadratic formula, it involves imaginary numbers even when all the roots are real.  Up until then, people were happy to ignore imaginary solutions to quadratics, but this simply wasn't possible with cubics. As to whether they exist, that's tough to answer.  But if the real numbers exist, then I can define operations on ordered pairs of real numbers that make them behave exactly like complex numbers.  To wit: [math](a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d)[/math] [math](a, b) \times (c, d) = (ac - bd, ad + bc)[/math] So if the real numbers exist, then complex numbers can be said to exist too.
