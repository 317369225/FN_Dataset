What is the number of ordered pairs (n,m) of positive integers that satisfy n^3+7n−133=m^3?
Take the equation as: n^3+7n=m^3+133 n(n^2+7)=m^3+133 If n is even, the LHS is even. If n is odd, the LHS is still even, as n^2+7 will be addition of 2 odd terms.   Hence, in both cases, LHS is even. To satisfy the constraints, RHS must be even. Meaning m^3 is always odd. We notice 7n-133 is the difference between cubes of n and m. Any value of n>19 cannot satisfy the above equation. I used a computer here to get results, and the pairs of (n,m) satisfying the equation are: (1, -5) (5, 3) (6, 5) (19, 19) Discard the first pair to get all the ordered pairs of positive integers (n,m).
