What is an integer?
The set of integers is denoted Z. Z = {The numbers you count with (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ...) & 0 & the negatives of the numbers you count with (e.g. -1, -2, -3, ...)} Note that there are infinitely many integers since you can always add one to an integer to get one greater or subtract 1 to get one lesser. An integer plus an integer is always an integer. An integer minus an integer is always an integer. An integer times an integer is always an integer. An integer divided by an integer is not always an integer, but it is always a rational number (unless you divide by the integer zero). Updated 99w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
