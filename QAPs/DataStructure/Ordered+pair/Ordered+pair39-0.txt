What is the physical significance and use of equivalence relation in math?
It's strange that you ask for a physical significance of equivalence relations, so I'm not sure what I write here will respond to your question. Many equivalence relations arise from the use of the word "same".  For example, one equivalence relation on physical objects is the one which defines two objects as being equivalent if they have the same mass. The interesting equivalence relations are those that don't seem to arise from the two things being the same in some way.  Those can be used to create new abstract things, and once they're created, then you can describe the original equivalence relation in terms of something being the same. For example, if you take ordered pairs of integers (a,b) where the second integer b is not 0, then you can define an equivalence relation on them by saying                        (a,b) is equivalent to (c,d)  if  ad = bc. That is an equivalence relation since it's reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.  You can then say an equivalence class of that equivalence relation is a rational number and denote the equivalence class of the ordered pair (a,b) as a/b.  That creates rational numbers from integers.   Now two such ordered pairs are equivalent by the original equivalence relation if they name the same rational number.
