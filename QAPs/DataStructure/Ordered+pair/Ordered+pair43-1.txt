Are "equivalent" and "equal" the same?
In the context of algebraic equations with a variable, such as "2x + x = 18"  and "2x + x = 3x" they are not the same concept.    "Equivalent" is used to refer to sequences of operations (functions) and "equal" is used to refer to numbers. In each sentence above the symbol "=" is pronounced "equals," nevertheless there are two distinct meanings of "=" employed.  The first sentence is about numbers and the second about sequences of operations (functions).     "2x + x" is "equivalent" to "3x" because they always represent the same number. The sentence "2x + x = 3x" does not help specify "x".  "2x + x = 3x" for all x. It abbreviates  the generalization "2x + x = 3x for all x." It is always true. The two (different) sequences of operations represented by "2x + x" and "3x" are said to be "equivalent" (and, the numbers are equal. Yes, the numbers are equal but the meaning is at a more-abstract level--the level of functions.   On the other hand the sentence "2x + x = 18" identifies a number (x = 6 makes it true). The sentence is not always true. It is critical to its meaning that that sentence can be false. Otherwise, it could not distinguish one number from another. If x = 0 it is false. "2x + x" equals "18" if and only if x = 6.  But "2x + x" is not equivalent to "18"-- it is just equal in that one particular case when x = 6.   In summary, in this context, "equivalent" is something like "always equal" and refers to the higher-level concept "function."   The mathematical terms "equivalent" and "equal" are used in other mathematical contexts too, which this explanation does not address.
