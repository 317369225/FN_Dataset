Why do recording artists that sing cover versions always sing them in exactly the same key as the original? Have they never heard of transposing software?
People change the key of songs all the time. Anyone who plays with a singer should expect to be doing some transposition. This is not especially difficult for a competent musician and may involve nothing more than applying a capo to a guitar and playing the same shapes, though it depends on the instrument. On a piano certain transpositions are easier than others, for instance. My limited understanding is that it works on the circle of fifths most easily, which makes sense in terms of the chord shape changes. Software that can generate a new chart can be helpful if you need to do it on the fly in a live performance but it's certainly not necessary, at least for improvised parts. I transposed an improvised bass line to "On Green Dolphin Street" last night with no chart and I'm certainly not a pro (though I can hang on jazz bass). There are limits, though. Some songs sound better in their original keys, or at least in nearby keys. For instance of you tried to push a Led Zeppelin song a fourth down it would probably start to sound silly. Pitch shifting software sounds like Alvin and the Chipmunks if you do too much with it and it'll start to sound glitchy even at lower levels. That's how the autotune effect works.
