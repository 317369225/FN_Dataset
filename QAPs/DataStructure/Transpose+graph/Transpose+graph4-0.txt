To solve a maximum flow problem in a directed bipartite graph (NOT bipartite matching),which algorithm is the most efficient?
Dinic's and Pushâ€“relabel flow algorithms are best choices here. Although Dinic has an worst case complexity of [math]O(V^{2}E)[/math] and Push-relabel has [math]O(V^3)[/math], in practice it is extremely rare for them to reach that worst case. Most of the times they will run way under [math]O(V^2)[/math] or [math]O(VE)[/math]. For graphs with unit capacity edges (which I think is the case of your graph) it is even lower. For example, Dinic has an worst case complexity of [math]O(\sqrt{V}E)[/math] for this kind of graph. Of course, like the previous variant, it runs far less in most cases.
