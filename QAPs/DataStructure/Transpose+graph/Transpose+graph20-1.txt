What is a key in music?
A key is the "foundation scale" for a musical piece, but as far as normal people are concerned, one of the most trivial aspects of a musical piece. If I took a "Sonata in D" and transposed the whole thing to a "Sonata in C", all things equal, it would sound like exactly the same piece except that the whole thing is a bit lower now. Key is sort of like a pitch offset. So in math terms, let's say I had a graph of a function. Changing a key would be like simply giving a y-offset to the entire function. e.g. y = x^2 vs y = x^2 + 1. The shape, feeling, and everything that defines the piece would still remain the same. The analogy of using a color to represent a key is relevant only to highly trained musicians and a minority of the population. To these people, indeed the key of A major sounds more "bright" than the key of A flat major. However, the differences are extremely subtle and only noticeable by a small percentage of the population. Colors are much more analogous to chords than keys, because if you change a chord, such as adding a 3rd or a 9th, you have changed the way it feels and "tastes". The things that matter most in a musical piece is not its "offset", but rather its constituent pitches relative to each other. That is why melody, rhythm, and chords are much more relevant to how a musical piece sounds than its key.
