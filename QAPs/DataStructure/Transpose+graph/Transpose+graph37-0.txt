What things should be learnt in MATLAB as an EEE student?
What things should be learnt in MATLAB as an EEE student? Matlab is a general purpose technical/math programming language with a matrix orientation. There are other similar programs including Octave, Euler, Mathematica, Maple, MathCad, SciLab, R, and others. Matlab's forte is matrix arithmetic. In fact, MatLab originally stood for Matrix Lab. Matlab offers "toolboxes" with ready built functions to handle different technical disciplines such as control engineering, or image processing, or communications signal processing. If the math associated with the discipline is matrix oriented (particularly 1 x N vectors), then Matlab is a good choice of programming language. The real power of Matlab is in the toolboxes and particularly a graphical programming add-on called Simulink. MatLab/Simulink is widely used and probably the premier tool for communications signal processing. So I would say that for the sub-discipline in EEE you are pursuing, you should probably be familiar with both basic Matlab and the toolbox that supports the discipline. If you are going into control, then the Control Toolbox, communications then Simulink and the Communications Toolbox, antennas then the Electromagnetic Toolbox, and so forth. Matlab has a Symbolic Math Toolbox that enables it to do symbolic math similar to Mathematica. In basic Matlab, you should know how to do linear algebra, how to plot, and how to create a function so others can use your software. Matlab is all about getting numerical answers out and probably less oriented towards documenting your work.
