I would like to use evolutionary algorithms for engineering optimization, is it good to use python?
Both python and matlab are well suited to the task in general.  Both have useful libraries to provide most of the tools you'll need.  I've written algorithms for robotics based on ACO (that evolutionary algorithm that isn't GA) in matlab, and found it to be a nice fit.  I've also tinkered a bit with numpy and scipy and found them to be pretty nice.  The most important questions are whether you're already more comfortable in one or the other, and whether other people will need to maintain or update the code, and what they may be used to.  You mention that this is an engineering problem, if you're working in an academic lab in an engineering program you may find that most of the department uses matlab.  If you're outside engineering, python may be more common.  If you need to tie a website to your algorithm, definitely choose python.  If you need to generate pretty pictures, matlab may have a slight advantage over python there. It is worth mentioning that matlab of course has the disadvantage of being not free.  That said, you may wind up paying for a python IDE, and since you ask for an IDE recommendation I will say that at the moment I am using Pycharm and enjoying most aspects of it.
