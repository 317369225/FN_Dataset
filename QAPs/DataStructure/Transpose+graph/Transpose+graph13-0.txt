What exactly is a logistic regression algorithm in machine learning. What are its applications?
"_____ regression" means fitting a particular family of function to data: "linear regression" means obtaining a best-fine line; "polynomial regression" means obtaining a best-fit polynomial (of given degree); and "logistic regression" means obtaining a best-fit logistic function. Figure: Logistic functionÂ  [math]y = \frac{1}{a + b e^{- c x}}[/math] Since the logistic function has two different asymptotes, it can be used to divide data into "yes/no" categories -- the low side being "no" and the high side being "yes." All of this is covered in pretty basic terms in Andrew Ng's machine learning lectures, which you can watch online for free.
