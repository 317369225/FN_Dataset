What are the applications of logic programming?
Logic programming is widely used in parsing, both in natural languages and programming languages.  Using Definite Clause Grammars in SWI-Prolog is a good tutorial to learn DCG in SWI-Prolog. Since the creator of logic programming is also an linguist, it once was widely used in natural language processing(NLP), mostly in parsing natural language processing and generating natural language. Prolog and Natural language analysis is a book about this topic. But nowadays, NLP is mostly occupied by  statistic approach. Since it is really easy to write an parser in Prolog, it is also quite often used to implement new programming. The first interpreter of Erlang Programming Language is written in Prolog.  You can read Joe Armstrong origin paper Use Prolog to implement an new programming languages .  Or you can check Markus Triska Lisprolog - Interpreter for a simple Lisp, written in Prolog to see how to write an lisp interpreter in 100-200 lines of code. Logic programming is also used widely when there are a lot of relations, like in semantic web's RDF manipulation(which you can view it as the root of Knowledge Graph ).  There are also some library to do constrained logic programming which is quite interesting and exciting. For example, the following program from Rosetta Code solve the Soduku using the clpfd library. IMO, it is extremely short and elegant. :- use_module(library(clpfd)). sudoku(Rows) :-        length(Rows, 9), maplist(length_(9), Rows),        append(Rows, Vs), Vs ins 1..9,        maplist(all_distinct, Rows),        transpose(Rows, Columns), maplist(all_distinct, Columns),        Rows = [A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I],        blocks(A, B, C), blocks(D, E, F), blocks(G, H, I). length_(L, Ls) :- length(Ls, L). blocks([], [], []).blocks([A,B,C|Bs1], [D,E,F|Bs2], [G,H,I|Bs3]) :-        all_distinct([A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I]),        blocks(Bs1, Bs2, Bs3). problem(1, [[_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_],            [_,_,_,_,_,3,_,8,5],            [_,_,1,_,2,_,_,_,_],            [_,_,_,5,_,7,_,_,_],            [_,_,4,_,_,_,1,_,_],            [_,9,_,_,_,_,_,_,_],            [5,_,_,_,_,_,_,7,3],            [_,_,2,_,1,_,_,_,_],            [_,_,_,_,4,_,_,_,9]]).
