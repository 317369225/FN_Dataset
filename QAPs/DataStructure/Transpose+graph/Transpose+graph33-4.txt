If I transpose a piece of music to a different key in equal temperament (where all half-steps have the same size independent of the key), does the piece feel qualitatively different to people without absolute pitch?
What a fascinating question.   I don't know other people's answers, but I love music and am a very emotional person. I don't have absolute pitch. To me, the emotional quality of a piece comes from its melody and harmony and other aspects (such as lyrics and context), and I am unaware of any emotional quality associated with the key.   For example, I often sing in the shower, and I require to transpose some songs to match my vocal range. This seems not to affect their emotional qualities for me.
