If I transpose a piece of music to a different key in equal temperament (where all half-steps have the same size independent of the key), does the piece feel qualitatively different to people without absolute pitch?
I don't know but I'm interested. Some people assert that different keys have different flavors or feelings to them and have assigned particular qualities to each key. Certainly, the same music has a different feeling in a different key for the person[s] executing the music, partly because it's in a different range -- singers and wind instrumentalists may have to exert themselves more in higher keys, for example -- and partly because instrumental fingerings and other execution-related elements are different in different keys. These and other differences definitely make the music sound different, sometimes dramatically so, but they're secondary to your basic question. I don't have perfect pitch, and I often can't tell when music is transposed, but I have no doubt that others are more sensitive than I am. The problem is knowing what aspects of the differences are inherent in the key itself and what are manifestations of those other secondary factors. I've never encountered a definitive answer.
