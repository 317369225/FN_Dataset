What saxophone is this? (Look in description)
I think you found your answer: the serial number. C.G. Conn Ltd. (Conn Instruments) made these C-melody horns called "Wonder I" and "Wonder II", also known as "Wonder Improved" in the 1920's. I was able to find this information on the helpful website http://saxophone.org at their Saxophone Serial Number Reference page. As for playing a C horn using Bb charts, you can teach yourself to transpose instantaneously as you're playing. I used to read Bb charts playing an Eb alto saxophone, and given enough practice, you will get good quickly. Updated 10w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
