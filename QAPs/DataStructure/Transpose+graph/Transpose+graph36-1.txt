Is linear algebra generally less intuitive than other mathematics?
To the contrary, I think there's a great deal of intuition that one can get by the end of a good first course in linear algebra. The suspicion that linear algebra is less intuitive than other areas might be justified from the first few topics in many linear algebra courses:  after all, it just seems like you're pushing around arrays of numbers using apparently arbitrary rules, to reach an apparently arbitrary goal -- a "row reduced matrix," most of the time. Okay maybe it's not all that arbitrary, if you think of it as solving systems of linear equations.  But still, kinda arbitrary, right? But then you learn about the real bread and butter of linear algebra:  vector spaces, linear transformations, invertibility, spans, rank, kernel, etc. I taught linear algebra in graduate school.  On the first day, I cautioned my students that the first couple weeks might seem like monkey work... mindless manipulation of symbols.  But I promised them that there will be good stuff in short order.  And when we got through all those "bread and butter" concepts, I actually took a lecture or two to discuss what I called the "zen" of linear algebra:  connecting the apparently mindless manipulation of symbols from the first couple weeks to the more abstract vocabulary we had just learned.  Once you get the "zen" of it all, everything becomes trivial.  (Okay, maybe not trivial... but at least clear.)  I think that's the very definition of an intuitive understanding.
