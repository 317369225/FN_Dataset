Is music theory necessary to master guitar playing?
I am answering this question assuming that mastering the guitar means being able to write great music with the guitar. No! But music theory can help you compensate for some flaws in your ears. Problem is most musicians build themselves on theory and not on their ears. Very sharp ears are a necessity if you want to be as good as your heroes or as you said, master the guitar. There is no substitute to a pair of sharp ears. Music theory can 'guide' you, but depending on it will leave you like millions of other players. It can help you make a more informed 'guess' while transcribing, but sharp ears will give you the ultimate authority, i.e. you can transcribe confidently and also create what you truly want to, whether or not it conforms to the  'rules' of music theory. Theoretically no, practically yes, but depend on your ears as much as you can. Watch this video; listen to what this master has to say. Updated 2w ago • View Upvotes
