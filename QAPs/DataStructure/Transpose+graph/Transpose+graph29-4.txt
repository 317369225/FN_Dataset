Is music theory necessary to master guitar playing?
I am not really sure what "master guitar playing" means (must be the same as "the best") but yeah most really high level guitarists (but not all) know some music theory. Theory gives you knowledge of what tends to go well together and an ability to communicate with other musicians. There are some folks who are so intuitive they don't need theory and can't read, but that's not true for most good players.
