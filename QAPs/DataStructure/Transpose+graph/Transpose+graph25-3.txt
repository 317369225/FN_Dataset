Guitars: How should a beginner learn music theory?
Learn a song, learn the theory needed to understand the song, rinse, lather, repeat. Example: Lots of songs become more comprehensible when you understand the notion of Secondary dominant. Take a very simple song like Robert Johnson's "Love in Vain". It's a 12 bar blues. If you play it in G the chords are: G7 G7 G7 G7 C7 C7 G7 G7 A7 D7 G7 G7 So the G7 is the tonic (in blues tradition we throw in the 7 even on the tonic), the C7 is the four, and the D7 is the five. This is the four in classic blues one-four-five-one. Wait, what's the A7? It's not in G but it is the dominant of the D7, which is the five of G. It's a secondary dominant, here the five-of-five. It adds a little extra push to the motion back to the tonic and lets the melody be more interesting. Once you get what this chord is doing here, you'll start to see it everywhere!
