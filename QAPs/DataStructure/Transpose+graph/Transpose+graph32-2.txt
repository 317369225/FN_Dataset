What is an exhaustive list of the most important things a versatile piano player should know/be able to do?
I agree with Phil's assessment of Chopin etudes.  Those etudes will help a pianist gain a solid technique, although to even attempt them, a fairly decent technique is necessary.  That can be gained with practice and other exercises such as Czerny and Hanon (although you want to exhibit caution if you attempt them without someone to guide you, as they can cause injury if practiced incorrectly).  Scales and arpeggios are a good bet too.  However, to be truly versatile one needs to understand different styles as well.  In jazz, for example, you want to know the different chords and ways of playing those chords inside-out so you can improvise on them without hesitating.  That comes with practice.  Improvisation comes with practice too... perhaps starting simple with a walking bass and learning some famous solos would be a good start.  Then start deviating from the solos.  Transcribing them is good ear training practice too.  In these days, it is also a good idea of how to play contemporary techniques like the "banshee effect" or stopping strings.  A good sense of rhythm is also critical for many pieces.  In general, I think it is important to have a good ear and to be flexible.
