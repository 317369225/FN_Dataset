Why do recording artists that sing cover versions always sing them in exactly the same key as the original? Have they never heard of transposing software?
They don't ... Dream Theater and other bands OFTEN change the key of cover songs to better fit the singer or whatever.Â  Since they are trained musicians they know how to transpose easily without software...
