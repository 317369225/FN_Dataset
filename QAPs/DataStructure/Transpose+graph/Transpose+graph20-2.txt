What is a key in music?
Think of the word "key" used as a synonym for "important," or "fundamental." (As in, "this is the key issue...") What color is this painting? ("Escape" by Alfred Gockel) Obviously there are several colors, but if you had to name only one color, you would probably say "red." The other colors play against that basic foundation. If Gockel had used blue in place of the red, the painting would be fundamentally different. The black and orange could stay as they are, but they would look different against the blue foundation. Painters study "color theory" for basically the same reason musicians (and bass players) study "music theory:" to learn what effects are produced by combining the different colors. A "C" reacts differently to the key of G than it does to the key of E-flat.
