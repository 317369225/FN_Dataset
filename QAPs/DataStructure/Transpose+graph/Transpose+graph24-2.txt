Where can someone find a good database of free piano sheet music?
The International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP) has a huge collection of scanned public domain sheet music: http://imslp.org/wiki/. It's mostly geared towards classical music (piano works, concerti, symphonies, etc...) up until the early 20th century. Unfortunately, copyright kicks in after that, so you won't find more recent songs like the one you're looking for. However, it's a wonderful resource for free piano sheet music in general.
