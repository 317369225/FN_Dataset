Is music theory necessary to master guitar playing?
The trouble with the term "theory" is that it's incredibly vague. If you go to music school, theory is dissecting Bach to see flawless harmony writing. If you talk to metal players, theory is knowing all the modes. But if your definition of "mastery" includes things like the ability to play a wide variety of styles well, work with pro-level musicians, and/or get paid to do it, then learning either of those "music theories" isn't going to be terribly helpful to you. But you will need to know enough theory to understand how chords are built, how to transpose on the fly, how to navigate soloing over chord progressions that span multiple keys, how to read basic charts, etc, etc. Even if you're one of those rare birds that's blessed with great ears, not knowing any theory means you'll have no names to help you organize it all. Mastering the guitar (vs just playing it fairly well) is actually more difficult without theory than with. If you want to start with theory that's going to be thoroughly useful to you, start by learning the names of every note on your guitar. There's a wealth of information embedded in every song you learn, but for most folks it just washes over them like so much French on a Canadian road sign. Learning the note names gives you a window into the world of theory, and just by learning songs, you'll begin to understand the most useful parts of music theory. I wrote a guide to learning the note names in a fun way: www.fretboardanatomy.com/notes
