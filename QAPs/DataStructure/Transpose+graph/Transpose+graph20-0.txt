What is a key in music?
The key of a musical piece refers to the scale containing the most important notes in the correct relationships which the musicians will use to play the piece. Most pieces of Western music have a particular note, such as C, that functions as the "home" note. Composers define the home note, more technically the "root", by the chord changes they use. Usually the opening chord is based off the root, and the changes move off the root and then return. The most common chords other than the root (aka I) are the IV (based off the sub-dominant, or the fourth tone in the root scale used by the song), the V (based off the dominant, or the fifth tone in the root scale used by the song), and the vi (based off the relative minor, or the sixth tone in the root scale). These are closely related to the root because of low harmonic ratio numbers (see other answers in Music Theory for more details...). Once the root note is defined (pay attention, this is the "key" to keys) your ear processes the rest of the song in relation to that root and experiences a satisfying sense of resolution when the root reappears. Cat Stevens' Father and Sons is an example of a song that starts on the root and then goes through a simple progression of chords to return to the root: Sometimes the opening chord is a related chord, usually the dominant or sub-dominant, but actively resolves to the root chord. You can hear that kind of chord progression in Lynyrd Skynyrds' Sweet Home Alabama: the progression goes V - IV - I The Blue Nile's Headlights on the Parade is a song that plays the root almost continuously, and plays the other tones in the root scale off the root itself as a way to introduce and resolve tension in the piece: Key changes introduce a momentary feeling of disorientation and uplift as the ear recalibrates its expectations of what the root is. A famous key change happens at the 3:00 mark in this song: I hope this is helpful.
