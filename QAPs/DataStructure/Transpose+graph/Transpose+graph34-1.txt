How do I learn to play jazz on the cello?
Google things like left-handed accompaniment, vamps, and walking basses. Enough of that stuff is pretty standard and you can probably play along with recordings and get the feel that way. As you get better, follow the suggestion of learning by imitation, playing in all keys, etc. I've seen jazz bassists that use both the arco and pizzicato approaches. Since you're playing jazz 'cello, which is unusual, people won't have a ton of expectations. Use that freedom: you can really sing as a soloist with that bow, and when you start to get a feel for the expanded harmonies and rhythmic feel of jazz, you can imitate other, more traditional instruments with potentially exciting results. A cellist never has to breathe the way horn players do. A cellist can imply a lot with double stops (think Casals doing Bach). And the range of cello is something people love, because it overlaps so well with the human voice. As a pizzicato player, you can join forces with or play off of the bassist. Cello/bass or guitar/cello/bass might form an interesting basis for a pianoless small band. Good luck. I think strings in jazz is an old idea that should be made new again. A few more recent artists like the late Max Roach have used strings at times, but the old stigma of "sweet" strings vs. "swinging" everything else lingers on.
