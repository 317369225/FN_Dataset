Is music theory necessary to master guitar playing?
Paco De Lucia, the great neo-Flamenco player who died recently, said in an interview shortly before his death that he regretted not learning any theory. He was most certainly a "master" of his instrument... He could hang with guys like Al DiMeola and John McLaughlin.... All depends on your definition of "mastery".
