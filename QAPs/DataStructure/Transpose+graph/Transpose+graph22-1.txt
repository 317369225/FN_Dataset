Could anyone provide me the major and minor relative chords in piano?
I can tell by your question that someone has already confused you.  But I think we can "clear the air" here. DEFINITION: a "relative minor" chord is a chord whose ROOT is three semitones DOWN from any note.  See chart - - the RELATIVE MINOR, of the key of "C MAJOR" is "A MINOR" Note the scale, a C MAJOR scale.  The chord tones A, C, E make an A MINOR chord.  therefore A MINOR is the RELATIVE MINOR of C.  Just transpose to any key, keeping the major scale of the original key intact, and you'll have all the relative minors. IN REVERSE:  C MAJOR is the RELATIVE MAJOR of A MINOR.  That's really all you need to know to understand the fundamentals of relative majors and minors.  Unless you want to drive yourself nuts.  Otherwise STAY IN THE SAME SCALE AS THE "ORIGINAL' MAJOR, and count three semitones down to establish the root of the "relative minor".  Makes sense? Hope this helps!  Happy holidays!
