Is music theory necessary to master guitar playing?
The question is meaningless If you want to play classical finger style guitar, then put in several years to be average. Apart from trying to get a distinct sound, you will need to be able read notation, study harmony, and have a good instrument. If you want to be a folk guitarist you will only need to learn a few chords It helps to learn notation, but you will be able to get by using tablature Just about any playable instrument is acceptable If you want to be a Rock guitarist you will need a good instrument and much electrical extensions to start with It will help to learn theory, but only very basic stuff for a few scales Many Rock players learn by just watching and recording others play You will need to be a good technician, so practice comes before theory If you want to be a modern jazz guitarist you will need to learn hundreds of chords in all keys, and all scales (chromatic, diatonic, modal etc.) Depending on your style, you might learn both finger style and plectrum style. You will need a good knowledge of chords, but that is only a small part of theory If you want to just play well enough for fun, then all you need is a book of chord shapes and the lead sheets for the tunes Apart from basic theory, very little is required for the guitar unless you want to improvise Get a program like Band in a Box, which has many backing tracks, and lets you create your own. You can play along with these Also get Transcribe which allows you to select sections of music and play them at different speeds Â Music theory is mainly for composers and arrangers. It is possible to be a very good guitarist without much theoretical knowledge
