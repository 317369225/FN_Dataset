How do I learn jazz piano?
There are multiple components integral to becoming a Jazz musician.  The jazz idiom requires a strong grasp of jazz theory (learn all the ii-V-I's...etc).  There are specific books that can help with these types of tasks, The Jazz Piano Book by Mark Levine is a great place to start.  Understanding theory is important in the classical realm, but for the most part you can get by without too much (unless using figured bass, or transposing etc).  Understanding theory in the Jazz piano realm is absolutely vital.  So...learn all the ii-V-I's in all inversions, and in all keys.  If you don't know what a ii-V-I is do some research.    The second aspect of becoming a Jazz pianist is of course improvising with others.  The more you do this the better you will become.  Find local Jazz jams and meet the ladies and gentlemen in your area who know how to read the changes.  Get a Real Book (the legal one), and apply the theory you learn to the charts in it.  Do yourself a favor and try to be conservative on the keys when in the group...no one likes a piano player who plays every chord over and over.  Be tasteful, be musical, and be polite! And as usual, get an instructor who is fluent in the idiom.  You will pay a premium for lessons from the local masters, so be sure to accurately assess your piano technique before you take jazz lessons.
