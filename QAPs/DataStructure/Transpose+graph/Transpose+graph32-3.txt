What is an exhaustive list of the most important things a versatile piano player should know/be able to do?
Thanks for the A2A, but I'm not a pianist. I believe versatility on any instrument comes from experience. You acquire it by playing lots of different kinds of music under (usually) less-than-ideal conditions. not by following a set of steps.
