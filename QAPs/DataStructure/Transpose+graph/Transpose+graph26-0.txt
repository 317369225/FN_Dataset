What is concert pitch?
Hm....good question. Probably the simplest definition of concert pitch is 'whatever note is agreed upon'. If it's an orchestra with a music director, that person decides what concert pitch will be: A440, A442, A337, whatever they want. It could be much lower, like A330. If it's a band, concert pitch is often a B-flat instead of an A, for complicated reasons related to the instruments, not the performers. If you'd like to learn more, I suggest you read this Wikipedia entry. Concert pitch
