Could we as musicians consider guitar to be the hardest instrument of them all?
Guitar isn't even the hardest guitar, so unless we're including pedal steel, the answer is definitely no. Even among session-quality players, an aura surrounds a quality pedal steel player. For me, as a fairly competent lap steel player, a pedal steel being played just fairly well is super intimidating. It's the only instrument I know of where being very good means you can work all the time. -- The Construction of the Pedal Steel Guitar To be a middling pedal steel player, you need to know a decent amount of theory, tunings, how to maintain a maze of machinery, foot pedals, a volume pedal, knee levers, and finger picking with those unruly finger picks. All those don't even include tone bar techniques.    That said, perhaps the guitar, per its ubiquity, has the largest range of techniques to master. When people say someone is good at every genre of guitar, I don't even bother to investigate the claim -- it's ludicrous. That seems slightly less implausible for a pianist, violinist, or drummer. By barrier-to-entry standards, I'd put guitar way behind other instruments. Bag pipes and violin come to mind. I'm told the same is very true of oboe and french horn, but I wouldn't know.
