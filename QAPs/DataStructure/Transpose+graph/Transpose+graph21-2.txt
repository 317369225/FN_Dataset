How do I teach myself the mandolin?
If you know how to play the violin and the ukulele, you've already got most of what you need except for maybe the full chords, which are not that hard once you get the hang of them. I would recommend if you haven't done so to check out a chord chart and memorize the basic finger positions for full chords -- you can transpose just a handful of positions to make any chord you want. Anything specific you're having a hard time with? I've been playing mandolin about 3 years and guitar for about 7 years and have played both in numerous bands, so hopefully I can help with anything in particular you want.
