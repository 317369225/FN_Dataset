What is an exhaustive list of the most important things a versatile piano player should know/be able to do?
I think my former piano teacher was pretty versatile. Though he was classically trained, I think it is fair to say he could play virtually any genre of music. Being able to improvise from a simply melody line and playing from lead sheets is a pretty impressive skill. Being able to sightread virtually anything and play it at tempo is equally impressive. I once brought him a piece of sheet music I liked.  The arrangement was pretty basic, but that particular lesson was an introduction to arranging.  He played that song ten different ways, while explaining the various techniques he was using.  I was completely blown away at how the same song could take on so many different moods.  I asked him, "What the heck are you looking at?" attempting to match the notes on the page to the keys being played.  There was nothing to match up.  It was all in his head.  That's an amazing skill.
