Where can someone find a good database of free piano sheet music?
If you want to play rock, the best method is to learn enough music theory to be able to figure the songs out by ear. Rock songs are rarely very complicated, and if you master some standard progressions, you'll be well on your way to figuring out most of the tunes. Learn the major scale and its associated chords and modes, the natural and harmonic minor scale, and the blues, and that covers 90% of rock and pop. Pick up some basic jazz and that will carry you the rest of the way. If you're a beginner and you're having trouble finding charts of the stuff you like, the best method is to find a good teacher and have them figure out the songs for you. I do this with my guitar students routinely. They'll ask me to do a particular song, and I can usually just work it out on the spot. If I can't transcribe it immediately, sitting with the student and working it out can be a really valuable learning experience for them. Even if you can find charts for the songs you like, they may not help as much as you'd think. I've found official sheet music for contemporary music to be of widely varying quality. The charts are written by slumming classical musicians who sometimes don't understand or aren't interested in rock, so they'll write in generic boilerplate accompaniment under the melodies rather than whatever idiosyncratic thing is actually happening in the song. They also tend to assume that you want a solo piano arrangement that gets at the general feel of the song, rather than the exact keyboard/piano parts being played along with all the guitars, bass etc. And official charts very often omit introductions, endings and instrumental passages.
