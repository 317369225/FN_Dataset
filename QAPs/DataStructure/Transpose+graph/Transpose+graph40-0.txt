Why are some instruments (especially woodwinds) transposed by default?
In a way, the reason is to make it easier on all woodwind players. Both woodwind and brass instruments have weird transpositions. A "C" on an Alto sax is a concert Eb. A "C" on a tenor is a concert Bb. A "C" on most trumpets is a concert Bb. There are Eb horns, C trombones, Tenor horns (Bb), Eb trombones (soprano I believe), and so many more. But, have you noticed that across all saxes and all brass instruments (with 3 valves), the same notes (in whatever transposition that particular instrument is in) always have the same fingering? First, take a look at the flute vs. the C soprano sax. Similar sizes and shapes, right? They're both in the key of C. However, if you want to reach lower notes on either, you're going to have to change the core shape of the instrument. If you elongate the bell of the sax, you're changing the notes that it can hit, and it changes the key. We could keep calling the notes of the sax in their concert key, but that would require the player to learn an entirely new fingering system for each instrument. Instead, to make it easier on the player, a "G" on both a flute, sax, and clarinet is played with three fingers. To avoid the confusion of 3 fingers being 3 different notes on 3 different instruments, the names of the fingerings were standardized.
