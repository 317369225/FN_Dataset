Could anyone provide me the major and minor relative chords in piano?
These chords apply to not just piano, but any combination of instruments or situations in which tones are sounded simultaneously or in quick order (the arpeggio) so that the ear perceives them as chords: MAJOR Chords:   C = CEG   G = GBD   D = DF#A   A = AC#E   E=EG#B   B=BD#F#   F#=F#A#C#  or  Gb = GbBbDb   Db=DbFAb    Ab=AbCEb   Eb=EbGBb   Bb=BbDF   F=FAC   C=CEG  (perhaps you can see a progression here!) MINOR Chords are the same, except the middle note (if they are laid out this way) is a half-step lower.   Cminor = Cm = C Eb G       Fm = F Ab C       Dm = D F A   - and so on. The "thirds", as those changed notes are called, being lowered by a half-step means that the sharp becomes a natural (white) note; the white note becomes a flat. If you know how to make scales, arrange them this way:  C G D A E B F#, and Gb Db Ab Eb Bb F C - increasing sharps and decreasing flats.  If you make a chart, you can easily see how the chords relate to one another - and also create the groundwork for being able to create ANY chord (minor 7th, diminished, and all the odd ones).
