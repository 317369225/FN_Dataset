How do I teach myself the mandolin?
I started off my listening to music that I liked and found some books that matched those styles. Like most, I learned bluegrass techniques first, but then began playing some classical stuff and once I got hooked on David Grisman's "Dawg" music, veered off into that direction. The bad things about music books (and teachers) is that there are some good ones and some horrible ones.Â  Because we all learn differently, a teacher or book might also suit one person, but not another. The best mando teacher I ever had was Roger Belloni whose primary instrument was guitar. He really inspired me to take things to a different level.
