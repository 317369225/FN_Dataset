What things should be learnt in MATLAB as an EEE student?
Thanks for A2A First and foremost you should learn: Fundamental principles of MATLAB notation. You need to understand to understand such notation as a(:,i), b(b<0.5) etc. Loops. You will use them A LOT. Also, study using loops inside loops Simulink. Basic block diagrams, will be useful in Communication Systems Plots and their options. Would be very helpful for writing lab reports The first three would be more than sufficient at the beginning. After you master these skills, it would be much easier to learn the rest. The topics below would be very useful, but you would need to possess fundamental knowledge to handle them FFT and IFFT. You would need to understand how to interpret the results of frequency domain analysis Symbolic toolbox. It is much less intuitive than WolframAlpha but is much much more flexible Surf, quiver, plot3, bar, etc. Become a God of data visualization I think this would be enough for undergraduate studies.
