How do I learn to play jazz on the cello?
I have no classical training, but the sense I get from people who do that making the transition to jazz is tricky because the mindsets are so opposite. In classical you have a written part and it's your job to play it. My sister has classical piano training and she's really not able to go off the sheet. In jazz improvisation is everything. You don't play off scores, just lead sheets (aka sometimes a few chords written down on a napkin or just stated verbally to the room) and have to learn how to fill in things yourself. Eventually you need to get your nose out of the book and hear the song as it evolves. This is really not easy. What I'd suggest: Start with a few swing, blues, or Latin tunes that don't have too many complicated changes. Learn their melodies and play them with different feelings, more on the beat or off the beat. Play these to one of the many backing tracks you can find online so you get through it without having to look at the chart. The iReal Pro app can be very helpful because it will let you transpose, alter tempo, etc. Then lay down a bass line. Then try a tenor harmony line in the middle of it. Then start interleaving them. All Blues or Freddie Freeloader (Miles) All of Me (the standard, not that overplayed John Legend song) Take the A Train (Ellington) Song for My Father (Horace Silver) I would LOVE to play jazz with a cellist. Sustain and that vocal feel in the low register? Wow. That would be amazing with an acoustic guitar, which is very percussive but can play chords. Are you by chance in New York City? If so, message me I'd be willing to give things a try.
