Why do recording artists that sing cover versions always sing them in exactly the same key as the original? Have they never heard of transposing software?
In This Is Your Brain On Music, the author relates a study that shows most people tend to sing a song in whatever key they first heard it. As I recall, the study was about regular people, not professional singers. Professional singers transpose songs all the time. They transpose songs into the keys in which they sing best. Key signature is part of what makes a song familiar. So keeping close to the original key helps the song sound familiar to listeners. Radical transposition will tend to make the familiar less so.
