Do different keys in music (Eg, Ab, C, E) have different moods/atmospheres that are a result of anything other than association and what we're used to?
There are differences between the different scales and modes and such things as they have different intervalls between the tones and therefor different harmonys, however, those differences are mostly subjective as to what mood or feel we assign to them. And of course there is the whole wide world of psychoacoustics, however, that does usually fall outside of keys and somesuch. Another funny thing about such things one also has to take into account, is the fact that the tuning is pretty arbitrary... A song in c-minor would still be c-minor if you change the tuning from 440Hz to, let's say, 420. However, while still being the same key and scale, it would sound deeper - due to being deeper, frequency-wise - and potentially change the feeling of the music quiet a bit.
