What is an exhaustive list of the most important things a versatile piano player should know/be able to do?
Get a Fakebook of familiar music and peck out a single note bass line, and a single note melody. Think of these as the highest and lowest notes in the piece. Add notes across the middle to develop your own style. Music should be an expression of you. Neglect the soul-killing mechanics of self-development, and have fun to keep on improving.
