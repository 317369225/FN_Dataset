What saxophone is this? (Look in description)
Michael confirmed what you had already guessed. It is also true that you can transpose while you read your piece, which indeed is not hard to do, once you are used to it. The only thing different, in all horns, are the dynamics. The combination of valves that are closed gives the pure note a different dynamic. This is what gives the saxophone it distinct sound and energy. Overblowing on certain notes is less desirable, your audience will confirm this, on any horn pitched in "C". Note: Although we share the same family name, I do not know Michael Bauer. We do, however, seem to have music and playing the saxophone in common :)
