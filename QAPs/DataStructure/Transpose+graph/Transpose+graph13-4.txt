What exactly is a logistic regression algorithm in machine learning. What are its applications?
Historically, the first application of logistic regression was "given a certain dose of poison, how likely is this pest to die?" Other applications that are pretty common: Life insurance actuaries use logistic regression to predict, based on given data on a policy holder (e.g. age, gender, results from a physical examination) the chances that the policy holder will die before the term of the policy expires. Political campaigns try to predict the chances that a voter will vote for their candidate (or do something else desirable, such as donate to the campaign). Bankers use it to predict the chances that a loan applicant will default on the loan. Marketers use it to predict whether a customer will respond to a particular ad (whether by clicking on a link or sending back a self-enclosed mailer). Weather forecasters use it to predict the "chance of rain" you see every morning. Really, any question where you're working from data where subjects or systems either did or did not do something (i.e. a binary dependent variable), and you have independent variables that DO NOT perfectly predict the outcome, logistic regression can be a powerful tool for understanding the data and making predictions.
