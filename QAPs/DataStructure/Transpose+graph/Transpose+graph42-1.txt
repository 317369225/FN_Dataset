How do I learn jazz piano?
Jazz certainly has a lot to do with listening. But don't stop there! Try to translate what you hear into something on the piano. (It need not be an exact transcription!) I like to identify a technique or musical effect when listening to jazz greats, and then try to apply it to my own playing in my own way. I wrote an article about how I did this with an Oscar Peterson lick: Dissecting an Oscar Peterson lick ("Night and Day") A more by-the-book way of learning some jazz idioms and getting your fingers into shape are Jazz Exercises. Oscar Peterson wrote a set of 13 of these, which are short and digestible--fun to play and equally fun to listen to. I've been working on some of these and sharing. Here's Exercise #5: Page on youtube.com Listen to everything, decide what you like, and try to draw out those sounds through your own playing. Good luck!
