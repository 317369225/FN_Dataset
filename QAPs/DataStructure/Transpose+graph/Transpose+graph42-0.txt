How do I learn jazz piano?
User's answer covers everything except this: Listen. Jazz, like all musical styles, is a language unto itself. Listen to a variety of jazz pianists from every subgenre and decade. Listen to instrumentalists. Listen to big band albums. Get a music notation program or just a sheet of staff paper, and transcribe solos that strike you as particularly astonishing. Learn them, and look at them in a theoretical context - figure out why certain notes and phrases sound so good, and compare them to others that you may not consider as effective. Your technique needs constant maintenance and improvement. But it doesn't matter how much you can move your mouth if you can't speak a language. After enough active listening and transcribing, the vocabulary will become more readily available to you on the spot. Listen to other improvisational styles of music that may not fit the criteria of what you would call "jazz." Listen to classical music. Listen to bluegrass. Listen to Beyonc√©. Everything will widen your scope as a musician. Good luck! Don't give up.
