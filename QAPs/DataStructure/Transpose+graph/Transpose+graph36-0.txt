Is linear algebra generally less intuitive than other mathematics?
Linear algebra is often the first course one takes where there is some emphasis on rigorous proofs.  Prior courses emphasize calculation by methods that the students are told work.  This is not mathematics--it is essentially arithmetic. Thus, in a sense, linear algebra is often the first "real" math course that students ever take.  It is a substantial change of pace from high school math and calculus, and can be difficult for new students. The pure mechanics of linear algebra are very basic--far easier than anything of substance in calculus.  The difficulty is that linear algebra is mostly about understanding terms and definitions, and determining which calculation is needed to arrive at the intended answer.  A student in the "calculus" mindset of performing calculations without thinking about why they are doing them will have a very difficult time. Proofs are another matter entirely.  Students in their first course with proofs are, as a rule, terrible at writing them.  Generally speaking, everything on their page is nonsense.  The only way to get better is to practice.  If you continue with math, you will find that in hindsight the proofs in linear algebra are actually the easiest part of the entire course.  Virtually every assigned proof in a linear algebra course has a one- or two-line proof.  This doesn't stop students from turning in page-long "solutions." In the grander scheme of things, linear algebra is extremely easy.  It is one of the best tools in a mathematician's toolkit precisely because we understand it so well and it is so well behaved.  A huge variety of important questions in mathematics can be reduced to understanding problems in linear algebra, and this is frequently useful because the ideas from linear algebra are so basic and easy to understand.
