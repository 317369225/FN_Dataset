Could anyone provide me the major and minor relative chords in piano?
The relative minor and its major counterpart are a minor 3rd apart, but you should note how George Hirsch has emphasised that the major scale of the original key must be left intact.  This is important, because sometimes students  hear  the minor 3rd SOUND, but wrongly use an enharmonic equivalent.  For example, the relative minor of F# major is NOT Eb minor but D# minor, because there is no Eb in F# major; it is D#. The way I teach students to get this right quickly is to explain that the NUMERICAL size of any interval involves counting the total and all-inclusive number of ALPHABET LETTER names involved in that interval. Therefore, to find the relative minor of F# major, you must count down 3 alphabet letters starting from F (sharp): F# E D. Next stage is to apply the  "step-and-a-half" rule (=wholetone + semitone or vice versa). This amounts to 3 semitones, in other words. D must become D# (not Eb, as we have said). The relative minor of any major scale has the same key signature, but the 7th note must be raised a further semitone. Once again, the letter name cannot be changed, so in the example I gave, D# minor must read: D# E# F# G# A# B Cx (not D natural) D#. This is the harmonic minor form of the minor scale (the one that is used for chords in "tonal" as opposed to "modal" harmony), and the chords that involve the leading-note (Cx) will have it raised in them.  These chords in a minor scale will be III  V  and VII. Here are the chords of F# major and its relative minor D# minor: III+ denotes an augmented triad, IV denotes a major triad, iv=minor, while  viio means diminished. You can now apply this to the other keys. Obviously, relative minor to major reverses the process, so starting from D# (as in D# minor) we ascend three alphabet letters and apply the step-and-a-half rule: D# E  F#  (as in F# major). In teaching, I link the finding of relative keys to the finding of intervals generally, including the common intervals of orchestral transposition (a tone, minor 3rd [as with relatives] and perfect 5th).
