Men, what are the three most off-putting qualities you find in women?
You'll get a lot of different answers for this. Personally, these two things would make make me think twice: 1. Deceit. I really think that honesty and transparency is of paramount importance in a relationship. Everyone has things to hide. But when the time comes to let the cat out of the bag, I'd really rather hear it from my partner than from someone else. 2. Indecisiveness: No man likes it if a girl cannot make up her mind. No, I'm not talking about the little things, but the situations (mostly where family is involved) that a girl should know where to put her foot down. Tons of examples can be given for this and I'm sure you can relate this to something in your life too. The same applies to guys too. There is no point 3. Honestly, the above two are the major things that a guy wouldn't want in any relationship. I could mention insecurity too but I really think that it's the guy's job to make the woman feel secure. Will not mention emotional because some human beings are born that way and you should and cannot change that in a person (at best, they'll only mask their emotions and that's bound to explode in your face later). I think any otherÂ  'off-putting' quality can be worked on by having an honest and open discussion.
