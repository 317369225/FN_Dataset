What is the intuition behind the Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm for finding strongly connected components?
It is based on the idea that if one is able to reach a vertex v starting from vertex u, then one should be able to reach vertex u starting from vertex v and if such is the case, one can say that vertices u and v are strongly connected - they are in a strongly connected sub-graph. Kosaraju algorithm works by checking this fact: 1. Generate the reverse post order list for the graph - this gives the ordered list of transpose graph. 2. Iterate and find connected components on the reverse post order list. 3. For given two vertices, if they are in same connected component in both inorder and reverse post order, then they are strongly connected.
