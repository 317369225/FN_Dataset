Who actually uses Palantir Finance?
Palantir Finance is basically a "Quant Research for Dummies" toolkit. I'm pretty certain that's their target user base: people who want to seem cutting-edge and quanty, but who can't program (but otherwise think Excel VBA is *very* impressive). It is, amongst other things, meant to be a lightweight backtesting language that integrates with Reuters or other proprietary data sources. I imagine it will do quite well amongst the sell-side fraternity as (if any of them can bothered to learn the Palantir language) they might be able to induce the odd trade out of their less savvy clients from the "advanced" analyses they're able to perform. It will also probably do quite well with 'quantitative' pension fund managers in Dayton, OH. However, any quant worthy of the name is already using R, Matlab, Mathematica + the Bloomberg API (or custom software in C++, Java or Python) to do things that Palantir still only can dream about offering in their setup. Ultimately, I think Palantir can probably be a good product for the big, lazy, middlebrow sell and buy side communities. But I've not seen anything yet that would make me switch from the custom implementations of quant research I've already made, seen and used. I also don't think it's a serious competitor to Bloomerg's Terminal product. Data -- we'll see. But Terminal? Not even close.
