Where can someone find a good database of free piano sheet music?
Most free sheet music is also copyright free - so there aren't a lot of current tunes available. You can find some free user-contributed guitar tab charts for current songs, but free sheet music is rare - which is logical - sheet music requires transcription by a trained musician and is time consuming. My favorite site is sheetmusicdigital.com. The selection is great, but not unlimited. And it isn't free, but the $1.99-4.99 price for a single song is so reasonable, I'm happy to pay it. Plus the site allows you to transpose keys and lots of features that are really great. I looked for Arcade Fire, but didn't find any of their songs. I gravitate to songs outside the mainstream, too, so I understand your frustration. You might request that the song be transcribed - the guy who runs the site responds to emails right away and he probably does custom work - not for the standard price, most likely - but worth it if you really want the song.
