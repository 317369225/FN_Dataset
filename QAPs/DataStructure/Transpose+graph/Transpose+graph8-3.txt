Men, what are the three most off-putting qualities you find in women?
The following will change my wall-street graph into a sharp decline: Not ambitious, no personal goals. Not aware of their own actions. Not willing to see the world through the eyes of others. It's vital to have personal goals, no matter how silly they may be. Having a goal gives focus. Focus is sexy (attractive). I can't stand people that obliviously make others feel bad. To a degree, we are automated and unhinged - social actions are built into our neurological behavior. Obliviously making people feel bad shows a lack of self-control. Compassion, very important to me. Racists, sexist, and bigots pretty much have a lack of compassion. Women with the ability to transpose themselves into the lives of others shows perspective, intelligence, and humanity. By the way everyone, we're pretty bad at formatting here. The sister/brother question seems to be kicking our butt at formatting. Compare: Women, what are the three most off-putting qualities you find in men you are considering as people to date?
