What is the difference between depth-first search and breadth-first search?
1. In BFS the root node is expanded first, then all the successors of the root node are expanded, and in next step all the successors of every node are expanded, the process continues till the goal is achived.               while In DFS we explore the root node and traverse as far as possible from the root node untill the goal is achived. 2.In BFS the space complexity is more critical as compared to time complexity.                                                                                               while In DFS has lesser space complexity, because at a time it needs to store only single path from the root to leaf node. 3.Breadth First Search can be done with the help of queue i.e, FIFO(First In First Out)                                                                                                 while Depth First Search can be done with the help of stack i.e. LIFO(Last In First Out). 4.BFS is slower than DFS                                                                     while DFS is more faster than BFS. 5.BFS requires more memory compare to DFS                               while DFS require less memory compare to BFS. 6.BFS is useful in finding shortest path                                              while DFS in not so useful in finding shortest path.
