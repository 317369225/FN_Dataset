I have one month to master depth-first search, breadth-first search and graph theory. What should I do?
What you should do is look up the things you mentioned, because it sounds like you literally have no idea what they are.Â  Two of them are trivial things you can teach yourself about over lunch (and you're never going to get "better" at them, because they're known solutions, rather than problems) and the third is a massive field of mathematics that still contains many active research topics and has applications to industries like software, retail, shipping, communications, biology, and just about everything else. I actually don't know what "masters" would look like, in this context (not that it isn't already a massively overused word).
