How does breadth-first search (BFS) work?With a queue? An intuitive explanation assuming no any prior knowledge in data structure would be greatly appreciated.
Since you have specified you have no knowledge in data structure, I will explain this in layman's terms. Consider you are playing on a beach , and you create a small mound out of beach sand.  Suddenly you realize you have lost your ring , which in all probability is lost within the pile of sand used for the mound. How will you search your ring ?? 1. You can push your hand down to the entire depth of the mound and search for the ring , starting with the left-most part of the mound ....and repeat this step till you reach the right-most part (or till you find your ring) 2. You can push your hand a little bit into the sand and remove entire sand from that level , again starting from left to right.  If you don't find your ring, you push your hand a little deeper and repeat the same process. You repeat this step till you find your ring , or remove all the sand from the mound. Strategy number 1. is called -> Depth First Search (DFS) Strategy number 2. is called -> Breadth First Search (BFS)
