What is the best (programming) algorithm that you have ever created?Anything that you're proud of and would like to share the algorithm as well?
A script that creates the skeleton of my courses teaching various writing systems: Given a large number of international words and names (like "taxi", "pizza", "Peru", "Tom") in the writing system you want to learn, the script will determine the best order of introducing the letters / symbols, where best means that you can read the most of the given words as early as possible (so you can practise reading without having to learn the entire alphabet first). The output of the script is new letter, new words you can read, new letter, new words you can read, and so on. Language-agnostic and works for syllaberies and ideographic writing systems as well as alphabets. I have also created some interesting code when developing the machine translation system prototype for UNIKOM, but mustn't talk about it at this point.
