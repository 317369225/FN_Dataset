Which way of opening tabs is more effective while web browsing - BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search)?While web browsing, we use to browse the web mostly in two ways. BFS - we open multiple tabs in background and then follow them. DFS - we open a page in a new tab and immediately follow it, then get back. Which one is the most effective and why? Feel free to write down your own web browsing habbits or extend it to other aspects of your life.
