How does breadth-first search (BFS) work?With a queue? An intuitive explanation assuming no any prior knowledge in data structure would be greatly appreciated.
Ebola is gradually spreading through the world. Every day, the people who have it infect new people they share fluids with. In this way, ebola is doing a sort of breadth-first-search over humanity. The "queue" is the set of people who have just been infected. The graph is the unintentional-fluid-sharing network of the world. Imagine you need to simulate the spread of ebola through this network. The root node of the search is patient zero, a toddler in Guinea. You start off with just him with the disease, and no one else. Now you iterate over the people he's in contact with. Give all of them ebola. Now iterate over all of them. Give all the people they're in contact with the disease too, unless they've already had it. Keep going until you've infected everyone, or you've infected your target. Then you're done. That's how breadth-first-search works.
