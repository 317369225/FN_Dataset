What is the difference between depth-first search and breadth-first search?
Originally Answered: What is difference between breadth first search and depth first search?These searches are applied to the Trees with root, subroots and the leaf nodes. The breadth first search starts from the root move to the next level, searches all the subroots (maybe leaves) and then move on to next level of tree and so on till the search on the leaf nodes is completed The depth first search starts from the root, move to its first left subroot and will continue till the the last left leaf node is searched. Then the pointer moves to root again and the search starts again from the next subroot of the root
