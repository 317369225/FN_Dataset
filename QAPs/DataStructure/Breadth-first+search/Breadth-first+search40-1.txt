How did Akshat Bubna become so good at competitive programming?He's an IOI medallist. How did he start programming and what resources did he use to become so great at it?
How do you know he's good at programming?  Are you a higher grade programmer with the ability to judge his programming as "good"?  Based on his own answer, he is still very much a novice.  There are a ton of variables that dictate if someone is a "good" programmer or not.  Knowing a few algorithms or winning some contest would be at the bottom of the list for judging how good someone is as a programmer.  I've known a ton of developers with CS degrees and a number of them are bad programmers;  Some had even won contests.
