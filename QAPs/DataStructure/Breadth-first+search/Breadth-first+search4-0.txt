What are the real world applications of Breadth First Search?
One really important application is in modeling 'Flood Fill' or pretty much anything that resembles a viral growth pattern. Well-constructed stochastic BFS traversals can come pretty close to approximating the actual outcome. Another interesting one is 2-Colorability (a.k.a Bipartiteness Test). A BFS tree is a decomposition of a graph by layers (each successive expansion from the previous set of nodes is a new layer; initialized with a chosen root). This can be useful in problems that must enforce bipartiteness, though I can't think of any good examples off the top of my head. Shortest paths was mentioned, though it should be clarified that this is exclusively the case in graphs with unweighted edges (e.g. a social network). Web crawling as already mentioned, since BFS avoids overloading individual hosts, whereas DFS is more likely to drill all the way down the same site.
