How do you implement breadth first search on a binary tree using just recursion and no explicit data structures such as a queue, stack, list etc.?
On a single-thread, I can't think of any escape from using or simulating a queue. Practically it's best to use queue, but it's worth to note that if the nodes in the binary tree contain right siblings (easy to build right sibling pointers if they don't exist), then we could traverse all nodes at each level before recursing to the next level. The r-sibling pointers basically provide the queue behavior! Â  I would only *consider* it if the tree already contains the right sibling pointers. If we are mutating the tree to build these pointers for this purpose, a queue is much more elegant / cheaper.
