What are some examples of depth or breadth first search applied to real life?
Best example is a topological sorting where one event depends on / can be completed only after another event. This can be applied from CPU scheduling algorithms to real life situations. Example in an ATM, successful transaction execution will depend on certain other events to complete (password authentication, user auth, user options, input from user etc). You cannot jumble this order by any chance. Also take an example of the final check out in an ecommerce website store.(user auth, adding products to carts, payment gateways etc.,)
