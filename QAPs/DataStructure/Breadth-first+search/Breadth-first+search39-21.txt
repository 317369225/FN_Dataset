How can one be well prepared to answer data structure/algorithm questions in interviews?
Originally Answered: What is the best way to prepare data structure for an interview?To prepare DS,the following resources would be helpful : 1)Get the theoretical concepts clear by thoroughly going through either SCHAUM'S OUTLINES DATA STRUCTURE(author : Seymour Lipschutz.) or DS by Yashwant Kanetkar.These books are a really good starting point to make you familiar with different data structures and how they can be used.Personally,i preferred schaum's because it provides you with algorithms and not language specific codes. 2)After learning theory,move onto practical implementation of data structures. Page on geeksforgeeks.orgÂ  is an ideal resource for this purpose.Try doing following articles : arrays,linked lists,,strings,tress,bit magic .First try coming up with your own algorithm,then compare it with the given solutions. 3)For a deeper understanding on the subject,watch MIT video lectures on algorithms and data structures .
