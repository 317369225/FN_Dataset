What is the best (programming) algorithm that you have ever created?Anything that you're proud of and would like to share the algorithm as well?
I implemented a set of common data structures in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) because I was doing a lot of work in relational database design using Microsoft Access, and got sick of re-inventing the wheel as I moved from contract to contract. Initially, I memorized them because I had to leave the project code behind with my clients, and the code library I built as part of the project was always a part of it. Finally, I committed them to code. Here is my implementation of the left-leaning red-black tree clsLeftLeaningRedBlackTree due to Robert Sedgewick as discussed at Page on Princeton I used it extensively as the symbol table of a VBA parser, implemented in VBA, in a the cross-referencing database application for VBA I wrote and called Hypertext Cross Reference, to aid with code project documentation in Access database applications. It's available to review at Index and to download at Downloads. By way of justification, I created it because it's a unique implementation of the left-leaning red-black tree, and supplies operations missing from Sedgewick's paper, such as the balanced delete operation resulting in a re-balanced tree. Naughty Robert, for leaving essential implementation details out! Try it, you might like it.
