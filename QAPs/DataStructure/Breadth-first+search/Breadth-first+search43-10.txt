What is the best (programming) algorithm that you have ever created?Anything that you're proud of and would like to share the algorithm as well?
This is not my algorithm, but something my student Michael Otte came up with: It allows randomized path planning algorithms to be super-linearly sped up on multi-core machines, that is 10 cores are not 10 times, but 20, 30 or 50 times faster. Here is how it works: when looking for a shortest path using a random planner, and once a path from start to goal is found, there is no shorter path outside of the ellipsoid that can be created by using a rubber band of the current best length between start and goal as constraint for a pen. Sharing this ellipsoid with anybody else who also works on this problem, will allow those computers to drastically reduce their search space, increasing the efficiency of the search. In addition to reducing the search space, actually sharing the best possible path will increase the likelihood that other computers actually find a point that will lead to a shorter path. The algorithm is described in more detail in this paper C-FOREST: Parallel Shortest Path Planning With Superlinear Speedup
