What is the best (programming) algorithm that you have ever created?Anything that you're proud of and would like to share the algorithm as well?
During my sophomore year , we were given a dynamic programming assignment in algorithm course. The problem was that given a text with multiple lines optimize the spacing for each line and the optimization function was given.We were taught the dynamic programming concept but extracting the solution wasn't really described in the class ( basically you keep track of the pointers to reproduce your optimize path). I was fairly new to this and I came up with the idea of keeping the pointers in another matrix so that I can repro the final  optimize text.  I later came to know this is a standard way of solving such  problem. Not extra ordinary , but it really made me proud of my algorithm skills given I was fairly new to computers. The other one was novice although simple discovery for creating a linear size 3-spanner for a proper interval graph in linear time that can support node updates. This was done with a class mate.
