Why are Depth First Search and Breadth First Search called so?
They are both named based on the way they traverse a graph. Skip next 2 para's if you already know how the algorithms work. Depth first search starts at an initial node, moves to its neighbour, and then the neighbour's neighbour, and so on until the required node or a dead end is reached. At this point it backtracks. Breadth first search starts at an initial node, moves to its first neighbour, then its other neighbour and so on until it has checked all its neighbours. It then moves down to its first neighbour and checks all its neighbours. Then all neighbours of the second neighbour and so on. If we imagine the graph to be drawn in a manner that the initial node is drawn on top. Its immediate neighbours drawn 1 level below it. Nodes at a distance of 2 edges(the neighbour's neighbours) at a level below this and so on. We notice that DFS will traverse all the way to the deepest nodes and then come back up again, hence the name "depth first". Whereas BFS will check all the nodes(across the breadth) in a level before it goes one level down, hence "breadth first".
