What is the best (programming) algorithm that you have ever created?Anything that you're proud of and would like to share the algorithm as well?
Can't talk about the best one as that's covered by an NDA, but a couple of close seconds include an implementation of the switchboard pattern (a pattern for integrating backend code with a distributed collection of REST api's by using a server/metaclass hybrid to translate REST calls to method calls and vice versa), or one of the lazy, recursive descent de-serialization algorithms I've written using generators. (all of this is in python). Edit:Â  I'll update this post to include some pseudo code explaining switchboard (tomorrow probably, when I've had some sleep)
