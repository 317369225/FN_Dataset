What are some real-life examples of Breadth and Depth First Search?What are some real life examples of BFS, DFS and similar algorithms that help us find shortest path between two nodes? What are some of the unknown places where graphs have been used to model the situation?
Scanning a hierarchical filesystem directory structure can be performed in either a breadth first or depth first manner. Starting at an arbitrary directory, you can find all of the elements in the directory. In a recursive algorithm if, upon finding a subdirectory element, you descend to that subdirectory immediately to continue the search rather than find more elements in the present directory,Â  then that would be a depth first search. Finding all elements at each directory node before descending to any subdirectory would be a breadth first search.
