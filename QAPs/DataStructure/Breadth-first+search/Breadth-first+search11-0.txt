How do I apply the breadth first search algorithm?
Breadth-First can be tricky to wrap your head around, but it's very simple in concept. Make a queue - the queue is the heart of a breadth-first search. Put the "from" location into the queue While the queue still has stuff in it, Get the next item in the queue If that item is the destination, then you're done. Otherwise, find all the places you can get to directly from that item, and push them into the queue Repeat until you find what you're looking for. Depending on how you decide to set up your data, you may need to remember which locations you've visited before, and if they show up again, don't put them in the queue. If you need to print the final path, not just look to see how to get where you are going, you'll want to push the "path so far" into the queue, not just the next step. So first you'll put [arad] into the queue, then [A, arad] if you can reach "A" from "arad", etc. Each time, just tack the new location onto the front of the list. When you get where you're going, reverse the list, and that's your answer.
