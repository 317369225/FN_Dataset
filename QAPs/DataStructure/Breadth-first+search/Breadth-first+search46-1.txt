Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur (IITJ): How did Arpit Agarwal land a job at Google?How did he learn to code?
Thanks for the A2A. But I may not be the appropriate guy to answer this question. You can always ask arpit himself. Or you can ask one of the awesome programmers at iitj. Since no one has written a answer for near a week now, here's my feeble attempt at answering the question. The things needed for landing a decent coding related placement in a MNC are: 1. Clarity in concepts of coding and mathematics. For more of all that geeky stuff log in to geeksforgeeks.com 2. Persistence and Patience and Practice You have to have a lot of patience if you want to code right. These are 3P's to become a better coder. (Copied from quora itself) 3. Competetive Programming Participate in all those dark hour contests and keep submitting on codechef. 4. Start early The early you start, the more proficiency you gain. 5. Always have hope Hope is a good thing red, probably the best of things and no good thing ever dies. (If you don't understand this one, fuck coding first go and watch swashank redemption) Well these are some things I have observed for past year and half living with 3 cse guys as my roommates(one of them is very near to landing a microsoft intern). I assume these things with 10 times the dedication might have been arpit's case or he might just be a genius. Arpit Agarwal Edits are more than welcome or better write your own version to motivate us.
