In the Introduction to Algorithms, there is a theorem 22.5 (correctness of breadth-first search). How does it conclude that u.d = δ (s, u)?in the textbook, I used four Lemmas, but I could not make such conclusion.
The theorem names v as the vertex with minimum δ(s,v) -- "true length of shortest path from s to v" -- that receives an incorrect d -- "calculated shortest path length" -- value. The theorem names u as the vertex immediately before v on a shortest path from s to v.  That means that δ(s,u)+1 = δ(s,v). Because v is the vertex with minimum δ that has an incorrect d value, and u has smaller δ, u cannot have an incorrect d value.  Otherwise we would have chosen u instead of v originally.  Therefore u.d is the correct value, δ(s,u).
