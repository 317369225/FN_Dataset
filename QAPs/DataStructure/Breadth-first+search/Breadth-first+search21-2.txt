I have one month to master depth-first search, breadth-first search and graph theory. What should I do?
Well, mastering Graph Theory in a month is obviously not possible if you want start everything from scratch,but nonetheless you can kick off the journey by going through these at least. Breadth First Search Depth First Search Topological Sorting Strongly Connected Components Kosaraju Algorithm Tarjan's Algorithm Minimum Spanning Tree Kruskal's Algorithm Prim's Algorithm Shortest Path Problems Dijkstras Algorithm Bellman-Ford Algorithm Floyd-Warshall Algorithm Maximum Flow Problem Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm Edmonds-karp Algorithm Hopcroft-karp bipartite matching algorithm. This is a very vague list, and you have to learn a lot of things to shift from one to another topic in this list,for instance after BFS and DFS, one must learn DAG,Cycles, Edge classification, Tree properties to conclude Topological sorting. Following the order would definitely help.
