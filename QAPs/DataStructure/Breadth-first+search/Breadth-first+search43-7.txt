What is the best (programming) algorithm that you have ever created?Anything that you're proud of and would like to share the algorithm as well?
An algorithm to determine song lyrics based on a web search. If you do a web search for "comfortably numb lyrics", you get a bunch of results. You can actually extract the actual lyrics because the common part of the text on each result page will be the actual lyrics. Would like to extend this to images some day. For example, if you search for jobs on Google Image Search, you get a bunch of images, but the entity you are looking for shows up in a bunch of images, and you can extract that by locating the common bits of each image.
