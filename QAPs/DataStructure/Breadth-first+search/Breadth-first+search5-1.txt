What is the difference between depth-first search and breadth-first search?
Originally Answered: What is difference between breadth first search and depth first search?As the name implies, a breadth-first search starting in vertex v  will first visit each vertex w  that is adjacent to v  , and next go on to perform a breadth-first search for each such w  . The search terminates when no more unvisited vertices can be visited in this manner. A depth-first search starting in vertex v  will first visit the first vertex w  that is adjacent to v  , and next go on to perform a breadth-first search for this w  . When this search eventually terminates, the depth-first search will then visit the next vertex adjacent to v  . The search starting in vertex v  terminates when a search has been performed for all vertices adjacent to v  . Have a look at the Breadth First Search/Depth First Search Animations.
