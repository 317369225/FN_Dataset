What is the best (programming) algorithm that you have ever created?Anything that you're proud of and would like to share the algorithm as well?
My best algorithm was created for my MS research. It was an automatic summarization algorithm. I call it TextTeaser. At first I really doubt the quality of the summaries it produce. But after getting some feedback with the people, I now think it was really that good. And I'm getting request to open source it... soon! You can try out TextTeaser via this link: TextTeaser: An automatic summarization application and API
