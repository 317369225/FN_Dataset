How does breadth-first search (BFS) work?With a queue? An intuitive explanation assuming no any prior knowledge in data structure would be greatly appreciated.
BFS is a graph search algorithm that aims to expand and examine all nodes of a graph or combination of sequences by systematically searching through every solution. BFS search algorithm begins at the root node and explores all the neighboring nodes as in the gif below. BFS is implemented using queue(FIFO). You would like to visit Stacks and Queues if you don't understand what queue is. Algorithm (Informally): If the element sought is found in this node, quit the search and return a result. Otherwise enqueue any successors (the direct child nodes) that have not yet been discovered. Pseudocode:       Step 1: Push the root node in the Queue.       Step 2: Loop until the queue is empty.       Step 3: Remove the node from the Queue       Step 4: If the removed node has unvisited child nodes, mark them as visited and insert the unvisited children in the queue. A more detailed discussion can be found in Breadth First Search.
