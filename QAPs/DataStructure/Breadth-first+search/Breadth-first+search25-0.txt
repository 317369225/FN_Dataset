How can I find the counterparts for commonly used programming terms such as inheritance, breadth-first search etc. in Chinese?Now and then in my line of work, I would need to communicate with developers from China. Since I am fluent with conversational Mandarin , I rather speak Mandarin with them rather than English. However, I found myself stuck at technical, programming/computer science terms, such as inheritance, loops, iterations, database queries etc. How can I find the Chinese counterpart for those technical jargon?
Most Chinese programming terms are rather simple translations from English: inheritance would be "继承性", breadth-first search would be "宽度优先搜索", and so on, so you should be able to do reasonably well with a dictionary. If that doesn't work, try describing whatever you're referring to, or just say the term in English. Most developers know a bit about English programming jargon.
