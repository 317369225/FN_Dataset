What is the minimum number of jumps required to complete the game of Snakes and Ladders?Given a snake and ladder game, write a function that returns the minimum number of jumps to take top or destination position. You can assume the die you throws results in always favor of you.
This is just a question of finding the shortest path from beginning to end. Model the board as a directed graph. The cells in the board are the vertices. If you can reach cell Y from cell X in one throw of dice (and taking a ladder/snake as might be needed), there is a directed edge from X to Y with weight 1. The problem then reduces to finding the shortest path from 1 to 100. Since the edge weights are all 1, breadth-first search will let you find the solution. And guess what, in certain boards, it might actually be more advantageous to get eaten by a snake on the way.
