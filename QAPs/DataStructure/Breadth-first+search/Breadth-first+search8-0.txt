What are the advantages of breadth-first search?
Breadth first Search goes for the optimal solution in a left to right manner level wise, unlike DFS which shall search all the levels from left and then shift right repeating the process. So say you have a tree if depth 100 and your solution lies at level 3 but to the atmost right. If you do a DFS then the search shall go all the way from the left to the right searching the entire 100 levels multiple times. So basically it will nearly search the entire tree before coming to the solution. BFS however will search level 1 then 2 and then three and shall give you the answer. So BFS is useful when you have your solution not very deep and towards the right hand side of your tree.
