How can one be well prepared to answer data structure/algorithm questions in interviews?
As in most areas, the level of success people achieve in answering these questions is a combination of their innate ability and the quantity and quality of their preparation. The best way to improve is to practice solving these challenges. You can go through the challenges in a book, or even practice online. I even created an online tutorial for this purpose, which you can go through and solve the challenges it links to: Algorithms for Interviews See the page on algorithms strategies for some general tips. It also breaks down some larger challenges into smaller ones, so you can see how to solve hard problems.
