How can I find the counterparts for commonly used programming terms such as inheritance, breadth-first search etc. in Chinese?Now and then in my line of work, I would need to communicate with developers from China. Since I am fluent with conversational Mandarin , I rather speak Mandarin with them rather than English. However, I found myself stuck at technical, programming/computer science terms, such as inheritance, loops, iterations, database queries etc. How can I find the Chinese counterpart for those technical jargon?
I assume that you can read Chinese since you are fluent with Mandarin. If you know how Chinese programmer learn programming language, you will be familiar with the Chinese jargon. 1) Read the best-known programming language book of Chinese version.. This is the best way. 2) Read the programming document of Chinese version. 3) Search the English terms in Chinese search engine, like Baidu, Google HK (set the search tool that searching only Chinese pages may be better). The engine will give some Chinese articles concerning the terms. 4) Join the Chinese forum that concerning your programming language. Through the above methods you will get the common Chinese terms. But the up-to-date technology does't translate to Chinese, then using English directly. A good programmer in China can read English well. The English references is fresh, detailed and easy to understand,  but high-quality Chinese references are rare, so we have the saying "程序员不会英语就是二等公民 "。
