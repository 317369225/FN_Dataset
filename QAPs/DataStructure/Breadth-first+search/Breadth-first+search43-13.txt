What is the best (programming) algorithm that you have ever created?Anything that you're proud of and would like to share the algorithm as well?
I shaved off a check for every operation in the standard GJK algorithm. For those who don't know, it is an algorithm to check for collision between two convex objects. It calculates the Minkowski difference(just subtract all points from one another) between two objects and then sees if the origin lies within that difference. Â I looked at the algorithm and found that there was something intuitively wrong in it. Somehow, the spaces overlapped in such a way, that one of the checks was completely unnecessary. I had just a hunch but wanted to be completely sure. So, wrote down an elaborate mathematical proof to remove any further doubt. Then, I wrote down the code, and it ran for all the test cases that I designed. Note: Removing a check might seem small, but one run has about 10-15 checks and when a third of them are shaved off, the performance also improves by about a third. And, when there are thousands of calls to that method, there is a visible difference.
