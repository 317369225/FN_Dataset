How can I find the counterparts for commonly used programming terms such as inheritance, breadth-first search etc. in Chinese?Now and then in my line of work, I would need to communicate with developers from China. Since I am fluent with conversational Mandarin , I rather speak Mandarin with them rather than English. However, I found myself stuck at technical, programming/computer science terms, such as inheritance, loops, iterations, database queries etc. How can I find the Chinese counterpart for those technical jargon?
Look them up with Wikipedia,and change the language,you will get the answer
