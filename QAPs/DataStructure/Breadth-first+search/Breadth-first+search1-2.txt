How does breadth-first search (BFS) work?With a queue? An intuitive explanation assuming no any prior knowledge in data structure would be greatly appreciated.
I wont go through how to implement BFS in a language, but with the intuition part of understanding it. Here is the scenario to consider to understand how BFS work:   Make a list of people you know personally.   Start interviewing from the top of the list and ask each person for his/her connections and strike out his name from the list.   Add those new people at the bottom of your list.   Continue interviewing people (only new ones, do not interview same person twice) until you are tired of interviewing - always interview the person on the top of list.   You got BFS working for you.   To create a list you use a queue and connections are nodes connected to the node you are currently visiting.   Hope helps.
