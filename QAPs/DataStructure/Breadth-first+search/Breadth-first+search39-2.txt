How can one be well prepared to answer data structure/algorithm questions in interviews?
Originally Answered: What questions on algorithms, data structure and computer architecture are commonly asked in interviews especially in companies like Google, Microsoft, Quora, Amazon,Â  Wikipedia, Facebook, and LinkedIn?The questions depend on your level of experience and position you are interviewing for. In general, companies try to assess how good you are in things you claim to know. If you are assuming a job in software, there are several types of questions Standard programming questions - operations on linked lists, tree traversals, etc. You are expected to write code on the board (or in a shared editor) and fix any mistakes you may make at first. Standard material about algorithms, data structures and their complexity. For example, you may be asked to discuss algorithms for finding the median in an array, decide which one is more practical and why. Problem-solving questions that do not involve coding, at least at the beginning. For example, develop an algorithm that would access an array in which one value repeats in more than 50% array elements and find this value in linear time with minimal additional memory. Design questions, where you are given some situation and need to outline a strategy or a data structure. For example, how would you design an Amazon shopping cart. Questions about Java or C++ syntax or runtime. Sometimes lame or overly narrow questions. Questions related to discrete mathematics or probability.The last two categories are less common, but do occur. There are several excellent books on coding interviews, with many examples. Some even discuss the differences between companies. You can easily find them on Amazon. The books by Gayle Laakmann McDowell are very popular, especially Cracking the Coding Interview.
