How can I implement breadth-first-search to find the shortest path between two Wikipedia pages for longer paths?I'm trying to implement a breadth-first-search to find the shortest way of going from some ABC Wikipedia page to another XYZ page. My code works if it takes a few steps but for longer paths, Wikipedia temporarily blocks me from the server. Is there any bypass to make it work for longer paths too? Thanks!
