What is the best (programming) algorithm that you have ever created?Anything that you're proud of and would like to share the algorithm as well?
The core algorithm by which Project Darkstar parallelizes event handling. I later learned that in concept it is similar to "transactional memory" but I developed it from scratch from the ground up solving all the problems of a massively parallel game content server.
