What is the best (programming) algorithm that you have ever created?Anything that you're proud of and would like to share the algorithm as well?
You know that applet on every investment planning nd bank website that tells you how much to invest monthly so you can retire with the amount of money needed to live the life you want? I wrote the original form in 1995, and put it on the web as freeware. I wrote it because I wanted to know how much I needed to invest and how aggressive my investments needed to be to retire t an age young enough to enjoy it. In fact, I would be retired now had I followed it. The reason I haven't retired yet? One reason with two effects. Marriage, and divorce. So if I were to add to the app as I designed it, I would add two buttons. One would be, a divorced button that divided the amount in half and then an additional 10% to pay for attorneys. The other...A marriage button, that when you click on it, a message box pops up that says, "Who are you kidding? Your wife will spend everything before you have chance to invest it." Of course the previous paragraph was a joke, but the rest is true. Another nice app I created was to prevent a bossmfrom altering my code. Each night, after wemall left for the day, my bossmwouldmgo into our code and make changes, that he felt made it better. But in reality, the codewas not done so he ruined hours of work, then blamed delays on us programmers. So, I implemented code with the idea of "security" since our app was sensitive data. We did set up security, but part of the security module checked for two things. If the user was our boss, it checked for the location of the app. If it sat on the deployed server, it ran normally. If it was on the test server, it generated a random error code. Since the boss was on the tech bleeding edge, we could blame it on his new tech drivers. We got the project completed on time and on budget. We took the code out once we were done. Updated 25 Oct 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
