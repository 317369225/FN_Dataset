What are the advantages of using BFS over DFS or using DFS over BFS? What are the applications and downsides of each?I know how each works.
Advantages ofÂ  BFS:- 1. Solution will definitely found out by BFS If there are some solution. 2. BFS will never get trapped in blind alley , means unwanted nodes. 3. If there are more than one solution then it will find solution with minimal steps. Disadvantages Of BFS :- 1. Memory Constraints As it stores all the nodes of present level to go for next level. 2. If solution is far away then it consumes time. Application Of BFS :- 1.Finding Shortest Path. 2.Checking graph with bipertiteness. 3.Copying cheiney's Algorithm. Advantages Of DFS :- 1. Memory requirement is Linear WRT Nodes. 2. Less time and space complexity rather than BFS. 3. Solution can be found out by without much more search. Disadvantage of DFS :- 1. Not Guaranteed that it will give you solution. 2. Cut-off depth is smaller so time complexity is more. 3. Determination of depth until the search has proceeds. Applications of DFS:- 1. Finding Connected components. 2. Topological sorting. 3. Finding Bridges of graph.
