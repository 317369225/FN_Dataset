How does breadth-first search (BFS) work?With a queue? An intuitive explanation assuming no any prior knowledge in data structure would be greatly appreciated.
First you need to know how a Queue work, it has the feature of the elements are popped in the same order it was pushed. So imagine you are traversing a tree and start your algorithm by pushing the root of the tree and repeat the following till the queue becomes empty: 1. Pop the front of the queue "at first its the root" 2. Process it and push all of its children to the queue 3. Go to 1 So if you have a tree like this you will end traversing and processing them in the following order: 48 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 - > 2 -> 2
