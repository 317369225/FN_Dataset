What is the minimum number of jumps required to complete the game of Snakes and Ladders?Given a snake and ladder game, write a function that returns the minimum number of jumps to take top or destination position. You can assume the die you throws results in always favor of you.
Make a directed graph, from any position i, add edges of edge weight 1 to positions - i+1,i+2,i+3,i+4 ,i+5 and i+6 respectively. If a ladder exists from position i to position j ,add an edge of edge weight 0 from i to j, similarly, if a snake exists from position i to j , add an edge of weight 0 form i to j. Now that we have got a graph, run Dijkstra shortest path algorithm .
