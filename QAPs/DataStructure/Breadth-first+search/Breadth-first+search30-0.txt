Why do we need to color a node grey in the Breadth First Search in addition to other colors, black and white?As given in the book CLRS, while doing a BFS, we color the node grey if it was previously white and would now be inserted into the queue. But we never check whether a node is grey or not. So why do we color a node grey?
You are correct that our pseudocode never checks whether a node is gray.  If you read our discussion about correctness, however, you'll see that we do refer to gray nodes.  See, for example, the loop invariant at the bottom of page 595.
