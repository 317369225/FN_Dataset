What is the time complexity of Breadth First Search Traversal of a graph?I was reading somewhere that the time complexity of performing Breadth First Search Traversal in a connected graph is O(V+E), where V and E are the number of vertices and edges respectively. However, I think it should only be O(E).
All edges and all vertices of graph G(V,E) need to be visited one time. Algorithm(Start BFT from any vertex say v, passed as parameter): BFT(v) { visited(v) = true; add(v, queue); while(queue not empty) { x = dequeue(queue); print(x); foreach(w adjacent_to(x)) { if(w not_visited) { visited(w) = true; add(w, queue); } } } } Therefore, Time complexity of Breadth First Traversal =  O(|V|+|E|)
