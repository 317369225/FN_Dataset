I have one month to master depth-first search, breadth-first search and graph theory. What should I do?
Depth first and breadth first search are two graph traversal strategies. They are very important in graph algorithms and used in many cases, but they are not very complicated to understand in themselves. You don't need one month to understand them. Just grab any good algorithms and data structures book (there are many threads listing some on Quora), understand what the algorithms are about, and practice on exercises and examples. Mastering graph theory in one month is impossible. It's a whole sub field of mathematics and theoretical computer science. Some people spend their academic career understanding and improving graph theory. All you can get in one month is the basics.
