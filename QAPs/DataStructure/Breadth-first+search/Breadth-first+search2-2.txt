What is a breadth first search?
Let me try to explain this with a model that is so far away from ground realities that only a number theorist can think of it. (Unless, of course, you are a supply-side economist.) It is 2057, and the hegemonists, tired of world domination, want to colonise the entire solar system. Distance is the only constraint. Noxious gases, extreme temperatures,Â  slow internet -- bring them on. So we're looking at the seven other planets of our solar system and two satellites each for the five of them that have satellites. As a first step, we have a flag-planting probe that does exactly what you think it does. (Which flag, though? Let us just say that the United Nations prevailed with great difficulty.) Now here is the itinerary if the probe were to do a depth first search. Venus Mercury Mars, Phobos, Deimos Jupiter, Ganymede, Europa Saturn, Titan, Rhea Uranus, Oberon, Titania Neptune, Triton, Nereid And here is what happens if the probe were to do a breadth first search.
