What is the best (programming) algorithm that you have ever created?Anything that you're proud of and would like to share the algorithm as well?
The algorithm that I used to turn music into fictional stock prices for my Android game, MoonStocks.  It's sort of like Dance-Dance Revolution for stocks.  The prices move up and down in accordance with high or low frequency portions of a song. I used the following method: Take the waveform of a song and convert it into a series of data points using a Fourier transformation, where each data point represents the dominant frequency at a given time slice.  Scale the data points so that they fall across some range of positive integers which could represent a realistic dollar amount of a stock. After the data points have been generated, they can be used to have stock charts display interpolated lines between them to the rhythm of the music.  If you want to see it in action, MoonStocks is available at Android Apps on Google Play.
