What are some examples of depth or breadth first search applied to real life?
This is the answer I always think of: succession in a monarchy is a depth-first search (assuming it's gender-equal). Nodes are visited in depth-first order by age, starting with the dynasty's founder, until a live node is found. So for instance, Princes William, George, and Harry, and Princess Charlotte, will all be visited before Prince Andrew, because all of Prince Charles' descendants must be visited before moving on to the next node descended from Queen Elzabeth. I could never convince my data structures TA that this was a great way to remember it, but it's always made sense to me...
