What are the very basic algorithms that every Computer Science student must be aware of?
(I am not including here algorithms like simplex, or fast Fourier transform, that are useful and in some sense "fundamental", but not likely to be encountered in a basic CS course.) Binary Search Quicksort and merge sort. Depending on what data you're dealing with, there may be a better sorting algorithm that suits the problem. But these are two very popular and fundamental sorting algorithms, each with its own approach to the matter. Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path of a weighted graph. Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning trees. Depth-first and breadth-first searches. Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for matching substrings. [Edit: Rohit Banga suggested binary search as well. A basic algorithm that at first blush seems straightforward and trivial to implement, but as Jon Bentley found, most implementations (even his own that he published!) had errors.]
