What is the difference in knowledge of a language (say JavaScript) between a non-computer science background programmer and a computer science engineer/scientist and how does it help?
A novice programmer would learn JavaScript in a month, and try to accomplish all tasks with that one language.  A computer scientist could pick up the relevant parts in a day, and instantly switch if a different language was better for the job. Computer scientists don't always know a lot about specific languages, but can code in just about any language if necessary.  There are many programming languages (like JavaScript) that I could easily use to solve problems, but I'd have to google how to load a file from memory, or find the length of a string.
