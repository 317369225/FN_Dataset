If I want to start with bioinformatics or computational biology, what topics should I learn? What are the actual challenges in this field?
Thanks for A2A Bioinformatics and Computational Biology are a vast fields in itself! I would recommend getting an overview of what actually is Bioinformatics/Computational Biology. In short, these are the development and application of computational tools to felicitate biological data storage. management, retrieval and analysis. Having a brief knowledge of biological molecules like DNA, RNA, Proteins would help you better understand how these stuff work. Regarding the topics, there are plenty of topics to be dealt in bioinformatics: Sequence Alignment DNA and Protein Structure predicition Protein Folding Biological Molecular Interaction Biological Networks Biological Databases Algorithms Scripting (Python and Perl most commonly) Molecular Dynamics Machine Learning etc We can keep on listing the topics as the world today is moving towards a diversification. You could easily find a chemical guy or a computer sciences guy doing work on Bioinformatics. To begin with, I think this could be a wonderful start considering you have basic knowledge: http://www.ploscollections.org/d... There are several challenges in the field, and one major is the lack of reliable accurate software tools! Next Generation Sequencing Analysis is trending a lot these days! There is plenty of room and scope for development of automated workflows to handle the vast amount of data generated by NGS. Protein Folding and molecular dynamics also have good applicability. Predicting Protein/DNA-Protein Structures, Drug Discovery and Target Identification are some of the other areas having great scope and challenges.
