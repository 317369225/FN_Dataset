I would like to make a version of autocorrect kinda like a find and replace program. What system should I use? And how would I go about programing such a thing?
It depends on exactly how this program works. If you want something that can load up a file and do a find and replace on it, perhaps in real time as you type, you could use Java, or C# is a very nice and relatively painless choice for Windows. Unfortunately the free version of Visual Studio for C# makes it a pain to deploy the app. C++ would make for a zippier and more efficient app, in which case you could use QT Studio. But the learning curve is much steeper.
