What are Donald Knuth's main original contributions to computer science?
I think some of the main original contributions to Computer Science are the following: Knuth-Bendix algorithm/orders, used in all modern theorem provers, such as Z3 and Vampire, which in turn are used by many program analysis tools. The article is Simple Word Problems in Universal Algebras. Knuth-Moris-Pratt string searching (already mentioned). The article is Fast Pattern Matching in Strings. LR(k) grammars, which lay the foundation for parser generators (think yacc and successors). The article is On the Translation of Languages from Left to Right. Attribute grammars, a way to define the semantics of a (simple) programming language that pops up in research every now and then. For example, they were used in the study of VLSI circuits. The article is Semantics of Context-Free Languages. I believe he was the first to profile programs. The article is An Empirical Study of FORTRAN Programs.He also did some work in mathematics. If I remember correctly, I saw him in a video saying that the article he is most proud of is The Birth of the Giant Component.
