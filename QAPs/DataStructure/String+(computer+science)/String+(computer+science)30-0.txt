What is the most improbable thing people have ever seen?
Aurora Bourealis ("The Northern Lights") from my hometown in Skaneateles, NY.  When I was 16 years old, one summer night I remember looking at the sky and wondering what the faint changing colors of light could possibly be. I got a ladder and climbed onto the roof to watch the show.  Only later did I realize what an amazing natural occurrence I was experiencing.
