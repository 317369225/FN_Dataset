Have there been any new brilliant computer science algorithms in last 10 years?
These are 2 new algorithms I have heard in recent times. AKS Primality test, from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK) in 2002 According to wikipedia, AKS is the first primality-proving algorithm to be simultaneously general, polynomial, deterministic, and unconditional. Previous algorithms had been developed for centuries but achieved three of these properties at most, but not all four. The name of the paper is "PRIMES is in P". Improvement in max-flow (approximate algorithm), from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2010 This paper is about a new approximate algorithm for solving the max-flow problem in undirected graphs. An article about this can be found here. According to that article, "If N is the number of nodes in a graph, and L is the number of links  between them, then the execution of the fastest previous max-flow  algorithm was proportional to (N + L)(3/2). The execution of the new algorithm is proportional to (N + L)(4/3).  For a network like the Internet, which has hundreds of billions of  nodes, the new algorithm could solve the max-flow problem hundreds of  times faster than its predecessor."
