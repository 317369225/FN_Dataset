What is the point of pure mathematics?
Timothy Gowers, a professional mathematician, professor, and Fields-medal-winner, discusses the importance of pure mathematics and why mathematics departments should receive ample funding in his lecture "The Importance of Mathematics" available here: One of his key points is the interconnectedness of maths. I think it's easy for the layperson to accept that maths is directly useful in at least one area. Most people answering this question in this thread are spelling out instances where maths has an application. I don't think anyone will actually debate that topic. What's more interesting is how maths that doesn't (yet?) have a direct use plays vital importance in practical applications. The importance is illustrated by Gowers by showing how seemingly disparate areas of maths are actually deeply connected to one another, ans how often insights in one area lead to breakthroughs in another.
