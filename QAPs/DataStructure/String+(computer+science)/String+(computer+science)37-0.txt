What are all the All India rank 1s in IIT - JEE doing with their lives?
Nitin Gupta, (BSBE Faculty) AIR 1, IITJEE 2000, just joined IIT Kanpur in July 2014 as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences and Bio-engineering. He graduated from the Department of CSE, IIT Kanpur and eventually went on to study biology at University of California, San Diego. He plans to set up a cognitive neuroscience lab here at IITK. Plus, he is a wonderful person to talk to and knows a lot of the recent campus culture for a Professor! An inspiration, especially for me, another student of Computer Science at IITK who is interested in biology! Updated 76w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Saurav Kumar
