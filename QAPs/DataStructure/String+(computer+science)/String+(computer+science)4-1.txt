Computer Science Homework Question:Â How do I check a string for just letters in Java?
You need to use a regular expression. You give it a pattern and it tries to match the pattern against a string. The full tutorial is Lesson: Regular Expressions but for something this simple you can look at the java doc Pattern (Java Platform SE 7 ) and take a peek at some blogs talking about it. There are magic symbols for matching all white space characters (spaces and tabs), or matching all numbers, or all letters, and saying match many etc. It can match blocks of patterns and return you an array of things which match the pattern blocks from the original string. Regular expressions are in all languages. They are a swiss army knife. Its worth stopping and playing with them they will be your new best friend once you have got to grips with them. Enjoy.
