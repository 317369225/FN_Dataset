Is it right to put it this way: math is the study of objects that are defined using sets?
Using sets as a building block to construct every mathematical objects is just one approach of axiomatization. It does not mean that numbers are sets in essence. Nobody would think of a number as a set in daily life. Two is two, not {{},{{}}}. Numbers are as fundamental as sets. Mathematicians want an axiomatic system to be as simple as possible. Numbers and sets are both basic notions. We can just put both of them into our axioms as something that exist without the need of proofs. Though if mathematicians find out they can eliminate one using another, they surely won't miss this chance. It turns out that using sets to define numbers is the better way. This does not mean it is the only correct way. It was only 100 years ago when Zermelo proposed his axiomatic set theory. Mathematics has a much longer history. When Pythagoras studied right-angled triangles, he probably didn't think of a triangle as a set. When Diophantus studied equations with integers, he probably didn't think of an integers as a set. Though it is beyond doubt that their works are mathematics. It is possible that after some years, mathematicians discover a more elegant axiomatic system to construct mathematical objects using something other than sets (say using topos). Then we would start to say "math is the study of objects that are defined using topos". Most mathematicians won't even notice anything have changed. In fact nothing has changed. The "foundations" of math is actually pretty detached from the math that is used to solve real problems. It is not as important as you think of. It is hard to define what mathematics is, though if we start from some axioms and use proofs to derive theorems, it should be safe to say that we are doing math. It does not matter whether we start with ZFC set theory, Peano axioms on natural numbers, or Euclid's axioms on geometry.
