What are some of the algorithms in computer science that you like more than the others?
At this particular moment, my favourite algorithms constitute a set of algorithms that can be implemented in approximating AIXI (this will definitely change, and I don't think I am aware of all of them). AIXI is a mathematical formalism to an Artificial General Intelligence. However, AIXI is incomputable and therefore, it must be approximated. Some of the algorithms or types of algorithms used in approximating AIXI involve: Probabilistic sampling algorithms, these include Monte-Carlo algorithms, or the Metropolis Hastings algorithm and more. These types of algorithms are mostly used to determine the best thing/action to do at a particular time point by AIXI. General-purpose prediction algorithms which are based on learning Variable order Markov Models (VMMs). These algorithms include: the Context Tree Weighting Method (CTW), Prediction by Partial Match (PPM), Probabilistic Suffix Trees (PSTs), the improved Lempel-Ziv Algorithm (LZ-MS) and more. These types of algorithms are used to determine what might happen next in a particular environment, this also feeds into determining what the best thing/action to do is.
