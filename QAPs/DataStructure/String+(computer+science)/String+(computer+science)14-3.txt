What is the worst mistake ever made in computer science and programming that proved to be painful for programmers for years?
Programming languages are a good target, because they define intellectual worlds within which much of the interesting activity happens. So, I'd pick FORTRAN for 2 reasons, one formal and one heretic: 1) The lack of use of formalization for FORTRAN's syntactical definition, implies that people can write programs of near-ambiguity and of little error detection: 		 	 	 					C     This is a FORTRAN program       DO10I=1.5			 		       A(I)=X+B(I) 10    CONTINUE The above is NOT much of a loop because the DO line is an assignment really. To his credit, Backus stands for the first letter of "BNF", which is the formalization used up to nowadays to formally specify many subsequent languages, including C, Python and quite a few more. Yes, Perl has no formal definition, does that ring a bell? 2) Now, the heretic argument is that: FORTRAN abused indentation in a way that has been very unproductive, *to the point of driving people on the other extreme, whereby ";" is sole delimiter of program instructions*, as opposed to line format. This design has proven to be fine for automated parsers, passable for programmers, poor for everybody else who wants to read third-party code. Do not believe this? Read a few IOCCC entries and come back to discuss it! Now the interesting facts follow, which regard Pascal & could apply to C, too: In 1978, Ripley & Druseikis examined the Pascal compiler of a CDC 6000 machine, collecting information regarding the nature and frequency of syntax errors in 589 programs. In exactly two-thirds of all detected errors, only a single symbol of the language is missing and in 48.5% of all cases, that is ";"!! Here are the first three causes of errors: Number of errors     %            Error cause83                        48.5                     ; ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼18                        10.5                   END ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼13                         7.6                  BEGIN ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ Do you see the picture? Use of ";" and explicit keywords or "{","}" as means to define code blocks, implies a whole class of errors, that can be pruned by correct indentation (!), which experienced programmers do advise *anyhow* for readability. If we have it anyhow, why not as well use it and keep it as such? fi. Python has its own issues in certain areas, but at least this is done right and it should be no surprise that new Python programmers often get a correct program *their first time ever*. So, people often become heretic with the so-called *off-side rule*, but the true cause of the heresy has been the resentment that FORTRAN created in the first place! Many modern languages steamed ahead anyhow: Off-side rule Q.E.D. ;-)
