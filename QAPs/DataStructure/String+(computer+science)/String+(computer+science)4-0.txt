Computer Science Homework Question:Â How do I check a string for just letters in Java?
As I think you've figured out, the problem is occurring before the actual loop that's implementing your string letter check. The problem is in your Scanner. It's throwing an exception because it's not finding both elements that you're looking for. I can't tell why because your code fragment is syntactically incorrect. This is all wrong: myName = Alex Wilde; That wouldn't even compile. But wherever your problem is, it's in that vicinity in the actual code. Your actual loop is also incorrect, but you haven't even gotten to that yet. The question is, what do you supposed to do when you detect that it's got a non-letter character? Probably throw an exception, but I don't know what your assignment calls for. Right now, the code just doesn't do anything.
