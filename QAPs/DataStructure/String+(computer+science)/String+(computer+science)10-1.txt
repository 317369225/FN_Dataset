What is the funniest thing you have ever coded?
Some 10 years ago when I had absolutely nothing to do, I've created a Fish Programming Language (or FIPL): FiPL - Fish Programming Language. On this page you will find a complete IDE with the editor, compiler and debugger running inside a Java applet, the book Fish Programming in a Nutshell; fishlets - snippets of the FIPL code that can be copy-pasted and executed right on the page, and even an extension on the theme - a book called How to turn the Fish into a Quantum Computer. FIPL is a new programming paradigm. Your whole RAM is located on the drawing of a fish where each scale represents a memory cell and several registers on the tail. You can only manipulate colors in this paradigm - no numbers or characters exist. Scales can be organized in various groups: buddies, horde or all the fish -  everything is explained in the book (FUPE). The execution advances in cycles, where all scales undergo some programmed change and, based on that, a number of incidents happen. Every change in the color of a scale is regarded as an incident, so the whole paradigm is called Incidental Programming. Incidents may have aftermaths comprising commands for the next cycle. There are many commands available in the language (again, please read the book), but to exit the system you can use thanks for all the fish command. The funny thing is that you can actually do some fishy programming on this. Updated 137w ago • View Upvotes
