Can computer viruses be designed to evolve completely on their own? If so how does it work?
Currently, there aren't any confirmed computer viruses that have evolved completely on their own. While theoretically possible, the coding would be extremely hard and is more of something that you would find in a PhD thesis compared to something someone is coding for fun and/or hacking. There are computer viruses which change their code in order to stay undetected though, which is a technique called Polymorphism. While implementations change language-to-language, it generally involves encrypting portions of the code and decrypting them at runtime in order to stay undetected by antivirus engines, as well as re-encrypting each new iteration of the piece of malware (if it's a worm/virus) with a unique encryption string.
