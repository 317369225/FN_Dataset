What is the funniest thing you have ever coded?
I submitted 12 blank A4 pages as a project and received 100/100 on it. Back in the varsity days. 7th semester. Compiler Construction class. To demonstrate the concept of Bootstrapping (the act of writing a compiler in the language which it is intended to compile), we are tasked with a project to design a minimalist programming language, write a compiler for the language in that language and submit the source code in hard form. The project is due a month later and is weighted heavily. As an ace procrastinator, I while away the month playing video-games and hanging out with friends. Before long, it's the night before the day of submission. Sound logic goes that the project couldn't realistically be completed in the time left, so I go to a good night's sleep. But before I do I have an idea. Next morning, I go to the campus photo-copy shop first thing, buy a dozen blank A4 sheets, write my name on the first one, and submit it as the project. A trip to the professor's cabin for an explanation later, I score 100/100. But how? The previous semester I developed a programming language, inspired by Whitespace, called Vague, complete with documentation, examples and installers as a hobby project. The idea is that the syntax of the language consists of just three characters: Tab, Space and Newline, making a program written in Vague seemingly *invisible*. That includes the compiler itself. While initially thinking of it as some kind of a mistake, the professor was impressed enough with the work that he awarded me the maximum score. Win, win. ​ A "max of X integers" program written in Vague ​ A screenshot from the documentation of the language Updated 14w ago • View Upvotes
