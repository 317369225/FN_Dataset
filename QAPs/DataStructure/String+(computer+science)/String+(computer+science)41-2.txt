How difficult is it for the average person to become a computer programmer?
I agree with Shawn Drost. Also I gave an answer to the Silicon Valley: How do you become good enough a programmer to work at a top-notch Silicon Valley company? question which is pretty much silimar to yours because Silicon Valley is a Mecca for good (and excellent) software engineers. study a lot love what you do be curious share/teach others (meetups, workshops) learn from others (meetups, hackathons) go extra mile: if somebody asks you to do X do X+1 give your self time: Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years promote the hell out of yourself, don't be shy create beautiful (code-wise) things All of the principles can be applied to any other job. :) Updated 137w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
