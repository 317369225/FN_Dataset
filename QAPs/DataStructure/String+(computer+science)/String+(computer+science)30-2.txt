What is the most improbable thing people have ever seen?
I am a regular contributor to Wikipedia, and together with a bunch of Bengali speaking expatriates, worked on the development of the Bengali Wikipedia in its early days (2006-8). At that time, there were very few people actively working on it. One of them was a doctor who lived somewhere in USA and was doing his postdoc at a university. We never met while working on Wikipedia, but were collaborating on Bengali Wikipedia a lot. That summer (2007), I went to intern in Google in Mountain View, California. One weekend, my wife and I went to an Indian restaurant. Suddenly, the person sitting in the next table jumps up, and comes to me, asking, aren't you Ragib? I was surprised ... I've never seen this guy! How does he know my name and face? It turned out that he was my long term Wikipedia collaborator, who happened to be dining in the same restaurant with his sister! He had been to my webpage, and therefore knew my face. Amazing coincidence, isn't it?
