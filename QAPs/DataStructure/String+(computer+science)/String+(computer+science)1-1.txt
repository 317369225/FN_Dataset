What fields in computer science are as difficult as string theory?
That would probably be Geometric Complexity theory. An effort by Ketan Mulmuley, Milind Sohoni and others (the names of whom I do not have the patience to google) to solve the P vs NP question by using Algebraic Geometry (AG) and Representation Theory . It has connections to the Riemann Hypothesis, quantum groups and even langlands duality. Algebraic and arithmetic combinatorics, algorithms in arithmetic geometry (which by itself is a mix of two notoriously difficult areas in math, namely AG and Number Theory) have also played an important role in this filed. I have absolutely no idea what any of this means, but it sure sounds bang my head to the wall difficult.Â  Another area I think is the theoretical and mathematical aspects of machine learning/Deep Learning. Techniques from well... AG again (polynomials everywhere!), Algebraic Topology, Harmonic Analysis, Hodge theory, group theory, even a very young field like Tropical Geometry, and differential geometry applied to probability and statistics known as information geometry have found a place in the effort of trying to formulate why learning models are so good at what they do. And oh yes even the famous Renormalization Group has shown its face here. Of course, it's debatable if these areas as as difficult as String Theory. But what's interesting here is that every field of math mentioned above (don't know about harmonic analysis) play very important roles in String theory research.
