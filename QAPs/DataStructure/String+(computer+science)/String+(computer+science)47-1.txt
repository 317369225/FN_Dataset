I would like to make a version of autocorrect kinda like a find and replace program. What system should I use? And how would I go about programing such a thing?
I would use Python, and if you want a GUI I would use Tkinter - Python interface to Tcl/Tk-- because that's all native to Macs. I would start with a keylogger (you can find code for this all over), then I would do some pattern matching (re - Regular expression operations), maybe something like (off the top of my head): #Input: keylogged text, dictionary of possible words#Output: a word from that dictionaryimport stringdef autoComplete(text, dictionary):    letters = string.ascii_lowercase    for i in letters:        tmpString = text+i        if tmpString in dictionary:             return(tmpString)        else:             pass Please note that there are a lot, a lot, a lot of different ways to tackle this problem, and in many different languages.
