What is the worst mistake ever made in computer science and programming that proved to be painful for programmers for years?
This one: Pentium FDIV bug For decades, people expected CPUs to be bug-free and flawless, including Intel (company) themselves. And when Intel brought the new Pentium processor on the market, with build-in mathematical coprocessor, no one expected it to be flawed. So it was sold in large quantities and used by many, many people until someone discovered some flaws in the output of his math-related code. He got the wrong values! It took some research to discover that he had not made a coding error, but that the processor had a flaw. The Internet was also slowly becoming more popular so he contacted others who could confirm the flaw, once they were aware of it. Intel offered to replace the faulty processors on request but many people just didn't use this option. Millions of computers would still be used with this mathematical flaw and it even resulted in Microsoft adding a work-around in Microsoft Windows to "fix" this bug. (Also, various compilers, including Borland Delphi, added a compiler option to use a software-based math engine instead of the flawed FDIV function.) The result? People started to realise that even processors can have bugs. Worst mistake ever!
