Why do most top tech companies give more priority to algorithms during the recruitment process?
Not all top tech companies. :-) At LinkedIn, we put a heavy emphasis on the ability to think through the problems we work on.Â  For example, if someone claims expertise in machine learning, we ask them to apply it to one of our recommendation problems. And, when we test coding and algorithmic problem solving, we do it with real problems that we've faced in the course of our day jobs, eg. http://thenoisychannel.com/2011/... We try as hard as possible to make the interview process representative of actual work. It's an approach that has served us well.
