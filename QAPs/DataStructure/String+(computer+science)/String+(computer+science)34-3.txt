Why is it difficult to understand quantum computing?
Awesome answer Scott Aaronson, thank you for the links as I had not read your stuff before.  I would like to offer a hopefully complementary view I found helpful if I could.  I found this lecture by Dwave startup scientist Eric Ladzinsky to also be instructional. He is from  the startup company Dwave.  They are really a highly funded R&D startup but their plan is to make a commercial version of their computer.  They have delivered two prototypes, one to Google.  The lecture was given at Google when they delivered the prototype: @ This is one of the best plain english descriptions of quantum mechanics and how their quantum computer works that I ever heard.  There is more info on the Quantum Computer company DWave - link here: Home .  This is not Crowdfunding like I discuss in my blog at: http://www.systemdmfg.com/about/ , but in my opinion they could crowdfund either a research project or a product and it would by just fantastic to get other physicists involved.  Their research model however uses lean methods to continuously improve their product. Even though the business model is far from lean, the company uses lean development processes to iterate this AWESOME computer! Rapid iterations and learning from one model to the next is fundamental to how they are operating their research teams   Basically they use the least efficient manufacturing processes in the world to slowly add capability to the processors.  They are depending on the fundamental principle of exponential growth in calculating power as nodes are painfully and slowy added to their processor.
