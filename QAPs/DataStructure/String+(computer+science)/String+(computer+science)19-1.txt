What is the point of pure mathematics?
There is an influence chain that connects pure math to technology. Since technology is a major factor in the advancement of civilization (stone tools, astronomy, chemistry, electricity, transistors, drugs), one can indirectly credit pure math with many of these things. Technology and medical innovations are driven by progress in the applied sciences. The applied sciences are driven from the pure sciences. The pure sciences derive their most powerful frameworks from applied mathematics. And applied mathematics gets the framework for its innovations from pure mathematics. So while pure math may not discover a cure for cancer, it indirectly supports the applied math and problem-solving techniques of quantum physics, which provides the framework for protein modeling, which drives "rational drug discovery," which is the engine behind the leading biotech companies, which are producing the new cancer-curing drugs.
