As a student majoring in computer science, what are the best sites or journals in the Internet that I could surf and read in order to update myself with the latest innovations in my field of study?
My personal favorite scholarly journal for the field of Computer Science is MIT's technology review, which can be found here: http://www.technologyreview.com Another great source for scholarly. articles and publications in the filled of Computer Science is the IEEE Computing Society. They actively maintain a list of recommended publications here: http://www.computer.org/portal/w... You can also use the search string "scholarly journals computer science" on Google to find more. Be sure to leave the quotes- that way Google will search for that exact combination of letters and characters.
