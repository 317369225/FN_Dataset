Is it right to put it this way: math is the study of objects that are defined using sets?
        "On the Inﬁnite", Mathematische Annalen 95, 1926 Hilbert was writing about how set theory worked so well as the foundations of mathematics. Set theory works so well because it allows us to bring higher-order concepts down to first-order ones.  For example, if you want to talk about all the functions from [math]A[/math] to [math]B[/math], in logic that's a higher-order concept.  The elements of [math]A[/math] and the elements of [math]B[/math] are first-order.  With set theory all those functions can be interpreted as another set [math]B^A[/math].  Likewise all the predicates on a set [math]A[/math], which correspond to subsets of [math]A[/math], form another set, the [math]power set[/math] of [math]A[/math]. Mathematicians generally didn't distinguish between first-order things and higher-order things, and with sets they don't have to.  They're all sets. Can you do all of mathematics within set theory?  Most of it seems to fit.  You'll find mathematicians who will argue that it's not sufficient for everything.  Some don't use classical logic. Some require constructive methods. Some study the foundations of mathematics.
