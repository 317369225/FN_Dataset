I would like to make a version of autocorrect kinda like a find and replace program. What system should I use? And how would I go about programing such a thing?
I was thinking recently about how to make an adaptive IDE, kind of like an IDE that would work anywhere by learning what you're typing. It's probably a bit different than what you're talking about, but I started some basic work on it by making a keylogger in C# (my first choice was Java, but you have to type into the program for KeyListeners to work in that). If you include that and some rapid backspacing you could accomplish an autocorrect.
