What are some great tech events to attend in Bangalore?
Arguably, Bangalore has the most number of regular tech events happening in India. My personal favourite is the Yahoo Open Hack. I have attended two of the past (5) events and they are arranged very well with only wifi issues causing problems. This is a free event so there are limited seats which fill up pretty quick once registrations are open. Then there's HasGeek which hosts a number of events around the year like JSFoo, Droidcon, Cartonama, MetaRefresh, RootConf, The Fifth Elephant, etc. These are paid events. More details are available on the web site. You would also find meetups taking place almost every weekend via Meetup.com Find Meetup groups near you. This is because there are a lot of stronge user groups in Bangalore. And as you already mentioned, Barcamp Bangalore (12 editions done) rounds up my list.
