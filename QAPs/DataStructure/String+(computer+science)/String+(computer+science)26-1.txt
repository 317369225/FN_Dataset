What are some great tech events to attend in Bangalore?
Apart from the regular conferences mentioned by Kenneth, HasGeek also organizes public lectures by visiting geeks (mostly free to attend), under the banned Geekup! You can see the last one on: Pune JSFoo Geekup - Geekup There's a mix of events that happen at Jaaga including their Study Groups. It's also a nice place to catch up with fellow geeks/startup enthusiasts. Lots of small groups around specific technologies (Ruby, Python, Android etc.) also meet regularly. A few more suggestions on an old thread: Are there any meet-ups in Bangalore for techies? and What Indian events offer startup/product launch platforms?
