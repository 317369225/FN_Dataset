Can computer viruses be designed to evolve completely on their own? If so how does it work?
It is not desirable to have applications (viruses) that "evolve on their own" as you put it. Every application, even a virus has a purpose. The purpose of a virus is usually to break something by for instance calling system methods, interfere with some resource or whatever. What exactly does it mean to evolve entirely on its own? This is not a valid question. A virus designed to spread through any available resource that it can access in order to ensure its own survival and growth? Such things exist kinda but are called organisms. Applications execute very specific instructions and on the level of code you have to define every data type, return value and method call. Otherwise nothing happens. You can't design an application to "destroy whatever you encouter", it does not work like that. An application that finds itself in an unknown environment, for instance a Windows executable that suddenly after a night of partying wakes up on an Apple computer can not execute a single thing and would just be some meaningless data on the filesystem. It would not be a virus anymore.
