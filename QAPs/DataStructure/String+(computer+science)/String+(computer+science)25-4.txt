Why do most top tech companies give more priority to algorithms during the recruitment process?
I've written a blog post about this The gist of which is to paraphrase Winston Churchill. Many forms of [technical interviews] have been tried and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that [having candidates code data structures and algorithms on a white board] is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that [whiteboard coding interviews are] the worst form of [technical interviews] except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time. I believe democracy and data structure/ algorithm coding interviews to be one in the same in the "least bad" since. https://medium.com/@thatboiwill/... Updated 12w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
