What are Donald Knuth's main original contributions to computer science?
I don't know how many actual, novel, theorems and algorithms he invented on his own, but everything I've read seems to suggest that his main contribution was bringing mathematical rigor to computer science, and doing a lot of refining of proofs of other theorems and algorithms. http://www.fbbva.es/TLFU/tlfu/in... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knu... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knu... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knu... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tra...
