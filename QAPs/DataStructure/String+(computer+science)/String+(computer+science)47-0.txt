I would like to make a version of autocorrect kinda like a find and replace program. What system should I use? And how would I go about programing such a thing?
This kind of string searching and manipulation is a classic, core Computer Science field of research. It's not an especially hard problem, but it certainly has many subtleties. If you don't have any CS education, you are at a fairly serious disadvantage, because there is a lot to learn. Just about any programming language can do this sort of thing. Whatever is easiest for you to learn is fine. The major script languages (Python, Perl, Ruby, etc) are especially well suited for these kinds of problems. Beware that the line between "pretty easy" and "basically impossible" is pretty subtle sometimes, and that is true in this field. Without a more clear description of the problem, it's hard to say whether what you want is doable or crazy. This comic is accurate: If your string algorithm requires any comprehension of the meaning of the text, for example, you're doomed. Updated 18w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Izabella Zamora
