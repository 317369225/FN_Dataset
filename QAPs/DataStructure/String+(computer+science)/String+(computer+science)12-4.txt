What is the difference in knowledge of a language (say JavaScript) between a non-computer science background programmer and a computer science engineer/scientist and how does it help?
Well, as far as I'm concerned, the important difference is that a CS trained specialist knows how the things work on quite a few levels; as a result, it's easier for them to solve tasks that are considered "tricky". A fine example was a friend of mine, looking at one of the Java Puzzlers: he didn't know much about Java, but solved the puzzle instantly, because, I quote, "You wouldn't be able to write a compiler that does otherwise." As a downside though, it's harder for them to stay focused: where a novice sees a clear path, a CS graduate sees a bunch of problems waiting to happen.
