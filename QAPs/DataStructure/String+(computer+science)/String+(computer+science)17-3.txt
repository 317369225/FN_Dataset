How does one become a great coder?
Books alone and research will not make you a great programmer. You need much more than that. Greatness comes from a spark, an inspiration. Decide on what you consider to be great computer programs. Many computer programs exist and you may have used some you consider absolutely great. A good place to start is a list of C++ Applications. You can even decide that a mobile app is the greatest program you have used. Basically, there are great programs that you did not write but you are interested in the skills it took to make those programs happen. After you identify great programs, you then need to learn about the lead software developers how wrote them or greatly influenced their creation. The Web may have information about the lead developer(s) of a given software you consider great. The crucial part is, what have those programmers written about their point of view about software. Often, their published information contains a good mindset that nudges you in the right direction. Anyone can tell you what books to read and what to specialize in to become great, but the best source is those who are great. Once you identify those persons who are great, consider their background and history. What programming languages do they use? You will find that, on average, many of the programs that people call great, the ones they will definitely pay money for when there are free alternatives, or those free programs that run most of society are made in a similar fashion using similar technologies and points of view. It goes back to identifying great software and those who created it and how they got there.
