How difficult is it for the average person to become a computer programmer?
If you want to be good at something, do it everyday. Getting good at programming requires persistence. Some key suggestions right off the top of my head are: Master algorithms and data structures. Good way to learn is to commit yourself to a MOOC. Be an active student by completing exercises and programming assignments. Princeton's Algorithms 1 and 2 on coursera (https://www.coursera.org/) are my personal favourite. Regularly participate in programming competitions. Popular platforms include HackerRank and topcoder. They would cement your algorithmic thinking. Contribute to open source projects on github (https://github.com/). You could start off by documenting code, writing tutorials and finding and resolving bugs. Reading a large codebase would give you some perspective on how things work in the real world. If you're a student at a university, do an internship with a professor which involves programming. It would give you a lot of confidence. BONUS: Your work might get published Now its time to give back. Help others by contributing on platforms like stackoverflow. You'll actually be helping yourself  by reading and debugging someone else's code  and learning a lot of subtle things in the process. Disclaimer: I'm not an expert, I'm using this recipe myself. Best of luck. Happy Coding.
