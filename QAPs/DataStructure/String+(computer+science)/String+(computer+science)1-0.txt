What fields in computer science are as difficult as string theory?
I am not sure if this is true, I saw the following on Twitter - "Programming is one of the most difficult branches of applied math; the poorer mathematicians had better remain pure mathematicians." - Dijkstra Actually, it's like comparing apple and oranges, some people find string theory easy and writing code hard. A better question would be what fields of CS are as complex as string theory, string theory builds on a plethora of physical and mathematical concepts. Are there any fields in CS which use knowledge from various different fields. I believe theoretical machine learning is pretty complex - draws from linear algebra, geometry, convergence theory (real analysis), statistics, algorithms, graph theory, and nowadays topology and manifolds.
