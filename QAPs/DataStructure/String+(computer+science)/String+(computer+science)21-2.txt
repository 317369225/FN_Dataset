What is it like to have dinner with Donald Knuth?
I never had dinner with him, but I had lunch with him a few times while we were working on a project over last summer. He knows a lot about a lot of things, so it is easy to have a conversation with him. Over our lunches we talked about music, asian languages, art, math and CS. He is an extremely nice guy and is very easy to talk to. Before I met him, I was expecting him to be some sort of brooding genius, but he turned out to be a pretty normal, funny, guy. He is also surprisingly tall. He told a lot of humerous stories during the lunches. He talked about how he hates the normal QWERTY keyboard layout and how he made his own layout which he calls "donkeys". The modifications he made were pretty smart, but it made it difficult for him to use the keyboard on the laptop we used for his project. At one point of the meal, Knuth noticed that the other professor I was sitting with was not eating his tomatoes. Without asking, Knuth decided to reach over and help himself to the tomatoes. He also ate my croutons (also without asking) when he noticed I was not going to eat them. I thought that this was rather funny. He also has a very good memory. At our first lunch I mentioned that I was going to a Rubik's cube competition. The next time we met up he immediately asked me how it went. I wasn't expecting him to remember that since I'm sure that he has a ton of things going on in his life.
