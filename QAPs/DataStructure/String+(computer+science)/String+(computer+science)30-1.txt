What is the most improbable thing people have ever seen?
Playing darts, I threw two double-bullseyes in a row and was celebrating like hell.  This ended the match and I was very happy to have won.  THEN, whimsically and only half paying attention, I threw my third, final, now superfluous dart at the board.  It struck and stuck into the BACKSIDE of one of the two darts already on the board, thus scoring a third double-bullseye in the most dramatic and improbable fashion imaginable, given the first two darts.  The only thing better and less likely would have been to have scored one double-bullseye, stuck a dart in the back of that dart, then stuck a third dart in the back of the dart already stuck into the original double-bullseye. My friends and I went ape-shit.  It was probably the greatest moment of my beer-sports life.
