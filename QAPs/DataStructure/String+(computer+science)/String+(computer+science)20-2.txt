Can computer viruses be designed to evolve completely on their own? If so how does it work?
This is fun...I'm not going to dwell out all the things coz I'm working on this since last 5 years...it stays in my PC as of now..trying to learn me..lemme tell you how i'm trying to make it work.. Now virus can be anything...Mine is just trying to read pattern and it saves the files which you delete..nothing destructive yet...but not sure how my mind works...trying to get a webcam on and stream it too...as of now it stores the pattern of the usage and mail the data....like when you listen to music, or play games or play movies.....it started off with KBs....hope to evolve it soon...
