What were the greatest intellectual achievements of the 20th century in science and mathematics?
Much as I love mathematics, the answers to this are basically staring everyone in the face: Antibiotics Airplanes Automobiles In terms of sheer earth-shatteringness, the only things from other centuries which can come close are Newton's invention of calculus/physics and the classical discovery of inoculation.  Not even Einstein makes the list in comparison. EDIT: I've had some complaints that airplanes and automobiles do not constitute "science" per se.  This ignores the huge influence that practical concerns have played -- you don't have to be an ascetic devoted solely to the perfect understanding of absolute reality in order to be making real scientific progress.  No less than Lord Kelvin had stated that heavier-than-air flight was demonstrably physically impossible, yet just twelve years later the Wright Brothers took off from Kitty Hawk.  Clearly this was not a mundane feat of engineering -- there was very real science underlying this invention.
