What are some of the algorithms in computer science that you like more than the others?
I like algorithms that are simple, stupid and obvious.  If I have verified empirically that the code is performance-critical, then (at least in the work that I do) the correct choice is to look at how the code is interacting with the architecture and make changes accordingly. To be honest, the kind of low-level coding I enjoy doesn't lend itself to complex algorithms.  For example, if you're writing a Intel Pin tool then you're going to be much more worried about getting control flow out of your instrumentation code and not at all worried about how optimal your data structures are.  If you're writing MPI code you're focused on minimizing the amount of communication between nodes, and if that means less efficient code on the processors, it's generally still a win.
