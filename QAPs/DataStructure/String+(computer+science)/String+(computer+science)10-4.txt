What is the funniest thing you have ever coded?
When I was learning to code in high school, I spent a lot of time in the computer lab. It was a good place to hide out too during mandatory assemblies too, as the computer teacher didn't seem to really track when exactly those were. Plus, he would never suspect sweet ol' innocent me of skipping required school activities. He and I got along well. Anyway, I was busy building a Tetris-like game so I spent a lot of my free (and, uh, not free) time in the lab. The computer teacher starting complaining to me about someone who kept printing out pages of just... stuff. Random shapes and splotches of black. Dozens of pages at a time. This went on for weeks, infuriating him more and more. Then one day, as the printer is printing (again) and I'm in the lab coding (again), the teacher pulls out a seat next to me and plops down a big stack of papers on my keyboard. "Wanna chat?" he says. He's pissed. I pause my game and turn to look at the papers. I look up at my screen. I look down at the papers. In this weird, abstract way, they had this faint resemblance. A circle on the paper and a circle on the screen. But there's a bunch of other stuff on the screen too. So it's not the screen. And yet... it is. But I don't even know how to write code to access a printer. How on earth...? After several repros and much debugging, we track down the issue. A little recursive function that filled in a shape until it hit a perimeter color. Something like this: Somehow, the stack overflowed and this caused it to access some other spot in memory... that consistently triggered the same, bizarre result. To this day, I don't really understand how it happened. Not the stack overflow part - I get that - but the same "random" result? Moral of the story: be careful with recursion!
