What is the difference in knowledge of a language (say JavaScript) between a non-computer science background programmer and a computer science engineer/scientist and how does it help?
To make an analogy, one can know enough to write in English to make a grocery list perfectly well without understanding how to write a research paper or a book.  There is more to building software and systems than understanding the syntax of a language.  To be a serious professional engineer you need to know about a lot more than that.  You need to understand how the language works, and whether this one is the right one to use for this job.  You need to know how its speed will be impacted by other things happening on the machine.  You need to understand how the network works, how version control systems work, how the system should be built, released and managed, and a thousand other things that a beginner won't understand. That said, learning all of that stuff isn't something that can somehow only be learned in a computer science classroom at a university.  Some of the best software engineers I have known don't have degrees at all.
