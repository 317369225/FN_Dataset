Are doctors overcompensated in the U.S.?
Overall, absolutely not. However, some specialties are overcompensated, creating bad incentives for doctors coming out of med school and then even more bad incentives when practicing their specialty. When there are too many specialists in a given region it has been shown that their mere presence can actually generate demand for their own services, even if they are not medically necessary.

Notable quote: "Doctors and hospitals (are) doing things to you and me that we don't need" in a system "that pushes doctors to do more when less is probably better." If doctors were paid salaries and rewarded for the results of their care (as they are at the Mayo Clinic) instead of being paid-per-procedure, the United States would be a healthier country.
