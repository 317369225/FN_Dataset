What are typical ping times between different EC2 availability zones within the same region?
For research purposes, I've been continuously monitoring ping times from us-east-1b to us-east-1a.  A live graph and histogram are available at http://amistrongeryet.com/op_det....  Over the last month, the median is 2.09 ms, 90th percentile is 20ms, 99.th percentile is 47ms.  This is based on over 250,000 pings -- one every 10 seconds over the last 30 days. I have a casual blog where I've focused on various AWS latency measurements.  One post in particular, http://amistrongeryet.blogspot.c..., has a section on EC2 network latency, though it mostly discusses intra-zone latency.
