What is the best way to learn maths for a std. 8 student who literally hates mathematics and is very weak in the subject?
Very weak - that depends what makes him weak. As a math tutor I saw couple of examples where weakness was resulting in lack of some fundamental skill. Once this deficiency was addressed there was considerable improvement. Now for the hate part - that is most difficult if one is prejudiced against subject there will be little to gain from any extra lessons as there will be active resistance against knowledge, hate can come from weakness in math and this is in fact most common cause. Personally it requires a bit psychological approach. One needs to find root cause and address it - anything else can wait for that. An example that I encountered was a young 9 year old kid that was exceptionally bad at maths. I discovered that root cause was severe problem with mental multiplication ability and with long multiplication. Not surprise that division was equally bad. I addressed problem by teaching him Ancient Egyptian multiplication (it is taught in Computer Science studies at my university and this is where I got the idea) since it requires ability to add (where there was no problem) and ability to multiply and divide number by two (multiplication - no problem it was solved by telling him to add number to itself, division was bigger issue so I devised couple of workaround methods to find division result). The effect was pretty much surprise not only problems with mathematics were gone (as kid now could multiply and divide) but also it provided kid with major psychological boost - sure math genius he was not but this "workaround" is enough to carry him through school math comfortably.
