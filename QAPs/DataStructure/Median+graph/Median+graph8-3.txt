Is it true that some people write long and detailed answers just to get upvotes and attract attention?
I would guess, people who want to get maximum upvotes and attention would write SHORTER and PITHIER answers. If that was the goal, then shorter answers would get an upvote. We all have a limit to how much attention we can pay to a single topic, and if your Quora feed is overflowing its banks (Â¡mine is right now!) then you might find yourself preferring a short answer to upvote. Yes, Quora should be about sharing knowledge, not about status. But the problem is: most of us do it. I like to earn upvotes, and I see nothing wrong with that. One of the longest and most detailed answers I remember was by Tim O'Neill. The TL;DR of that would be: If the Holocaust had not happened, the Nazi war criminals would have denied all charges. They denied nothing; they admitted that the Holocaust did happen. The details given in this answer were all given to support that point. It was a very good answer. More than a year after I read it, I have not forgotten. My own long answers are based on the associative way I think. Before this answer gets too long, thanks for the A2A, Prakhar Chauhan.
