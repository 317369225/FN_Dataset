How is the residential real estate market doing in Noe Valley, Pacific Heights, the MIssion, and the Marina District?
Well, I'm not sure how well these images are going to translate after they've been chewed on by the quora uploading program, but hopefully you'll be able to see them clearly. The data source for both charts is the San Francisco multiple listing service. Property type is for single-family homes and condominiums, with any number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The top image is a comparison, by neighborhood, of the median sales price in December of 2008 vs December of 2010. The data shows median sales prices up in the Inner Mission and Pac Heights, stable in Noe Valley, and down in the Marina. The second graph is the month by month detail between the ending points in the above graph, to give you a little idea of the volatility in any of the neighborhoods. It is also worth noting that the data sets for each of these neighborhoods is fairly small, which is part of what contributes to the volatility you see on a monthly basis. Hope this info helps!
