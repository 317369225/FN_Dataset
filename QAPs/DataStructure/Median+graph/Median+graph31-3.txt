CAT or GMAT which one is tougher?
That's a common (but speculative) question which has little practical relevance. For most bschools (including those that accept multiple test scores), there's a single score that usually gets the most importance. In case of many Indian programs, it might be the CAT. For international programs, it might be the GMAT. Narrow down on the list of schools that you want to apply to (based on your experience level, aspirations and other factors) and you'd know which test to prepare for. The level of relative difficulty shouldn't figure in the list. If you are still keen on knowing more about how the two tests differ, this should give you an idea --> GMAT vs CAT Differences Good luck!
