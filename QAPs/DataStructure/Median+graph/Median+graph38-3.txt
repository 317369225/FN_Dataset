Is real-time search fundamentally different from the various search services Google already provides?
Real-time search in very similar to various other search services. A few key differences: Data collection: For real-time search of Twitter, you must accept streams of data as it comes in, which requires you to have the computing power available to process it in real time.  Web crawling is typically done on intervals that vary based on how often a web site is updated. Search techniques: Can be very similar for both but for real-time search of Twitter, a system must be even more concerned with performance (not to say a normal search service isn't concerned with performance).  For example, let's say you want to find similar Tweets to a particular Tweet (say you posted "Quora just went down," and you want to see who else posted something similar).  Obviously, you can't compare every pair of Tweets together.  That would take way too long.  You'd want to use some kind of pre-organized locality sensitive hashing scheme to organize your tweets better in a hash table.
