Is real-time search fundamentally different from the various search services Google already provides?
Edmond Lau's answer does an excellent job covering the large technical challenges to building Realtime Search. In addition to these challenges, Realtime Search has the potential to fundamentally change the way people think about search thanks to some distinctive qualities of the Realtime corpus. Realtime results are, well, fresher. Information often appears on Twitter, Facebook, etc. minutes, if not hours, before it appears on the rest of the web, including major news websites. By looking for spikes in our feeds, we detect many major events in the world well before Web and News can. Realtime results are structured. We have strong, unambiguous, data about content authorship, date, location, social connection (e.g. followers), and actions (e.g. retweets, @replies). This allows us to do things like show results authored in the last 10 minutes within 5 miles of you by people you follow. For the rest of the web, search engines must infer this meta-information and the inherit uncertainty handicaps its usage. Realtime results contain information not published anywhere else on the web. People are becoming sensor nodes, reporting information about the world around them. They're complaining about the security line at JFK, photographing the fire engines outside their neighbor's house, and checking in to their holiday party. They're sharing the latest YouTube kitten video they watched, reacting to red-carpet photos, and writing answers to questions on Quora. Finding these sort of updates and showing them to users is a Hard problem, but an intensely satisfying one. For example, compare http://www.google.com/search?hl=... to http://www.google.com/search?q=a... (comparison probably only good for the next few hours - accurate evaluation of results for such ephemeral events is yet another technical challenge Edmond could have discussed =) Updated 255w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
