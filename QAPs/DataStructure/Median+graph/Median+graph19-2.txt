Have there been any new brilliant computer science algorithms in last 10 years?
Communication-Avoiding Algorithms This is really a new way of looking at algorithms: instead of looking for the best performance in terms of calculations, these algorithms have a cost model that takes communication into account. "Communication" can be anything from moving information throughout clusters to just moving it through the local cache hierarchy. The interesting insight is that these days, communication costs are often at least as significant as computation costs, so minimizing them can have large practical effects. These techniques have already been used to develop improved algorithms even for very common tasks like matrix multiplication and BFS. Here's a nice powerpoint about the subject: http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~demm... These same techniques can also be used to improve energy usage rather than performance.
