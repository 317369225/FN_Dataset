How much math does a game designer need to know?
A game designer is responsible for defining all the rules of how a game works.  If you are designing a video game, many of these rules need to be represented in mathematical form, because computers operate on mathematical principles.  So, you need to have a solid grasp of at least basic algebra so that you can express your game rules as equations and variables.  For example: Attack_Damage = Weapon_Damage - Armor_Resistance. Designers of games of all types (video games, board games, card games, etc.) deal with an element of chance.  Balancing chance properly to provide the right game experience requires a basic knowledge of probability and statistics.  You should be very comfortable in working with fractions, decimals and percentages; calculating mean and median; and graphing distribution curves. Depending on the genre or theme of the game you are designing, you may need to know a bit about physics, economics, and/or geometry.  In fact, a game designer actually needs to know a little bit about everything.
