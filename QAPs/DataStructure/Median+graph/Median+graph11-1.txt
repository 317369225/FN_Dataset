How effective is Leetcode for preparing for technical interviews?
Definitely Leetcode is a great resource to prepare technical interview. It has quite a few very interesting and helpful coding questions that can help you be better prepared for an interview. In fact, most of the questions are very similar to what are asked in an interview, so you can definitely have a clear idea and preparation by practicing with Leetcode. However it doesn't mean that you need to finish all of them or once you finish all of them, you will get a job. Some people are trying to memorize solutions without fully understandingÂ  them, which will never work as it's rare to see the same question in an interview. Also many people thought that technical interview is all about coding, which in fact is an exam. Besides your code, various aspects are evaluated as well like communication, analysis skills etc.. In addition, don't forget system design interviews. So it's better to combine different set of resources/books/websites and pay attention to your communication when preparing.
