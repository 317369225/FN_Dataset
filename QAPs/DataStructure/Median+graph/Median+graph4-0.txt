How much math does a game designer need to know?
"How much math" is a difficult question to quantify :) But the general answer is: it depends. All games are systems of rules, rules are represented with math (Games have deterministic or random rules. You can't leave them "vage"). There are simple systems and there are complex systems. When your game has a lot of parameters, you need math to balance them. You need to understand your canvas, to deal with screen resolutions, ratios, calculate angles, and more. In general, you need enough math (and physics, and economics) to be able to model the specific system you deal with. Try to simulate the process in your head of defining the rules of a game you played. Do you understand how to model it? Do you have enough knowledge to express the rules? You don't need a degree in math or science, but you need to feel very comfortable with dealing with mathematical problems. That's the level of math you need.
