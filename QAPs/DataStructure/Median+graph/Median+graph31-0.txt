CAT or GMAT which one is tougher?
Do you have domestic plans or international plans? Do you carry actual work experience? Can you spare your time for T.I.M.E? How do I score 750+ on GMAT? Ans: GMAT is super easy. You can take the GMAT exam max 5 times in 1 year. You can take each exam after every 16 days as per GMAC's new policy. I know it does take $250 (~Rs.16000) for each exam you take. Just remember that this exam is gonna decide your career and a very high GMAT score will fetch you a guaranteed 30%-50% scholarship as an international student. Top B-schools can track your record of each attempt you made to pick up the best score you earned. I'd suggest not more than 3 scored attempts and the score remains volatile for 3 years. Try to get at least 3 years of work experience (actually speaking, you need 5 years of Work Ex to become a very strong contender) and since you've got a lot of time, why not prepare from Day 1 instead? This is how a normal guy would think right? However, to prepare and crack a super competitive exam like GMAT there is no need for a tuition class and you don't need to prepare heavily for 3-5 years for this exam. You just need to subscribe for an online course (gmat.magoosh.com or gmatprepnow.com)and try to solve 40-50 Questions everyday for a period of 75 days for Math and Verbal lessons with 109 secs on stopwatch for each Qsn. Try 50 Qsns x 100 Secs = 5000 secs everyday's mental pressure i.e. 90 mins of mental football everyday for the next 75 days w/o half-time. Analyze your score. Improvize on the weak areas. It will take a month's time to refresh your Math and Verbal skills via tutorials. Plus, you do not want to waste and wait for 1 year for the CAT exam. GMAT is accepted in most B-Schools in India (even IIM-A/B/C/.......but only for top 1%-2% candidates). If you are currently pursuing your Bachelors degree i.e. if you are in 2nd or 3rd or 4th year engg., you must take a look at ISB's YLP program. Talk to the AdComs i.e. Admissions Committee for the median cut-off for undergrads. A score of 700 on GMAT would do the trick in Stage2. IIM-A/B/C median GMAT score is 750+ (but the FPM doctoral program has 680+ ->  48Q and 39V minimum for FPM admission i.e. >87th %ile). If you are an Indian, you must have at least 4 years of work ex and 730+ on GMAT for IIM-Bangalore (check this coz the competition here is too stiff). Go for EPGP and save your 1 year (-: It is a 720 hrs intensive program as against 960 hrs of its flagship PGP program. If you are an offshore candidate and did your MS abroad (>= 18 months program), you can send your GMAT score of 710+ for IIM-Bangalore (as of 2015) for 2 years PGP program (very good for networking). XLRI's median GMAT score is 680-690 i.e. >85th %ile. No shortcuts to XAT for BM via GMAT. If you have 2+ years of Work Ex, wait for 1 more year and aim for Global MBA  or If you have 4+ years of Work ex, wait for 1 more year and go for GMP. Be ready with your GMAT score by 15th December for XLRI. ISB Hyderabad GMAT median score is 700+ i.e. >89th %ile. It is a 700 hrs intensive 1 year PGP program. Again, minimum 2 years of Work ex would suffice for ISB. (people generally have 4-5 yrs of work ex here.....So, if you have just 2-3 yrs of work ex, you need to earn a very high score on GMAT for sure). For ISB, be ready with your GMAT score by 15th October for Round1 or 15th Jan for Round2. If you are from Mumbai: SP Jain (650+) SJMSOM - IIT Bombay (700+) NMIMS (600+) Welinkar (600+) .....All accept GMAT and will fetch you ₹.100k/month package for sure (-: but IIM Bangalore's package would be ₹.200k/month. So, rethink again!!! The beauty of GMAT is that you can mentally prepare yourself with 1 month's preparation and crack the exam with 700+ score. I'm talking about 150,000+  out of 1.29 million people cracking the 700+ score (equivalent to 89th percentile score) in the past 5 years:http://magoosh.com/gmat/2014/wha... Now, imagine if you want to crack the score of 700+ and hope for an admit to top 10 universities in USA, you'll have to go beyond 710-720 score to get a Wharton/MIT/Stanford/Yale call .....depends upon your MBA aspirations. Yes if you have a vast amount of Work ex, you can score low on GMAT i.e. 680-720. Remember, I said that it is much easier to study with your own pace and crack the GMAT in 2 months time and get a 750 score....every student competes with nearly 5000 applications in a university (Top15 B-schools) for getting an admission according to the specialization.....again depends. CAT needs 5-6 months of preparation (but you have to wait for 1 whole year for this exam) and if you aspire to have an IIM tag on your belt just to show the world that you are the Man, you can choose to give your CAT, get mentally set for the 99th percentile score and in the meantime you can easily give GMAT a try for 1 or 2 attempts :) Likewise, GMAT is awesome. Verbal has SC-CR-RC with 13-14/14-15/19-22 marks respectively. So, anyone who scores 13-14-19 on Verbal SC-CR-RC, will be on a high scorer bracket. Quant goes with 40% DS and 60% PS i.e. 15 and 22 Qsns approx. respectively. Math has no Graphs/Calendar/patterns logic/hard Functions....no Calculus and DI(except for 12 IR Qsns). It's purely logical. GMAT can be cracked with your own pace. CAT needs a lot of time. A lot of patience! GMAT Verbal will kill you for sure. But it gets more interesting when you try to solve a couple of hundred Qsns from each section :) There are 8 x 3 topics for Quant, SC and CR. See the pic below: ​So, there are around 30 topics in total that you need to master in 100 days right? For Quant, OG content + Magoosh + Manhattan is enough. If you are really really weak on the Verbal part, start with the foundations - Nautical Miles by IMS or Word Power Made Easy by Norman&Lewis or Manhattan MGMAT Foundations of Verbal book. You have tons of Apps in the App Store for pocket prep. Try these: Official GMAT app by gWhiz (in-built Timer + Reset button), Prep4 GMAT app by MIT guys (a very comprehensive app), Veritas Question Bank app (has 250 quiz qsns...50 for each), Complete GMAT Video Course app by Veritas prep, GMAT ToolKit 2 app for flash cards, Magoosh GMAT Math app, GMAT idioms app for flash cards, Pocket GMAT app by Manhattan for flashcards (For more flashcards, go to beatthegmat.com website), Pranayama app (for 5 mins mind yoga) and Timer+ app (stopwatch). The GMAT online forum community helps you a lot. Only 2 main active GMAT best forums in the market with over 10 years of expertise are gmatclub.com and beatthegmat.com Don't even think to go beyond that (-: So, log in and skim through the entire website rightaway. Become a silent observer of top main moderators (e.g. Bunuel and bb on gmatclub.com) and top members and followers on both the forums (-: Try to solve at least 10 mocks that are available for free for the 1st attempt (from Manhattan MGMAT, Veritas Prep, The Economist, Kaplan, 800score, Platinum GMAT, http://litesee.com/gmat.htm for verbal, Princeton Review, gmatclub.com and the actual GMATPrep s/w that includes 4 actual simulation tests of the GMAT exam ) and try to supplement it with an online course such as magoosh.com or gmatprepnow.com (hardly takes $99 for Magoosh and $0 for gmatprepnow).Buy the actual Quant Review and Verbal Review from GMAC. (buy it from amazon.in ;) save ₹300) Wiley, the publisher, provides you an online access to solve the same Qsns which allows you to simulate real GMAT exam mode online (-: Buy Question Pack1 from the mba.com (takes $30). Now, see the pic below: Total = around 3000 Qsns here. If you follow my chart shown below, you'll get your dream score for sure. Byheart this chart and solve these Qsns 2-3 times. Maintain your Error Log: GMAT Error Logs - Free Tools for your GMAT Study So, say if you want to crack GMAT in 100 days, take out the entire column and divide it by 100 i.e. try to solve 6 DS 9 PS 5 SC 4 CR 1 RC passage per day. Try to go step by step. 1st complete Magoosh in 20-25 days and then touch the OG content and then touch your laptop with GMATPrep QsnPack1 practice. At this modest rate, you can easily cope up with 34-35 Qsns/day. Take rest on Sundays. This is really important. Don't budge. Complete the entire practice set and you'll feel confident enough to crack the mocks after 50 days for sure. Why 50 days? Remember, 3000+ Qsns are actually hidden in the mocks as well. So, double or triple your speed as per your capacity to digest that kind of data in your head. Keep that hunger and solve 20 mocks at least :) Don't forget to solve Manhattan MGMAT Qsns(I've not mentioned here in my chart) for SC and it really helps to crack the SC section if you could download "Thursdays with Ron" which is entirely for free (-: It has 50+ videos till date with more than 80+ hrs of online coaching content and get a high speed internet connection for downloading this 15 GB of awesome Verbal content or stream it as you wish:http://www.manhattanprep.com/gma... Do check this for consolidated files:http://gmatclub.com/forum/update... You don't need to go for an actual mentor coaching because the online part covers everything and the forums will help you solve your doubts quickly (-: These are 2 eBooks with 200 pgs of awesome content that you must read:   SC Tips eBook from Prep4GMAT by MIT guys (-: SC eBook from Magoosh's blog for idioms (-: Even if you are not satisfied with your official CR content and are really hungry for more, go for Powerscore CR bible, Powerscore RC and the Official LSAT SuperPrep......You'll have to dedicate another 100 days to cover this entire topic (2000+ Qsns) if you are weak in CR or RC. Actually speaking, you need to really do the OG content and feel each CR Qsn thoroughly. For RC, you'll have to improve your english skills if you are a non-native. This means that you'll need to read NYT/The Economist/ The Hindu or play with fiction novels. You do realize that these great authors and highly paid writers have strong vocab skills embedded with years of practice and perfection....I am Marathi. I sucked at verbal with 30-34 initially. And I have read 570+ novels and 10,000s of articles. So, daily I journalize my stuff. Keep this habit and you'll understand how I could crack GMAT in 72 days. It is not by magic. You need to hone your logical reasoning skills. For RC- Don't be bleakly emotional with the cognitive content. If you keep on doing the same RC passages or skim it twice or thrice then you are certainly weak on RC. Familiarity breeds contempt!! But stay focussed for at least 100 days and you can crack your Verbal with a perfect 43/44/45 (-: You know, you don't need a TOEFL score if you have a strong Verbal score on GMAT (-: But give it anyway coz you need to convince your Visa interviewer to make him/her happy. For those who are struggling with Verbal and want to catapult your score, invest in e-GMAT subscription for $199. I never tried it but my friends told me it is cool for a non native. Would suggest T.I.M.E for CAT for sure ....no doubt about that! Full-time faculty members @T.I.M.E are really naive to not to give GMAT and  guess what, GMAT Math is 3 times easier than what I experienced from CAT but GMAT Verbal is 3 times difficult.......nobody might have told you that right (-: Also, nobody might have whispered this to you: GMAT calculates past 3 years percentile scores i.e. close to 22 Lakh scores. CAT just calculates current year percentile scores i.e. close to 2 Lakh scores.http://www.mba.com/india/the-gma... (For example, Yale SOM last year's admission was for 710-720. Now, because so many took the GMAT and many scored beyond 720, the median cut-off for Yale is now 720+ as of 2015 which was 710+ as of 2014!!!) More than 1.29 million people took the GMAT exam in the past 5 years and more than 3.72 million score reports were sent. So, %ile scores are really hard to earn these days. A GMAT score of 750 used to be 99th %ile score in 2005, Now, 750 is considered as 98th %ile score in 2015. That's okay!! You don't need a 750 score. You just need to get beyond 720....Q50,V40 will easily fetch you a Top10 B-school call :) So, if you are intelligent enough to decide for yourself, you might say both exams are super tough. GMAT focusses mainly on Verbal and CAT focusses mainly on Math. For those who really don't understand: AWA (nothing but an argument's analysis = 30 mins) + IR(hard mix of 12 Qsns i.e. 33-39 sub-Qsns from Quant+Verbal = 30 mins) + Quant (37 Qsns = 75 mins) + Verbal(41 Qsns = 75 mins) = GMAT :) AWA can be done in 1 session :) Easiest section on GMATHow to get 6.0 AWA....my guide... byheart the template a million times. IR needs crazy reasoning skills. Quant is easy. Verbal can chew up your score into pieces...!!! The exam is for 3.5 hrs. So, visualize your cockpit (-: Keep 10 days reserved for taking mocks prior to your GMAT exam (-: If you are a novice beginner, I'd say 100 days to GMAT or 200 days to CAT. If you are an intermediate, I'd say 75 days to GMAT or 150 days to CAT. If you are an expert, I'd say 60 days to GMAT or 120 days to CAT. In conclusion, if you can crack GMAT with 760, with an extra effort on the Math, you can easily crack CAT with 99.99%ile. My Total Cost for GMAT : approx. Rs.36000 /-  (buy books from amazon.in itself, it is actually cheaper than flipkart ;)) 1. GMAC's Official Guide with 900 Qsns for Rs. 1100 2. GMAC's Quant Review and Verbal Review books with 600 Qsns for Rs.1500 3. GMAC's Study collection for Rs.4600 (QsnPack1 with 500 Qsns and ExamPack1 with 4 genuine mocks = $72) from mba.com....You have to practice this on laptop/PC. 4. gmat.magoosh.com with 900+ Qsns takes Rs. 6300 ($99 premium purchase) and includes 1 mock test. 5. Manhattan MGMAT books for Rs. 3200 (only SC/CR/RC) with online access to 6 hard mocks. Also, buy Foundations of MGMAT Verbal and Advanced GMAT Quant = Rs.2000. 6. GMAT exam fee is  $250 i.e. Rs.16,300. Plus, I borrowed the Powerscore CR Bible, Powerscore RC and Official LSAT Superprep from my mentor. So, I saved ~6000 bucks (-: Note : Schedule your exam date 2 months prior to your GMAT. Well yes, if you happen to stumble upon GRE, you can download ETS.org's free Powerprep s/w and you can check which exam is better by simulating both the GMATPrep s/w and PowerPrep test s/w......each has 2 mocks for free (-: Tip -> Judge both the exams after studying at least for 1 month prior to taking any simulation test. Both exams are accepted by MBA programs as well. Mostly for Masters/PhD, you take the GRE exam. Mostly for B-schools for MBA (or a relevant PhD), you take the GMAT exam. What is the GMAT equivalent GRE score? Check this:http://www.ets.org/s/gre/flash/b... GMAT Total score = -2080.75 + 6.38*GRE Verbal Reasoning score + 10.62*GRE Quantitative Reasoning score The regression equations: GMAT Verbal score = -109.49 + 0.912*GRE Verbal Reasoning score GMAT Quantitative score = -158.42 + 1.243*GRE Quantitative Reasoning score So, V164 minimum on GRE = V40 on GMAT and Q168 minimum on GRE = Q50 on GMAT. So, a GRE score of 333 = GMAT score of 750+. .'. GRE score of 327 = GMAT score of 700. Note: If you want to send your score for Top10 B-schools, try to get 330+ on GRE. Top B-schools won't tolerate your score after your 3 scored attempts on GMAT and if you've failed to get a good score on GMAT even after 3 scored attempts, I'd say switch to GRE if you are really in a hurry bcoz application deadlines are near and you've exhausted your 3 scored attempts on GMAT already (coz you know each scored attempt can be tracked by Top B-schools). ETS and GMAC are two separate entities now (-: The world is full of possibilities (-: Tips : Try ginger soup coz it raises your heartbeat (-: 2 months leave  from  Work/Job (very important step to stay in focus for modus operandi) Now, try to take 10 days out and just auto-play all 300+ video lessons from Magoosh. Quant has some 180 video lessons and Verbal has some 125 video lessons. During these 10 days, don't practice any questions. Just enjoy the content. I completed the entire video lessons in 6 days and I re-played it again and again till I felt confident. Now solve 512 Quant questions and 425 Verbal questions separately. My entire time on Magoosh's website was 31 hrs. Why 31 hrs? bcoz I solved it thrice. All 900+ Qsns and diagnostic test as well. I just loved the Dashboard concept and Customize your practice filters. Solve OG 10th edition 1st and then solve the OG latest edition. People are really naive and don't know how to navigate a forum. Go to gmatclub.com and check the history of the Downloads section for DS PS or SC CR CR Tips&Tricks: http://gmatclub.com/forum/downlo... This website catalog contains everything.

So, now you can add these to the chart as well: Free Tests link:http://gmatclub.com/forum/18-onl... Go to gmatclub.com and access all 33 mocks (1700+ Qsns) for $80 (-: or earn 25 kudos with your posts for a totally free access for mocks. Maintain your Error Log !!.....On a separate Excel sheet and print it. Take snapshots and play the slideshow of difficult flashcards and Qsns before you go to bed. Play "Thursdays with Ron" 55 Verbal videos with 1.5 X speed coz he's dam slow (-: You'll definitely need 100s of post-its/Bookmarkers A big Calendar for scheduling each day. Get a big 5' x 5' huge whiteboard with different color markers Have a printer to make a hard print of cool resources/flashcards/etc. Get a Stopwatch for studying. Put 1min 49 secs for all SC/CR/DS/PS Questions and 2-3 mins for the RC passages (90 secs for SC .....to save time for CR and RC during the real exam and 2-3 mins per IR Qsn). Observe the moderators here. Bunuel's posts on gmatclub.com for his "signature collections" especially for Quant practice serves best. You'll get another surprise attack of 1000+ Quant Qsns here :-) Do not throw any topic for option!! (as we used to do in our college days..!!!!) Have a self disciplined approach and do not corrupt your mind by watching tons of movies or TV series. Remember that GMAT is a matter of 100 days of study....thats it!! Hydrate your body well. Sleep for at least 8-9 hrs daily for the next 2 months followed by a short nap. REM sleep can do wonders (-: Finally, motivate yourself by comparing B-schools on mba .com's awesome School Finder Tool. Jot down the application deadlines of your dream B-schools and be prepared with LORs, SOPs and Essays for each B-school. Normally people apply in Round 1 and Round 2. For Round 1, be ready by end of August because at least 30%-40% seats are reserved for the 1st pool of applications. For Round 2, be ready with your score by end of December because your GMAT median score might not be upto mark and you really needed some more time. So, for getting an admission abroad, do your research 18 months well in advance :) Never ever apply in Round 3 because seats are already filled up. Hardly 5%-10% seats will be available and tons of people will fight for the same. So, better clock for Round 1 after few months :) I was shitting my pants after I scored 390 570 680 720 on the simulation mocks from GMATPrep s/w !!!...All you need to do is to be technically sound with the GMAT format....The way GMAT tests you and the way you need to test the GMAT (-: OG 10th Edition contains 441 Quant PS Qsns(136 are new), 274 DS Qsns (124 are new) and Verbal (SC-268 + CR-205 + RC-50+ Passages) 700+ Qsns. Get your Manhattan's MGMAT 10 study guides (or only verbal). I've never touched Nova or Kaplan or Barrons or etc. shit!! Every person will tell you a very different story on their roadmap to ace GMAT.....that is what you have to judge for yourself!! Some people will kiss Veritas prep, some will go for Economist Tutor (₹.30k), some will go to youtube to crash their minds and some minds will crash and stick to Youtube playlists.....my sincere suggestion to you is: research more or stick to what I've said :) A bit more advice: Don't join T.I.M.E. or Byju's or Jamboree or Manhattan/Veritas classroom tutoring. These people will tell you what you already know. You just need cool resources and materials and proper time management which I've already discussed with you. Streamline your goals. So, you know for sure that with OG 10th edn, you can easily add 1000 Qsns to the Chart + 3000 Qsns from Mocks (1687 Qsns pool from GMATPrep s/w) + 1000s of extra Qsns from Manhattan + 3000 Qsns from my chart!!So, in all, you'll have to solve nearly 7500+ Qsns to get 750+ on GMAT and do not forget to solve it 2-3 times!! I should write a book on this thingy coz I've cracked it with a 750 score on the GMAT with 72 days of preparation. That is okay as compared to CAT with 140 days of preparation (again depends on your pace and patience). Just 10 weeks of hard work (unlike 20 weeks for CAT)!! I never tried Veritas prep's 6 mocks for $49 or gmatclub .com's 31 tests for $80. You don't need all of that to saturate your head. Even if you buy only 1 Manhattan MGMAT book (say SC) for Rs.1000, you can get an online access to all 6 hard mocks that will be valid for 1 year. Well some last tips: 1. AWA score >= 5 and IR score >= 5 .....for Top10 B-schools. 2. According to GMAC's new policy, you can cancel your GMAT score report if you think you have performed very badly during the test and you won't have to face the same Qsn on the day of your interview with the top B-school. This also means that if you are determined to crack GMAT in 1 year, you can give this exam and cancel the score 4 times and the B-schools won't notice anything. Well, trust me. You don't need that kind of attempts. At least, you can play the game for the 5th time ;) 3. Also, since you know that GMAT is an adaptive test, you must be super alert and focussed to solve the 1st 10 Qsns on GMAT Quant section and the 1st 10 Qsns on GMAT Verbal section correctly during the test. If your initial Qsns are correct and you get 4-5 Qsns wrong at the end of Quant section and 4-5 Qsns wrong at the end of Verbal section, it really doesn't matter. You'll still score 700+ on GMAT. 4. Carry a 100gms glucose biscuit and 1 fruit and 1 litre juice/water with you at the time of your GMAT exam and do not forget to wear a sweater because you'll be giving the exam @24° C for nearly 226 mins (You'll be given 8 mins break after 1 hour of AWA+IR and 8 mins break after Quant section). At the end of your exam, the GMAC portal will ask you whether you want to keep your score.... So, make this as a #1 thumb rule: Cancel your score report blindly if you don't get a 700+ score on the day of your GMAT exam!! Trust me, this will not only make your heart feel stronger but it will also make you feel more powerful the next time you hit the exam center. Some things I have not told you yet: 5000 secs for everyday practice also means that you should give 10000 more secs to review the same (-: I did my entire practice on iPad coz it's sleek. Except for the Study Collection i.e. QsnPack 1 + ExamPack 1 which I did on my laptop. I personally made it sure that I completed at least 70 Qsns as per day's target. My max was 120. So, if you cannot keep up with your pace, you cannot rest on Sundays that is for sure. And I also confess the fact I sequestered myself in my room for 2 long months :-* It chafed me to be confined like this....but ultimately it paid off at the end!! Download "GoodReader" app. Now, download previous OG 12th Edition or 13th Edition in PDF format. Now, create an annotated copy and use Highlighter so that you can track your page by page progress and bookmark that page daily. Say, your MGMAT CAT's 6 mocks avg. score = 670 or 680. Well, actually you'll easily get 720-730 score on the real GMAT exam. If you score 710 on the GMATPrep s/w, your actual score on the GMAT will be +10 or -10 i.e. 700 or 720. This software is really precise. In total you'll have 20 mocks: 4 GMATPrep s/w + 6 MGMAT CATs + 10 Free mocks that I mentioned earlier. So, just focus on your Qs and Vs. e.g. IIMs want 49/50/51 on Quant and 43/44/45 on Verbal. For IIMs, you can keep your GMAT score for 2 years (in case you are busy with your international client or you decide to start working on your Startup idea before joining an IIM). And do not hesitate to give your GMAT for a 2nd or 3rd attempt. You know, some B-schools will easily give you a 100% scholarship. Read this:http://blogs.economictimes.india... ....This girl from India got $80000 scholarship and was cordially invited by Cox B-school in the USA. So, just imagine her total MBA financial outlay for subsistence would be very nominal for 2 years including Living/Rent/Utilities/Health insurance/etc....and this is the reason mostly Indian students opt for GMAT for abroad generous scholarships from B-schools. For Canada, Top 5 B-schools have GMAT score requirement of 650-700 only. So, if you score low on GMAT, don't destroy your hopes :) You can still immigrate to Canada in 3 short years :) Or If your budget is really low i.e. ~$50k, I'd suggest go for MS in MIS only if you are a curious CS grad interested for a career in management in IT in USA or abroad elsewhere (you can work as a Software developer or in Operations or Analyst or etc. with a degree in MIS). MIS mainly requires a GMAT score and it becomes affordable to choose a cool university for the same coz you also know that most MIS programs are STEM related and will give you 2.5 years on OPT (unlike 12 months OPT for MBA). Here, you can save upto ₹.5 Lakhs on internship and literally complete your higher education under ₹.20 Lakhs abroad if you get a TA/RA i.e. Teaching Assistantship/Research Assistantship (So, shed a good conduct on your Professor and publish a research paper on your topic of specialization before you write your essays for admission). Or Go for a affordable Masters program in the USA (that requires a GMAT score) and after OPT if you find yourself lucky to win a H-1B cap/lottery, you can ask your Employer to fund your Part-time i.e. Weekend MBA program while you are still working on H-1B visa :) Your GMAT score will be still valid and you must use the score for a 2nd time for your MBA. So, tracing your timeline is really essential for this to happen. Alternate way: On OPT you can easily save upto $50k. So, all you need is another $50k. This $50k can be waived with scholarship via high GMAT score. A part-time MBA will take 3 years for completion. It is the same MBA degree (like a traditional/Full-time degree) but this time you won't have to worry about any loan/co-applicant or your Dad's help (-: and the best part is that you'll earn & learn at the same time. Or If you are a stereotypical engineer or someone who is currently in the pre-final year of your graduation and you have zero Work Ex but if you have a stellar profile, go for Deferred admission: HBS 2+2/ Yale Silver Scholars program/ Stanford GSB deferred enrollment/ Chicago Booth Scholars program/ ISB Young Leaders Program/ IESE Young Talents program/etc. A high GMAT score would certainly increase your chances. What is this program about? It is the same MBA degree but you get to enroll in the 1st year directly after your undergraduate degree. For the next 2 years you'll have to work and in this way, you not only get B-school approved skillset but you also get a guarantee to comeback quickly after 2 years of Work Ex to complete your MBA (In short, if you ask me, you save your 2-3 years of your life since your competition will be with guys with minimum 4-5 years of work ex and you'll stand out to be the best candidate engaged with proper skills when you enter the 2nd year of the MBA program after 3 years). Or If you've only completed your Bachelors degree, you can directly get into a fully funded PhD program (without the need for a Masters degree) from a reputed University anywhere in the world. A high score on GMAT would be required. So, here's another reason why you would like to spend 5+ years on a research to get an experience with a cool stipend. Why PhD? Coz you can self-petition for your EB2 visa (with tons of research papers) and you can also ask 3-4 employers to petition your H-1B visa in the USA. So, people who really know this directly apply for a doctoral program without giving it a 2nd thought (research more to get a mentor for your R&D in your specialization). For those looking for a Top B-school abroad and need a funding without a collateral/co-signer, just take a loan from Prodigy Finance: http://prodigyfinance.com to pay your entire MBA fees with a cool EMI over a period of 10 years. Hats off to this community initiated by INSEAD+LBS guys :) See, just motivate yourself with such articles and try to get 100% scholarship. Remember, 111-117 Qsns is what will decide your fate on GMAT :) The more you rely on unofficial content, the more you will become vulnerable to a bad score. Magoosh is just for brushing up your skills via tons of tutorials and practice Qsns. And finally, just trust Manhattan blindly bcoz I say so :) And because of the new GMAC's policy, what used to be 89th %ile score i.e. 700 on GMAT...would be 85th %ile in no time. So, quickly register to give the GMAT and keep a 100 days target :) and don't waste your precious time to join any stupid coaching classes....they will mess up your head even more!!! and let's say if at all you need Tuition coaching = 30k gone and let's say you are poor in verbal....e-gmat = 13k gone For practice.....Magoosh = 6.5k gone For learning....Manhattan MGMAT Study Guides = 10.5k gone For official content.....Official Guides + Study Collection = 7k gone For mocks....let's say you picked gmatclub.com's 33 mock Tests = 5k gone and let's assume you gave the GMAT exam thrice = 50k gone .'. Total = 125k gone. See, it becomes very expensive. Don't bother. Just keep an eye on your golden ticket to B-school via 100% scholarship, which can be upto $80k or about ₹.50 Lakhs. That's massive and generous!! Think of it (₹.125k) as an investment in your future. Think of it as the last resort to spearhead your career. What you need is a high level fidelity to Math and English. So, be a lone wolf and try to be as fresh as a duke while studying ;-) Below is a GMAC research data report of past 10 years: Google: "World Geographic Trend Report for GMAT Examinees" I've saved your efforts....check this: 3.72 million Score reports ÷ 1.29 million students = avg 2.8 times!! .'. Each examinee attempts for a 2nd or 3rd time after taking the GMAT exam to earn a very high score to secure an admit to his/her dream B-school....as per new GMAC's policy, you can take the GMAT 5 times in 1 year. Can you do that for CAT in 1 year??? Do you have the flexibility such as Round 1 or Round 2 application deadlines for top B-schools in India via CAT?? Do you really want to get a -ve score after you hit a wrong option(CAT)?? Can you build your accuracy for the non-MCQs with at least 75 marks(25 Qsns) on CAT with exactly 150 secs per Qsn in your hand?? Can you beg for a cool scholarship (>=50%) with your CAT score? Plus, can you keep CAT score for at least 2-3 years?? You have to actually wait for 1 whole year to take the CAT exam!! Then you start thinking 1st 6 months rest & then next 6 months CAT prep. Lol.....So, people who are lucky to read this post, dedicate 1st 6 months to crack GMAT. Next 6 months to CAT :) Remember, >95th %ile score (>720) for GMAT and >99th %ile score (>200) for CAT :) Here's a GMAT score chart. If you are aspiring for top B-schools, I'd say paste this chart above your head where you sleep and just dream about this triangle for the next 100 days (-: Your eyes should target V40 and Q50 (at the minimum). ​ GMAT wiki search result: The GMAT does not measure business knowledge or skill, nor does it measure intelligence. According to the test owning company, the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), the GMAT assesses analytical writing and problem-solving abilities, while also addressing data sufficiency, logic, and critical reasoning skills that it believes to be vital to real-world business and management success. Coming to CAT: Didn't look at NCERT Std 6th to Std 12th books. Didn't do Arun Sharma a favor. Had no time at all for T.I.M.E. coaching (coz I was working) nor I wanted to get crammed with 40 people in a room which is supposed to be a room for a batch of 30 people. Have a really great shortcut to crack CAT.... Career Launcher has Test series. Enroll with CAT TS+TG (Test Series + Test Gym) product:http://www.clexams.com/ You have to shell off ₹.4000 for the same. Now, you must get hooked to CLexams.com portal for at least 100 days. It had cost me an entire day to figure out how the fuck should I approach to crack 8500 Qsns. So, made a really cool chart yet again: ​Tests pe Tests.... Turns out Test Gym has 741 Tests in total. Test Gym Lite has: 276 Tests for Quant. 100 Tests for DI/LR. 365 Tests for Verbal. 31 full-length mocks and 45 sectional tests + 24 more from Test Gym Classic. Keep last 15 days for mocks. Again, go step by step. Complete 10-12 tests per day. Bookmark those hard ones. For pocket prep....download the MBA Exams Guide app from the Playstore. 1 Test = 7 Qsns. .'. 10-12 Tests = 70-84 Qsns per day's target. So, don't be gobsmacked coz it takes ~15 mins to solve a single Test. Again, don't forget to reset everything and solve it twice and thrice. Do the above and you'll get 99.99 %ile for sure. I made this decision coz I already gave the GMAT and I was strong with my Verbal and Math skills and most importantly, I was mentally set for solving those 8500 Qsns. And don't worry about getting a 99 %ile in your CL mocks. CL mocks are much tougher than the actual CAT exam. All Qsns are neatly refined to ace your CAT exam. So, even if you get 85-90 %ile in the CL mocks that would easily culminate into a 99th %ile score on the day of your CAT exam :-) So, be happy that you can actually ace the CAT in just 4000 bucks. Okay, I exaggerated a bit. You need ₹.2000 to buy Arun Sharma books. And download NCERT books too :) Do remember this: CAT will hit you with minimum 25 non-MCQs. Also, the concept of LR on CAT is pretty hard and you won't get enough time to solve 12 Qsns on LR. So practice real hard. (So, if you could get 15 Qsns correct in each section i.e. VA, DI/LR & QA you'd end up with a 90th %ile score on CAT. But if you can score 22-23 Qsns correctly in each section, you'd get a 99th %ile score....that's my analysis). Warning: Don't skip NCERT and Arun Sharma books if you have not given the GMAT exam 1st and you just wanna give the CAT exam 1st coz you'll have to dedicate 1st 30 days refreshing your skills for CAT Math itself. This is something not to be trifled with leniently. So, slap yourself and re-read my entire post again. Your head will be completely packed with 15000+ Qsns after GMAT and CAT. So, don't play all the cards at once (-: Remember, you still have a full marathon race before you :) From a monetary point of view, if you observe, only 12%-15% people giving CAT can afford to take the GMAT (or there are tons of other reasons for taking CAT.....job/support family/business....for execs/career in India/limited H-1B visas in USA/short OPT period of only 1 year for MBA guys in USA/cannot afford to sacrifice 6-7 years to repay $400k debt to Prodigy Finance if you have a H-1B visa/cannot afford to sacrifice 11-12 long years to repay $400k debt to Prodigy Finance in Indian currency/etc.). Advice on B-school debt by Warren Buffett: GMAT or CAT is not about a formidable challenge. It is about the ability to endure hardship against your sedentary ass!! And before you enter this mad quest just be sure to get at least 20+ genuine verified certifications (e.g. Business Informatics/Venture Finance/Statistics/Entrepreneurship/Innovation/Analytics/Accounting/Leadership/Digital Planning/Marketing/Finance/Strategy/Management/Economics/Operations/Critical Thinking/Creative Writing/Public Speaking/etc.) from Coursera :) to be well ahead of the competition to not to show empathy after a "failed Startup" situation in your essays. Trust me, it works even with Harvard ;-) And why I've emphasized on Top10 B-schools? It's an axiom of marketing: Reputation matters!!! And why did I give both the exams? It will take me 3000 more words to write exclusively and prove it to you "Why not both the exams??". So, anticipate your death after 25,000 days and just take out 250 days to crack GMAT and CAT.
