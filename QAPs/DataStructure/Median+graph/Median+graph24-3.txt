Is 2015 a good time to buy a house in the Bay Area?
Jeez - who knows? Bay Area real estate generally tracks the tech stock market. So if you think tech companies are overvalued/undervalued -- there you go. Someone I used to work for once told me that the trick to Bay Area real estate is just to buy and then be prepared to hold -- eventually you won't be wrong. But if you wait, you run real risk of the market running away from you.
