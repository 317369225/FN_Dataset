Is Oakland following the trend of other Bay Area cities in becoming more gentrified over the past few years?
Gentrification is definitely happening.  I opened a store in Temescal last year that would not have made it 5 years ago, and is running profitably.  There's a lot of new retail spots opening, and many new restaurants coming in. Within the "safe" regions of Oakland, prices are going up continually.  I'm seeing 2-bedrooms in Temescal, Piedmont Ave, Rockridge areas that are on par with SF a few years ago.  East Oakland is still a warzone, and there are some hot areas mixed in with the gentrifying areas right now.
