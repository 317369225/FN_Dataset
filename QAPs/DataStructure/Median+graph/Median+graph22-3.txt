With declining middle class for last 40 years how many more years can the usa remain a superpower?
There is no class structure in the U.S.   Everyone is “middle class”, neither nobility nor land-bound peasants.  We do have income levels with arbitrarily defined and constantly changing boundaries between lower, middle, and upper segments.  With the inflation (roughly 800% over the last 40 years) and the general increase in prosperity (real GDP per capita) the boundaries have constantly moved.  Is the shrinking middle do to the way the boundaries have been designated?  Which has grown  more, the upper or lower segments? Until a couple of years ago the U.S. was the world’s largest manufacturer in terms of added value which means in terms of manufacturing payroll and profitability.  Only recently has China passed us. So, can the nation with the world’s largest economy and the second largest manufacturing sector remain a superpower?  Why not?  Does it really matter?
