What is the best way to learn maths for a std. 8 student who literally hates mathematics and is very weak in the subject?
Standard 8 mathematics is a crucial year as far as introduction to high level math goes. From numbers - natural,whole,real,rational,imaginary etc - quadratic equations,polynomial, in algebra Statistics- mean median mode graphs bars Geometry- lines angles circle ellipse equations proofs etc It is quintessential that the basics of math from 5th to 7th are well oiled because then the course is fairly easy and relaxed for one only has to build upon what he/she has studied so far. Besides mathematics is an inevitable part of everyone's life hence the urge to flex the muscles and try it out as much as possible is needed. Practice is the only key to mastering this math issue and with conviction and analytical thinking this will definitely be a smooth ride.
