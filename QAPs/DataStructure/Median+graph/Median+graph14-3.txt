Are doctors overcompensated in the U.S.?
It's a tough system to determine- it always seems easy to salary doctors or PFP (pay-for-performance) but those have issues too.  Obviously, salary takes away initiative to do extra rounding, see extra patients, do extra cases (or borderline cases for that matter).  PFP is a really imperfect system and doesn't account for differences in patient populations or location or practice-type. Obviously there are some grossly wrong reimbursement patterns, but people attacking physicians for being the reason for costly medical care when they make up <10% of costs is misplaced.  Maneesh says the important points: huge # of years of training, malpractice premiums, and the fact that our specialty is in health and helping prolong quantity and quality of life (hopefully), which one would think is pretty unique and worth reimbursing.  Nobody attacks RN's for making 60-100k, NP's for making 80-120k + or CRNA's for making 120-200k (more than primary care physicians).
