CAT or GMAT which one is tougher?
Hi Jaya Ganesh Bharadwaj, You choose an exam based on how it is going to help you get into your dream schools. Not based on how tough it is :-) Do you want to do an MBA in India? Then take up all the multiple exams, CAT, XAT, JMET, NMAT etc to get into the Top schools like the IIMs, XLRI, SP Jain, FMS, MDI, etc.. At the same time, GMAT also opens your doors to top schools like ISB, SP Jain, GLIM, and a lot more in India, and if you have 5+ years of experience, then the IIMs and XLRI as well. So if you want to join the IIMs (PGP 2 year program) or other top schools where GMAT won't help you, or if you do not have 2+ years of experience, go for the CAT. Else, go for the GMAT. Opens your doors to a lot more schools in India and abroad as well. Just that, you need 2+ years experience at least :-) BTW, we have a free session coming up on the 10th and 11th of Jan, 2015. You will get to interact with CAT and GMAT test takers and also get to know the similarities and how you can carry forward your CAT prep to GMAT. Feel free to register using the below links.
