Are startups overvalued right now?
I think so for venture backed companies at least. A lot of those billion dollar valuations are driven by ego. In the last few months, I've spoken to a CEO who said what she is seeing in these is a lot of down round protection which is going to be ugly to earlier investors. On my regular Sumday morning Silicon Valley bike ride where most people are not techies, at breakfast, the subject turned to the economy.  Everyone agreed the area was overheated and a slowdown looms. As this economy goes, so goes startup valuations. Nationally, we've been in an expansion since 09. All good things come to an end. My wife works in HR for a post public, small biotech company. In the last few weeks she's commented that recruiting is getting tougher. I've got a little more confidence in angels though because I think they have a lower margin for error than VCs.  Especially those who lived through the dot com crash and 07-09.
