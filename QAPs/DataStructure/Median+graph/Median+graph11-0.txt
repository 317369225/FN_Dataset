How effective is Leetcode for preparing for technical interviews?
It depends on what you mean by "technical interviews". Depending on the company, you may be evaluated on broad skills with different emphasis such as coding, system design and communication. Here, I will talk about the coding aspect specifically. LeetCode https://leetcode.com is one of the largest Online Judges with more than 47 million submissions to date (Dec 10, 2015). For coding interview preparation, LeetCode is one of the best online resource providing a rich library of more than 300 real coding interview questions for you to practice from using one of the 7 supported languages - C, C++, Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, Ruby. Using a strong hands-on approach by solving the questions yourself, we believe this is the most effective way to improve your algorithm and coding skills. The Online Judge gives you immediate feedback on the correctness and efficiency of your algorithm which facilitates a great learning experience. The above image shows the runtime distribution graph for accepted solutions, so you know that your algorithm is not optimal :) Furthermore, we have a very active Discuss community which is a terrific resource for you to learn.
