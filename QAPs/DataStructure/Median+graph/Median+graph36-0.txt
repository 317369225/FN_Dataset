Why have the wages of the American middle class stagnated for decades?
The money has moved around. Less is paid in wages; more goes in healthcare costs; more goes to the rich and less to the average. So although the country is much richer, the average person is poorer (or rather, the average person now is poorer than the average person was in 1974). It is like those school exercises that show the difference between median & mean. In 1974 suppose we had incomes of:  2,4,4,4,10. Total =24 Mean  = 4.8  Median = 4 In 2014 we had incomes of 1,1,3,6, 49 Total = 60 Mean = 12  Median = 3 The total has grown massively (nearly 3X), as has the mean But the median has dropped, and 3 out of 5 people are worse off In that example there are five "people" so we have quinitiles: in that example the top quintile did well. In real life it is a lot more skewed that that. To show the actual data: Beasically, Note this is household income: as the number of women earners has increased since 1979 (and the earnings have grown more) that accounts for the (still pathetic) growth. If you look at media individual wages it is even less, and median male wages show the most serious declines. That is even more so if you look at wealth instead o income: the rich get (much) ricger, the poor get poorer For what it is worth, that is very race dependent: white as 12X richer than blacksm and are doing better; blacks are far behind and falling further Source: What We Know About Inequality (in 14 Charts) Updated 56w ago • View Upvotes
