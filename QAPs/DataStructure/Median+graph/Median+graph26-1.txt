What are good ways to solve mass unemployment?
My answer is a synthesis of a couple fundamental concepts. - Comparative Advantage - Network Marketing - "The Non-Job Revolution" as described by Elliott Hulse on YouTube I think a good solution to mass unemployment combines 2 ideas. 1) "Do what you love and find a way to get paid for it." Advice from my dad, certainly easier said than done. 2) Comparative Advantage: If 2 parties (or more) do what they do best and trade their goods/services, both will prosper. Combining these 2 practices, we would see people focusing their efforts on their passions and sharing wonderful, personal gifts with as many people as possible and being considerably compensated for their efforts and time. Are some people better at a particular thing than others? Sure. Fortunately, each person is unique and has at least one unique gift to share and (more than likely) a unique need or want in their life. There's something for everyone. Example. I'm a martial artist who appreciates music and wants to learn the guitar. I have a friend in an amateur rock band but was typically bullied at school. Could I teach myself the guitar? Yes, but I'd more or less be flying blind, trying all sort of lessons, techniques, and tutorials. Could he take a martial arts class? Yes, but it would be time consuming trial and error to find a class that was a good fit for his talents, preferences, and goals. Instead, I exchange private lessons, tailored to his abilities and goals and he coaches me on learning the guitar, good beginner exercises, and techniques useful for learning any song easily. We both prospered by sharing our talents and passions with each other. There are so many opportunities to make a (great) living doing what we love, except there is no set path or tutorial to follow for doing so. Luckily there are ones who have done it and are doing it that are eager to help us all start.
