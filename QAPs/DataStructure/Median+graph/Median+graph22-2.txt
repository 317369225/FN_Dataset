With declining middle class for last 40 years how many more years can the usa remain a superpower?
At least as long as the dollar remains the sole reserve currency. But actually you are seeking a correlation between two orthogonal qualities. The USSR did not have any middle class in the seventies, and they still were a superpower. Neither did the UK, with their global empire and an aristocracy based hierarchical society at home. Firepower or diplomatic power does not immediately imply an entrepreneurial and free economy. Powerful nation does not mean prosperous nation, and vice versa. If there is a total-war, absent third party intervention, India can kick the asses of Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark etc. (Possibly you can figure that I am not saying this as a proud nationalist, but just to emphasise my point.)
