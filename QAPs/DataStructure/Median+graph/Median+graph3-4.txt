What are some graphs that clearly show changes in the US economy?
A positive sign?  Households are paying down their debt.  The rate at which households are saving has doubled from 2008 to now.  This is a positive sign for consumer demand to pick up.  There's more disposable income available for consumption, if households start to feel more secure at lower debt and higher savings levels. There have beeen many conversations concerning corporate taxes.  This chart shows corporate profit before and after tax.  I don't think it supports an assertion made that corporations are paying an average of a 26% federal tax rate. This one's interesting - GDP and Final Sales to Domestic Purchasers both took a dip in 2008-2009, but then picked up their growth at a rate close to the pre-crisis rate, from that smaller base.  Nonetheless, credit market liabilities have decreased.  This implies that the ongoing consumer spending is being supported by credit less and less.  Our net exports are negative by a small amount. Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, FREDGRAPH There is a trove of data there, and plotting them against each other is pretty simple.  One can explore possible correlations and ponder what they might signify.  An interesting exercise is to look at a graphic relationship and speculate about the mechanisms and dynamics driving the numbers.  You can't really prove anything from them, but you can try to read them like tea leaves - that's how I think economists work... EDIT:  This one I've included elsewhere; it highlights the move from a manufacturing to a service economy. Updated 100w ago • View Upvotes
