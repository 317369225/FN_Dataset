With declining middle class for last 40 years how many more years can the usa remain a superpower?
It's called statistics then there are damn statistics. First graph confirms the fear, middle class is dwindling FAST! But wait, why is y axis is so out of whack? There are 7% decline in the last 50 years but in the graph it is much more dramatic. How about median income? 2nd graph is showing that it is stagnating since the 70s, even decreasing since the 00's. But don't forget 50-70 were the most prosperous times, so rather since the new millennium it is disturbing. The last graph shows the whole picture. Top 25% are getting increasing bigger pile of wealth, it is true. But the other 75% remains flat, more interestingly the rich's wealth is more inline with medium income change than the 75%! Apparently prosperity or "the loss of middle class" only correlates to the 25%. So it looks like if you are the top 25%, you need to watch out, you may see your wealth increasing but you will drop into the next 20%. Super power is more to do with military power. US will remain one for a very long time. Russia has been irrelevant economically for 30+ years, yet few dismiss it as a super power. In fact if US median income keep the rising pattern and top 25% get even bigger share of income, it is likely to become a stronger super power, international politics is of real concern to top 25%, if you are just a worker bee you couldn't care much about price of oil going up or down 30% (it does hit the pocket but not in comparison to one who owns 10,000 Exxon shares.
