What are some unsolved problems in math which seem easy at first glance?
Tur치n's Brick Factory Problem Although Tur치n was in a Nazi labor camp between 1940 and 1945, he was still crafty enough to turn an everyday task into a (still unsolved) math problem [0]. At the camp, Tur치n and others were tasked with moving bricks from the factory to silos nearby. The bricks were transported on little dollies that rode on train tracks. Unfortunately, the dollies were likely to overturn at every intersection of two tracks. Tur치n wondered the following (colloquial statement of the problem): If we could redesign the train tracks, how could we place them to minimize the number of crossings of the tracks? This can be reformulated as a graph embedding problem: Given a graph [math]G=(V,E)[/math], with [math]|V|=n[/math], construct a planar embedding of [math]G[/math] with a minimal number of crossings. In the case of the brick yard situation, we have [math]n[/math] factories and [math]m[/math] silos, so we really want to find an embedding of [math]K_{n,m}[/math] (complete bipartite on [math]n,m[/math] nodes) that a has minimal number of crossings. Zarankiewicz has conjectured the following upper bound: [math] \mathsf{Crossings}(K_{n,m}) \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \lfloor \frac{n-1}{2} \rfloor \lfloor \frac{m}{2} \rfloor \lfloor \frac{m-1}{2} \rfloor[/math]. The exact conjecture is that this is really an equality. This still has yet to be proven [1]. [0] Page on st-and.ac.ukl [1] Crossing number (graph theory)
