What is the rate of raising next series financing for startups?
The chart below from PitchBook shows the median valuations of different rounds of investment  from their report on valuations and trends from the first half of 2015 (Chelsey Nelson of PitchBook knows all).    The full report is available on their website. The median size of the rounds reported by Pitchbook were as follows for 2014:  Seed ($1.1 million), A ($5 million), B ($11 million), C ($15 million), D+ (~$27 million) It is important to note that these are median valuations by round and you shouldn't assume that your company will be a "median valuation company".   Valuations are dependent on traction at time of investment, the quality of the management team (including prior success), geography and sector. But this will give you a ballpark idea of valuations at different stages.  Note the clear indication of the "bubble" in valuations that is a current hot topic of discussion.  The valuations at each stage of investment are up significantly versus historic norms. Thanks for the A2A.
