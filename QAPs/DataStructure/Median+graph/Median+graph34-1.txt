What are the standard puzzles asked in programming interviews?
I have given quite a lot of interviews during last year, mostly for the software engineering intern position. I'll try to break down questions asked in two basic sections, algorithmic problems and puzzles. However, most programming interviews rarely consist of puzzles. Almost all the interviews I have given were for "Tier-1" companies and I was not asked a puzzle in any single one of them. Most interviewers will ask you algorithmic problems and sometimes few design problems. Puzzles You play a game where you are allowed 3 dice rolls. If at any step you decided to end the game, you get the number of coins equal to the value on the last dice roll. What is the maximum expected number of coins you can get? Dropping an egg from a floor number greater then [math]N[/math] of a 100 floor building will break it. You have to find [math]N[/math], while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case., if you have 2 eggs with you. How many points are there on the globe where by walking one mile south, one mile east and one mile north you reach the place where you started? Given a set of digits, find sum of all [math]N[/math] digit numbers whose each digit belong to given set of digits. Algorithmic Problems Find if a number is present in a sorted array that has been circularly rotated. Given a sequence, find if its pre-order traversal of a valid Binary Search Tree. Given a [math]N*M[/math] matrix of numbers from [math]1[/math] to [math]N*M[/math](each number occurs only once), find lexico-graphically smallest path from top left to right bottom while moving right or down only. Given a float [math]N[/math], find [math]\sqrt{N}[/math]. Given set of denominations, find the minimum number of coins required to form a sum. A coin of any denomination can be used multiple types. Given set of denominations, find the minimum number of distinct denominations required to form a sum. A coin of any denomination can be used multiple types. Given [math]N[/math] balloons, if you burst [math]i^{th}[/math] balloon you get [math]A_{i-1}*A_i*A_{i+1}[/math] coins and then [math]i^{th}[/math] and [math](i+1)^{th}[/math] balloons become adjacent. Find maximum number of coins you can gather. Given a string [math]S[/math] and a set of characters, find smallest window in [math]S[/math] that contains given set of characters. Given an unsorted array where each element is at distance at most [math]K[/math] from its correct position(i.e. position in sorted array), sort the array. Given a binary tree, check if its a Binary Search Tree. Find number of black connected components in a black and white matrix. Another version is if matrix is 3 dimensional. Sort an array stored on a tape, where there exists at pointer that points to an element at an index and operations allowed on the pointer are read, write, advance, goto beginning. You have 5 empty tapes each of size 100 which you can use. Given [math]N[/math] sorted arrays, find the [math]K^{th}[/math] smallest element if all arrays are merged. You have 4 strings, you can rearrange them in any way you want. You have to maximize the longest common prefix of all 4 strings after the rearrangement. There are [math]N[/math] points in 2-D plane. Each point has a color R, B, G. Find a triangle of largest area with these points such that one of the sides of triangle is parallel to either axis and each vertex has a different color point. Find triplets in a given array which sum to zero. A string like a2b3c5 un-compresses to aabbbccccc. Compress a given string. Clone a linked list. Clone a graph given in adjacency list form. Reverse a linked list. Given a python program determine the line at which a compilation error due to indentation occurs. Given a dictionary and various queries of strings, for each query return the strings present in dictionary anagramic to the query string. Find median of a running stream of integers each time a new number is added to the stream. Even though I could have solved each one of them, I sucked at some of them in my interviews and couldn't make it through any overseas company. Of all the Indian companies I had applied to, I cleared through all of theirs interview processes, though. I suppose your motive behind asking this question might be preparing for technical interviews and even though I have answered the question, I don't mind giving you some unsolicited advice. You current approach must be something like visiting websites like glassdoor, geeksforgeeks etc. and solving through problems and puzzles or probably going randomly through blogs scattered over the whole internet. There is very little structure to the content you are preparing for in this way. Considering the scenario, one of my seniors has started InterviewBit.com. All the content is well structured; you'll feel like you have a personal coach. There are various features which you can hear from the co-founder himself.
