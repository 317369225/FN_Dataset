Is real-time search fundamentally different from the various search services Google already provides?
Real time search and search are very different in nature.  Although they both find relevant information and implement similar technologies such as crawling, indexing, search and relevancy algorithms, their purpose and characteristics are different (and as such are the implementation details).  Real time search is about freshness and immediacy; it is different than search in the following aspects: Data Freshness – acquire data that is published in real time only Data availability – data should be acquired and indexed in milliseconds Relevancy – publish time is a dominant parameter in determining data relevancy Queries persistency – to enable continuous real time streaming of search results, not only the data should be indexed, but also the queries
