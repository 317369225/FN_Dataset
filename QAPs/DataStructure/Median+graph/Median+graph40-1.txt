What are some unsolved problems in math which seem easy at first glance?
P versus NP problem All it is asking is that if something is easy to check is it also easy to find? Definitely looks easy at first. Moreover you have hundreds and hundreds of NP-complete problems which are equivalent to one another. Just proving one of them to be easy or hard would suffice. For example, the Subset sum problem, Given a set of numbers, does some combination of them add up to zero? To solve the P vs. NP question, you have to give an efficient (polynomial time) procedure (Algorithm) to solve this, or prove that none exist. Collatz conjecture Yes you can explain this to a six year old. Start with any natural number. If it is even, divide by two, if odd, multiply by three and add one. Repeat the same method on the new number, and the one after that, so on. Eventually you should reach one, no matter what number you started with. eg. 6 -> 3-> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 Twin prime Conjecture and the Goldbach's conjecture A motivated middle schooler would be intrigued to see how easy they seem at first glance and yet unsolved. Are there infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that differ by two? Is every even number > 2 the sum of two primes? Erdős conjecture on arithmetic progressions Anyone who understands infinite series would appreciate the beauty in the simplicity of this conjecture. If the sum of reciprocals of a sequence of positive integers diverge, there exists arbitrarily large arithmetic progressions among its members. Perfect number Problem Are there infinitely many natural numbers whose proper divisors sum to itself? No one knows whether any of the above is true or false. Deciding any of them would guarantee a Fields Medal. Updated 118w ago • View Upvotes
