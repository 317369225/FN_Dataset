Is real-time search fundamentally different from the various search services Google already provides?
PageRank breaks down under the stress of "real time search".  Once it was wikipedia.org vs myspamblog.com.  Now it is twitter.com/spammy vs twitter.com/experty.  No sweat, you have a double PhD and you figure out a clever way to score the stream of opinion and citation.  Now you have two separate scoring algorithms producing different result sets, and you have to merge them.  The big challenge for Google is not disrupting the cash cow of canonical, slow changing links + Adsense.  That is what is keeping them in bean bags and Odwalla.  Users and sponsors rely on expectations of how your search works and it is not easy to change that without losing business.  That is why real-time results on traditional SERPs are served as a side dish, or accessed explicitly through a menu.  Visiting a real time search engine, you have already selected that flavor of indexing and scoring.
