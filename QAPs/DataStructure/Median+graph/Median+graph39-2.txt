What are some examples of great new-user experience flows on the web?
"General Rules of Thumb #3" - "force the user to take actions e.g. don't allow them to click the logo in the header and "escape out the flow... "  This is a loosing strategy.  If the user decides: he/she picked the wrong feature, he/she is confused by where flow is taking them, the flow just sucks - not working for them at all, [insert any one of 50 reasons you failed to anticipate their needs] ... then their only course of action is to back out step-by-step or close the browser tab.  Yes, abandonment within a flow is a data point, but you loose the opportunity to see where they go after they escape the flow.  The only way to see why your flow fails with your prospects is by tracking where they go and what they do after abandoning the flow.   Letting users "skip out" on the flow provides a critical datapoint.  It will hurt your business more if you don't understand why they want out of it. Whenever you hear your self saying "... force the user..." realize you are most likely wrong.  If your design is such that you have to "force the user" you really need to re think it.
