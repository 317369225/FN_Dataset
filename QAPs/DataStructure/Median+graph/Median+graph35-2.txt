What are some statistics that make the US look bad?
I first posted this answer as a comment to Graeme Shimmin's comment about US obesity, but decided to "unbury" it.  "The health risks of obesity are actually more statistically associated with insulin resistance, a condition that (1) is rampant in the USA, likely to an equal extent as obesity compared to the rest of the world (so good call on your answer!), (2) is a (the biggest?) causal factor in obesity, and (3) present in 25% of USA people who are NOT obese. Ouch! In the USA, the government continued to recommend diets high in complex carbohydrates and moderate in polyunsaturated vegetable oils, and the ADA contiunues to recommend that diabetics eat a diet high in complex carbohydrates, which exacerbates the severity of diabetes. In the USA, science and public health have become political policies, so we can all cherry pick whatever measurements of health and wellbeing we want to illustrate answers to this question. But there is good news; a minority of our population is among the most scientifically sophisticated in the world regarding the biological, nutritional and psychological underpinnings of health and wellness. This is a self-defense or counter-reaction to the malfeasance in our government and medical systems." Updated 16w ago • View Upvotes
