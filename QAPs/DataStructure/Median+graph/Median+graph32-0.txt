Is there a racial wealth gap in the United States?
Yes.  Without a doubt; with prejudice.  Miriam Jordan of The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday (7.26.11) that the Pew Research Center had authored a report showing that the median net worth of white households in the US was 20 times greater than that of black households, and 18 times greater than that of Hispanic households. The median black household had $5,677; the median hispanic household had $6,325; and the median white household had $113,149, in 2009.  This is the article; there are charts and references to additional data sources: "White-Minority Wealth Gulf Widens" http://online.wsj.com/article/SB... This is not a surprise to anyone who's been paying the slightest bit of attention, although apparently the incredibly rapid widening of the spread is unprecedented over the last five or so years.  In this particular case, a good proxy for wealth gap is the lack of wealth, or poverty. Poverty rates for women are, and have long been, higher than those for men, across race.  (The gender wealth gap is a bonus.)
