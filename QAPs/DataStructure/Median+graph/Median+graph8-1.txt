Yes, it is true that sometimes people write long and detailed answers just to get upvotes and attract attention. But if the answer isn't actually responsive, on topic, and useful, it won't succeed in any kind of positive fashion. That's the thing about Quora, there isn't any real formula for how to get the most upvotes on a question, nor does there seem to be any on how to become a TW. I've seen 5K upvote answers which were a single sentence that wasn't very helpful, and wasn't even particularly amusing. I've seen long posts with multiple images that had a handful of votes, regardless of relevance. There is also an element of democratic selection about the upvote process - for the most part, better answers will get more upvotes. It's not guaranteed, but on average, it balances out.
