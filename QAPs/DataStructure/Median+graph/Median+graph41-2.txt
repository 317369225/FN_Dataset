Is Oakland following the trend of other Bay Area cities in becoming more gentrified over the past few years?
Not exactly... First, it's important to understand that Oakland is a huge city with an incredibly diverse array of neighborhoods. You've got neighborhoods in the Oakland Hills, like Montclair, that are very expensive and very nice...if you can afford it. There are places like Rockridge, Elmwood, and Piedmont Avenue on the Northeast side that are great neighborhoods that lots of people like living in. They're closer to Berkeley and attract lots of Cal students. The area around Lake Merritt -- especially Grandlake -- is also popular...as long as you are careful near Adams Point. There are some neighborhoods, like West Oakland and Temescal that are gentrifying and becoming more attractive. Golden Gate gets a bit of gentrification halo from neighboring Emeryville. And then there's East Oakland. This is the counterpoint to these other neighborhoods. This is where you see high crime rates. This is where you see the economic inequality. This is the Oakland of reputation. They recently did a major renovation of Oakland Airport...but the city is in the process of losing two (and possibly all three) of its pro sports teams. The Fox Theater reopens...the Parkway Speakeasy closes. Oakland is, as ever, a study in contrasts. ...and THEN there's the fallout from the Occupy Oakland protests....
