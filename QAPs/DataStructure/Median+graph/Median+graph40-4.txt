What are some unsolved problems in math which seem easy at first glance?
A favorite of mine is the Collatz conjecture (sometimes called the hailstone problem). Define [math]f(n)[/math] to be [math]n/2[/math] if [math]n[/math] is even, or [math]3n+1[/math] if [math]n[/math] is odd. If you begin with any positive integer [math]n[/math] and replace it repeatedly with [math]f(n)[/math], will you eventually reach [math]1[/math]? I like this problem because it is great for many levels of students. I've asked this question to a classroom of seven-year olds, who were immediately hooked by how fun it was to generate examples (and amazed that they couldn't find a counterexample). And there are lots of small theorems and partial results, so even children can sink their teeth into it and discover interesting things (for example: how many times in a row can the sequence go up-and-then-down?). At the other end, it has inspired quite a lot of interesting research mathematics.
