What is grade inflation like at world-renowned universities?
Every university and department will take a different stance on how they want to grade their students. At Penn (Wharton, Engineering and most of College), the GPAs of students were discernible. Meaning, only a small number got above a 3.8 (~5% = summa cum laude), then a fraction between 3.6-3.8, and so on till an average somewhere between 2.7 and 3.3 depending on major. So I don't know whether you call this inflation or not, but certainly, GPA can be used as a mechanism to select students (for interviews for example). The problem with having everyone get an A, means your GPA is of no use. While I am certainly of the opinion that GPA isn't everything, I also have an appreciation for real world recruitment processes. I worked at a Bank one summer, and was given a stack of ~100 resumes and an hour to go through and choose 10 of them to consider for an interview. Unfortunately, time constraints of the real world mean you need ways to filter people, and GPA is an indicator of something. At the very least its an indicator of the ability to figure out how to get As. If on the other hand 80/100 resumes had a 4.0, I'd probably have no idea how to filter students, and choose on something even more arbitrary. My guess is that for this reason, some departments will try to force at least some classes into the major to create differences. The canonical example among pre-meds is organic chemistry, aka the weeder class for aspiring med students. Similarly at Wharton, accounting was that class, only 15% (maybe 20%) As were allowed to be given, no matter what. This enabled Wharton to give employers a way to 'filter' students essentially. You can agree or disagree with using GPA to filter, but at least it's a metric.
