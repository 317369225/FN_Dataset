CAT or GMAT which one is tougher?
Quant is more difficult in CAT than in GMAT. Verbal is more difficult in GMAT than in CAT. Well, the above two points can be easily understood by looking at the country of origin of these two tests. CAT belongs to India, where people are stronger in quant (and thus, you need a tougher test to keep most of them out), and GMAT belongs to US, where people are stronger in Verbal. So, depending on your individual strengths and weaknesses across different sections, you may find one of the test easier than the other. Besides, GMAC (organisation which conducts GMAT) gives away two full-length GMAT tests free. So, one can take one of these tests to figure out his or her level on the test.
