Are startups overvalued right now?
At the risk of not really answering the question: I'm sure that some are overvalued and that some are fairly valued.  Fidelity recently reduced the carrying value of its investment in Snapchat, and I think another company.  To the extent that an asset is written down on a fund's balance sheet, the value at which that asset was acquired was too high. The problem with answering questions of this type is that valuation of startups is fundamentally a negotiation between owner and investors.  If investors are willing to buy in to MyHotStartup.com at a $100 trillion valuation, why would the owner argue that his is only a $1 billion company? Of course, such high valuations implies that there is a proverbial greater fool down the road who is willing to pay even more.
