Is 2015 a good time to buy a house in the Bay Area?
The answer to you question depends a lot on the purpose, your time horizon and what you consider a good outcome. I'd say if you're looking for a primary residence and you intend to stay in it long term (10+ years) then yes now is a good time to buy.  Your mortgage payment will stay the same while rent in most areas of the bay area rises. A long time horizon gives you a bigger buffer to absorb  short term dips in housing prices. As a short term investment I think it's bit risky to flip houses right now. The current tech cycle has been going on since around 2009, if it falters that will cause a downward pressure on housing prices. The economy has been growing since it bottomed in 2008, there will mostly likely be a recession in the next few years as all economic expansions eventually run out steam. Mortgage rates have been kept artificially low but the Fed has stopped Quantitate Easing and will start raising interest rates sometime this year(2015).  I think the only thing stopping that would be a recession.  As mortgage rates rise it will put pressure on housing prices.If your time horizon is long enough you can ride out things like tech bubbles and recessions.
