What are some bad but popular reasons for people to go to law school?
Power, money and prestige. Law school is the last resort of the liberal arts major. I went to night law school and like all of my classmates worked full time. One woman - with a Stanford mastersÂ  no less- had enrolled because it was a good way to meet guys who were going to be successful and rich. As far as I know she never married. She didn't practice either.
