Which law schools are notorious for using the LSAT as the major admissions determinant to the exclusion (maybe even ignorance) of other factors like GPA?
Almost all law schools seem to use a mathematical formula to determine admission, factoring in undergraduate GPA and LSAT.  When I was applying to law schools, the best resource I found for inferring the relative weights of the two factors was http://www.lawschoolnumbers.com/ . There, you can look at graphs for each school with GPA and LSAT on the axes, plotting each applicant as a dot, red dots for rejected applicants and green dots for accepted applicants. From a quick glance at that site's listing of law schools, ordered by median LSAT score (http://schools.lawschoolnumbers....), several schools jump out at me as having median GPAs lower than those of schools with similar median LSAT scores, suggesting that these schools place relatively more weight on LSAT scores: Notre Dame; Emory; Wake Forest; and Illinois Urbana-Champaign, for example.  That said, there does not appear to be a very wide range of weights that various schools place on GPA, as there is not a lot of variation in median GPAs for a given median LSAT range.
