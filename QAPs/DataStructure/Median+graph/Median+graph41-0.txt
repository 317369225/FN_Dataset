Is Oakland following the trend of other Bay Area cities in becoming more gentrified over the past few years?
By the numbers, yes. If you look at the demographic and income data from 1980 through 2010, two trends emerge.  First incomes are up relative to the national average.  The chart below lays out the median household income in Oakland versus the US from 1980 through 2010:  Oakland's income was 85% of the national median in 1980, by 2010 it was 104% of the US national median.  That's a significant improvement in incomes. Second, you see a shift in the demographic composition, which is also typically associated with gentrification.  It's tough to talk about gentrification given the racially charged nature of the discussion, and I hope I don't get attacked for a frank presentation here of the data.  Typically the data will show an area dominated by non-white minorities becoming more white over time.  What's interesting about Oakland's shift, however, is that gentrification appears to be coming from the Asian, Hispanic as well as Caucasian communities.  What's not borne by the data here, but what I suspect having lived in Oakland the past 5 years, is that there are greater numbers of higher earning black households today than previous, and that they are also a component of Oakland's gentrification.  The chart below shows the trend:  In 1980, 47% of the population was African American and 40% Caucasian - less than 10% was Asian or Hispanic.  Today Caucasian are the most populous race in Oakland at 35% of the total population.  African Americans account for 28% of the population, Asians for nearly 20%, and Hispanics for about 15%.   So there you have it: yes.  That said, Ian's caveats and details about the diversity and array of neighborhoods in Oakland are very much on point. All the data employed here was provided by the US census.
