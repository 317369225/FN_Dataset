What is grade inflation like at world-renowned universities?
It depends from school to school. One caveat: some schools were already giving high grades out to people several decades ago, so even though they have very high median GPAs, they haven't seen significant amounts of grade inflation over the last 30 years - with Brown University as the most prominent example (see http://www.gradeinflation.com/ ).
