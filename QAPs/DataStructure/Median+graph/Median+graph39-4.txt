I'm sure the content here is dated at this point, but the folks at KissMetrics.com put this together years ago and I still think it's a pretty valuable tool: http://productplanner.com/ Shows the registration flows + viral loops for dozens of sites, apps, facebook games, etc. As I said, probably a bit dated, but still good stuff.
