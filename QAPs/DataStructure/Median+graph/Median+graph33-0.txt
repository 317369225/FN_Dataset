How many all-time-views does the average Quoran have; counting only Quorans with more than 10 answers?
So...  the average Quoran doesn't actually countable views as a random comment.  From a sample of 10,130 users taken on January 1, 2016,  7,290 or 71.9% had zero on the countable front.  Anyone trying to provide you an answer here is really going to struggle.  Just for fun, first stage from that sample is to remove all writers with 9 or fewer answers and no views. 788 users have countable views with between 1 and 9 answers. This group had an average of 8821 views and median of 2908.5.  Just providing this because interesting.  This is just for your own fun knowledge.  Back to the sample.  In the session with Adam D'Angelo , he said Quora had 80 million users.  I know the percentage of Quora users from India is around 40%, possibly higher. The sample I believe is around 20% female, which I again believe is representative of Quora more broadly.  The sample used for this reflects that reality in terms of composition.  Let's assume that my sample is that fantastic.  Once I remove all the people who have 9 or fewer answers, I have 2,086 users.  Across Quora, you probably thus have 16,474,000 users with 10 or more answers.  This makes sense given what I believe is a relatively high industry benchmark for month and daily usage of the site. 20% answering is great, especially as a lot of people use Quora just to read and register to get around the login firewall. My sample has  483,407,118 views across them all.  Divide this by 2,086 and then multiply times 16,474,000 and the total number of all time views for Quorans with 10 or more answers is, at a guess, 3.81763E+12.  I boggle. I really do hate average, though I will you that in this sample, the average Quora user with 10 or more answers has 235,578 all time views.  This is a bit misleading because on the median, the Quoran with 10 or more answers has 43,903 views all time. I've put this sample on a nice little graph to give an idea what is going on using logarithmic scaling.  This gives a bit better of an idea regarding distribution for "average" Quora users.
