What are some bad but popular reasons for people to go to law school?
They believe the employment statistics published by law schools, which are in the best case misleading, and in the worst case outright fabrications.   Note that it's pretty easy to be misinformed about lawyers' employment outcomes, as they are very different from those in other fields. See a chart of starting salaries for lawyers[1]: A naive prospective law student might be forgiven for, upon hearing that 18% of starting lawyers make a salary of $160,000, that if he doesn't quite make the cut-off, he might still clear six figures.   A more naive law student might see statistics from law schools like: "Median starting salary of graduates in the private sector: $145,000" and "Percentage of graduates employed 9 months after graduation: 97%", and think that he's got a pretty good shot at a high-paying job. Obviously the implication isn't right, but it is a bit misleading.   A less naive law student might scrutinize the figures closely, and look up the median salary for all graduates, and the employment rate, and think that even those lower numbers are quite reasonable, only to discover later that (a) the school deliberately suppresses or underreports students who are jobless or have low-paying or (crappy) non-legal jobs, and (b) that the school artificially boosts its employment numbers by offering 9-month paid positions (at $10-15/hr) to unemployed graduates just to boost the "employed 9 month after graduation number", after which these temporarily-employed graduates will be cast out again into the heartless void that is the US legal market.     --   [1] Among those who follow law school and the legal profession in America, this isn't a novel chart.
