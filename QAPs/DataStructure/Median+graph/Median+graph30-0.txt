Are startups overvalued right now?
Individual startups may be overvalued but the idea of startups is undervalued. This is a time to look at fundamentals and ignore the buzz perpetuated by the press. AWS (still young) still takes startup costs from $50k+ to $0 Mobile (still young) still puts a supercomputer that is more powerful than the Harry Potter wand in everybody's pocket Emerging markets still aren't quite online creating huge latent demand Each of the above has compounding effects on each other This stuff is so much more important than the price of Snapchat or Zenefits or Theranos. The increased volume of startups is justified by technology trends, and with more people rolling the dice, more founders end up hitting founder-market-luck fit. The compounding effects are really strong and deceptive. Seems like a great time to be an investor.
