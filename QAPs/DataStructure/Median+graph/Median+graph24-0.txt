Is 2015 a good time to buy a house in the Bay Area?
The best time to buy a house is when housing is most affordable. Historically, the ratio of median home price to median income is a good indicator of house affordability.  But I think this ratio should be adjusted by the mortgage interest rates because for the same level of income people can afford higher prices with lower interest rates. The below chart shows the ratios of median house price to median income in Bay Area based on the data published by NAHB/Wells Fargo in Q3 2015.   Source: Housing Opportunity Index, http://www.nahb.org/en/research/... The interest rate of conventional mortgage in 2007 was peaked at 6.66%, and rate in 10/2015 was 3.8%. Source: FRB: H.15 Release--Selected Interest Rates--Historical Data With interest rate adjustments, the current house price level hasn't reached the level in 2007 yet, but it will be soon at this pace, especially when the interest rate increases. I don't think interest rates will go up too fast. Thus, I speculate that the housing market will continue to go up in 2015 and probably 2016, but there is a high probability that it will peak within 2 years if we use 2007 as the proxy.
