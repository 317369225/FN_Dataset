Law School Admissions: Is it true that attending any but a top-tier law school is a personal and financial mistake?
I'm not a lawyer, but it has been my impression that many smart kids graduating from top undergrad programs can end up going to law school despite having no particular passion for being a lawyer, which I think is a grave personal mistake.  This happens, to my eye, incrementally:  they finish at a great school with good grades, and either aren't ready to get a job or aren't able to get one they want.  The idea of staying in school is great, but under what guise?  MBA programs want you to work first Med School: you would have had to decide that 4 years ago and work your ass off PhD: probably would have had to start working on that a while ago, too, plus what job am I going to get out of that, anyway? October, Senior Year:  But... law school!  "Sounds kind of interesting, you can go straight in out of undergrad, if I like it, I can get a good job that pays well.  I probably don't want to be a lawyer, but, what the hell, I'll take the LSAT for the fun of it, my friend is taking it anyway." January, Senior Year: What do you know?  I scored in the 97th percentile on the LSAT.  Might as well at least apply to a couple schools April, Senior Year: Hey, what do you know... I got into [top 10] Law School... and none of these job options seem that great anyway.  I always wanted to live in [Boston/New York/San Francisco].  Let's put off real life for three more years! Eight years later:  This sucks.  I hate my job, my clients grind the hell out of me, which makes sense since they're paying $500/hour for my services -- I'd grind me too.  Unfortunately, I don't see the $500/hour... used to think I'd put in my time, and when my name was on the door, I'd live off the fat of all the young grinders, but it turns out those guys are never going to leave.  Maybe I should start a cupcake bakery, people love those fancy cupcakes...
