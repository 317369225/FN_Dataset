What are some graphs that clearly show changes in the US economy?
This is a huge question. I'm going to focus on a tiny subset of the economy: distribution. I consider it one of the most worrying trends over the last ~40 years in USA that a smaller and smaller fraction of the population really benefit from growth in the economy. All these graphs are corrected for inflation [source: Slow Income Growth for Middle America ] From 1945 to 1970 median families had the same growth in income as the GDP-growth per capita. This makes inituitive sense: If the GDP/capita is doubled, then it'd make sense that the median inhabitant would have double income. But since 1970 there's been a disconnect: Productivity has grown by over 100% since then, but income of median families has grown by only about 35%. The rest ? Goes to the owners. These are mostly in the top 1% [graph-credit: Mother Jones] If you're a median American household then your income would be $10100/year higher if the income-distribution had stayed like it was in 1979. There's many reasons for this disconnect, but one of them is that congress appears to have been bought, law is increasingly in favour of capital and in disfavour of labour. Look at the graph for where the government collects taxes, for one example: Updated 67w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
