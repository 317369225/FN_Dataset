What are some statistics that make the US look bad?
A few facts that are different to the above and that make me feel particularly uneasy - these are personal. - There are 270m guns in the US. 5 times more than any other nation. - 46% of Americans don't believe in Evolution - 40% of Americans don't think Gay Marriage should be legal. - America has the 4th largest wealth gap in the world, only topped by Chile, Mexico and Turkey, and it's growing by 4% per year. - The median wealth of white households is 20 times that of black households and 18 times that of Hispanic households, this ratio has doubled in the last 20 years. - 62% of personal bankruptcies are caused by medical bills and of these 72% of people had health insurance at the start of their condition. In 1981 only 8% of bankruptcies were due to medical costs. - The drinking age is 21 ! - The police have killed 2,500 citizens in the last 5 years, this compares to 35 in the UK and around 5 per year in Germany. In fact in 2011 the entire German police force used 85 bullets, that's a little more than used to kill one mentally ill homeless person in Michigan a few months ago - http://rt.com/usa/news/police-sh... - There is one Sarah Palin and one Michelle Bachman, and one Rick Santorum and somehow the nation finds a way to let people put microphones in front of them and listen to what they have to say in a serious manner. - 3rd worst poverty rate among developed nations. - Only 15th in the world for Broadband penetration - More Black 17 year olds are in jail than in college - Only 37% of Americans have a passport. - One in ten Americans are taking Antidepressant drugs, making them the most prescribed drug in the country. ( Although note than in many other countries there usage is increasing massively) And a scary graph of life expectancy vs money of healthcare. Updated 180w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
