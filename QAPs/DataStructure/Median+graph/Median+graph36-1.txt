Why have the wages of the American middle class stagnated for decades?
If you look at the numbers, the US economy continues to grow. The money is still rolling in, it just isn't heading into the pockets of the middle class. This diagram shows where some of it is going. I think one reason is that the most wealthy have started to use some new tricks to secure a larger slice of the pie. Interational Outsourcing - allows labor to be bought from overseas Purchase of Political power - allows legislation to support the elite agenda Deregulation of trading and financial markets - creates a casino like playground where the high rollers can bend odds in their favour. Tax Avoidance & Evasion - There's a massive industry dedicated to the legal avoidance of tax.  And a dark industry dedicated to the illegal. In the last forty years, the elite have just gotten really good at this game. They have played it perfectly. They are making off like bandits while simultaneously convincing the country that this is entirely a good thing. It's difficult to even criticise this state of affairs without being branded a socialist. A fledgling political movement was established to challenge this. But everyone was arrested.
