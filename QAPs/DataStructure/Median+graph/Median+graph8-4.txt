Is it true that some people write long and detailed answers just to get upvotes and attract attention?
I don't think so. Of my two highest upvoted answers, the one in second place is quite long, the one with the most upvotes is just one sentence. #2 (currently 1.5k upvotes): Barry Hampe's answer to What is it like to land on an aircraft carrier? #1 (currently 2.8k upvotes): Barry Hampe's answer to If you know you are attractive, and your current girlfriend is not as attractive as you are, is that a valid reason not to marry her?
