With declining middle class for last 40 years how many more years can the usa remain a superpower?
That is a good question. A lot depends on future policies. I fear the USA is currently on an unsustainable trajectory. Our consumer based economy requires a strong consumer base to remain vibrant. One of the inherent flaws of capitalism is that it tends to result in rising inequality. The rich have the means to game the political process and institute policies which make them even richer. The poor get increasingly desperate and are so busy struggling just to get by that they don't have the time to get involved in the political process. But the United States has been down this road before, and has managed to overcome these problems. Extreme inequality becomes extremely unstable. The poor have the numbers to rise up and overthrow the system, either through the political process or through violent revolution. That can get bloody. Fearing such an outcome, the rich can institute more moderate policies in the name of "enlightened self-interest". Â  But your question was whether the USA could remain a superpower. Yes, it is possible it could remain a superpower with a very small middle class and a very unequal society. Other countries have done it. Wars are very expensive to fight. They also tend to put people back to work. But with an increasing reliance on drones, and an increasingly automated system, who knows? We're going off in uncharted territory. Maybe the USA could go on, but people would become unnecessary.
