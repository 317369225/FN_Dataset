What are some graphs that clearly show changes in the US economy?
I'm shocked that no one has mentioned this one yet - the fantastic, 150 year-transition of the U.S. economy from an Agrarian society to an industrial behemoth! There was perhaps nothing more fundamental to the course of the United States in becoming a world power than the industrialization it underwent from the early 1800s to just after WWII. In this one graph, so much can be realized: urbanization (no more jobs in rural areas), industrialization (all the people in the cities worked in factories), rapid improvements in productivity of farming equipment (that's why they didn't need as many people), concentration of land/farms (goes with the whole efficiency thing), regional rises to power (the South has struggled a lot as it has needed less workers to farm but wasn't able to fully adopt industrialization), etc. But, as awesome as the first graph is, this next one may perhaps be even cooler, if that were possible. Below is a depiction of a trend that all advanced economies eventually undergo: the transition from a manufacturing society to a service society. Driven by the ever increasing efficiency (and thus less use for human labor), higher wages (more expense to produce), higher education, and greater desire for convenience, the post WWII U.S. turned away from its industrial dependency and began to churn out lawyers, doctors, accountants, and other white-collar professionals. This has helped to produce an abundance of wealth for the U.S. and its citizens. As a result, the U.S. emerged as the world's largest importer of goods (they have lots of money to buy foreign goods and produce relatively less of their own than before) and largest exporter of services (programming, financial, legal, writing, etc.) It will be quite interesting to see what the "next" major form of employment will be.
