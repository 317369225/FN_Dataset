Is 2015 a good time to buy a house in the Bay Area?
I bought my first house in 2004 when there were bidding wars going on with "crazy" prices. And I bought my current house last year fighting "crazy" bids. Absolutely no regrets. Buying a house if you plan to live in it for 5+ years, is generally a good idea. All definitions of "crazy" prices are relative. Barring a Detroit-like crash, your investment is pretty safe in a good neighborhood in the bay area. If you make a good purchase where the Location, Lot and Layout have no major problems, you will be okay in the long run. Say you buy now at the "maximum" point (compared to the past only) there might be a dip or adjustment in the market in 2016/2017 (8-11 yrs economic cycle since 2008-09) but you simply have to stay put, not panic and ride it out. When I bought mine in 2004, the next few years the valuation went up and then 2008 hit and the values went down (but thankfully not below purchase price) and now its at 2.5X the purchase price. Similarly, a friend of mine had bought a condo in Cupertino at "peak" prices in 2004 and due to a family emergency was thinking of selling in 2010-11. He'd have lost money then. He held on, and now he's more than 2.5X easily. Moral of the stories: Buy something with a good Location, Lot and Layout and be prepared to ride out the next economy adjustment which historically comes every 8-11 yrs. Bonu$ point$ if you buy a fixer-upper and improve and live in it.
