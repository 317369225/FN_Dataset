What's the average number of views per upvote per person?
Since I A2A'd Laura, I probably should answer too. Mine is a bit easier: 1 million views, 7980 upvotes, so around 135 views per upvote. Granted about half of those views came from when Quora Force Feed took a liking to one of my answers, so the data is a bit skewed in my case. If you want a look at how much effect getting an answer picked by Digest can have, my laughably unbalanced stats are a good guide.
