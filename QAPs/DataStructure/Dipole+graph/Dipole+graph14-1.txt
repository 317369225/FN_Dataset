Thermodynamics: Is there a maximum temperature?
Our current understanding is that there is indeed an 'upper limit' to temperature; or, to put it more precisely, our current understanding of physics breaks down for any temperature higher than this particular temperature. It is called the Planck temperature, and its value is around [math]1.4 \times 10^{32}[/math] Kelvin. So what is the problem with higher temperatures? Well, there is a fundamental length in physics called the Planck length, about [math]1.6 \times 10^{-35}[/math] metres. It doesn't make sense to talk about lengths smaller than this length scale; all natural process that are allowed by our current theories occur at bigger length scales. This matters because the concept of temperature is also related to length scales. All objects at any nonzero temperature emit radiation, called Black-body radiation. Length scales come into picture through Wien's displacement law, which states that the temperature of an object is inversely proportional to the 'peak wavelength' of the  radiation it emits. A hotter object will therefore emit more radiation at shorter wavelengths.  You might remember that as you start to heat, say, iron, it first glows a dull red - red has a relatively long wavelength - and then, as you continue to heat it, bright yellow,  because smaller wavelengths like blue are also emitted significantly at higher temperatures, thus lessening the 'red'-ness. Similarly, the colour of a star in the night sky is a direct indicator of its surface temperature. Blue stars (those emitting more small-wavelength blue radiation) are very hot, and red stars (those emitting more large-wavelength red radiation) are relatively colder. Thus there is a (very high) temperature at which the peak wavelength emitted by an object is the Planck length. This is called the Planck temperature. Since smaller length do not make sense, higher temperatures do not make sense either, and therefore this is an upper limit to the temperature. Interestingly, we believe that the universe was once as hot as the Planck temperature, during its very early stages - as early as [math]10^{-42}[/math] seconds after the Big Bang. This is one reason why physicists are in search of better theories than our current 'Standard Model'; it would improve our understanding of the very early universe. In answer to the other part of the question, we have managed to create very high temperatures on Earth. Heavy nuclear conversions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN are expected to reach temperatures of the order of [math]10^{18}[/math] Kelvin.
