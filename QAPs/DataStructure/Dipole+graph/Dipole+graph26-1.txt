What is so interesting about nanomaterials?
The most interesting thing is it lets you find out how easily a person is suckered in by hype and babble. People confuse "Nanotechnology" with "nanomaterials". "Nanotechnology" is about 85% babble, uninformed, impossible babble about mechanical nanomachines building nanorobots that will eyeball each of your blood cells for cancer.   Once you see talk like that you can spit-can that book. "Nanomaterials" is what we used to call "intelligent uses of powders and thin films", but that was not enough of the sexy.   It's gotten to the point where cocktail-party conversations are cluttered with discussions of "graphene powered space elevators" and that's before everybody is totally drunk.  I blame "Wired".
