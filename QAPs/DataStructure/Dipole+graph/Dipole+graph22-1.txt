Can the electric and magnetic field strengths of an electromagnetic wave be out of phase like this image?
This is the "usual" EM waves look like: If we look at the end of the waves, that is the wave at [math]z = ct[/math], from the side, depends on the time [math]t[/math] of when we take the snapshot, it may have a look like this: (the same argument would equally apply if we look it from the top) There is a reason of why it looks like that, Maxwell's equations. It says: [math]E = cB[/math]. That is the electric field E (the red arrow) must equal with magnetic field B (the blue "x") away from us toward the screen times the speed of light. In other words, it says that the electric field and magnetic field are proportional to each other. Thus as we could see, when the electric field goes down, so does the magnetic field. That out of phase electric and magnetic field, at the same snapshot, would look like this: This look, [math]E \neq cB[/math], so no, it could not. Updated 3w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
