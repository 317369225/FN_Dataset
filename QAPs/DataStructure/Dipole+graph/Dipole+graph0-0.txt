How tight is the correlation between the dielectric constant and the dipole moment of a molecule?
They're very strongly correlated, since the dielectric constant is a function of the dipole moment of a molecule. However, that's not the only factor.Â  The other factor in the dielectric constant is the geometry -- not just how densely the dipoles are packed together, but how the dipoles interact with each other. Found a chart that shows this: Explanation of the Material Anomalies of Water (M1-M14) Shown [above] are the dipole moments (blue triangles below) and dielectric constant/(dipole moment)2 ratios (red diamonds above) relative to the dielectric constants for a range of solvents. The data 1-17 correspond to 1, diethyl ether; 2, chloroform; 3, methylene dichloride; 4, methyl ethyl ketone; 5, acetone; 6, ethanol; 7, methanol; 8, acetonitrile; 9, ethylene glycol; 10, dimethyl sulfoxide; 11, hydrazine; 12, formic acid; 13, water; 14, sulfuric acid; 15, formamide; 16, hydrogen cyanide; and 17, N-methyl formamide respectively. If molecular polarizability were the only factor in dielectric constant, you'd have a nice perfect straight line there.
