How would you define polar and nonpolar?
For more complex molecules, a convenient practical method which doesn't require much in the way of fancy equipment is thin layer chromatography (TLC). I was going to explain how this works in detail, but the Wikipedia article is excellent. Thin layer chromatography In essence, the more polar a molecule is, the more it likes to stick to other polar molecules. So if you add your compound to a solid very polar compound (usually silica gel which is stuck as a layer on a glass plate), it will stick to the solid silica particles with a certain affinity. If you then try wash the compound from the very polar surface of the silica gel particles you need to displace it using a solvent with similar or higher polarity than the compound. In TLC the solvent flows up the silica gel layer by capillary attraction. If the solvent is polar enough it will displace the compound and the compound will move up the plate with the solvent. If the solvent is not polar enough the compound will stay glued to the spot. So by determining what solvents are required to displace the compound and get it to move up the plate, you can get an idea of its relative polarity. For example, if you need 10% Methanol in dichloromethane (a very polar mixture) to make your compound move, you know that it is rather polar. If you only need 5% ethyl acetate in heptane (not very polar) to get it to move, then the compound is rather non-polar. How far various compounds move in a certain solvent gives a measure of the relative polarity of the different compounds. I hope this gives a fairly comprehensible description of the fundamental principle of what is known as "normal phase" TLC. As usual there are more complex processes at work in chromatography when you look at it in more detail, complete with formulae to learn. There are other methods to explore polarity of molecules, like reversed-phase HPLC, which require fancy equipment, but TLC is the simplest.
