Can the electric and magnetic field strengths of an electromagnetic wave be out of phase like this image?
Change in electric field causes a change in magnetic field, and vice-versa. Now, imagine an electron, if you move it a little, it will immediately create a ripple in both electric and magnetic field, which will propogate through universe together. You can not seperate them or create them seperately. They are actually not seperate things but we seperate them in our calculations. We can imagine a phase shift between them but that would not really make sense. For example, 180 degrees of shift would actually imply reverse direction of motion. Or 90 degrees shift would imply constant change of amplitude and direction. Maybe, just maybe, overlapping different waves would achieve that, but they can always be seperated to their original, non-phase shifted waves.
