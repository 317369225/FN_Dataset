Can the electric and magnetic field strengths of an electromagnetic wave be out of phase like this image?
Oh, sure it can, and Maxwell's equations back it up. Of course not the vacuum equations, that's just a particular case. Let's see a case when this happens. The usual equations for the electromagnetic waves are: [math]\displaystyle \nabla ^2\vec{E}-\mu\varepsilon \frac{\partial^2 \vec{E}}{\partial t^2}=0[/math] [math]\displaystyle \nabla ^2\vec{B}-\mu\varepsilon \frac{\partial^2 \vec{B}}{\partial t^2}=0[/math] An that gives us the usual in-phase case, but, these are not the general solution, the true equations are these: [math]\displaystyle \nabla ^2\vec{E}-\mu\sigma\frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t} -\mu\varepsilon \frac{\partial^2 \vec{E}}{\partial t^2}=0[/math] [math]\displaystyle \nabla ^2\vec{B}-\mu\sigma\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} -\mu\varepsilon \frac{\partial^2 \vec{B}}{\partial t^2}=0[/math] That extra term is usually omitted because we make [math]\sigma=0[/math]. The [math]\sigma[/math] is the conductivity and it's okay to ignore it in non conductive materials, but in metals for instance, it has a high value, and this changes things. Consequences: 1.- We have losses, that term produces an exponential atenuation of the fields. 2.- The electromagnetic fields are out of phase. This has very important implications, for example, the fact that metals can work as mirrors (the mirror looks like mercury or silver? well, maybe it is), the possibility of making waveguides...
