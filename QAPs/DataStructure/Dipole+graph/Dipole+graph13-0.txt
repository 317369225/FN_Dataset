How would you define polar and nonpolar?
To determine if a molecule is polar, if you are in a lab, simply mix it with water. If it dissolves, it is polar.  If it does not, it most likely is not. If you are working on this theoretically, first draw the Lewis structure.  Determine the shape of the molecule and determine if any of the individual bonds are polar (you need an electronegativity table for this). If the molecule has only nonpolar bonds, then it is non polar.  If the molecule has some polar bonds, determine if the molecule is perfectly symmetrical.  If it is, most likely the molecule is nonpolar.  If not, then it is most likely polar.
