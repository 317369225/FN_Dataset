What are radiowaves and microwaves?
A Simple Google Search would have answered your question. Anyways, both Radio waves and Microwaves are Electromagnetic Waves(EM waves). This means they consist of Electric and Magnetic waves vibrating perpendicular to each other and also perpendicular to the direction of their motion. They travel at the speed of light in vacuum, i.e. c=299,792,458 m/s. They lie at the lower end of the frequency chart of electromagnetic spectrum. You can see their order of frequency as well as wavelength in the chart. Polar molecules(molecules with net Dipole moment) interact with the electric field in microwaves and try to align themselves according to them(but are never able to because of rotational inertia). This causes heating due to friction. The heating efficiency of microwaves depends on various factors such as viscosity of material, temperature, and state. Radio waves suffer less signal loss as compared to other EM waves. They are also less energetic and can easily propagate long distances without much loss in energy. Hence, they are used in radio communications.
