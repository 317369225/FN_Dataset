Thermodynamics: Why does the H2O-Ethanol solution have less volume than the pure components?
A comprehensive and detailed answer to this question would have to get into molecular kinetics, atomic forces and complex fluid statics.   A much simpler explanation can be made by analogy.  If you have a gallon of golf balls and a gallon of sand, and mix them together, do you get two gallons? Clearly not.  A lot of the sand fits into the spaces between the balls, and the total volume at the end is less than the volume at the beginning.   Now, you may not think there's any space between molecules of water and ethanol, but the molecules fit together in particular ways which determine their density.  When you mix two different kinds of molecules together, they can often pack together in a more efficient way than either can alone, with one type slipping in between the other.  The total volume at the end is greater than either is alone, but less then the two of them separately.   Its a bit of a clumsy analogy, perhaps, but a gives an idea of how molecules mix together.
