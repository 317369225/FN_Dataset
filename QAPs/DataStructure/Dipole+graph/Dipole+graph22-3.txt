Can the electric and magnetic field strengths of an electromagnetic wave be out of phase like this image?
It is very much a reality that such a wave would exist. But, till now, I can't really give you any experimental proof, primarily because I am too lazy to google it. Theoretically it is absolutely fine. In fact a microwave would be a perfect example of such a phenomena since the two ends of the microwave are points where the Electric field is at a constant minimum while the Magnetic field is at a maximum, ofcourse, the proper way to say this would be that the Electric field is at it's node while that of the Magnetic field is at it's anti-node. The reason being that, since the ends are made of a conductor(generally steel) the electric field is [math]0  C/m^2[/math] while,  the magnetic field is constantly changing(since for an EM wave there should be a time varying magnetic field.) This leads to a resulting EM wave known as the commercial microwave used in Microwave Ovens. For further reading I would suggest "University Physics-Sears and Zeemansky".
