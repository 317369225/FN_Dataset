Thermodynamics: Is there a maximum temperature?
Yes, there is a maximum temperature. It is called Planck temperature (on Wikipedia). It is really hot: 1.4 × 10^32 K (Compare: center of our sun is about 1.5 x 10^7 K) It is derived from the fundamental limits of the universe, rather than something we have measured. In layman's terms, so not at all accurate, you can look at it this way. You already know temperature is the bouncing around and vibration of excited molecules and atoms. When at absolute zero, that movement stops. Well, the movement on the upper end is limited by physical properties of the universe, such the speed of light, so we can use those limits to calculate what the maximum temperature would be for some hypothetical mass/gas in this excessively high state. That is Planck temperature.
