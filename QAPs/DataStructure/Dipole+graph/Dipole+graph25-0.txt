Is there really scientific evidence for a "Young Earth"?
Evidence is funny stuff. After all, evidence is really just data: observations, measurements, artifacts, the result of experiments and analyses of data. It's just stuff. It isn't really about the evidence, it is about the methods used to evaluate the evidence against a given proposition. If we're lax, we can use the Ken Ham method, "well, we have all these bones in the ground, see that supports a global flood." As scientists and excited laymen, I think we all favor a more vigorous approach, something more like the scientific method. In this sense, the evidence mustn't merely be consistent with the proposition (hypothesis), but must be the necessary consequence of the hypothesis. In other words, if the evidence wasn't as we see it, then our hypothesis could not be correct. To look this is another direction we can say that in order to claim evidence in support of an hypothesis, we must have the ability to recognize disconfirming evidence. If an hypothesis is consistent with any hypothetical observation, then you cannot possibly proclaim any specific piece of evidence as supporting. And this is the problem with creationism. You can ad hoc rationalize any hypothetical piece of evidence to support it. It relies on a capricious, all powerful, being. You cannot deduce any regularity out of it. If something doesn't seem to mesh perfectly (what do you mean there's too much diversity to explain after a recent flood,) then you merely have to invoke god's will (he magicked in all that stuff). So, is there any evidence for a young earth? No, nor can there be. It's not a testable proposition.
