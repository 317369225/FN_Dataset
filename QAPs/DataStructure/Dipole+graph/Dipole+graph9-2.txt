Can someone tell me about the important derivations in electrostatics and current electricity for class 12 board in physics? How can I master electrostatics?
Simple trick to this problem is... 1) Go in a library or a book stall and get previous year board question papers on the subject of your concern... 2)solve all long and short questions as many times as you can..i know it'll be frustrating ..but its worth trying If you really wanna score good in your subject... Best of luck for your exam!!!
