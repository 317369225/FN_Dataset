How would you define polar and nonpolar?
Polar and non polar has to do with the nature of electropotential gradients within a molecule. Polar molecules have an electropotential gradient that seems to flow generally in one direction (this is called a dipole moment): where from one end of the molecule to another goes from a positive electropotential to a negative electropotential. This would be observed in molecules like water and ethanol. Nonpolar molecules have electropotential disparities (i.e. differences in the electronegativities within each atom), but there is no clear one directional gradient of these differnces. This would be observed in molecules like Benzene or Octane.
