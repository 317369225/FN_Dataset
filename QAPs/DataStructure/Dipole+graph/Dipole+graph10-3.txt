I read in a popular science book that an electron disappears in one orbit and appears in another? Is that really true? Is that an example of teleportation?
No, it is not true. What it does is either absorb or emit electromagnetic energy and change from one stationary state to another. It does not disappear, but we do not know what it actually does because due to the Uncertainty Principle, quantum particles do not have trajectories as in the classical sense. It can haveÂ  a huge number of ways of getting between the states, and there is no way of knowing which it actually chooses. Therefore, we say it goes from A to B and leave it at that. As an aside, equally we have no idea where it is at any instant when in a stationary state. What we calculate is a probability distribution of where it might be, but again, this is due to the Uncertainty Principle, wherein we cannot know the exact position and momentum of the particle. All we know is the expectation energy of it in a stationary state, and in a transition there is, perforce, no expectation energy.
