Do iron fillings get attracted towards light(an electromagnetic wave) when placed under it?
How small?  What frequency of light?  (visible is ~10^15 to ~10^16 Hz). The generic answer for visible light is a relatively simple no, simply because magnetic effects get cut off for large objects at high frequencies, because the magnetic domains in the iron filings can't respond fast enough. An example with powder-based transformer cores: chart source:  Magnetics Inc. Oh, and the powder cores respond faster because the magnetic domains are smaller.  Your typical iron filings probably cut off at a lower frequency. Here's a graphic of what's happening inside the iron: It's simply that the dipoles can't turn fast enough. If your particles are very, very small, you may be able to get some Optomechanic effects such as Optical tweezing: except that the forces involved will be different since the tiny bit of iron isn't a dielectric, but rather at optical frequencies will have a plasmonic effect.
