What are radiowaves and microwaves?
First of all, Use Google, not Quora. Secondly, they are both electromagnetic waves (EMW) so they possess the basic EMW properties. But the speciality of microwaves are that they can heat up the water molecules logged in or around any substance due to which they can very easily and evenly heat up objects. Whereas radiowaves on the other hand are used for long distance communications with less hindrance and harm. As the name 'radio' suggests it is transmitted by transmission towers and received by receivers. That's how the Communication is made possible.
