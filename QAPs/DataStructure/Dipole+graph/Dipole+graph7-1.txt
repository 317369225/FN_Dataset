Do iron fillings get attracted towards light(an electromagnetic wave) when placed under it?
Nice question. Here, you should understand that the magnetic field emanated, say by another magnetic material is not the same as an electromagnetic wave. So the magnetic field lines emanated by a magnet are like messages being sent continuously saying the other magnetic material either to get repelled or get attracted, and anyone can receive these and act accordingly. So you can assume them to be magnetic field lines which are simply moving in a single direction, and that is the like the past which the other magnet must follow. Well, that is not the case with electromagnetic waves. With electromagnetic waves, it's just that the electric and magnetic fields oscillate and that is the source of energy of the wave. So the fields aren't being emanated from any magnetic material,Â  so they are blind to all magnetic material. At least when we are concerned about themagnetic phenomenon. And another difference is that the fields don't point in any direction, so the other magnetic material doesn't really know where to go. It does only when the magnetic fields are emanated by a magnetic material and they are pointing towards a single direction.
