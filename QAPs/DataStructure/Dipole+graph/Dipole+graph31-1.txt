Is God real?  Do you believe in god?  Why do we believe there is an almighty god in real world?  Why we regard the man lived in 1400 years ago, 2000 years ago, 2600 years ago as our belief?  (PS: I mean no discrimination, I just want to know what other people think this question)
Is god real? So far, it has been impossible to prove it 100% conclusively one way or the other, so different people will say different things. Do I believe in god? No. To explain things we don't know or understand, I think it is simpler to say "I don't know" rather than trying to fill in the knowledge gap with a concept of "god". There's no argument or evidence I've seen or heard that makes me believe that the universe we live in has had a designer. Why do many people believe there is an almighty god in the world? Different reasons. Some people interpret the same evidence I do as being indication of a purposeful creation, or can't conceive that such a complex universe as the one we live in could be devoid of underlying meaning. I don't understand the other parts of this question
