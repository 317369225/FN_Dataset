Is there really scientific evidence for a "Young Earth"?
No, there isn't any scientific evidence for a "young earth", no matter what the folks at Answers in Genesis say. And I'll go one step further, and say the theological evidence for "young earth" doesn't hold up, either. First of all, the Bible is not a history textbook. It is many different things — poetry, allegory, songs, and oral history recorded many generations after the fact, among other things — but the one thing it is not is a history textbook. Genesis chapter one, in particular, is so obviously lyric poetry, that it is a wonder anyone ever took it literally. It is even laid out as such. God created [x] [fuller explanation of what was created] God saw that it was good. And there was evening and morning — the [n] day. Secondly, in order to believe that God created everything exactly as spelled out in Genesis, you find yourself painted into a corner. Because in order to believe that the world was created as written, you must realize that the God you think you believe in has planted evidence (such as dinosaur bones, fish skeleton fossils, etc.) like a crooked cop all over the planet, in order to trick you into not believing in Him. That would go against the stated desire of God, that all would come to believe in Him. And if God truly would plant evidence, what kind of God are you worshiping, exactly? Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. What faith is not, is the rejection of what God has put before your eyes; nor is it the requirement that you check your God-given brain at the door. Believe your eyes, understand the true age of the earth and the universe, and recognize that God is way more vast and eternal than the author of Genesis ever gave Him credit for.
