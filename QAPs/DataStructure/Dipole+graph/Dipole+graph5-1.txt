Is there any case where students during the process of writing their thesis or dissertations have discovered or invented something that has made them famous?
The Ising model, named after the physicist Ernst Ising, is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. The model consists of discrete variables that represent magnetic dipole moments of atomic spins that can be in one of two states (+1 or âˆ’1). The spins are arranged in a graph, usually a lattice, allowing each spin to interact with its neighbors. The model allows the identification of phase transitions, as a simplified model of reality. The two-dimensional square-lattice Ising model is one of the simplest statistical models to show a phase transition. The model was invented by the physicist Wilhelm Lenz (1920), who gave it as a problem to his student Ernst Ising. The one-dimensional Ising model has no phase transition, and it was solved by Ising (1925) himself in his 1924 PhD thesis. As a result, some call it Lenz-Ising model too. It was only in 1949 that Ising knew the importance his model attained in scientific literature, 25 years after his Ph.D thesis. Today, each year, about 800 papers are published that use this model to address problems in such diverse fields as neural networks, protein folding, biological membranes and social behavior. Though he himself did not win the Nobel Prize, numerous scientists using his model have won. For example, Lars Onsager received Nobel Prize in Chemistry for giving the exact solution for the two-dimensional Ising Model. Reference sources: Ernst Ising, Ising model
