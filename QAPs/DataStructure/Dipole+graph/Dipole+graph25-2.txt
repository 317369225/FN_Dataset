Is there really scientific evidence for a "Young Earth"?
You drive down south from Pueblo Colorado towards New Mexico.   Off to the right about 30 miles away, you see a funny peak,  the road map says there is an extinct volcano.    You go through a cut in the mountains.  You look at the sides of the cut.  It looks like one of those chocolate puddings with white layers!   The black layers are a couple of feet thick.  The cream layers about 3 feet thick.  Apparently that volcano erupts every now and then and lays down about two feet of black volcanic ash all over the surrounding countryside.  My, my, impressive, if it was that volcano, this ash came like 30 miles!   Then apparently the volcano shuts down for a while.   A long while, as the creamy layer is probably limestone, from the shells of sea creatures and diatoms.   From the deposition rate of limestone you can calculate that  each layer  took about 1.5 million years to deposit.  You don't lay down 350 feet thick of parfait layers in 6,000 years.
