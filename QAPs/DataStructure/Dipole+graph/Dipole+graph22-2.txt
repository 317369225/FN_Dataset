Can the electric and magnetic field strengths of an electromagnetic wave be out of phase like this image?
Yes, the electric and magnetic components of an electromagnetic wave can be ninety degrees out of phase with respect to each other - only then the fields are reactive, not radiation. The energy oscillates back and forth instead of actually progressing as it would in radiation. You can think of this as the field equivalent of the power factor concept from AC electronics. When voltage (V) and current (I) are in phase, they convey power. When V and I are in quadrature (i.e. 90 degree phase difference), they are purely reactive and convey no power. The fields close to a small dipole source are in quadrature with a ninety degree phase difference between the electric and magnetic waves. By the time you get a half wavelength or so away, the electric and magnetic waves converge to form an electromagnetic wave.Â  This behavior was described by Hertz in his classic work "Electric Waves" (see p. 152 for Hertz's graph of phase versus range). My company Q-Track (Offering Highly Accurate Real-Time Location Systems to Solve the Most Difficult Indoor Location Problems) actually uses this physics to make indoor location systems that employ long wavelength (~300m) radio waves to achieve 40cm accurate indoor location. This is one of the techniques involved in "Near-Field Electromagnetic Ranging" or NFER indoor location technology. So yes, electric and magnetic waves can be in quadrature as you describe in your figure. Only then they do not convey energy as they would if they were in phase with each other.
