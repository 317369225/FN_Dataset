What is so interesting about nanomaterials?
The potential for dramatic improvements in material properties or new material properties we have not seen before leading to improvements of existing devices and products and entirely new inventions. I will offer dispersion strengthened copper or "Glidcop" as an example for 2 reasons. First we have been using it since long before the term nano-materials came into usage and second because it is just a great success story. High purity copper has the often desirable properties of high thermal and electrical conductivities and the unfortunate properties of low strength and poor machinability. Dispersion strengthened copper comprises almost pure copper with a uniform fine dispersion of 0.15% to 0.60% of sub-microscopic particles of aluminum oxide. The Al2O3 particles restrict the internal mechanism of yielding and can result in a 4X increase in tensile strength from 20,000 psi to 80,000 psi. Because the volume fraction of the particles is so small, they have almost no reducing effect on the thermal and electrical conductivity. An application enabled by this is spot welding. The electrodes must deliver very high pulses of electrical current while applying heavy clamping forces to the metal layers being welded. This cannot be done without Glidcop. We owe our ability to economically manufacture modern press formed steel "unibody" chassis automobiles to this alloy utilizing dispersion strengthening - a nano-material.
