Do I need to be good in physics to do well in computer science?
I agree with Esteban and Manish completely. I am guessing you wish to take up coding or similar (mostly software oriented, not much hardware) which would require you to be good at devising algorithms, which in turn requires you to be good at reasoning and logic. And personally, I think a solid foundation in logical reasoning is built if one is a curious individual right from day 1 (childhood). And if thats true, then one would automatically develop interest in both maths as well as physics, thus becoming good, if not exceptional, at both. I am yet to come across someone who is good at mathematics but "poor" with physics. And of course, being good at mathematics is essential for taking up computer science. Hope this helps. All the best!
