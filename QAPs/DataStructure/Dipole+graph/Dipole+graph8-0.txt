Why does the value of G, speed of light and other scientific constants not vary?
First of all "Why" questions are not really the kind of questions that science tries to answer. The best we can do for a "why" question is to give an explanation of a theory that shows that something should be a constant, but this means something only if the theory is correct.  Science is always trying to either find more evidence for or against any particular theory, so it is never a settled question. Now, if the question is really "Why does science claim that the values of the constants do not vary?" then the answer is because we have measured them as best we can and have found no variation.  It is difficult to do this but Wikipedia has a great description of the attempts to learn if the fine structure constant is indeed constant in space and time. ( See "Fine-structure constant" for the full article on Wikipedia. ) First of all the fine structure constant has three equivalent definitions in terms of other fundamental physical constants: where: e is the elementary charge; ħ = h/2π is the reduced Planck constant; c is the speed of light in vacuum; ε0 is the electric constant or permittivity of free space; or µ0 is the magnetic constant or permeability of free space; or ke is the Coulomb constant. So this constant actually combines several of the other fundamental constants of nature, such as the charge of the electron, the speed of light, Planck's constant (that is used in quantum mechanics) and the permittivity of free space.  So if the fine structure constant is in fact a constant, then either all these fundamental constants are also constant, or if they vary, they vary in such a way as to keep the fine-structure constant as a constant. The fine structure constant determines the energy levels of the hydrogen atom and other atoms and thus the frequencies of the light emitted by those atoms.  This constant is known to accuracy of 3 parts in 10 billion.  So if it were changing significantly on a short time scale (10s of years) or distance (through the movement of the Earth around the Sun) we would be able to detect changes on the order of one part in a billion relatively easily.  In fact one experiment using the frequency ratio of Al+ and Hg+ in single-ion optical atomic clock was able to place a constraint of the change of the fine-structure constant of less than 1 part in a hundred million billion per year!  So it seems to be very constant right now, but what about changes in the past? By using telescopes to measure the spectrum of light from distant (in space and time) objects, such as quasars, it is possible to look for a possible variation in the constant over long periods of time and great distances.  The results of the search is that a small variation may have been measured. In particular the fine-structure constant may have changed by a few parts in a million over the last 10 billion years.  So this is a small change, which justifies saying that this constant is approximately constant and at the same time is evidence that it may possibly have changed with time. More work needs to be done to confirm and clarify these results. The following is a long quote from Wikipedia about the search for long term variations (in space and time) of the fine-structure constant.  I include this long quote to show that there is active research on this question of variation over long periods of time: While the fine-structure constant is known to approach 1/128 at interaction energies above 80 GeV,[11] physicists have pondered for many years whether the fine-structure constant is in fact constant, i.e., whether or not its value differs by location and over time. Specifically, a varying α has been proposed as a way of solving problems in cosmology and astrophysics.[12][13][14][15] More recently, theoretical interest in varying constants (not just α) has been motivated by string theory and other such proposals for going beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The first experimental tests of this question examined the spectral lines of distant astronomical objects, and the products of radioactive decay in the Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor. The findings were consistent with no change.[16][17][18][19][20][21] More recently, improved technology has made it possible to probe the value of α at much larger distances and to a much greater accuracy. In 1999, a team led by John K Webb of the University of New South Wales claimed the first detection of a variation in α.[22][23][24][25] Using the Keck telescopes and a data set of 128 quasars at redshifts 0.5 < z < 3, Webb et al. found that their spectra were consistent with a slight increase in α over the last 10–12 billion years. Specifically, they found that In 2004, a smaller study of 23 absorption systems by Chand et al., using the Very Large Telescope, found no measurable variation:[26][27] However, in 2007 simple flaws were identified in the analysis method of Chand et al., discrediting those results.[28][29] Nevertheless, systematic uncertainties are difficult to quantify and so the Webb et al. results still need to be checked by independent analysis, using quasar spectra from different telescopes.[citation needed] King et al. have used Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to investigate the algorithm used by the UNSW group to determine [math] \Delta \alpha / \alpha[/math] from the quasar spectra, and have found that the algorithm appears to produce correct uncertainties and maximum likelihood estimates for  [math] \Delta \alpha / \alpha[/math] for particular models.[30] This suggests that the statistical uncertainties and best estimate for  [math] \Delta \alpha / \alpha[/math] stated by Webb et al. and Murphy et al. are robust. Lamoreaux and Torgerson analyzed data from the Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor in 2004, and concluded that α has changed in the past 2 billion years by 4.5 parts in 108. They claimed that this finding was "probably accurate to within 20%." Accuracy is dependent on estimates of impurities and temperature in the natural reactor. These conclusions have to be verified.[31][32][33][34] In 2007, Khatri and Wandelt of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign realized that the 21 cm hyperfine transition in neutral hydrogen of the early Universe leaves a unique absorption line imprint in the cosmic microwave background radiation.[35] They proposed using this effect to measure the value of α during the epoch before the formation of the first stars. In principle, this technique provides enough information to measure a variation of 1 part in109 (4 orders of magnitude better than the current quasar constraints). However, the constraint which can be placed on α is strongly dependent upon effective integration time, going as t−1/2. The European LOFAR radio telescope would only be able to constrain Δα/α to about 0.3%.[35] The collecting area required to constrain Δα/α to the current level of quasar constraints is on the order of 100 square kilometers, which is economically impracticable at the present time. In 2008, Rosenband et al.[36] used the frequency ratio of Al+ and Hg+ in single-ion optical atomic clocks to place a very stringent constraint on the present time variation of α, namely Δα̇/α = −1.6±2.3×10−17 per year. Note that any present day null constraint on the time variation of alpha does not necessarily rule out time variation in the past. Indeed, some theories[37] that predict a variable fine-structure constant also predict that the value of the fine-structure constant should become practically fixed in its value once the universe enters its current dark energy-dominated epoch. In September 2010 researchers from Australia said they had identified a dipole-like structure in the fine-structure constant across the observable universe, using data on quasars obtained by the Very Large Telescope, combined with the previous data obtained by Webb at the Keck telescopes. The fine-structure constant appears to have been larger by one part in 100,000 in the direction of the southern hemisphere constellation Ara, 10 billion years ago. Similarly, the constant appeared to have been smaller by a similar fraction in the northern direction, billions of years ago.[38][39][40] In September and October 2010, after Webb's released research, physicists Chad Orzel and Sean M. Carroll suggested different approaches of how Webb's observations may be wrong. Orzel argues that the study may contain wrong data due to subtle differences in the two telescopes, in which one of the telescopes the data set was slightly high and on the other slightly low, so that they cancel each other out when they overlapped. He finds it suspicious that the triangles in the plotted graph of the quasars are so well-aligned (triangles, being the 3-omega of the data). On the other hand, Carroll suggested a totally different approach, he looks at the fine-structure constant as a scalar field and claims that if the telescopes are correct and the fine-structure constant varies smoothly over the universe, then the scalar field must have a very small mass. However, previous research has shown that the mass is not likely to be extremely small. Both of these scientists' early criticisms point to the fact that different techniques are needed to confirm or contradict the results, as Webb, et al., also concluded in their study.[41][42] In October 2011, Webb et al. reported[43] a variation in α dependent on both redshift and spatial direction. They report "the combined data set fits a spatial dipole" with an increase in α with redshift in one direction and a decrease in the other. "[I]ndependent VLT and Keck samples give consistent dipole directions and amplitudes...." TL;DR: So, the bottom line is that science does not just ASSUME that these constants do not vary, we continually look for evidence that they are either constant or evidence that they do vary with time and space.
