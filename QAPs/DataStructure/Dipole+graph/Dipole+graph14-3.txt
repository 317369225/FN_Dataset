Thermodynamics: Is there a maximum temperature?
Temperature  [math]T [/math]is defined by the relation [math]\frac{1}{T} = \frac{\partial S}{\partial E}[/math] where [math]E[/math] is the total energy of the system and [math]S[/math] is the entropy of the system.  There are two points to be made here. 1.   There is no maximum temperature, because entropy can be an arbitrary function of energy. 2.   Similarly, there is no "minimum temperature" in the sense that there are systems for which entropy decreases with increasing energy.   An example of a system that will give you both of the above phenomena is a set of atoms placed in a magnetic field, with each atom's magnetic dipole moment allowed to flip to either align/anti-align with the field.   If we assume that all configurations are equally likely (which we usually do), we will get a graph for entropy which looks sort of like an inverted U, maximal around zero energy.   Any physical realization of the system will find itself at negative energies, but in theory a system could exist at positive energy with negative temperature.  Negative temperature is actually "hotter" than a positive temperature, in the sense that if you connect this system to a system at a positive, finite temperature, heat will flow from the negative temperature system to the positive temperature one.
