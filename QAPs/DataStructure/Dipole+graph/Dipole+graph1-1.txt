Do I need to be good in physics to do well in computer science?
You might be thinking that just because of the fact that both are a subset of logic, which is something absolutely valid. However, there's a really important variable which is interest, it's a preference based on taste. Eventhough there is a correlation, ability in physics is not mutually exclusive to ability in computer science.
