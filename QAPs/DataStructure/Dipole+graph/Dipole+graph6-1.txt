What will the graph of induced EMF v/s Time look like?
Thanks for A2A. This is actually a tough question mathematically (not physics wise) and I have been trying to find an answer with enough simplifying assumptions, but have'nt managed to. I can give you a conceptual answer though. When a bar magnet falls through an air cored coil, the magnetic flux through the coil is changing. Magnetic flux is the product of the magnetic field through an area, and the area itself. Induced EMF is the rate of change of this magnetic flux with time. EMF = -dF/dt (here F is the flux) The minus sign is because the emf is induced to reduce the change in flux - so if it is increasing, the emf induced will be such that the magnetic flux due to the induced emf decreases the total change in magnetic flux. Now an area under the plot of this EMF vs time means we are integrating this equation. If you integrate the right side you will get the net change in flux due to this induced emf. So that is what the area under the graph depicts. Here are a few challenges I am facing for solving this exact case -: 1) The magnetic field of a bar magnet is not uniform in its immediate vicinity. 2) The coil can't be abstracted as infinitely long etc - the bar magnet is actually falling through it, so the flux in different turns of the coil will be different. 3) Flux in turns behind the magnet will be decreasing, while in those ahead of the magnet increasing An easier problem to solve would be to consider a bar magnet falling towards a coil from a great height. In this case the coil's own length can be neglected in comparison to the distance the bar magnet is from the coil. The magnet's field can be considered roughly uniform throughout the coil at a given instant, and then we can get a nice and easy result.
