Is God real?  Do you believe in god?  Why do we believe there is an almighty god in real world?  Why we regard the man lived in 1400 years ago, 2000 years ago, 2600 years ago as our belief?  (PS: I mean no discrimination, I just want to know what other people think this question)
Yes I definitely do. I don't believe in the popular concept of god as described in religion. To me god doesn't think like us, have emotions like us, god doesn't want for anything, god just is and is the foundations of the universe. Sometimes I don't like to see god as a being, god simply is the "majestic-ness" of the universe. Everything is god and god is everything.
