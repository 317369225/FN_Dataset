Do I need to be good in physics to do well in computer science?
Short answer:  No. Long answer:  Nnnnnnnooooooooooooo. Video of answer: Explanation of answer: I can show you places where you might need to be good at discrete mathematics (set theory, graph theory, predicate calculus, induction, proofs, etc.) to be good at computer science.  But I can't think of any examples where you need to figure out a Hamiltonian, compute a many-body attraction/repulsion problem, or even understand what electric dipole density even means to understand any computer science.  The physics is all abstracted away in the computer. Unless you want to run a physics simulation.  But in that case, you're probably not looking at CS, you're looking at physics.
