What is a simple, useful way of visualizing the magnetic moment of a system?
So your system is made up of a charge distribution [math]\rho(\vec r)[/math] and current distribution [math]\vec J(\vec r)[/math] confined to some finite volume. Zooming out, you can expand the electric and magnetic fields of the system in terms of a Multipole expansion, namely as the sum of the fields due to a monopole, a dipole, a quadrupole, and so on. In the case of a magnetic field, we don't know of any magnetic monopoles, so the first term of this expansion vanishes. Each additional term in the expansion suppressed by an additional factor of [math]1/r[/math], so if you look at most distributions from sufficiently far away, the fields looks like the field due a magnetic dipole moment - so let's talk about those. The magnetic dipole moment [math]\vec m[/math] of a system can be expressed in terms of the current distribution as: [math]\vec m = \frac12\int d^3\vec r\,' \vec r\,'\times\vec J(\vec r\,').[/math] If you're not used to the notation or doing those kinds of integrals, that might look like a lot of nonsense. But if you just consider a very small loop of wire enclosing an area [math]A[/math] with a current [math]I[/math] running around it, the magnitude of the magnetic moment of that system turns out to be [math]m = I A[/math]. So for most systems, you can imagine the leading magnetic moment to be due to an effective wire loop with current running through it. Each piece of the current density [math]\vec J(\vec r)[/math] of the system contributes to it, giving this effective distribution. Now that we have that out of the way, the best way to visualize the magnetic dipole moment is by graphing the field! So we've seen that if you look far enough away from a system - it just looks like a wire loop with the same magnetic moment [math] m = I A[/math], which gives you a way to think about the magnetic moment of the system. You can see this in almost any system; think about what you see when playing around with magnets and iron filings. See the similarity to the ideal dipole field as you start to get far from the magnet?
