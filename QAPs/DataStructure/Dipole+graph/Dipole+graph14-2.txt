Thermodynamics:Â Is there a maximum temperature?
The Planck temperature is a fundamental limit on temperature according to our understanding of quantum theory and general relativity. The magnitude of this temperature happens to be 1.4 * 10^32 K and was the temperature of the universe roughly 5.4 * 10^-44 seconds after the Big Bang. Note that, this limit is not owing to merely relativistic velocity limits on the molecules. The kinetic energy of matter increases with temperature, and this does not necessarily have to always go into 'velocities'. The masses too increase. Planck limits can be derived from the Planck mass, a measure at which both the quantum mechanical Compton wavelength and relativistic Schwarzschild radius meet. It is possible that this is not an actual limit on temperature because we do not understand what happens at values of T greater than the Planck temperature. Our most successful theories run into singularities in that zone. So, this is really something that can only be answered by a successful quantum gravity theory.
