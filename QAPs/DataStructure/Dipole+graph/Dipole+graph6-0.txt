What will the graph of induced EMF v/s Time look like?
Assume that the bar magnet has an magnetic dipole strength equal to m. Assuming the coil and bar magnet cross-sectional areas to be small, it can be said that all the magnetic field is the case of axial magnetic field due to a dipole. Follow the rest in the image: And hence suitable blessings from the benevolent almighty gods of physics can be achieved.
