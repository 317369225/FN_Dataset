How would you define polar and nonpolar?
You have to look at the molecule's dipole moment. Bonds are considered polar when the atoms bonded are more than or equal to .5 electromagnetivity units apart. More than 1.5 electromagnetivity units and now a bond is ionic. The only tricky part to this is that you have to take into account molecular dipole moment symmetry. For instance, CO2 has polar bonds, but because of the molecular symmetry of the dipole moment, it is actually a non polar molecule. Check an electro negativity chart from google if you want to calculate the electromagnetivity differences.
