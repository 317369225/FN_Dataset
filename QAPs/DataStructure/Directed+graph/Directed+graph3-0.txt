How can I traverse a directed graph that does not fit into memory?
The answer to this question depends a lot on exactly how "not fitting" the graph is.  From your question presumably the edges don't fit, but perhaps the vertices do?  There's also the question of what you want the traversal to accomplish: Find a path from vertex s to vertex t?  Topological sort? Find the strongly connected components? As just one example, for the extreme case of having almost no memory at all and wanting to find a path from vertex s to vertex t, Savich's Theorem ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sav... ) gives an algorithm that requires only O(log^2 n) memory for an n vertex ...
