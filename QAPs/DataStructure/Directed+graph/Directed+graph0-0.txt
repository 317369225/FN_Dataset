Discrete Mathematics: What are directed graphs?
A directed graph is set of things connected together by a set of connections, where each connection goes 'from' one thing 'to' another thing (ie it has direction). The Twitter network is a good example of a directed graph. There is a set of people and a set of connections between the people, where the connections are all of the form "X follows Y". Y can also 'follow' X, and this is a separate connection, as it goes in a different direction. The 'things' are normally called 'vertices' or 'nodes', and the connections are normally called 'edges' or 'arcs'. Non-directed graphs can be thought of as a special case of directed graphs, where any edge from X to Y is present if and only if the edge from Y to X is also present. 649 Views Â· 2 Upvotes
