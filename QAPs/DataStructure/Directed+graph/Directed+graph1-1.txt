How do I detect a cycle in a directed graph?
As explained by Shashi, a depth-first search (DFS) is a solution ; however, be sure that you apply your DFS on the connected component in which would be said-cycle. For example, if your graph consists of a cycle + an isolated vertex, you don’t want to apply your DFS starting from the isolated vertex… But which vertex would you choose if your graph isn’t connected ? A brutal solution is to try each vertex. However, that would greatly increase complexity, especially in the case of an already connected graph. The solution is to mark every vertex you visit during DFS, and to apply your DFS only be... (more)
