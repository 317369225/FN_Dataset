How do I count the number of cycles in a directed graph?
Number of cycles in a directed graph is the number of connected components in it, which can be found in multiple ways. One of the ways is create adjacency matrix of the graph given. maintain a counter num_of_connected_components to store the number of cycles in the graph. maintain an array of boolean(ARR) to store traversal status of vertices of the graph. TRUE-traversed, FALSE- untraversed. start DFS from any vertex V whose ARR value is false(not yet traversed) and maintain temporary list of vertices traversed for V and if you encounter the same vertex V again in DFS then that means its a cyc...
