How can I implement a weighted directed graph in C++ or Java using object-oriented programming?
You can implement Weighted Directed Graph in any language through adjacency matrix or adjacency list data structures. For adjacency matrix use 2-d array : For n vertices graph take 2-d array of size n*n in which each element will contain weight for edge joining the vertices represented by corresponding indices. For adjacency list maintain a list of vertices. Each vertex node in the list will maintain the list for the edges originating from them. Each edge node of a particular source vertex will also contain their corresponding weight and the address of destination vertex node. Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.
