What graph theory problems are tractable for undirected graphs and intractable for directed graphs?
I can’t think of any problem that would be polynomial for undirected graphs, and NP-complete for directed graph. However, the minimum spanning tree problem is way harder to code in directed case (see Edmonds' algorithm).But still they have same complexity. But I have something more interesting: an example in which complexities and easiness to code greatly differ, but it’s the directed case which is easier: Suppose I give you a weighted graph, two vertices s and t, and ask you for the shortest path between s and t? Think two seconds, and then you should exclaim: «Easy, it’s Dijkstra’s algorithm... (more)
