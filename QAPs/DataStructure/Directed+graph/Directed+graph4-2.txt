Where can I find a directed graph data structure library, implemented in Javascript?
I would recommend using Graphology to implement your Directed Graph. Documentation is great and seems very robust. From their site: graphology is a specification and reference implementation for a robust & multipurpose JavaScript Graph object. It aims at supporting various kinds of graphs with the same unified interface. A graphology graph can therefore be directed, undirected or mixed and can be simple or support parallel edges. Along with those specifications, one will also find a standard library full of graph theory algorithms and common utilities such as graph generators, layouts etc. 305 Views Â· 11 Upvotes
