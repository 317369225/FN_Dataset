How can I implement a weighted directed graph in C++ or Java using object-oriented programming?
Well to form it in a proper object oriented way i would make a class of edge which would contain the nodes it connects and its weight, another class of node which contains a list of edges(going in or coming out from that node). Lastly i would make a class of graph which would contain list of nodes it connects. Its a most rudimentary implementation details of implementation would vary depending on what queries are made.Â  I have added a method for breadth-first search just to illustrate. class Edge{ int source,destination,weight; Edge(int s,int d,int w){ source=s; destination=d; weight=w...
