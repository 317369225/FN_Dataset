Where can I find a directed graph data structure library, implemented in Javascript?
The details for the question are not entirely specific, but I will try to answer. The best way to hold a directed graph is either an adjacency list, an adjacency matrix, or an edge list. We will use the below graph as an example: (Source: File:Directed acyclic graph 2.svg) Adjacency list: For every node, an array holds the neighbors of that node. In a directed graph, it would just be all the nodes that are adjacent to the current node (pointing from current to adjacent). For the above graph the adjacency list would look like the following: Node -- [Its Neighbors] 2: [ ]... (more)
