Where can I find a directed graph data structure library, implemented in Javascript?
All I've found so far is https://github.com/chenglou/data....Â  The library seems to support directed graphs, but lacks many of the things that you might expect, like functions to navigate the graph. Have you found anything better? I'm looking for something that can tell me edge-types (cross, tree, forward, back) based on graph traversal. 1.6k Views
