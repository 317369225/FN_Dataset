Should the USA tax its nonresident citizens on their world-wide income as they now do, a practice which no other OECD nation engages in?
Edit:  I interpreted an earlier version of this question as being about taxing US citizens on income from investments from abroad.  The first two parts of the answer still apply to the question in its 2012-Apr-19 form.  The third takes on new meaning.  So I'm leaving the answer unchanged. No. I offer two reasons that are pretty obvious and one that may be less obvious. The money you earn is yours, not mine, not society's, not the government's. I won't argue here with social contract, mutual advantages, impracticality of anarchy and other justifications for taxes. But all that has to be limited. Money made in other countries didn't benefit from interstate highways, US courts, or a workforce educated in our public schools. The justifications for US taxation don't apply. And, wherever else you make your money, they'll tax it there. Taxing it here too is double taxation and extra unjust. Letting US citizens invest their money abroad provides a good "performance review" for the government and the economy. Perhaps this will stop CEOs from justifying big bonuses with, "it could have been worse if I wasn't here." Perhaps it will stop politicians from endlessly debating instead of solving problems. If not, a slow, continuous outflow of investment is less damaging that than ... nothing ... nothing ... and then everyone scrambling for the exits at once.
