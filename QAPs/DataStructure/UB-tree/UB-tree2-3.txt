What are some good places to visit near Bangalore for about a week?
Rent a bike and go on a bike trip to Mysore > Ooty or Madikeri. It's a fun 600km ride. Takes 10 - 12 hours to go there and then the same to come back. Perfect for a weekend. Infact, group of my friends did it last weekend. Chill maaadi! :D
