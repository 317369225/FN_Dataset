Why is the United States the only country that taxes its non-resident citizens on income that they make in other countries?
Add Spain to the list: You now have two countries. And there are many others, I'm sure. [EDIT] As you can read in the comments section I was kindly corrected by David S. Lesperance, who rightly pointed out that Spain taxes its residents, not its citizens. Thank you, David!
