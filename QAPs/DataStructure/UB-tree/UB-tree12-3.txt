What is it like to live in Bengaluru?
I am from the US and I lived in Bangalore for two months in the summer of 2011. I loved the great weather (summer in most other cities in India is unbearable for someone from California) and amazing South Indian food. There is a good nightlife scene, but it starts and ends early (compared to the US and Europe). I don't know much about housing since I lived in corporate housing, but transportation options within the city were not great, my colleagues and I relied mostly on transportation arranged by our company. Bangalore is a great city if you plan to travel to other cities in India, it's a central transport hub for long-distance buses and the transportation options for traveling to other cities in South India are very convenient.
