What is the best less crowded place to hangout in Bangalore?
HERE ARE SOME SUGGESTIONS & MY PERSONAL CHOICES. 1. Lal Bagh. A bench by the lakeside can take you back into tranquil times. 2. Cubbon Park 3. A stroll around Sankey Tank, Sadashivnagar. 4. City Central Library 5. Tipu Sultan's Palace and the adjoining temple. 6. The lawns inside the gateway of the old Bangalore Fort. Coffee on Canvas,Kormangala(behind oasis mall)
