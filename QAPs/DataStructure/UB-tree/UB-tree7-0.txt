Which is the best place to visit in Bangalore?
Skyye In addition to Raj Mahendra's comprehensive answer - I would recommend going to Skyye. It is the highest place to be in Bangalore. More specifically, it is located on the 16th top-most floor of UB City Mall in Richmond Town. You can oversee the entire city from here. A magnificent view - especially - at night. ​ There is an oval bar with a bright and shiny dance floor outdoors. The DJ's cock-pit is indoors - well situated above the main floor. Tables and half-circular-shaped sofas are present all over the place. ​ ​ The place is crowded. And loud. And there is a cover charge of 3000 Rs. It is not the place you go to everyday - but definitely a place you shouldn't miss out on. Especially for people with a penchant for fancy colors and parties. A once in-a-lifetime experience. Go for it! :) For further reading: Skyye Lounge in UB City is the Height Of Bangalore Nightlife.
