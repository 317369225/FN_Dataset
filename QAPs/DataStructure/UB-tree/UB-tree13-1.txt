What is the argument for a residential or territorial tax system, as opposed to a citizenship-based tax system?
I think the primary argument is that a residential or territorial tax system would be consistent with the tax system in most of the countries of the world and given the ease with which  technology and worldwide infrastructure allows a great number of jobs to be performed from anywhere in the world it is a dis-incentive to an economy for a country to tax citizens and residents on worldwide income and creates an economic competitive disadvantage for a country with such tax policies. My personal opinion is that is probably a pretty good argument for just about every country in the world except the US.  Think of countries like businesses who are competing to get you to buy their product, which in this case means participate in their economy and pay them taxes.  If your company has the most desirable product by far, then you can command a much higher price and thus higher margin because customers want to buy your product regardless of price. The US already has the largest worldwide economy by far and is in a situation where non-residents are still scrambling for the opportunity to participate in that economy even if it means paying additional taxes.  I have no doubt that as worldwide economies, technology and infrastructure change, there may come a time when the US has to rethink its worldwide tax policies in order to remain economically competitive with other nations, but until the current situation changes, the US government is better off to maximize its tax revenue stream, just because it can.
