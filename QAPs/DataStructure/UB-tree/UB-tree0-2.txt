What are the data structures used in data warehouse? In what way, they differ from data structures used in relational database?
First of all you are comparing an elephant with horse. There is a big difference between Data warehousing and relational database. Data Warehousing is nothing but a mechanism to store historical organisational data under a unified schema at a single site. Data warehousing has broadly two categories. one is ETL and the other one is reporting. Relational databases are the container to store data warehouse.
