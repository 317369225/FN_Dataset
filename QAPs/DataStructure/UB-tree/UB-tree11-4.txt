Should the USA tax its nonresident citizens on their world-wide income as they now do, a practice which no other OECD nation engages in?
All of the answers are wonderful and I'm sure some of the responders are expats as well. I have another answer to add to the pile just from personal experience. That answer would be "no"; in short, I received very little value from the US or State government for my time overseas. Someone could argue that I had the benefit of the embassies/consulates during that time. Let's talk about that. I needed to get some items notarised to take affect in the US so my only recourse was to go to the Embassy and pay $30 a page. Let's just say I was glad I didn't do a real estate transaction! That fee is outrageous when compared to my bank notarising my documents for free, and other places may charge a few dollars. Someone had shared that they asked the Embassy staff to waive the fees or reduce them. The issue was brought to a supervisor who indignantly replied, "how do you think embassy operations are paid for?" My response would have been: uhhhh from taxes that we expats have to pay? Also though I can't totally claim no taxation without representation, who does represent expats? We don't have Congressmen as they represent Congressional Districts stateside. So who represents expats, The Embassy? yikes!
