Will companies like Wealthfront and Betterment replace private wealth management divisions at places like UBS, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, etc.?
Wealth management and private banking are the wrong comparison both on (1) the product set and (2) the target client. JPM and Goldman have an investment product set and servicing organization helping folks in the high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth markets. They focus on advice, and deliver deep solutions. The true value of those solutions is debatable, but the current perception and stickiness are very strong. Betterment/Wealthfront focus on the retail and mass affluent market segment, and provide a customizable asset management product (rather than advice or service) that is strictly better than target date retirement funds. The right question, in my view, is whether they will replace Vanguard, Merrill, Fidelity asset management products. The answer is yes, subject to Betterment/Wealthfront ability to build a consumer brand. That exercise, though not impossible (see Lending Tree, ING Direct), costs about $100 million.
