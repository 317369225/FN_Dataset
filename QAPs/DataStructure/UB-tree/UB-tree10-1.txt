Which is the best one line poem ever?
"Darkness is a poem Inexplicable" This is a rough translation of a one line poem in South Indian language Malayalam by Balachandran Chullikadu. Darkness; It is the absence of light or is it the other way around? It seems to be the only thing constant in our lives.The one true invariable. Light shines for a day and then fades away leaving us to seek rest and solace in darkness. Quoting Jim Morrison "I  don't remember being born, It might have happened during one of my blackouts" , we see we were born out of darkness into the light of life and when  the life burns out we return to darkness and annihilates its depth. Every day we seek sleep in the dark,we slide into darkness, still no one has  ever met their sleep. We cherish moments but memories fades away into the depths of our minds. Everyone has a hollowness corner in their hearts that never gets filled. We are made of little pieces of light and darkness. The very universe was once made of darkness untill there was light and will dissolve into the darkness to be born into the light again.
