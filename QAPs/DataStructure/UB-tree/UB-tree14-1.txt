Why isn't the Bible being updated?
I think the question may be based on a false premise of sorts: Multiple translations is usually the best check on accuracy and/or translation, which you can do currently. There are multiple great translations to the Bible already in existence. To me the issue of macro-understandings are more important than the micro problems--plus they help us understand those issues in better context. Bible translators and publishers are in some sense always working on this task. Translations into other languages and Bibles that are adapted to specific audiences, and Bibles that provide historical and thematic context are perhaps being created more so than new translations. * In some ways the generality of the question makes it difficult to answer IMHO.
