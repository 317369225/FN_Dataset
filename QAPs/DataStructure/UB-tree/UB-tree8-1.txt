How does the Theros block work in Magic: The Gathering?
This question is a bit open ended. From what I've seen so far, the most popular mechanic is devotion, which works in two ways. There are creatures called gods which need a set amount of devotion to be creatures, otherwise they are just enchantments. Side note, devotion is the sum total of all mana symbols found in all permanents' mana costs you control. There is a secondary way which devotion uses, based on an enters the battlefield trigger on all the devotion creatures, this ranges from gaining life to making your opponents lose life. After that, there is constellation, heroic, and inspired. Constellation seems to be the mechanic that will dominate post rotation as it has a solid deck already playing mostly post rotation cards. Devotion may gain popularity due to the rotation of the shock lands. Making for an interesting new meta in standard. As a block, Theros plays extremely diversely - everything from sealed to standard has been severely diversified, giving us perhaps the most diverse meta in magic for quite some time.
