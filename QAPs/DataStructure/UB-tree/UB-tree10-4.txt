Which is the best one line poem ever?
हजारो मिठाइयाँ चखी है ज़माने में, ख़ुशी के आँसु से मिठा,कुछ भी नहीं Nothing is sweeter than the tears of happiness. किसी पेड़ के कटने का किस्सा न होता, अगर कुल्हाड़ी वे पिछे उसीका हिस्सा न होता. Which literally means: There would not have been any case of a tree being cut down,if the Axe did not have a part of the tree. A different meaning to this is we mostly are the reason for our own downfall or our people's downfall.
