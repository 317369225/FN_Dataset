What is it like to live in Bengaluru?
It is just plain awesome to live in the beautiful city of Bengaluru! Once considered a Pensioner's paradise, it has metamorphosed into a bustling metropolis, with a vibrant night life that blends in with a rich cultural heritage. From a long walk in Cubbon Park to hundreds of cafes, from trails of trees everywhere to the amazing weather, you canâ€™t help falling in love with the city.

SoBa (South Bangalore ;-)) is foodie heaven, which some else might say is true for the rest of the city as well! 2. Weather People say Pune comes a close second to Bangalore in terms of pleasantness of weather. As a friend once said, "Bangalore hit the jackpot when it came to the weather"! Though with the number of cars increasing on the road, don't expect that distinction to last too long for either Bangalore or Pune. 3. Weekend Getaways Mysore/Ooty in 3 hours, Bylakuppe (largest Tibetan settlement outside Tibet and a massive Golden Temple) in 4 hours, Coorg in 5 hours, Chikmagalur in 6 hours, Hampi in 7 hours, Pondicherry in 7 hours. Don't have a vehicle of your own? No need to sweat it 'coz KSRTC is one of the best state bus services in the country. 4.Bookstores No, am not talking about Crossword and other branded book retailers. MG Road has a number of small time book stores where you get all kinds of literary dope you can think of! Even during the age of e-com, these book stores have managed to carve out a set of loyal customers and readers! Source: 11 Reasons Why Bangalore Is Awesome.
