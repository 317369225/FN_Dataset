Will companies like Wealthfront and Betterment replace private wealth management divisions at places like UBS, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, etc.?
Automated investment management will affect the WM units at major banks in several ways, but startup robo-advisors like Betterment, Wealthfront or FutureAdvisor won't necessarily replace them. Joseph Wang correctly cites one reason for that. Traditional wealth management and financial advice has typically targeted wealthier individuals than those served by robo-advisors. In fact, robo-advisors exist because *nobody* was giving people with less than half a million dollars good advice. That is, about 85% of US households were unserved, underserved or straight up getting burned by charlatans. That's the group of investors robo-advisors are working with first. But likely any disruptive business, they start with the market that the traditional players won't touch, and they'll move upmarket from there. Robos will get more and more sophisticated, fulfilling more and more complex needs, as time goes by. And this will affect the WM units at major banks. That said, the robo-advisors operating now, and the technology they use, are two different things. Major banks, if they are smart, are actively trying to incorporate automated investment management technology into their businesses. That would effectively build a ladder to increase the wealth of their mass-affluent clients until they qualify for the private bank. Big banks can access that technology in three ways: 1) Partnering with a current robo 2) Buying a robo 3) Building their own robo in house. Watch the market. You'll see all three things happen several times in the next few years.
