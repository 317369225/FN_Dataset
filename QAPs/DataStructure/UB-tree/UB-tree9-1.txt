Why is the United States the only country that taxes its non-resident citizens on income that they make in other countries?
Coal mining companies, sugar farmers, banks,  oil refiners, tech companies, etc., all have organizations that lobby for laws and regulations, including tax breaks, that benefit them.  So, not surprisingly, they are taken care of by politicians. What organizations lobby for the interests of expat Americans?  In what way are they organized as a voting bloc?   In what state do they have enough concentration to interest a candidate? That is your answer.   Taxation is predation.
