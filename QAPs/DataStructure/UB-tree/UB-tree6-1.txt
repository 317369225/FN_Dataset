What is the best less crowded place to hangout in Bangalore?
If you love nature, go to Hessaraghatta grass lands. You can sit there with friends, talk, sit, play ,sleep. There are no eateries or facilities over there, so if you are looking for some food you won't get it there. However the ambience is awesome. It's around 30 Kms from the city.
