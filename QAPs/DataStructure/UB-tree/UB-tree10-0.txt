Which is the best one line poem ever?
Note: The answer gonna be long, but worth reading, worth your time... Read only the poems,unless required,or if your are an avid reader or you will get bored in the mid-way, and my effort would remain unseen, or half-seen :D Some poem, you may not appreciate, skip, there are many poems, worth reading, for your life, for your day-do-day conversation, and for moral-education. You would definitely not want to miss those. For those who don't understand Hindi, there's an English translated version too, some may not be that good for the poem. There's a short explanation too, in English. ___________________________________________ Searching for Evil Bura Jo Dekhan Me Chala, Bura Naa Milya Koye Jo Munn Khoja Apnaa, To Mujhse Bura Naa Koye Translation I went on the search for the bad guy, bad but couldn't find any When I searched my mind, then no one is as bad as me Meaning This doha<Doha means a two line poem, in hindi> is about observing ones own mind. Kabir says that he searched the world for the bad guy, the real evil person reponsile for all the pain and suffering in the worrld, But he couldn't find the evil person no matter where he looked. Then he looked at and critically examined his own mind, his own thinking process. There he found the real evil thing that lived hidden inside, and grew unchecked. All evil is caused by thinking, which is the action of the unobserved mind. When we accuse and condemn another, it is our mind that is doing the finger pointing, the other person is probably innocent or the victim of his circumstances. Were we to inhabit the condemned persons body, live his life, have his life conditioning, then we too would behave and act the same. ___________________________________________ Kabir Washes Clean His Mind Kabir Man Nirmal Bhaya, Jaise Ganga Neer Pache Pache Har Phire, Kahat Kabir Kabir Translation Kabir Washed His Mind Clean, Like The Holy Ganges River Everyone follows behind, Saying Kabir, Kabir Meaning Kabir washed and cleaned his own mind, like the holy Ganges. That is, he removed all impurities from his mind, from his thinking process, this letting the true light of divinity to shine forth. Then everyone follows him whereever he goes, calling his name: Kabir, Kabir from behind him.

Meaning Do the work that needs to be done now. There is no other time then now. ______________________________________________ Speak such Speech Aisee Vani Boliye, Mun Ka Aapa Khoye Apna Tan Sheetal Kare, Auran Ko Sukh Hoye Translation Speak such words, you lose the minds Ego Body remains composed, Others Find Peace Meaning In speech use such words that your ego is eliminated. Don't brag, don't gloat, don't make yourself out to be big, important, rich or anything else that the ego attaches to. Building the Ego takes energy from the body, takes away the bodies composure. If ego is lost in ones speech, the listener finds peace from listening to it. _______________________________________________ Be Slow, O Mind Dheere Dheere Re Mana, Dheere Sub Kutch Hoye Mali Seenche So Ghara, Ritu Aaye Phal Hoye Translation Be Slow O mind, Slowly everything happens Gardner may water garden a hundred times, When the Season comes, there is fruit Meaning Kabir tells his mind to slow down, everything in life happens slowly, in its own time. The fruit only comes when the season comes, so will the fruit of life come in its own time. ___________________________________________ God Grant Such Wealth Sayeen Itna Deejiye, Ja Mein Kutumb Samaye Main Bhi Bhookha Na Rahun, Sadhu Na Bhookha Jaye Translation God, give me so, so much wealth, that my community is fed I don't remain hungry, the Sadhu does not go hungry Meaning In this doha, Kabir asks God for wealth in abundance - that his community is fed, he does not starve and the visiting Sadhu (holy man) does not go hungry. For him, true wealth is in these simple things, the gift of life, aily sustenence for the community and that the sadhu does not go hungry. Kabir does not ask for a mansion, a Mercedes benz, a colour TV or millions in a swiss bank account, what real use are they to him? ____________________________________________ If Your Big So What? Bada Hua To Kya Hua, Jaise Ped Khajoor Panthi Ko Chaya Nahin, Phal Laage Atidoor Translation If You are Big so what? Just like a date tree No shade for travelers, fruit is hard to reach Meaning Being bid, important, powerful, wealthy is of no consequence. Kabir likens this to a tall date tree whose fruit is out reach, and which does not give shade to the traveller. _____________________________________________ As Oil is in the Seed Jaise Til Mein Tel Hai, Jyon Chakmak Mein Aag Tera Sayeen Tujh Mein Hai, Tu Jaag Sake To Jaag Translation Like the Oil is inside the Seed, Just as the Fire is Inside the Flint Stone Your God is Inside You, If you have the Power to Wake Up, then Wake Up Meaning God is within, like the oil inside the seed, and the flint stones have the potential for fire inside them. If you can realize this, then awaken and arise. It is said as challenge - if you have the power to wake up. ____________________________________________ Begging is like Dying Mangan Maran Saman Hai, Mat Koi Mange Beekh Mangan Se Marna Bhala, Yeh Satguru Ki Seekh Translation Begging is like dying, Let no one Beg It is better to die than beg, this is the SatGuru's Message Meaning Don't beg - give that you may receive. Give time, give some service, give friendship, give love - don't beg. ___________________________________________ Maya Mari na Mun Mara Maya Mari Na Mun Mara, Mar Mar Gaye Shareer Asha Trishna Na Mari, Keh Gaye Das Kabir Translation Neither Maya Died, Nor the Mind Died, Die and die again People/Bodies Hope and delusion have not died, so said Das Kabir and left Meaning One of Kabir most meaningful doha's for me. Kabir observes the world from within, and sees the world as Maya - illusion. It is projected by Mun, the mind, the collective mind. Shareer refers to the living body or living person. Shareer's die and die again. There is hope that this will end, that there will be the emergence of a new Shareer that will wake up, and then Maya and Mun will instead die. _____________________________________________ Kabira Stands in the Market Place Kabira Khara Bazaar Mein, Mange Sabki Khair Na Kahu Se Dosti, Na Kahu Se Bair Translation Kabira Stands in the market place, Asks for everyone's prosperity Neither special friendship nor enmity for anyone Meaning In the market place, Kabor wishes goodwill to all. _________________________________________________________________ Studying Books the World has Died Pothi Padh Padh Kar Jag Mua, Pandit Bhayo Na Koye Dhai Aakhar Prem Ke, Jo Padhe so Pandit Hoye Translation Reading Books and Scriptures everyone died, No one became Pandit Two and Half Words of Love, Who ever reads, Pandit he becomes Meaning Forget about book learning, no mater how many books you read, you won't become wise, you won't became the true Pundit. Just a few words of love and you'll become Pundit. Try it. ____________________________________________ In Sorrow all Pray Dukh Mein Simran Sab Kare, Sukh Mein Kare Na Koye Jo Sukh Mein Simran Kare, Tau Dukh Kahe Ko Hoye Translation While Suffering everyone Prays and Remembers Him, in joy no one does If one prays and remembers Him in happiness, why would sorrow come?

If you did that during your happy times, then you will not experience suffering because there woud be no need for it. ______________________________________________ Guru the Wash Man Gur Dhobi Sikh Kapda, Saboo Sirjan Har Surti Sila Pur Dhoiye, Nikse Jyoti Apaar Translation Guru is the wash man, Sikh is the cloth , God the soap Wash the mind thoroughly clean, Out Comes The Glow of Truth Meaning Life is process of cleansing - hence this site, which is about Mind and Body Cleansing. ____________________________________________ Alive one Sees Jeevat Samjhe Jeevat Bujhe, Jeevat He Karo Aas Jeevat Karam Ki Fansi Na Kaati, Mue Mukti Ki Aas Translation Alive one sees, alive one knows, find your liberation while alive If Alive you do not cut the noose of your attachments , how will there be liberation with death?

This is the story of life - the lovers meeting, separating, the pangs of love and the urge for union and the eventual union.

Meaning When we see ourselves as individuals, there is the concept of "I". This is in duality - that is, there is me, you, him, this computer, that sofa, this hand, that chair. When we see beyond the duality, where "I" no longer exists, then only God exists, and I don't. The word Hari comes from the Hindi Her, meaning every (everyone, everything), and is a reference to God. The mantra Hari Ohm, literally means God, God, or everywhere God. So, before duality, God was and I was not. Now in duality, I am, and God is not seen. This darkness dissolves when I see that God is within me. Then I realize that "I" don't exist as my mind would have me believe that I do.

The Mind controls the 'sensual five', the five senses of sight, sound, touch, smell and taste These five senses and the mind that interprets the vibrations that the senses deliver to the brain, they all tell us lies. The mind and the five sesnses tell us that duality exists, though in truth it does not. Like a dream, everything around us does not exist - only God exists, everything else is part of duality. _____________________________________________ Although the question was 1-liner, i have included all the short 2-liner doha(poem).
