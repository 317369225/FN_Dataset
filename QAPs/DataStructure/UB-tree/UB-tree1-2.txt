Which are the best places for breakfast in Bangalore?
I am new to Bangalore, as a north Indian who drools over South Indian food, during my initial days here, I set off searching for places that serve the best South Indian breakfast in the city. I liked the concept of Darshinis' which I think is particular to this part of the country.  Out of many places I tasted food I loved this place in Jayanagar area:  Taaza Thindi (Taaza Thindi - Bangalore) It is 10 minute walk away from Bangalore Central Mall(a major landmark in the city). Like most breakfast joints it opens at 7 am sharp. If you are someone who loves walking you would love to take an early morning walk to this place through the treelined lush green neighbourhood. It's not surprising to see people from all strata of the society coming up every morning to this small picturesque joint. Talking of food there, it is delicious, healthy and cooked and served in an environment with insane emphasis on hygiene. It is the most hygienic place I have ever eaten. (Sorry I couldn't find a better image) The prices are jaw dropping low, like 20 rupees for a dosa, 15 rupees for a idly/vada. The food is very tasty, healthy and nutritious. The place opened somewhere around July last year, it is slowly gaining popularity among the people of Bangalore. If you like to have authentic south indian breakfast, visit this place, savour the food and thank me later. Updated 46w ago • View Upvotes
