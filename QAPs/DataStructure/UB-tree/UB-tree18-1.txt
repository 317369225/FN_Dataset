Should I buy gold?
No, you shouldn't buy gold. I would disagree with Jack C Crawford here, as precisely the stable nature of gold, plus its uselessness as a commodity, makes investing in it a zero-sum game — someone must lose in order for you to win. Michael Grammas is right on the spot here — you have a better chance chasing coins now, but if you're not an investor by the mindshare, I would suggest safer alternatives for investing your hard-earned resources.
