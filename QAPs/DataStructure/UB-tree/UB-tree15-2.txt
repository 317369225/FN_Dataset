What is the likelihood that the US will change their tax law to not tax foreign residents?
It seems very unlikely. And it's unfortunate. It makes it very difficult for American expatriates and dual-citizens abroad. It hinders international commerce fostered by expatriate entrepreneurism. It would require organization of a significant lobbying effort to do so, with substantial backing. IMHO the best plan would be to propose a reasonable alternative. An example of a reasonable alternative, IMHO, is to allow U.S. citizens to renounce residency, but not citizenship. Same tax situation as renouncing citizenship (exit tax, then taxed as non-resident alien), however instead of losing your passport you exchange your passport for a U.S. non-resident passport, and may then only visit the U.S. for 60 days/year. Perhaps you must already be a non-resident for tax purpose (see substantial presence test) before you become eligible to renounce residency; and perhaps you will have to back-file and pay taxes for some previous years if you ever regain residency (by choice of by overstaying the 60 day limit). Americans should not be forced into a situation whereby they feel compelled to give up their birthright because of the financial and regulatory burdens. This is a much more reasonable alternative step.
