Should I buy gold?
No. You shouldnt buy gold. Most of the money to be made in gold has already been made. You have a better chance at this point investing in rare coins because when the gold and silver prices settle back down and we have a better understanding of what was melted in this most recent price spike what is rare will become rarer...
