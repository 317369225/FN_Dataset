What is the likelihood that the US will change their tax law to not tax foreign residents?
Almost none. Despite estimates of 4-6 million Americans living abroad, we have no effective representation in Congress to advocate our case (like our Members back home, whom we vote for as absentees, give a damn). Moreover, and perhaps most importantly, as long as populist sentiments run strongly against wealthy Americans using offshore accounts to mask their wealth, we're all going to be lumped in the category of potential tax dodgers (even if we're not anywhere close to wealthy enough to be able to dream of such a luxury) and so required to report in to the Motherland. Basically, the folks back home would tell us that we knew the stakes when we chose to leave, so we shouldn't change the rules now. As for renouncing your citizenship altogether, I think that's a much heavier decision that requires more careful consideration than just your tax burden. Keep in mind that there's an exit fee to boot, currently $2,350.
