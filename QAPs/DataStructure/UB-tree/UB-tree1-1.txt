Which are the best places for breakfast in Bangalore?
Depending on the budget you get ample choice of English Breakfast places in Bangalore. Below are 3 of my favourites: 1) ITC Windsor Manor - Raj Pavillion: Budget: Rs. 1000 If you are in a mood for a lavish breakfast buffet, this is a great option. There are similar buffets available in Leela and Taj Westend. 2) Nandhana Grand Hotel - Koramangla: Budget: Rs. 300 As I stayed in Koramangla, this hotel became really a favorite breakfast place for me. Initially, they started their buffet at Rs. 75/person and we used to wait for Saturday's to hog on the food. Then they doubled it to Rs. 150 and the rush didn't go down... I hear these days it's around Rs. 300, but still, I just love the place! 3) Koshy's at St. Marks Road, Budget: Rs. 200 This is like an all time favourite place. Though, let me warn you, you need to be patient as it's crowded many times and service suffers due to that. 4) South Indies - Indira Nagar - South Indian Breakfast Buffet: Budget Rs. 500 This, though away from topic, but is a fantastic place to have a breakfast buffet with south Indian delicacies.
