Will companies like Wealthfront and Betterment replace private wealth management divisions at places like UBS, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, etc.?
No.  Different clientele.  Wealthfront and Betterment are aimed at the upper middle class or lower upper class (i.e. the mass affluent).  This is a different group of people than private wealth management services.  People that go for private wealth management want personal service and want discretion, and they aren't going to fill out a web page.  They have enough money so that they will tell you what they want, and you will fill out any forms for them. I do think that UBS, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan are under serious threat but from another direction.  A version of Wealthfront or Betterment that is a B2B solution rather than a B2C solution would allow a well connected broker with private clients to work directly for private wealth manager.  So rather than going to a private bank, a rich person or family could hire a few people that would use technology to create their own bank, and interact directly with the markets.
