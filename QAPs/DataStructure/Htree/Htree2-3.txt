What can I learn/know right now in 10 minutes that will be useful for the rest of my life?
Let me tell you about a website known as http://www.gapminder.org It is non-profit venture and modern museum. This site gives to access to all data and statistics about any topic you want for example average age of marriage in the world, HIV infected population, literacy rates, etc . You are allowed to download this data moreover the best part is the visualize option the website provides.Now this visualize option is something I have seen nowhere. What it does is it shows you a graph of any country or countries you want and compares data on X and Y axis ( you determining the parameters on the axes ) from 100 years ago or moreÂ  depending from when was the data available. This feature is so influencing that immediately you are able to visualize all the facts and statistics without straining your brain. You are able to clearly see patterns which won't be possible without this feature. Such an open source of statistics and data can be useful in many projects,presentations, etc to make points or convince people about something and finding all this data in one place and you can download it too not costing you a penny is something incredible and a great effort by Hans Rosling the founder of this project.
