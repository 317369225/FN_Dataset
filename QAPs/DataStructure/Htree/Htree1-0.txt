How does the file lookup on a Linux system work?
As Vivek's stated ... most (if not all) FSs have a very good indexing system, if not it's either a very old or extremely simple FS. However, that's just the situation of using a path to a specific file inside a directory containing lots of files. E.g. typing a path at the CLI console or directly into a program's open dialog. What happens when you're browsing for a file in a GUI dialog/window? Where you do find slowdowns due to large numbers of files is nothing to do with the FS or OS - it's due to the program you use to view the file listing. If that program displays all files at once it's going to be affected drastically and use lots of RAM when displaying a folder containing such large numbers of files. If it shows only a page at a time then it would respond quicker and use much less, but it may mean a slight delay each time the list is scrolled (as it needs to read the next set of filenames). This previous situation could be made quicker or slowed down depending on the indexing strategy the FS uses. E.g. if the index uses some sorting system, then the file display tool might make use of such when retrieving the list by only taking X number of files from it. If the index uses some hashing the list would be random and thus to display any sort of sorted order all filenames need to be retrieved and then sorted.
