Is the time complexity for finding a directory entry in one directory of Ext4 file system [math]O(n)[/math], where [math]n[/math] is the number of existing directory entries?
It really comes down to how you are accessing the directories.  If you are search/listing them then it's much more time consuming than if you know here you need to go and cd directly there.  The reason is that the standard library use by ls, find, and other utilities does a poor job of caching the directory and managing memory while iterating though the directory nodes. There examples on the web of how to rewrite ls so that it is quick on such operations, but you are still at the mercy of the Shell scripts wildcard resolving if your use wild cards to find entries. It's best if you need to scan the entries frequently to keep the number of files under a couple thousand.  The exact number you will have to figure out yourself as System specs affect perceived performance. The time is supposed to be O(n), but as n increases in size it inches its way toward O(n^2)
