Is Java a pure object-oriented programming language?
JAVA is not purely object oriented because: 1.'pure object oriented' means it should contain only classes and objects. it should not contain primitive data types like int,float,char. 2. In pure object oriented language ,we should access everything by message passing (through objects).But java contains static variables and methods which can be accessed directly without using objects. 3. Java does not contain multiple inheritance. it means an important feature of object oriented is lacking. so hoe we can say that java is purely  object oriented language? BUT THE PRECEDING POINT   REPRESENT LACK OF IN DEPTH UNDERSTANDING OF JAVA: 1.Even if java has primitive data types,these types are used inside the class and never outside of it. So they are a part of class. 2. Even static variables and static methods are written inside the class. When accessing from outside we should use class name. It means they are part and parcel of class definition and should not be considered as individual element.
