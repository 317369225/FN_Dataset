What are some of the biggest failures due to bad code quality?
For me It has to be the Ariane-5's Failure.   Ariane-4 was  successfully launched rocket. Ariane-5 was supposed to be more faster than Ariane-4. They  ported the same software(Araine -4's) into Ariane -5 .   I believe to save space they  used casting to  store the 64 bit floating calculations in 16 bit signed integer. Now since the Ariane 5 can fly faster than Ariane -4 the horizontal velocity  of thsi new launch was a very big number,on conversion it could not fit into 16 bit signed integer.The number was larger than 32,768, the largest integer storeable in a 16 bit  signed integer, and thus the conversion failed.     So what happened though  is : After 40  seconds   roughly  :   . . . . . . . . . .         Yes, it exploded !!!!!!   All due to a software bug.   The cost of this project was estimated US$7 Billion.
