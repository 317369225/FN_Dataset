Should I start learning C or should I focus on Python?
It sounds to me like you're getting bogged down in Python. For that reason alone, I'd recommend switching to C for a spell. Now, contrary to popular belief, C is not always faster than Python. C is generally faster than Python, and well-written C is a lot faster, but the best way to ensure a fast program is to use clean algorithms and good structure, rather than engaging in spurious optimization. By those metrics, a concise high-level language like Python will often surpass C, given that your programs will have fewer moving parts and more standardized functionality. Using C, however, will force you to understand primitive data-types and to go very close to the metal. It will also help you view memory and data structures the way they actually are, instead of the way Python abstracts them. In addition, many Python libraries and backends are implemented in C, therefore learning C will improve your ability to code in Python. Finally, since C is a lot more low-level and frankly a lot less forgiving than Python, learning C will teach you precision and will allow you to appreciate the niceties of Python a lot more. The great benefit of Python is really in the ability to think a step or two "beyond" the low-level details of C in favor of the bigger picture, so there's really no way that learning C will diminish your ability to code in Python.
