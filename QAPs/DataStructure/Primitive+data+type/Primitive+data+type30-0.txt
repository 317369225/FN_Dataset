Why do I feel that Java is a difficult language and can't even do my java homework?
If I had to hazard a guess, you feel Java is difficult because you're trying to put Java into the same pathways you built up while learning C. Java is a very different beast from C, but you have one major advantage: the fundamental syntax of curly braces, semicolons, and most of the primitive data types are identical to what C uses. Take that, and then start a new mental box for Java, because you need a different way of viewing programming for it to make sense. Java is object oriented, while C is an old-school imperative language. The closest thing to an "object" or "class" in C is a struct -- which may, or may not, help you understand Java better. In Java, everything is basically a struct. In fact, in C++ a class and struct are the same thing (well, almost exactly the same -- there are some differences). Java just forces you to recognize this much sooner, as it adds a lot of features C structs don't have. I had a similar problem trying to learn C from a BASIC background, I just felt like I couldn't understand everything, even though there was lots of pre-written code for me to study. It just didn't make sense to me, at the time. Right now, you're going from C to Java, which requires a shift in how you approach problems. Force yourself to do it for your class, though. You may find, after a few weeks, that it's not as bad as it seems right now. Updated 11w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
