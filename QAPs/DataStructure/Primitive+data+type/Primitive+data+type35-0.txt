What are some of the biggest failures due to bad code quality?
The example they always share in CS classes here at Michigan is that of The Patriot Missile Failure in the Persian-Gulf War. Put simply, a miscalculation due to the improper use of a primitive data type caused the death of 28 soldiers. If there's anything you can learn from this, it is to test your code as if lives depend on it.
