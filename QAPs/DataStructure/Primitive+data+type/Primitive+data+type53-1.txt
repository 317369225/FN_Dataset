Is Java a pure object-oriented programming language?
Deepak Pandey: Even using Wrapper classes does not make Java a pure OOP language, as internally it will use the operations like Unboxing and Autoboxing. So if you create instead of int Integer and do any mathematical operation on it, under the hoods Java is going to use primitive type int  only. Consider below code: public class BoxingExample {    public static void main(String[] args) {         Integer i = new Integer(10);         Integer j = new Integer(20);         Integer k = new Integer(i.intValue() +  j.intValue());         System.out.println("Output: "+ k);    } } In the above code there are 2 problems where Java fails to work as pure OOP. While creating Integer class you are using primitive type "int" i.e. numbers 10, 20 While doing addition Java is using primitive type "int" In simple words whatever you do Java can not be termed as Pure OOP language, but then almost no language is purely OOP language. P.S.: Java can never be termed as Pure OOP language.
