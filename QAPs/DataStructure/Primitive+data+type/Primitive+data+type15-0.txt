What is the difference between double d=5 and Double d= new Double(5) in Java?
double d = 5 ; > Here d is a primitive data type. > d behaves as just a variable with type as "double " > it does not have access to use the object class methods like equals() , hashcode() etc .  where as for Double d= new Double(5);> Here d is an object , more specifically a Wrapper class for double primitive data type ( Why we require wrapper class can be justified here Why are there wrapper classes in Java? ). > d holds the reference for a Double type Object created in heap space. > Since it is and object we can use equals() , hashcode() for d and other methods which are of Object class . To justify the last difference here is a code snippet : double d1=5; double d2=5; Double d11= new Double(5); Double d12= new Double(5); d1== d2 ; // true , since they have same values. d11== d12 ; // false , since the reference held by both are different d1.equals(d2); // invalid ( compilation error) , since d1 and d2 are primitive data types  d11.equals(d12); // true , since they refer to same values
