Why do I feel that Java is a difficult language and can't even do my java homework?
Although java might seem like a very difficult language at first. But I consider it a very powerful and interesting language to start a programming career with. For the following reasons: Java will instill discipline in you, as you have to handle java types and compile time error. Being OOP you are forced to see software components as actual physical objects. That way you can easily create a mental picture of relationships between software components. Hence enhancing ur software engineering skills. It teaches you how to be a little more organised, as you have to start working with packages, libraries and even classes from day one. Being c-styled you have the ease of moving from java to any other c-styled language (c++, c#, javascript, swift e.t.c), and even better convenience moving to languages that are loosely-typed (php, javascript e.t.c) - having mastered the act of not shooting yourself on the foot. My advice for you is, just find a way to solve your assignment, which would basically involve knowing the right class to house your funtions(method in java), then implement those funtions (which would most likely be similar to a c implemention). Grab your A - very important. Then cool down and learn java at your free time. I wish you all the best in your career. And please learn not to discriminate among languages, as language is but a tool. Logic and algorithm is what makes you a great programmer. You will hardly be relevant untill you show flexibility in many languages.
