Should I start learning C or should I focus on Python?
The short answer is yes. Just checking two programming popularity indexes, namely Tiobe (The Coding Standards Company) and Spectrum (Top 10 Programming Languages), C is still one of the most popular programming languages and so should make you more employable. It should be noted however that these indexes do not survey businesses/organisations directly to determine what programming languages they are using and for what purposes, which would be a better estimate of what might make you more employable, but I think we can assume C is probably being used widely in industry.
