Should I start learning C or should I focus on Python?
Most answers here seem to equate learning a low level language with improving the efficiency of the code you write. Personally I disagree. I have seen (and I am ashamed to say occasionally written) horribly inefficient code in many languages (assembler, C/C++, Java, PHP, PSQL, TSQL, etc.). The way to improve the efficiency in the code you write is to understand how computers, operating systems and programming languages work. Applying just these basic concepts I have earned good money optimising other peoples processes. So, if you really want to write fatastically efficient code learn computer architecture, operating system design and compiler design, then choose a language that fits what you want to do in the environment where you want to do it.
