Why is the Boolean data type absent in C?
When the ANSI C standard was drafted, "true" was defined to be 1 (but is typically any non-zero value), and "false" was defined to be any zero or null value. Modern programming languages have boolean values, but the hardware level of interpreting boolean values essentially boils down to "is the value equal/not equal to zero or null then jump to the right label". One great illustration of this is in C++, which build bool values on top of existing C ideas. In C++, bool values exist but you can also use 0, 1, "true", "false", null, nullptr, etc.
