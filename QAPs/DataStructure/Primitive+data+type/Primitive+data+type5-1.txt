If any programming language contains a primitive data type then it is said to be not a pure object oriented language, but Java consists of primitive data types and still it is called as a pure object oriented language, why?
Java is not a pure object oriented language because it supports Primitive datatype such as int, byte, longâ€¦ etc, to be used, which are not objects. There are seven qualities to be satisfied for a programming language to be pure Object Oriented. They are: 1. Encapsulation/Data Hiding 2. Inheritance 3. Polymorphism 4. Abstraction 5. All predifined types are objects 6. All operations are performed by sending messages to objects 7. All user defined types are objects. Some people call it Pure Object oriented because nothing can be done without declaring a class in java.Even Simplest "Hello World" requires a class to be declared.
