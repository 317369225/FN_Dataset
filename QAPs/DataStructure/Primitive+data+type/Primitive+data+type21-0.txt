Why do pow() function is not working for large range of value?
The problem is that the pow() function grows very fast and no inbuilt data type(even unsigned long long!! ) in C or C++ is sufficient even for moderately large values.Maximum values that can be represented using unsigned long long are around 19-20 digits while even pow(10,21) has more than 20 digits. There are 2 solutions: 1) Use a language with inbuilt support for large numbers like Python or Java. No need to write any extra code. 2) You will have to represent the numbers in an array and perform operations o this array. here is a short tutorial by on representing numbers using arrays : Computing Factorials of a huge number in C/C++: A tutorial
