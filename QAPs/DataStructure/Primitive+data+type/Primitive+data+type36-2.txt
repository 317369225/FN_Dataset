How should I store huge numbers (more than 100 digits) in Java and C++?
Particularly for this question, you actually need not use BigInteger Library or BigInt. Simply using BigInt either in C, C++, or Java may TimeOut. I am saying this because I and many others have solved it in C in very less time without using BigInteger Try to get some inspiration from the Top solvers who have solved it in 0.00 time. If they can do it, you can also do it. Try some test cases on pen and paper, observe something and make an efficient algorithm. Despite that, you can get the BigInt Library Code in C++ here: calmhandtitan/algorepo Hope that helps! :)
