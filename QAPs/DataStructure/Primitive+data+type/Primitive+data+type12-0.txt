Are there any programming bootcamps that teach Java?
I created the Android course at Bloc (programming for Android requires Java). The course targets complete beginners, and instructs from basic to intermediary Java. If you are interested in learning Android as well as the Java programming language, then I recommend Bloc’s Android course. With respect to Java, here are the concepts we cover: Binary logic Primitive data types (int, bool, float, etc.) Conditionals, Loops, Methods Statics Classes Inheritance Security Interfaces Polymorphism Singletons Generics Multithreading Throughout the Android portion, students continue to write Java code as they build applications. The Android course prepares students to use Java in the wild, and that may be all most require. However, if students want to learn more advanced topics, their Bloc mentor can assist them with that as well. Bloc pairs each student with a working professional that guides them throughout the course. Among a mentor’s many responsibilities is to help students go beyond the curriculum to learn even more advanced topics. One such topic includes object recognition, employed by Wayne Johnson to create MoneyLens: If using Java to build compelling mobile applications sounds interesting to you, check out Bloc’s Android course.
