Why do I feel that Java is a difficult language and can't even do my java homework?
Arguably Java is one of the easiest OOP languages to learn. To go from C->Java for simple programming such as what you're doing,  you're probably only going to have to change the way you develop by prepending the class the function or variable exists inside. That and the use of the keyword "new", which if you transition to C++ from C you'd be using anyway.  Thinking back... since I started in GWBasic->QBasic->QB45->C/ASM->C++-> Java, I'm going to take a stab at what might be the issue. 1- OOP concepts ( sorry but this is something you're going to have to learn one way or another ) 2- Packages,  I can see that being a problem as in C .h files you know what's there. To get around this, just use an IDE like Eclipse. Further to this, Java has a giant tech stack full of classes - again IDE's help. 3- Your version of  int/void main...  is in a class. A way to start off on that train of thought is, if you really have to, only keep your main program in that class and use other classes for everything else, that way you won't have to figure out why you're instantiating the class it already looks like you're in. - Though you'll need to know, just do things 1 step at a time. 4-Where's printf ? Answer: System.out.println() , and it works similarly. At least it's not cout<< which is way more complicated. 5-Compiling/running etc from the commandline. Just skip it for now, use Eclipse or Netbeans or IntelliJ. Same goes for projects etc. Which arguably are more difficult in C depending on what you're doing ( like creating a dll etc).
