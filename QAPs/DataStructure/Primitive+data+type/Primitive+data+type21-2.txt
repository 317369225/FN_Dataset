Why do pow() function is not working for large range of value?
This worked for me. Since the value is quite large, you would need an appropriate datatype to handle that.  For the program below, I tried with integer type but it kept failing.  while the one below succeded. But it doesn't work for the other one. pow(2,100)! Wrong answers occur when the computed answer tries to exceed the limit of the datatype. #include<iostream> #include<cmath> using namespace std; int main() {    unsigned long long int a=pow(double(10),10);        cout<<a;         cin>>a;         return 0;     } P.S.- This is from a naive programmer, i don't know how it addresses the problem. Although I would be looking for the perfect answer.
