What is type wrapper in Java?
Java is mostly an object oriented language so it provides object versions of primitive data types as mentioned by Harshdeep Singh Saluja. Again using object oriented version of primitive data-types allows programmers to use all the object oriented features of while working with data types. Some features that wrapper classes provide are Being objects(that implement comparable interface and iterable interface)  they allow the use of primitive data types in collections.List<int> wont work but List<Integer> does work. We have static constants defines in wrappers that are useful.Some most commonly used constants are MAX_VALUE and MIN_VALUE that set upper and lower bound of the respective data types. The wrapper classes are IMMUTABLE.Meaning?? meaning they cannot be changed once created.This feature looks like a disadvantage at first but when we wrap our head around it a little we realize this feature is a life saver when working with threads. Wrapper classes provide functions for processing and manipulating datatypes. e.g toBinaryString returns a string representing the binary of the number and is implemented by all wrapper classes. Wrapper class implement Serializable. Hence giving programmers to serialize primitive data type just like objects. All in all with wrappers we get to use all the Object goodies of Java for primitive data types.    PS:wrapper classes are included in the java.lang package.
