As a programmer, how big is the advantage of knowing a low-level language like C even when you don't use it?
Not knowing C = Lack of knowledge to the situation. Based on my experience, even a tiny exposure in C helped me understand more how the works are done under the hood. How stuff are managed down to the memory. How big is the advantage? I don't think there's a big advantage (to others). Programmers can write codes even without knowing what's really happening underneath because for this case, not knowing won't hurt. Like I could care less. ^_^ For me, knowing/understanding it is more of a self-advancement as I feel less ignorant on the matter.
