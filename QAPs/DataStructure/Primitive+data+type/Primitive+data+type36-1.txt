How should I store huge numbers (more than 100 digits) in Java and C++?
I am assuming you are talking about in-memory storage. Primary datatypes will not support these numbers since their memory is not sufficient. One simple solution you can think of is to have a linked list (you would need many insert operations rather than searching the digits, so arrays are useless here) of digits and implement an adder, subtractor on top of it. Multiplication and division can be done using adder and subtractor.Â  You can persist them in a file / database. Reading them back would be optimized to what digits you would be looking for. Another solution would be to use a string to store the number, and implement the add/subtract/multiply/divide APIs by handling the ASCII values of the digits in strings.
