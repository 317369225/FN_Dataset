What is non primitive data structure?
Data type specifies the type of data stored in a variable. The data type can be classified into two types Primitive data type and Non-Primitive data type PRIMITIVE DATATYPE       The primitive data types are the basic data types that are available in most of the programming languages. The primitive data types are used to represent single values. Integer:  This is used to represent a number without decimal point.             Eg: 12, 90 Float and Double: This is used to represent a number with decimal point.   Eg: 45.1, 67.3 Character : This is used to represent single character   Eg: ‘C’, ‘a’ String: This is used to represent group of characters. Eg: "M.S.P.V.L Polytechnic College" Boolean: This is used represent logical values either true or false.  NON PRIMITIVE DATATYPES              The data types that are derived from primary data types are known as non-Primitive data types. These datatypes are used to store group of values.         The non-primitive data types are Arrays Structure Union linked list Stacks Queue etcat are derived from primary data types are known as non-Primitive data types.
