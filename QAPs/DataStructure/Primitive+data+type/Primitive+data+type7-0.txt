Why in C syntax the primitive data types (also arrays) use '&' operator in the argument list of function scanf() when taking input while strings are written as it is?
Example 1: char a;scanf("%c",&a); This shows that your giving address of variable 'a' to your standard console input to read the data from user. so in general 'a' represent value and &a represent address of a. Example 2: char a[1];scanf("%c",a); Now from above example in an array the letter 'a' shows the address of a[0]. you can retrieve first value of array in two possibilities, 1) a[0]     2) *a. both represent same. Example 3: char a[10];scanf("%s",a); It's nothing but, your giving the address of the a to %s to read data. Just compare ex 1 and ex 3. It seems both are same right. If you didn't understand read it again. Example 4: retrieving from the array, for(int i=0; i<10; i++)printf("%c",a[i]); AND for(int i=0; i<10; i++)printf("%c",*(a+i)); Both are same. Try it.
