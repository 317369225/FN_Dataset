Why are pointers used in C/C++?
In a large system, where multiple components are layered one on top of the other/are interacting very closely, it is possible to have situations where all the layers require access to a lot of common/shared data. In these situations, passing by pointers/references saves a LOT of memory and time. For e.g- Assume you are sending some bytes over the network. Without using pointers, every layer in the network stack must copy the data from the previous layer. Or, If you are writing some data to the disk, the complete IO stack must replicate the contents of the user buffer at every layer. It is to avoid these memory (and memcpy) overheads that pointers are most useful. However, managing them manually becomes a nightmare (specially in a multi-threaded environment) and that's why pointers are most often replaced by resource owner objects like shared_ptr, unique_ptr, ComPointer e.t.c Updated 121w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
