Why do pow() function is not working for large range of value?
The reason for it not working is that pow(2,100) is too big a number to fit in any primitive data type supported.(viz int, long , double). Â  Coming to the next part: How to find those values? The answer to this part is you are seldom required to find the exact value of such big numbers. In most of the programming contests, what is required to find the value modulo some prime. That you can easily do using this approach: #include <stdio.h>#define MOD 1000000007long long int power (long long int a, long long int b) {    long long int ans=1ll;    while(b) {        if(b&1)ans=(ans*a)%MOD;        a=(a*a)%MOD;        b=b/2;    }    return ans;    }int main(void) {    printf("%lld\n",power(2,10));    printf("%lld\n", power(2,89));    return 0;} If you are really interested in finding the value of those numbers: 1) Use Python 2) Use BigInteger in Java 3) Implement your own BigInteger library in C++. I hope I answered what you intended to ask.
