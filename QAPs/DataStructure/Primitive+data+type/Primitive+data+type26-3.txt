What is it like to learn Haskell without any prior programming knowledge?
Wow, tough one! I haven't seen any Computer Science Department to offer Functional Programming as it's introductory level course like Haskell or Scala...not at least at MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley nor some of the Ivy's too which is an obvious sign that it's pedagogically wrong to start with something like that! The syntax of the language is not so out of this world but it's more about the thought process which is even hard to grasp for more experienced programmers. Once when you've wrapped your head around compiled level languages like C & C++, once when you know what is going on underneath the "hood", learning a new language is by an order of magnitude easier!
