Why is wrapper class Integer required for basic datatype int?
Java is a pure object oriented language, it insists that programming be done entirely in objects and relations between objects. Variables in Java are declared using primitive data types and int is one of them. Now if all we need to do is declare a variable and do some simple math operations like +,-, the primitive data type would be sufficient. However if we would want to go for operations like converting int value to String or vice versa, we would be needing an object.  Integer  acts as a wrapper class around primitive data type int, and converts this to an object. We need a collection of integers, the catch however is that a List or Set can be a collection of objects only, in that case we could convert the primitive data type int into an Integer object and place it in a collection.
