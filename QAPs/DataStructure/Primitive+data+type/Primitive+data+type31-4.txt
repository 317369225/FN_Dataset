Why do we need to declare default constructors in Java classes?
At the beginning of an  object's life, the Java virtual machine (JVM) allocates memory on the  heap to accommodate the object's instance variables. When that memory is  first allocated, however, the data it contains is unpredictable. If the  memory were used as is, the behavior of the object would also be  unpredictable. To guard against such a scenario, Java makes certain that  memory is initialized, at least to predictable default values before it  is used by any code.
