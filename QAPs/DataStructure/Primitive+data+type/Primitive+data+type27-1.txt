What is the difference between primitive type and reference type in Java?
In short, At the lowest level we have group of primitive types like "byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char" and Reference types are mostly designed to group primitive types together. So you can have group of int as list, group of char as string, class of the primitives etc. Another important factor is about primitive type holding a value and reference holding address. int item = 3; int item2 = item; Making item2 hold a value 3 still. But for reference type say Point p = new Point(1.0, 2.0); Point q = p; q will be holding address of object p and in VM its still one point. Similarly the address is passed to methods for reference type whereas value will be passed for primitive type. Most other differences are also associated with value and address. Refer: Reference Types (Java in a Nutshell) for greater detail.
