What are the applications of wrapper classes in Java?
Mainly due to the following two reasons: 1. Convert primitive types to Objects. Typical application would be in Collections. Suppose you have to create an ArrayList of integers, you can't use ArrayList<int>. You have to use ArrayList<Integer> and then add numbers such as 1,2,3 etc. The Integer here wraps the values and converte them to an object. Secondly, Collection classes only work on Objects so you are bound to use Wrappers there. 2. Convert primitive values to String and vice-versa. All wrapper classes provide utility methods to convert String values to primitives and vice-versa. Suppose you have this: String number="24"; And you require it as integer value(say, for addition operation), you can easily use Integer.parseInt(number) to get 24 as integer. To convert 24 to "24" you can use new Integer(24).toString() Hope this helps!!!
