What are some real world examples of primitive data types in Java?
In Android when you send things like SMS, Images network data, serialization they will be byte[]. Int's are used for most number purposes, longs are used in time, interesting enough you can convert an int to char, and char to int. I used it in my "random" library to create a random string. If you had a function -> int randomInt(int min, int max) you can actually pass an char into it by converting to int, getting the int back and converting int to char to get a random char. A random string is formed by random char[] for some size into string String theString = new String(char[])
