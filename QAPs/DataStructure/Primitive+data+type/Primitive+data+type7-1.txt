Why in C syntax the primitive data types (also arrays) use '&' operator in the argument list of function scanf() when taking input while strings are written as it is?
In C language for variables of primitive data type we use address variable like we have int a;scanf("%d",&a); for arrays say integer/float arrays : int a[10];for(int i=0;i<10;i++)scanf("%d",&a[i]); now when we take input a string using scanf() say char a[10];scanf("%s",a); a, the name of array points to the base address of array. now one thing to observe is when we input string we enter continous characters which get stored in continous memory positions of array say input is : "famous" this gets stored as it is but ,what happens for input "you are good" only you gets stored in array when we input array elements we do seperate them by space/tab/newline so by observation we can say that when we want to take discrete input in diffrent variables we make use of & operator . like in string eg you could also take input like . for(int i=0;i<10;i++) scanf("%c",&a[i]); Sorry for grammer and framing of answer hope it helps .
