What are some common beginner mistakes in Java programming?
You can't use integer variables in an if condition : For C/C++ this is absolutely correct : int i = 0;if(i) //this results to a false condition in C++{ //do something} However for java the above program will result in compiler error, instead you have to use boolean variables : boolean i = false;if(i){ //do something} Also java does not have a sequence point i.e. i = i++ + i++; is completely legal in java, but in C it will have undefined behavior. Have a look at Question 3.8 if you want to understand sequence point in C.
