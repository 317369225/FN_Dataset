Are there any programming bootcamps that teach Java?
The first question you need to ask is do you want to do web/mobile dev?  You need to learn Java for android dev and Java can also be used in many web frameworks like Spring. I'd highly recommend checking out Switch  - It's got a comprehensive list of bootcamps and online tutorials, as well as some student reviews on there! Here's the list of Java related bootcamps: 1)  Skill Distillery: Bootcamp in Denver 2) Software Craftsmanship Guild in OH 3) Da Vinci Coders in Boulder, CO (game dev) 4) Eleven Fifty in IN 5)Grand Circus has in Detroit (8 week in person) 6)TurnToTech's Android bootcamp features Java in its curriculum Online: 1) Bloc | Online Coding Bootcamp for Developers and Web Designers 2) Thinkful · Online mentorship to advance your career Both have android/Java classes. There definitely seems to be more room for Java bootcamps based off of the sheer number of jobs out there.  So expect this list to be updated! Updated 14w ago • View Upvotes
