What is the difference (if there even is one) between a flag and a boolean?
In my experience a flag is just something that can be thrown that signifies something.  In many cases it is a boolean. (Generally in a 1 or 0 form). However it could mean other things and be a reference to a record in a database.  IE - User 12345 was flagged for too many login attempts.  So there is no flag just a record in a table that is used to store such signifying information. I suppose you would say that flags are just loosely defined structures of software vs a boolean being a primitive data type. Primitive data type What is flag? A Webopedia Definition
