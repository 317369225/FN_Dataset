Why is Java not considered a pure object-oriented programming language?
No, Java is not pure object oriented. Object oriented programming language should only have objects whereas java have int,char,float which are not objects. As in C++ and some other object-oriented languages, variables of Java's primitive data types are not objects. Values of primitive types are either stored directly in fields (for objects) or on the stack (for methods) rather than on the heap, as is commonly true for objects (but see escape analysis).  This was a conscious decision by Java's designers for performance  reasons. Because of this, Java was not considered to be a pure  object-oriented programming language. However, as of Java 5.0, autoboxin  enables programmers to proceed as if primitive types were instances of their wrapper class.
