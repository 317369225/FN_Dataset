What are the advantages of operator overloading?
Operator overloading allows you to give special meaning to some operator when there are operands associated with it. i.e. You define rules for that operator! For example: If there are two strings, "456" and "56" and you want to do this: "456" - "56" = "400". Can you do this without operator overloading? PS: I am assuming that you have basic knowledge about OOP languages.
