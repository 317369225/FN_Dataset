Why in many programming contests the answer is required to be printed modulo 1000000007?
Well what's special about 1000000007 - simple it is a prime number. First I will answer why modulo is used then I will come to why prime is used. 1) Why is modulo operation used ?: Because it prevents overflow and enables the problem setter to frame his problem for bigger ranges and hence demand a clever algorithm. And why it is useful will be clear from the example that follows: Suppose you are required to find nCr for n and r as high as 10^5. You know this number is going to be really big and no primitive data type can contain such a big number. Going for libraries handling big numbers will mean compromising with the algorithm as the operations like addition, multiplication no longer remain  O(1) operations. So what to do in these cases, simply ask for the result modulo some number. 2) Why is prime used ?: It's because many operations become easier when you do them modulo some prime. To make things clear: How would you calculate [(a/b) mod m] when you know a%m and b%m. Note that this will be required in the example I gave above(finding nCr as nCR = n!/(r!)*((n-r)!)). You cannot do it unless m is a prime number. I would recommend trying to solve this problem: Robot Movings to understand why modulo some prime is used. Now coming to the part on why 1000000007 ? I would say it is a big enough prime and conventionally it has been used so the use continues. You can refer to this: What's significant about the number choice 1000000007? for further explanation.
