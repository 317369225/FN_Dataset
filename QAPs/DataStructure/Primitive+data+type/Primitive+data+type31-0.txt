Why do we need to declare default constructors in Java classes?
Constructors establish the object's state. From this example, it may appear that the only purpose of the constructor is to set a variable's default value, which will be 0 anyway. This default constructor will be implicitly declared and created by the compiler if no overloaded constructors are used - but here, the constructor X(int a). From the specification: Chapter 8. Classes The spec doesn't say why the default constructor will not be implicitly created if overloaded constructors are used. I think it makes sense that, if the programmer creates overloaded constructors, they waived the convenience that the compiler will create the default constructor.
