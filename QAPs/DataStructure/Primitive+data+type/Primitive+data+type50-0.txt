As a programmer, how big is the advantage of knowing a low-level language like C even when you don't use it?
Say you're programming in JavaScript and you write this function: function makeChanges( aNumber, anArray ) { aNumber++; anArray[ 0 ]++;} Then you test it with this code: var myNumber = 4;var myArray = [ 4 ];makeChanges( myNumber, myArray );Console.log( myNumber + " and " +  myArray); //output = 4 and 5 Why did myArray change and myNumber stay the same? You can "understand" this by remembering arbitrary rules: "for some reason, when you pass a scalar variable to an function, the function has no ability to alter its value, but when you pass an array variable, the function can alter it." But without a deeper understanding of what's going on, you're likely to make mistakes, because you'll never understand the "big picture" behind the arbitrary rules. You won't know how they affect the entire system you're working with, so you won't know how to effectively tweak that system. If you learn C, you'll understand that variables point to addresses in memory, and those addresses contain values. When a variable gets passed to a function, a particular language can pass it in one of two ways: it can pass the value stored in the memory location or it can pass the address of that location. This distinction -- pointers -- is glossed over by many high-level languages, which is both a pro and a con. It's a pro in the sense that many programmers get confused by pointers. It's a con in the sense that that without understanding pointers, you don't really understand what's going on with variables. But though JavaScript can pretend pointers don't exist, it can't really get rid of them. It can just hide them, causing programmers with no low-level understanding to get confused or shrug their shoulders at seemingly odd, arbitrary behavior. This is just one example amongst many. Computer hardware is hard to understand. The further you move away from it, the easier it is to program a computer to do simple things; the closer you get to it, the more power and understanding you have about the beast you're actually wrestling with. It's kind of like the distinction between making pizza from a mix or from scratch. There's nothing necessarily wrong with using a mix, and it can be a great time saver. But it also limits your options. If all the mixes contain oregano, your pizza is going to have oregano in it whether you want it to or not. Updated 15w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
