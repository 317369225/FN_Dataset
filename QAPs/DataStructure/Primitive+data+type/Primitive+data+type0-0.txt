Why can't ArrayList store primitive data types?
Generics in Java are a bit of a hack. Once upon a time, in older versions, everything we put in a List was cast to to Object and then we had to cast it back to the type we wanted ourselves when we accessed it. In order to do this, we had to wrap all primitive types in their corresponding wrapper classes in order to match List's method signatures which called for Object.Â  Of course, this methodology is just begging for bugs from mistyping objects, so Sun decided to add generics to the language. They hacked the compiler so that it would insert the casts to Object and back again at compile time. They didn't do anything to modify the JVM in order to maintain backwards compatibility. But they couldn't add any nice way of automatically wrapping and unwrapping primitive types because this would require them to modify the existing standard class libraries which were published with older versions of the VM.
