Why is wrapper class Integer required for basic datatype int?
Since Java is pure object oriented language, we need to have objects to work with any thing or we need to convert them as objects. That is the reason files, requests, responses, tables ... every thing should be available as object in java. But in reality not every thing is available as object, some of the exceptions are variables.  So, if we want to make use of java features and  apply/enhance oops concepts on variables, we need to convert these variables into objects. All the variables in java are declared using Primitive Data Types, int is one of them. Wrapper classes are used to convert these primitive data types into objects. Some of the advantages using wrapper classes are, we can Use these variables in java collections.(Most benefited advantage) Handle some exceptions with numbers(For example null pointer exception etc) Handle type casting features....
