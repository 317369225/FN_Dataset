Why are pointers used in C/C++?
Because CPUs use pointers, and C++ is just a fancy way of producing machine code.  Most computer languages use pointers of some sort, and most of them wrap the pointers in some sort of protection layer that prevent you from misusing the pointers, either accidentally or on purpose. Those protection layers introduce a lot of overhead.  C++ allows you to program at a low level, close to the metal.  C++ is for experienced programmers, not for people who are confused about how the underlying hardware works. So, this is a trade off between languages that use extra resources at run-time to make the programmer's job easier, and languages that are more complicated but also more efficient in the hands of an expert.
