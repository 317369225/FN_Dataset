Why do I feel that Java is a difficult language and can't even do my java homework?
You don't like it because you don't know it, and that frustrates you. I find Java easy because I've been using it for a long time, you don't because you've barely used it at all. That's completely normal of course, and your frustration is normal too, though misguided. A few things to help you out: Use an IDE like NetBeans, I will program C in a regular text editor, but not Java, Java is wordy, that auto-completion really comes in handy. You can make Java act like C if you want to, you could use character arrays for strings if you wanted, that sort of thing, but really, really, really, DON'T. Take it one step at a time, and maybe elaborate about specifics you don't understand. You're on your first project in Java, that means you're a beginner, and unfortunately being a beginner in programming really sucks, because practically everything is really hard when you first start. You're a beginner in this field, a language isn't disgusting because you say it is, you just need to keep learning.
