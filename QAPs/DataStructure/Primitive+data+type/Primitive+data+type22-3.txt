What are some common beginner mistakes in Java programming?
Not understanding the purpose of equals(), hashcode() and clone() methods and their improper usage Writing code such that little run-time polymorphism comes into play. eg: over use of static methods Defining unnecessary instance variables Catching wildcard exceptions and swallowing exceptions Declaring variables beyond the necessary scope Unnecessary null checking Referring collection instances with concrete class name (applicable to any interface-implementation pair) Not checking whether objects are thread-safe or not. eg: SimpleDateFormat is not thread-safe and can not be shared across threads
