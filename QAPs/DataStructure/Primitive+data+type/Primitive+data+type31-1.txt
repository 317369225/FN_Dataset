Why do we need to declare default constructors in Java classes?
You are right when you say that every primitive data-type has a default value assigned to it and hence, there seems no legitimate need to create a default constructor. Sometimes, this seems like a legacy issue that the Java creators carried over from C++. However, there are a few things that happens when you don't create a default constructor. If you only have a non-default constructor in your class that assigns non-default values to the instance variables, you won't be able to create a default object because the program won't be able to find the required constructor. This would violate the function overloading rule of OOD. Also, you need a default constructor while creating a javabean. This is because you need to ensure that the user of the bean gets as much latitude (in defining the variables) as possible. This is usually achieved through accessor methods. When you have accessor methods, I think that it'll be superfluous for us to put in a non-default constructor.
