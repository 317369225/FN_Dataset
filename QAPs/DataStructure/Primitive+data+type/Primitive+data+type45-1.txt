Which data type is used to store values as large as 100! In C?
You'll have to implement a big integer library to store these two numbers. There are basically two approaches you can follow in C : Use arrays (or equivalently use std::string in C++) - This is the easier of implement and is as efficient in terms of time and more efficient in terms of memory than approach 2 for various reasons like cache locality. The only downside is constantly expanding and copying your pre-allocated array into a new array as the number grows. But the amortized cost will be no different than approach 2. Use linked list to represent a number as list of digits - This is harder to implement and you might have to implement link lists with both head and tail pointer to achieve the same efficiency as approach 1.If you're storing close to 100 digits a number, then the performance won't really differ that much.
