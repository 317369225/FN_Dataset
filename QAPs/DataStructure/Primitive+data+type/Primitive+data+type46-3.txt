Why are pointers used in C/C++?
Mathematics is confusing at times, too.   Do you wonder about its utility too?  I think  your objection has to do with the absence of your understanding, not the absence of usefulness of pointers. The main purpose of a pointer is enable handing a reference/name of an artifact to another programming entity, while avoiding passing an entire anonymous artifact to the other programming entity. You use pointers every day, if you use the web.  You enter a long string of characters, that name a remote location.  The web machinery reaches out to that location, and fetches the value it finds there, making a local copy on your computer so you can see it.  If  you fill in a form, the data goes back to the web site.  But the original data stays at the web site. Without that web address, how would you indicate what you wanted? Worse, what would happen when you finally located it?  You really don't want the other website's computer to move to your house just so you can see a web page. Pointers in C and C++ act the same way.  They give one part of the program, access to data produced by another part, without copying that data to the first part.  They also provide a way for that data to be shared and updated among a variety of program elements. People will tell you Java doesn't have pointers, so you don't have to learn this.  They are wrong.  What Java calls "objects" are realized by pointers to structures.
