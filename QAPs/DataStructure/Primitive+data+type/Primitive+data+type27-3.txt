What is the difference between primitive type and reference type in Java?
The data types that already exist are primitive types. User defined types are the objects of a class. The user defined data types are the reference types. See primitive data types means the ones like int, float, double, etc. Even the ones like BigInteger, ArrayList are all primitive types. When I create variables like this, I am actually creating instances of the class Integer, Float, BigInteger, etc. But say suppose I define a class as:    class A    {      void func()      {}     }     class B     {       public static void main(String...args)       {         A obj=new A();        }      } In this case, obj is abject of an user defined class. So it's a reference type variable.
