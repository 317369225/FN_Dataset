What are some real world examples of primitive data types in Java?
Primitive Datatypes removes the boiler plate code. Say for example you use boolean the value can either be "true" or "false" even if you dont set the value for the variable compared to Boolean which when not set will have value NULL. In this case it eliminates you from checking for NULL in your code. When there is a primitive data type that can be used, they provide better performance. Char lets you use only one character. You can declare it like below. char c = 'a'; Java doesnt stop you from using String for a character. You can declare it like below. String c = "a"; In short, removes boiler plate code and better performance.
