Should I start learning C or should I focus on Python?
You can do both. Learning another programming language will only make you a better programmer. C is great, but I am biased because I use it every day and I love it. But I also like, C++, Python, PHP, JavaScript .... And I won't stop there. We are software developers, the language is just a tool to express our creativity, and the bigger the toolbox...
