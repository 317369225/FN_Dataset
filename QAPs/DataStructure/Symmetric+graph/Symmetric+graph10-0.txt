Why are quadratic graphs always symmetrical?There are several ways of representing the equation of a quadratic on the plane. The one you likely saw first is y=ax2+bx+cy=ax2+bx+c, known as the standard form. In terms of answering your question, this doesn¡¯t really do the trick, so we¡¯ll switch to vertex form¡­ y=a(x?h)2+ky=a(x?h)2+k. For example, you might have the equation y=(x?3)2+4y=(x?3)2+4 (for convenience and simplicity, I¡¯ve made a=1a=1, and I¡¯m only going to discuss quadratic functions in this answer; quadratics that aren¡¯t functions also have the type of symmetry you¡¯ve observed).

The neat thing about vertex form is that you can easily identify the location of the vertex without graphing ¡ª it¡¯s the point (h,k)(h,k), or, in our example, (3, 4). Consider what happens in y=(x?3)2+4y=(x?3)2+4 if x=3x=3 (i.e., the x-coordinate of the vertex)¡­ the part of the equation in parentheses goes to zero, and 02=002=0.

Let¡¯s move rightward by one unit, x=4x=4. Our example equation evaluates as y=(4?3)2+4=12+4=1+4=5y=(4?3)2+4=12+4=1+4=5.

Now, consider x=2x=2, or one unit leftward of the vertex. The example equation is y=(2?3)2+4=(?1)2+4=1+4=5y=(2?3)2+4=(?1)2+4=1+4=5. Same y-value as before!

Try again with the pair x=1x=1 and x=5x=5. In both cases, y = 8.

So what¡¯s happening? By squaring (x?h)(x?h), the effect is similar* to taking the absolute value of the quantity, in that evaluating values of x which are an equal distance from h will yield the same result. On the graph of a quadratic, whatever is happening m units to the left of the vertex, the same thing must be happening m units to the right of the vertex. Hence, symmetry!
