What does it mean to have a Spectral Density graph that is symmetric about the y axis?This question requires more information. What is being plotted (power vs frequency, power vs time, power vs position, etc.)? What are the units on each axis, and is this a 2-D (x-y) or 3-D (x-y-z) graph, or is it in some other coordinate system? Without this information, there are just too many possibilities to suggest, which may confuse you much more than help you.
