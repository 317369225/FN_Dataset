How many ways are there to add N edges to a given labeled cycle graph with 2N vertices to make a cubic graph?F(2) = 1 and F(3) = 4, but I don't know the general equation.
Our cubic graph must be the superimposition of the cycle with a matching (a graph where every vertex has degree 1). How many matchings are there on 2N  vertices?  The first vertex must be connected to one of the other 2N−1  vertices.  Once we’ve done that, the next not-yet-connected vertex must be connected to one of the other 2N−3  not-yet-connected vertices.  Then the next, to one of the other 2N−5  , and so on.  The number of ways to do this is   (2N−1)(2N−3)⋯3⋅1=(2N−1)!!=(2N)!N!2 N    (where k!!  is the double factorial function). However, this overcounts the answer because superimposing some of these matchings onto the cycle might yield a multigraph that isn’t a graph—we might get two copies of an edge between the same pair of vertices. To find out how much we overcounted by, we’ll invoke the principle of inclusion-exclusion.  Number the edges in the cycle 1,…,2N  .  Let S  be the set of all (2N−1)!!  multigraphs we just found, and let T i ⊂S  be the set of those multigraphs with edge i  doubled.  Then the number of graphs in S  that aren’t multigraphs is   ∣ ∣ S∖⋃ 2N i=1 T i ∣ ∣ =∑ 2N k=0 (−1) k ∑ 1≤i 1 <⋯<i k ≤2N ∣ ∣ ⋂ k j=1 T i j  ∣ ∣   . Since two adjacent edges cannot be doubled, T i ∩T i+1 =T 2N ∩T 1 =∅  .  How many ways are there to pick k  edges i 1 ,…,i k   of the cycle such that no two are adjacent?  A simple stars-and-bars–like argument gives (2N−kk)+(2N−k−1k−1)=2N2N−k (2N−kk)  . Having picked such i 1 ,…,i k   , each element of ⋂ k j=1 T i j    is the superimposition of the cycle with the doubled edges i 1 ,…,i k   and one of the (2(N−k)−1)!!  matchings on the other 2(N−k)  vertices. So the number of graphs is   ∑ N k=0 (−1) k 2N2N−k (2N−kk)(2(N−k)−1)!!  . Updated 10 Jun 2013 • View Upvotes
