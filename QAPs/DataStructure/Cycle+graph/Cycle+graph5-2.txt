How can DFS and BFS be used to find out if there are cycles in a graph?
Originally Answered: What is the best way to determine whether a graph has a cycle using DFS or similar?If the graph is connects and undirected, simply keep track of visited nodes. If you encounter a node that is in the set, then there must be a cycle. You can vary this approach to relax the connected and undirected requirements--this is left as an exercise for the reader
