How can DFS and BFS be used to find out if there are cycles in a graph?
Originally Answered: What is the best way to determine whether a graph has a cycle using DFS or similar?You can also run a topological sort using Kahn's algorithm. Wikipedia has some pretty great pseudocode for this: Topological sorting It's not a DFS but it gets the job done. Plus, if the graph has no cycles, you get the Topological ordering of the Directed Acyclic Graph! Talk about your two for one deal. :D
