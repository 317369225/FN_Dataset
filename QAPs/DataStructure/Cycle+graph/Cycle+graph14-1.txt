How many Hamiltonian cycles are in a complete graph with N vertices?
There are (N-1)!/2 (unless N=1 in which case there is 1, or N=2 in which case there are 0. I assume N is at least 3 for the rest of the answer) Since every pair of vertices is connected by an edge, we can pick any order of the vertices we want to visit them in. However, since these are cycles, we have to be careful not to overcount. For instance, for N=3, the cycle 1-2-3 is the same as the cycle 2-3-1, which is also the same as 3-2-1. There are N! orderings of the vertices, then we have to divide by 2N since each cycle can be written as a permutation in 2N ways, depending on which of the N vertices you start at, and which of the two directions you traverse the cycle in.
