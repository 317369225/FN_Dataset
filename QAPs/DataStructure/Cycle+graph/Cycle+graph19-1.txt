How can you find if a graph has any cycles using "union-find"?
Sunny Mitra's answer to How can you find if a graph has any cycles using "union-find"? is good. Assuming the "union-find" operation involves the disjoint sets data structure, the graph has a cycle if and only if a new edge to be considered connects the vertexes that already belong to a single connected component. Therefore, just take edges in any order and start joining the connected components corresponding to the ends of each edge. If, at any iteration, two ends of the edge already belong to one connected component, you have a cycle. If all the edges have been exhausted with no cycles found, your graph has none.
