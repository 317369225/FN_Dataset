P vs. NP: Are there polynomial time algorithms for finding hamiltonian cycle in a undirected graph?
If you find one, then you would have proved that P = NP, which is unlikely but still an open question. Finding a Hamiltonian cycle in an undirected graph is NP-complete (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Ham... > (Karp 1972; Garey and Johnson 1983, p. 199)). Most complexity theorists believe that P ≠ NP. Therefore most complexity theorists believe that finding a Hamiltonian cycle in a undirected graph is not in P, i.e., most complexity theorists believe that there is no polynomial time algorithm for finding a Hamiltonian cycle in an undirected graph.
