Show that the edge set of a graph in which each vertex has even degree may be partitioned into edge sets of cycles of the graph.?
Let the even graph be G(V,E)  . We may assume that G     is nontrivial and connected. The problem can be viewed as a collection of the following subquestions: 1. Can we detect a cycle  C    of the graph; 2. What is the property of the graph as we remove a cycle from the graph i.e. [math]G'=G/ C[math]. Observe that if G has only vertices of even degree, G' also has vertices of even degree (try to see why). So, if we can find a cycle C, then we can use induction on G' and claim that G can be decomposed into cycles. So, the only thing remaining is to find a cycle of the even graph G. This can be done by starting at a arbitrary vertex v, moving  along the edges to one of the neighbors  of v and keeping track of the vertices visited until a vertex is visited for the second time. The sequence of vertices visited in between the two occurrence of the repeated vertex form the desired cycle C. Note that we will always get a repetition of a vertex since each vertex has degree >= 2. Another approach to get the cycle is to consider the longest path P of G and let its starting vertex be v. Since degree of v >= 2, v has at least two neighbors in P,say a and b. Let (v,a) be an edge in P. Cycle C can be obtained by  taking the path along P from v to b and the edge (b,v). This completes the proof of the claim. PS. This problem is the famous Konigsberg bridge problem which was solved by one of the greatest mathematicians - Leonard Euler.
