Why is it easier to determine whether a graph has an Eulerian cycle than a Hamiltonian cycle?
The problems do look similar at the first glance: one is "visit each edge once", the other is "visit each vertex once". So it's quite natural to expect that their solutions will be similar. Why aren't they? It's kind of hard to tell what exactly is the property that makes them so different. One such property may be the fundamental difference in the degrees of freedom you have. While in the Euler tour problem you are forced to use all the edges, in the Hamiltonian cycle problem you have the freedom to decide which edges to use and which to avoid. And in this case it turns out that this makes a huge difference. Consider the Eulerian problem first. Once you are forced to use all edges, you know that the graph has to be pretty special (connected and all degrees even) for a tour to exist. And after you have such a special graph, you already have a guarantee that a tour does indeed exist -- in fact, you are basically forced to find it :) in the sense that once you start walking along the edges, you are basically forced to construct a valid tour. Whenever you have a choice, all options are good and lead to valid solutions. On the other hand, the freedom we have in the Hamiltonian case makes the problem much harder. As far as we can tell, no greedy approach can lead us to the solution, we'll always get stuck somewhere without the possibility to go on (which is precisely what couldn't have happened to us in the Eulerian case). The graph can be seen as a maze, with lots of incorrect twists and turns designed to throw us off. And as we already know (thanks to reductions from other NP-complete problems), it is possible to construct graphs-mazes that can be quite small and already extremely hard to solve.
