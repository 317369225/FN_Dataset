Is there an efficient algorithm to find out whether a graph has a four cycle (C4) or not?
A slightly augmented version of Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm can do this in linear time O(|V|+|E|). You need a slight modification to maintain a level for each node (i.e., recursion depth of the strongconnect function); when checkingÂ  for the case commented as "// successor w is in stack S and hence in the current SCC", you add a check for condition: level(w)=4+ level(v). If that condition is true, you claim a positive answer. The modification I propose does not change the time complexity of the algorithm.
