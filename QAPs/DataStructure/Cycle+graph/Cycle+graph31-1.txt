I wrote a code to find a cycle inside an undirected graph. It prints if the graph has a cycle or not. How can I make it print the edges of the cycle in the format (I, j)?The code in the first comment.
Thanks for A2A. To find cycle in undirected graph G=(V,E) , you can use a simple depth first search algorithm. dfs(u){    visit[u]=1   for u->v      if(!visit[v]){          parent[v]=u;      }     else if(parent[v] is not u){           //cycle exists            print(u);               }      } You can use the auxilliary parent array to find the cycle path. How? while(parent[i] is not i) //assuming root node of dfs is its parent      print(i, parent[i]) Hope you get the drift of what am trying to explain.
