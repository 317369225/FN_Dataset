How can I find if any graph has cycle or not?I am implementing kruskal algorithm so I need to check if there is cycle in the graph or not repeatedly. How can I do that.
Run DFS. If you find an edge pointing to a node you have visited before (a back edge), you have a cycle. Ref: Cycle (graph theory)
