I wrote a code to find a cycle inside an undirected graph. It prints if the graph has a cycle or not. How can I make it print the edges of the cycle in the format (I, j)?The code in the first comment.
I'll leave the coding to you, but here's the idea: Walk your graph like you walk a tree, depth-wise. At each node, iterate through each path besides the one you arrived from. At each node, push the previous node onto a stack. At each node, test the stack for the existence of the current node. IF the stack has the current node, print the edges between the current node and the matching stacked node.
