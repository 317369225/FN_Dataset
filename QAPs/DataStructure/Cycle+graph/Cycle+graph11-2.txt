How can we find all simple cycles in an undirected graph efficiently?
If you could do this efficiently you could find all cycles, take the largest and check to see if it was a Hamiltonian cycle.  So I think this is NP-Complete.  I guess a simple algorithm would be to just enumerate all the paths in the graph and check if they were cycles.  Simple but not efficient
