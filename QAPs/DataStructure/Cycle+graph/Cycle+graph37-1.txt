How do I use Kosaraju's algorithm in a directed graph that has at least one cycle?
While i don't know how kosaraju solved this, you don't need to know any algorithm for finding this out. First you need to check whether your graph is connected. If it is, then we know that a tree-like structure will have N-1 edges, if you draw a tree, it's obvious that if you add one connection to it, you will create a cycle. So if you have >= N edges, then you surely have a cycle. But what about if you have more components? Well then you have more graphs and just test the same on each of them.
