What is the most efficient way to count number of cycles in a directed/undirected graph?
If you mean the number of independent cycles, for undirected graphs it is just edges minus vertices plus connected components (use DFS or BFS) but for directed graphs it's NP-hard. You can read about this problem on Wikipedia here.
