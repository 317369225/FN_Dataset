What is a simple example of cycle bases in an undirected graph?
The cycle basis is the minimal set of vectors such that any cycle in the graph can be obtained from a ring-sum (linear combination) of the vectors in the cycle basis.  For a more formal and complete definition, see Cycle basis The above graph has 3 cycles, {a, b,  d, e, f}, {a, d, c, f}and {c, d, e} Let's denote the cycle using vectors in GF(2). The ith element is 1 if the ith edge is present in the cycle, else it is 0 {a, b, d, e, f} -> [1 1 0 1 1 1] {a, b, c, f}      -> [1 1 1 0 0 1] {c, d, e}         ->  [0 0 1 1 1 0] In this example, choose any two cycles and perform the ring-sum operation. You'll get the third cycle! The first two cycles form a cycle basis. You can choose the first two vectors in three ways. So this graph has three cycle bases.
