Why do array indices start with 0 (zero) in many programming languages?I would breakup the answer in 2 parts :- Why the newer language use zero as the start of an array? : It is because most of the constructs of the newer languages are inspired from the old language and old language use zero as the start of the array. Now obviously, it boils down the whole question to - Why the older language use zero as the start of an array? : The semantic of the language defined the name of the array as the pointer to the first element of the array. Think about the concept of pointers in C where we express array[i] = *(array + i). For eg:- If arr[10] is an array of 10 elements, then arr points to the first element i.e. arr[0] = *(arr + 0) and hence arr[i] = *(arr + i). Now this concept not only provides programmatically importance to the name of the array but also makes the pointer maths easy.
