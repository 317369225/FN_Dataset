Length field of an array?The word 'field' has two contexts in your sentence. The first one is when you describe the array itself. Surely, the 'length' is not a field of the array. The second one is when you describe the object which encapsulates the array. In this case, the 'length' is a field.Now, in Java both these contexts are mixed indistinguishably. For instance, float[] arr1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6}; array arr1 has 1,2,3,4,5,6 as the fields in the first context (while I strongly have an urge to call them array elements), while from a Java object perspective, the length of the array i.e. 6 is also a field. So, IMO it's entirely on the language specification as what to call what.
