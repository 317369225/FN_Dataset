Why do we need arrays when we have vectors in C++?I want to know in which scenarios arrays will serve a better purpose than vectors. Can I stop using arrays at all ?If you're working with a compiler that doesn't implement C++11 initialiser lists then filling an array at initialisation time is much easier. Indeed it's not possible to do it with a std::vector in C++98/01 - the best you can do is have every element initialised to some specified value.
