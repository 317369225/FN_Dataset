What is the difference between String Array and Character Array?Thanks for A2A! Character Array A character array is simply an array of character data type. It can be used to represent a string as there is no string data type in C. For example- 12345 char str1[]="Quora"; char str2[6]="Quora";   //length 6 for one extra ‘\0’ character char str3[]={'Q','u','o','r','a','\0'}; printf("%s %s %s", str1, str2, str3); //will all print Quora printf("%c %c %c %c %c", str1[0], str1[1], str1[2], str1[3], str1[4]); //will print Q u o r a           Note '\0' character which is automatically added by the compiler at the end of the str1 and str2. However in str3, you must supply the '\0' character explicitly. String Array Now what if you want array of strings rather than of characters. There is no direct concept of a string array in C (indirectly you can use either 2D array of characters or array of pointers for that). However in C++ and Java you can declare a string array. Below is example of string array in C++ using string class of STL Library. 12345 string str[3];       str[0]="Quora"; str[1]="Is"; str[2]="Awesome"; cout<< str[0] << " " << str[1] << " " << str[2]; Below is the example using array of pointers in C- 12 char *str[3]={"Quora", "Is", "Awesome"}; cout<< str[0] << " " << str[1] << " " << str[2]; Both above examples will print Quora Is Awesome. Hope this helps.
