It is possible to create an array which stores references to objects. You can also have an array which will store objects of any class. As you may know that Object class is a class in Java which is a superclass of all classes. So by creating an array of Object type you can store references of any class' objects. e.g. consider A and B as any two classes. You can write- Object[] arr= new Object[10]; arr [0]= new A(); are[1]= new B();
