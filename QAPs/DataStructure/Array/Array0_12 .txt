Why do array indices start with 0 (zero) in many programming languages?Because in most languages arrays are just items being put after one another in memory. The array index is then the offset from the start of the array. The first element has no offset, so it's index is 0. This way you can calculate the position of an element in memory by this simple formula: item_position = array_start_position + index * size_of_each_item
