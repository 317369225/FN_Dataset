How do arrays relate to pointers?Pointers are an elegant way to utilise memory in C++ if the problem size is unknown. Moreover C++ allows arrays to be passed as references or pointers which proves an advantage in situations where arrays of larger size are to be passed across several functions. Furthermore using pointers provides several benefits for compiler optimisation with minimal effort such as using restrict keywords which is an assurance to the compiler that the memory location wouldn't be manipulated anywhere else in the program which apparently helps the compiler to optimise code.
