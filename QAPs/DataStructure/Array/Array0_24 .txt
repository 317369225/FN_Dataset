Why do array indices start with 0 (zero) in many programming languages?This convention originated with machine-language programming, where the address of an array element would be computed by adding the index to the address of the beginning of an array. Starting indices at 1 would entail either a waste of space at the beginning of the array or a waste of time to subtract the 1 i.e, it has to do the operation of multiplication and addition to find the correct address which is not the case when index start with 0, in this case it has to do one operation of addition.
