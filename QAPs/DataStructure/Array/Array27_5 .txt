Are arrays objects in Java?Yes, array is an object. We use array, arrayList, TreeSet, etc when we want to use a group of elements in one bundle. You assume that it is like a tray of some reference variables i.e. some balls or some cups. Note that Arrays are objects but they're declared to hold primitives or object reference not the object itself. e.g. Make an array of Dogs. (1) Declare a Dog array variable  Dog[] pets; (2) create a new Dog array with a length of 5, and assign it to the previously declared Dog[] variable pets  pets = new Dog[5]; Now we have only an array of dog references, but no actual Dog objects. So, (3) create new Dog objects and assign them to the array elements.  pets[0] = new Dog();  pets[1] = new Dog(); Again, the array objects can have elements which are primitives, but the array itself is never a primitive.
