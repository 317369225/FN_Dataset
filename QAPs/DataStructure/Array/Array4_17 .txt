Why do we need arrays when we have vectors in C++?I want to know in which scenarios arrays will serve a better purpose than vectors. Can I stop using arrays at all ?Use array when it can be used.vector force you to include STL headers leading to added compilation.Arrays should be used over vector if possible in code path that is required to be performance critical.Consider using variable length array when size is not known at compile time if VLA support is there. Small things matters a lot when system is tested on large scale and stressed.
