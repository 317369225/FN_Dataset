Is array [] and array* one and the same thing while using as parameter inside a swap function? For eg. int swap (int array[]) works same as int swap (int array*).Yes Inside a function arrays are indexed using pointer mechanism. Note that even when you say array[] you are passing only the starting address So, for example, a[1] is manipulated as *(a+1) which is exactly how you index using pointers.
