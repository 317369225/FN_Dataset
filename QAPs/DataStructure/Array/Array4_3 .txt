Why do we need arrays when we have vectors in C++?I want to know in which scenarios arrays will serve a better purpose than vectors. Can I stop using arrays at all ?24 bytes saved (for 64 bit OS) + no memory allocation cost. Drawback is that array size is fixed and defined at compile time. I would advise using std::array rather than c-style arrays to benefit from iterators, size(), for loop, etc...
