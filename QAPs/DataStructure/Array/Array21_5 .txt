Is it possible to search in an array of C structs?If you keep your array sorted, then you can do a binary search with bsearch(3); you can sort the array with qsort(3). Both take the same user-defined comparison function. Alternately, rather than sorting the original array, you could build an index array or other data structure, like a hash table or tree. While there isn't standard library to build a tree, there is one to search it: tsearch(3) To do it without global variables, you might need to use the _r flavors that take a context pointer for the comparison functions. That context might include a pointer to the base array. The compare function would be given pointers to two elements in the index, and would need to take the index value in each slot as an index into the base array, then do value comparison of the elements referenced in the base array.
