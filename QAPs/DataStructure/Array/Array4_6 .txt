Why do we need arrays when we have vectors in C++?I want to know in which scenarios arrays will serve a better purpose than vectors. Can I stop using arrays at all ?vectors are allocated from a heap area and use dynamic memory allocation which can cause memory fragmentation by time. this is prohibited at most of safety critical systems (in embedded world). in addition to that using vectors adds extra cost for allocating and freeing memory comparing to arrays. c++ offers std::array<type> class as opposed to vector<type> since c++11. array<> classes use stack area and behaviors are deterministic at compile time. so, if your maximum array size required is known at compile time, it is better to prefer arrays to vectors.
