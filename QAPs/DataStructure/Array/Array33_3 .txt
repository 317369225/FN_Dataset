What is the difference between String Array and Character Array?a string array is a collection of strings. a char array is a collection of characters. eg.String str[]={"friend","life"}; String str1[]={"i","am","f"}; are correct declarations. char ch[]={'f','i','r','e'}; is also correct. but char ch[]={'friend'}; or char char ch[]={"friend"}; are wrong declarations. In java, a string array is a collection of string class objects while a char array is a collection of char (primitive data type) values.
