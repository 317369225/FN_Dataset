Why does Java prohibit generic array creation?Arrays in Java remember their component type at runtime. That means to create an array, you need to know the component type at the time you are creating it. Here, T, a type parameter, is an unknown type. Can there be a more detailed explanation than the above?Think about what you're suggesting and understand why it's pointless: an array of generic types is just a contiguous block of pointers. Do you realize how many other and more explicit methods exist for you to express that? Arrays should be reserved for primitives that will occupy contiguous memory. In all other situations, it's better practice not to obfuscate the fact that it's merely the pointers and not the data itself that is sequentially stored.
