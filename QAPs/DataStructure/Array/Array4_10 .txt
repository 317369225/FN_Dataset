Why do we need arrays when we have vectors in C++?I want to know in which scenarios arrays will serve a better purpose than vectors. Can I stop using arrays at all ?Agreed with Robert Love and others . To add , array are built-in-types and vectors are abstract-data-type .. its user defined .. its a library ( created using built-in-types only.) Vectors are implemented as array only. One simple way to view vector implementation is : vector start off with a small array, and whenever it reaches its capacity, a new array of double the size is allocated and the old elements are copied to the new array.
