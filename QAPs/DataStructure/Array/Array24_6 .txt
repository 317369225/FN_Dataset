What's the difference between array and pointer in C/C++?I am assuming you have very little knowledge on this, so I am going to try to simplify as much as possible. A pointer is actually an object that points to a value stored in memory. An array is an information structure that contains a finite number of data (information) values. Imagine if you live in a large building where you have to pick up your mail on the first floor. There will be many mail boxes, each with a number representing an apartment in the building. Let's assume that the mail boxes are very small, so you can only fit one letter into it. When you want to pick up the letter for apartment 100, you go to the box numbered 100 and retrieve the letter. An array in C++ is like a representation of these mail boxes. You can place only one type of information inside the array, and each "box" in the array has an address, often referred as the index. For example, you have an array of size 500 (500 "boxes"), numbered from 0 to 499. You can retrieve the data from any of the boxes if you know where it is located. In C++ (and many other programming languages), you can perform many operations that allow you to manipulate the data in the array. Here goes an example on how to use a pointer with an array: Once again, going back to the array of size 500, let's refer to box 250 as i. When we store the location of i in a pointer, let's call it p, we can say that p points to i. Therefore, a pointer is nothing more that an address, and the variable representing the pointer, aka p, is just a variable that can store an address.
