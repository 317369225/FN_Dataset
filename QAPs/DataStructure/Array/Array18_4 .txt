Is it faster to iterate through an array or a linked list?Rizwan is perfectly fine on the issue,plus i would like to add that if u want even faster access through an array i.e a linear iteration over the array, a faster approach would be to use pointers . int a[100]; int *p=a; and then simple accessing and incrementing the pointer. This is because a[i] is calculated as *(a+i) and adding two addresses is a pretty high overload as compared to a single increment and using this u will avoid this same calculation again and again and thus make your code run pretty faster :)
