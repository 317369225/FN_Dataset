C++ length of an array?When you try to cross over an integer array using pointer it overflows, because integer arrays are not NULL terminated. The value '26' you are getting may change upon restart or in different runtime environments.  The online compiler is much more different or rather efficient in runtime memory allocation. It allocates only minimal memory required (thus no unallocated memory); because it is a shared service, leaving behind unnallocated memory will result in inefficiency for the site (heavy load for the servers hosting the site) and will require a heavy duty periodic cleanup.
