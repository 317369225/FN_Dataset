Why do we need arrays when we have vectors in C++?I want to know in which scenarios arrays will serve a better purpose than vectors. Can I stop using arrays at all ?Taking c++ for software engineering at the moment, I can tell you that arrays are considered deprecated. You shouldn't use them-- even in Java. In Java you should use Array List. In C++ use a Vector, Stack, Set, Queue, Map, or any other container listed on cplusplus.com . Arrays are considered "only for legacy code" from a software engineering perspective.
