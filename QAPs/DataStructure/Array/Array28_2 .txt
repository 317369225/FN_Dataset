What are associative arrays?Associative arrays map keys to values. It is essentially a hash table. For example, normal arrays map integers indexed from 0 to values. You could map a string to a value using an associative array, and the value can be string or whatever object you want. To summarize, a normal array is as follows (in python): 123 array = [1,2,3,4] array[0] = 1 array[2] = 3 And an associative array (or a dictionary) in python is: 123 arr = {} arr['example'] = 2 arr['quora'] = 'is awesome'
