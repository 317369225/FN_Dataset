How do I revert the array bracket syntax " []" to the old "array()" in PHP?I didn't realize that the cpanel uses php 5.3 while brackets are introduced in 5.4 Is there any quick tip/editor since I already code Laravel with brackets? PS: I code with Sublime Text 3When I ran into this problem, I used Sublime Text 2's regex search across files with the following parameters: Match : \s\[(.+?)\] Replace : array($1) I'm not great with regex, so please let me know if this doesn't work for some cases.
