Why do array indices start with 0 (zero) in many programming languages?Short answer ... because that's how programmers count (or rather how they should). Longer answer ... because it's analogous to an offset from a starting position, thus the starting position has an offset of zero. More correct answer, it's because an array index is the same as an ordinal index, not a cardinal index. If the language allows for base 1 indexing (or like Pascal any starting index) that becomes a nominal index instead. Personal gripe ... I can't understand why people don't realize that everything is even counted (not just offset from) starting at zero. Even if you start counting using your fingers, the base starting point would be a closed fist = 0 (even if you only start thinking of the 1 after it). But that's a bit unrelated to this issue and is what's meant by cardinality, even in cardinality (i.e. counting) zero is a valid count - even though few people think of it as such.
