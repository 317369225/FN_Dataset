Is array [] and array* one and the same thing while using as parameter inside a swap function? For eg. int swap (int array[]) works same as int swap (int array*).Actually Yes, as the answer below mine describes, if you pass " array[ ] ", it will be treated as a pointer reference. As a matter of fact arrays are always passed by reference. When you don't want the changes to be reflected, always make a copy of your parameter array and operate on that.
