What are arrays?"An array is a systematic arrangement of objects, usually in rows and columns. Specifically, it may refer to" I can explain it better in a programming sense. Lets say I have an integer array (so a row of numbers). I can say how many "elements" I want in the array (better described as post boxes). In each of these elements is a number (because it is an integer array). So if I want to access element 12; arrayname[12]. Would be how I access it. Of course first I have to say it's an integer array, say how many elements are in the array and place a value in the elements I am looking at (otherwise it is null - nothing)
