Why do we need arrays when we have vectors in C++?I want to know in which scenarios arrays will serve a better purpose than vectors. Can I stop using arrays at all ?First there was C++ then came STL. First there was array then came vectors. Vectors remove the pain of managing memory that arrays require. Vectors are there to make our life easy. However imagine you have to interface with a Pure C library, then expect the library to use array somewhere in it's API and it wouldn't understand STL, so you fall back on array. C++ is a C .... ++ .
