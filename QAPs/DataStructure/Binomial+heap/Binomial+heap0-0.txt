What are binomial heaps?
In computer science, a binomial heap is a heap similar to a binary heap but also supports quick merging of two heaps. This is achieved by using a special tree structure. It is important as an implementation of the mergeable heap abstract data type (also called meldable heap), which is a priority queue supporting merge operation.
