How do I count the number of subarrays (contiguous) with sum zero using DP?
Maintain continuous sum and if the value matches it means there were some elements which cancelled out each other. Let me take your array as an example: A = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} s[0] = 0 s[1] = 0 + -2 = -2 s[2] = -2 -1 =-3 s[3] = -3 + 0 = -3 s[4] = -3 + 1 =-2 s[5] = -2 + 2 =0 So, we have below sum array whose value matches s[0] & s[5]  -- you can see from 1 to 5th index the sum is 0 s[1] & s[4]  -- from 2 to 4th index the sum is 0 s[2] & s[3] -- from 3 to 3rd index the sum is 0 Enjoy!!
