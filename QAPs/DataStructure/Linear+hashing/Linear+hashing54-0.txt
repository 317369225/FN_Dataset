Is the linear formation the best sorting production?
I suppose difficulty can be encountered by these aspects:  1. prediction of data can be rather hard. thus we cannot construct a general formula to describe well the following numbers (may be hash values).  2. due to the first difficulty, numbers out of certain range can be divergent. example graphed by Google: the graph of  Google. the values derived out of [-1,3] are really large, as well as rapid increment in difficulty executing the original formula.  3. that is actually equivalent to hash, which creates a table that contains the values. and the production rule is a formula.  4. the execution of a "smarter" inquiry may be expensive because of the complexity of algorithm itself. Glad I came up with an answer, eventually.
