What is the coolest algorithm with complexity O(1)?
A personal favorite of mine is sampling from a weighted distribution in O(1) time (of course, there is linear time preprocessing required).Â  The sampling algorithm is very simple, but there is a fair amount of cleverness that goes into the preprocessing to make the sampling fast.
