What classes should I take if I want to become a data scientist?
A data science curriculum should mostly a combination of Statistics and Computer Science classes, with additional relevant classes from other departments (e.g. Applied Math, Math, Econ) Here are my suggestions on a full curriculum for a data science program Introduction One year of multivariable calculus and linear algebra / matrix algebra One year of intro CS One year of intro probability and inference Core Classes Data science Machine learning Linear modeling Predictive modeling Stats electives More linear models Time series analysis Statistical software Experimental design Survey analysis Causal inference Bayesian data analysis Nonparametric methods CS electives Theory of computation / Analysis of algorithms Data structures and algorithms Software engineering Visualization Parallel programming / Massive computation (for processing huge datasets) Network analysis More machine learning Economics + Computer Science (game theory, auction design) Other electives (convex) Optimization Behavioral economics Thank you for those in the comments for suggesting more comments to add to the list!
