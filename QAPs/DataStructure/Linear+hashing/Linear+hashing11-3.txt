How do I implement a C-code to remove duplicate elements from an array and what will be the complexity of such an algorithm?
The ideal approach would be to sort the elements and then remove the duplicate ones. So the time complexity would be the complexity to sort the elements- let us take quick sort as an example as it is the efficient one in average cases- and then scanning the array one more time to see if there are duplicates or repetitions.
