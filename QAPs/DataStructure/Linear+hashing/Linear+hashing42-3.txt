Which data structure is better to implement a phone book: Trie or Hash? Why?
I think Tries . As in ordinary phone book you click "S" all name starting with S are shown which can be implemented with Tries.Phone book typically contain 500 name so meomary is not a issue I personally reccomend you to use ternary search tree as it can provide the feature + memory utilized is very less +speed is almost same http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ter...
