What is hashing function?
A hash function takes data of some type and produces a numeric value. For example, PersonsName -> PhoneNumber  or  ParkedCar -> ParkingSpace. Different people usually report different phone numbers, but some people may share their phone number, which is why you'd normally say "May I speak to Mrs. Jane Smith?" after being connected to Mrs. Smith's number. The most useful hash functions are not those defined by large tables (such as phone books), but those computed by a few lines of code. If parking-lot attendants knew about hash functions (and hash collision resolution), they wouldn't need to mark every car in a large spreadsheet. They could just compute the space from the license plate when they park or retrieve the cars. There is a lot of freedom in choosing a hash function, but different cars should typically hash to different parking spaces such that every parking space is equally likely to be chosen.
