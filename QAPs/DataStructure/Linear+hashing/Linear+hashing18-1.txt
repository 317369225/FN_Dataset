What is locality-sensitive hashing?
Without much formality: A locality sensitive hash is a hash function that takes some data point and hashes it into a number, with the added condition that two points that are close by some metric of interest in the original space have hashes that are close to the same value. This is very different from a normal hash, where you want hash(200) to have no relation to hash(201). One main use of this is as a poor mans clustering. Clustering is pretty expensive computationally, and if you have a good enough LSH, it will scale linearly with the number of data points.
