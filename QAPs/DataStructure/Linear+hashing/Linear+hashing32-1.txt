What are various collision detection methods in hashtables and how do you prevent or fix a collision? What is the best method?
There are a zillion methods actually, linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing, linked synonyms, overflow areas, etc. There's no "best" method because most hashing schemes are data-dependant. You can build a perfect hash function for your data if that's needed, there are efficient methods to do that. Now if you are looking for a collision resolution method that is very easy to code and very easy to handle I'd suggest you to use Cuckoo Hashing. Using 2 or 3 hashing functions with buckets of size 2 or 3 you can get around 90% of efficiency in space usage and the coding is really very simple. see: Cuckoo hashing And if you want the paper by Pagh & Rodler.
