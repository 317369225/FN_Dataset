What is locality-sensitive hashing?
The problem LSH solves is that finding nearest neighbors is a very expensive, both in time and space when operating in large feature spaces. It hashes input vectors (e.g. bag-of-word vectors) in a way such that similar vectors are likely to have the same hashes. Because of this property, lookup of near neighbors becomes a very efficient operation. The most important applications for LSH is usually in high-dimensional spaces. Think about matching text having entire english vocabulary as features, clustering images where they have hundreds of thousands of features, even audio files quickly and efficiently (for example - soundhound).
