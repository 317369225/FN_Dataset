What is a hash table?
I'll try to give a non technical answer here. A Hash table is one which helps you reduce the possible places where you can find an element, really. What you do is given a set of possible places, you chop (hacher) them down into little pieces. To place an object, associate it with a piece based on the element's property. When you want to check if an object exists, you will only try to check the check that piece. An analogy will be looking for Karthik in the 'K' section of a regular phonebook instead of the entire book. This is, assuming you decided to organize the names initially and put names starting with 'K' on the K-page.
