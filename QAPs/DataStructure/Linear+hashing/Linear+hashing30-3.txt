I am the programming karate kid. You are the programming Mr. Miyagi. How do you train me?
Here's a "to-learn" list I made once. It's based partly on programming contests and rest on what I thought would be interesting to learn. May need some heavy editing for hackathons. - OS: Processes, Multi-Threading & Concurrency, Memory Management - Red/Black, AVL, B Trees - Radix Sorting - External Sorting - Hashing - Radix Searching - KMP, Boyer-Moore and Rabin-Karp, Multiple search - Pattern Matching - Parsing - Convex Hull - Range Searching - Geometric Intersection - Closest Point problems, Voronoi - Graph algorithms, theory - Simplex method - FFT, Linear Programming - Combinatorial Game Theory - Compression - Cryptography - Design Patterns - Machine Learning
