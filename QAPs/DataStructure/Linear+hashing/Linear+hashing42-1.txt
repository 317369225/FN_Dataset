Which data structure is better to implement a phone book: Trie or Hash? Why?
Hide the implementation behind a facade or API, then implement whichever data structure you can make work soonest. You can always change the implementation later. For either of these data structures you're going to disambiguate key collisions, both across query types ("Cliff Jones", "Peter Cliff") and within query types ("Cliff Jones", "Cliff Robertson"), so you'll need buckets. You're also going to need to share or replicate leaves since the same information can be looked up in three different ways. Managing the leaves could be more complex than the lookup! For example, you might keep all of the phone book entries in a hash table, but use tries to map search keys to hash table buckets for rapid search.
