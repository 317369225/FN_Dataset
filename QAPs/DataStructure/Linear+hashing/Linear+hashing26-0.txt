What's David Karger's favorite algorithm/data structure?
I'm not sure if you're asking about my own algorithms or the field in general.  Regarding my own, Karger's algorithm (I didn't pick the name, but I'm vain enough to appreciate whoever did) was the first really new algorithm I ever discovered, the shortest one (3 lines), the easiest one to explain, the one with the simplest analysis, and the one with the most consequences for my future work.   The field in general is harder because its so big.  I'd have to list several favorites including Sleator and Tarjan's Splay Trees, Seidel's Treap data structure, Perfect Hashing, Seidel's algorithm for linear programming, the Mulmuley-Vazirani-Vazirani algorithm for perfect matching via matrix determinants, Cohen's estimator for transitive closures, and the Goemans-Williamson max-cut algorithm.
