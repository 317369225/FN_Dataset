Is geometric hashing the best way to assembly DNA molecules from optical mapping?
It's hard to answer this without playing with some actual data.  That said, geometric hashing may work fine, but it doesn't seem like the best tool for the job: first off, geometric hashing is designed for 2D patterns, whereas here the patterns are 1D, and second off, geometric hashing can deal with affine transformations, whereas here you may have non-uniform stretching (which is a non-linear transformation).  Again, hard to say how big of an issue these things are without seeing some examples of the data.
