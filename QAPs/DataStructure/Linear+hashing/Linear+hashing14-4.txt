What is hashing function?
A hash function is any method which produces fixed size output values for arbitrary sized inputs such that same input will always produce same output. Lets take an example. A teacher decided to give ID to each of her student using the following method. A student's ID = Sum of numerical value of alphabets of students name. Example For student named Sam ID = 19 + 1 + 13 = 33 For student named Frodo ID = 6 + 18 + 15 + 4 + 15 = 58 Where a = 1, b = 2, c = 3... z = 26 (both a and A would have value 1) If ID is less than 10 then 0 would be appended to it. So that 5 becomes 05. If ID is greater than 99 then its remainder with 100 is taken as ID. Now, all students come one by one to the teacher, tell their name and get their ID. In the above scenario The method teacher used acts as the hash function as it maps students' names of arbitraryÂ  length with a fixed 2 digit ID. If two students have same name then their ID will also be same. The ID acts as the hash value for the respective name. Whenever, two students get same ID, then that is called as collision in terms of hashing. Good hash functions are those which result in minimum collision. Hash Functions are mostly used for security and verification functions. MD5 and SHA 32 are popular hash functions used in cryptography. Checking checksum of an incoming file in Unix or comparing hash values of objects in Java language are frequent uses of hash function.
