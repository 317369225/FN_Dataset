Hashing:Â What is the probability of having CRC32 collision on simple strings?
A 32-bit hash isn't a great candidate for a hash key. If you hash 77,164 different strings, you will probably get a duplicate! (The chance of collision from n randomly-chosen c-bit values is [math]1-n! \left(2^c\right)^{-n} \binom{2^c}{n}[/math].) A CRC is linear, meaning it's tractable to take an input and alter it while keeping the same CRC. (The CRC is designed to change its value in the case of the kinds of corruption caused by communications links and disk drives -- not arbitrary corruption caused by evildoers or even complete replacements of a string with something else, as in your case.) But I don't think the CRC's linearity is particularly to blame for your case above. Even with just 30,000 strings, you have a 10% chance of collision.
