Why is the look-up time in std::map [math]O(logn)[/math]?
You are mixing up cause and effect. Maps are implemented as balanced search trees because C++ requires O(log N) complexity for lookup. And C++ requires that because there is nothing better (the standard is just making sure nobody ships anything worse). There are of course hash maps with constant average time lookup, but they are unordered associative containers, a fundamentally different data structure from a map, which is ordered. As for relationship with random access iterators, there isn't any: map iterators are bidirectional. Distance is linear.
