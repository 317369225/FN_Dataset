How do I write a program that, given two sorted arrays of N int values, prints all elements that appear in both arrays, in sorted order?
Note: Prints all elements that appear in the union of A and B in sorted order. Thanks to Will for catching the ambiguity! Suppose you have arrays A[N] and B[N]. Then the code will look something like... a = 0, b= 0  while a < N or b < N:     if (b == N):                   // We've reached the end of B         print A[a]         a++     else if (a == N):           // We've reached the end of A         print B[b]         b++     else if (A[a] < B[b]):   // A has the next smallest element         print A[a]         a++     else:                              // B has the next smallest element         print B[b]         b++
