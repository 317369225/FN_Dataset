What is a symbol?
A symbol is a unique object. It is the simplest object you can have. Any one symbol will always have the same object ID. They are usually useful as "keys" or "names" for things as each symbol with the same name does not take up any more memory. As compared to creating "strings" with the same name, which will create new objects each time, thus taking up more memory. So a symbol with theÂ  name :monday is the same object wherever you create it in your program. If you need to use :monday in your application alot, instead of creating a String "monday", consider using a Symbol instead. Writing "monday", "monday" in you program automatically creates two different objects, as I said previously, this adds to your memory consumption.
