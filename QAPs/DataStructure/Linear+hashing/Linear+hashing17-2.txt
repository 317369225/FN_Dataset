What are some good resources for learning about dimensionality reduction? Why?
Here are some papers that greatly enhanced mathematical understanding of dimensionality reduction An Elementary Proof of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma by Dasgupta & Gupta [1] A Global Geometric Framework for Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction (ISOMAP) by Tennenbaum, Silva and Langford [2] Laplacian Eigenmaps for Dimensionality Reduction and Data Representation by Niyogi and Belkin [3] [1] http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta... [2] http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/Paper... [3] http://www.mitpressjournals.org/... Highly recommend reading the lecture delivered by David Donoho  titled "High Dimensional Data Analysis: on the Curses and Blessings of Dimensionality". The "blessings" of data in high dimensions is that the information of interest effectively lies in a lower dimension which we can then leverage, typically, this involves sparse representations or low dimensional manifolds. http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~do...
