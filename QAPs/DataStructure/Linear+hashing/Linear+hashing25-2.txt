How do giant sites like Reddit verify that a username isn't taken so fast?
Searching quickly is possible because the database has created an index of the usernames. The index is a sorted list of the usernames. Think about it like this: First the database compares the username to the username in the middle of the 8 million usernames. If it's greater than that username then it repeats the comparison to the username in the middle of the last half (middle of 4 million) or the first half of its less than. This is repeated until it finds the username or the two usernames that are greater than and less than the submitted username. 8 mil, 4 mil, 2 mil, 1 mil, 500k,Â  250k, 125k, cont... This can be done in a few seconds or less. Keep in mind there are more techniques to speed it up, like: if the username begins with the letter 'm' the process can start in the middle of the index for m's. Which would be less than 1/26th of the 8 mil to search.
