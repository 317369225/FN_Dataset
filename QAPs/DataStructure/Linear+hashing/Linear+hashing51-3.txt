Given a file of 2 billion 64-bit integers, how can one be  found that appears at least twice?
First, find a good hashing algorithm and put them into buckets. This process is linear time. Identical pairs will be in the same bucket. Then, if a bucket is small enough you could just compare all with each other within each bucket. Otherwise, you could hash again with a different hashing algorithm to narrow it down further. edit: with the new memory requirement, here is a way to do it: When performing the first hash, append the data to files for that bucket rather than a list in memory. Then just go through each file separately looking for duplicates, brute force if list is small or else using a different hash function to subdivide further (but these can remain in memory). Duplicates are guaranteed to be in the same file. Updated 86w ago • View Upvotes
