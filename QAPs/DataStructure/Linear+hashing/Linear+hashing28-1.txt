What are some applications of algorithms in theoretical computer science to problems in practice?
One example is primality testing (testing if a number if prime or not). You use this in, for example, RSA encryption when you want to generate very large random prime numbers. To do this, you just generate a very large random number and use a primality tester to check if you got a prime number - if not, then repeat. By the prime number theorem, the probability that a random n-bit number is prime is roughly proportional to 1/n, so you just need to repeat this O(n) times to generate a random n-bit prime with high probability.
