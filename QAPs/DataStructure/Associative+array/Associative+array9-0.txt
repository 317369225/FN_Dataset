Can you have associative arrays in Ruby without using Hashes?
A sorted hash would probably get you most of the way to an associative array (after all, an associative array is just a hash with some sugar).  You could take a look at the http://rubygems.org/gems/rbtree gem as a potential candidate. Still, I'm confused where the hassle comes inb?  It should be a matter of just choosing to use square versus curly brackets.  Arrays and Hashes have very different uses.  When using an associative array (say, in PHP), you rarely ever combine those two - and it's probably a very bad idea if you were to. You've either got a list of things, or you've got a map of keys to values.  It's a good idea to tell the language which of those you're dealing with, so that it can provide better performance characteristics for your code. Ruby's Array is pretty flexible, too: API-wise, you can treat it more or less the same as you would an associative array: ruby-1.9.2-p180 :001 > a = [] => [] ruby-1.9.2-p180 :002 > a[5] = 'hi' => "hi" ruby-1.9.2-p180 :003 > a => [nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, "hi"]
