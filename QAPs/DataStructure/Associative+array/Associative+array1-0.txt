Does C++ have a built-in associative array?
Built-in? No. Abstract data types, such as containers, are not part of the core language in C++. However, C++ does also provide a specification for a standard library, and that contains four container types that meet the AssociativeContainer requirements: C++ concepts: AssociativeContainer, and four the meet the UnorderedAssociativeContainer requirements: C++ concepts: UnorderedAssociativeContainer. These eight class templates provide various permutations on the general concept, but std::map is the one that most closely matches what is generally intended by "associative array". Would you mind satisfying my curiosity about something? I can't figure out what language you're coming from; Python, Objective-C, and C# call their equivalents of this concept "Dictionary", Java calls theirs "Map". Lisp would probably use an alist for this. D calls their built-in version "associative arrays", but most D programmers know C++ pretty well...
