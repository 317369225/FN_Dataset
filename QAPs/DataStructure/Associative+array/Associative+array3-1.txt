How is the map data structure different from an associative array?
Associative arrays are also called maps, symbol tables, or dictionaries. They are the same thing. An associative array was a cleaver name that a programmer used to describe his map. Maps have all sorts of different implementations. Heap Maps, hash tables, binary trees, etc. Some implementations and programming languages try harder to hide (abstract) the fact that their associative array isn't an array. But there is a difference between an array and an associative array. Arrays are only good for looking up values based off of the index, while associative arrays are more general and can look up values based on any value. Additional differences will pop up based on the implementation.
