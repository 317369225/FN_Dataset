What are associative arrays?
An associative array is an abstract data type composed of a collection of (key value) pairs, such that each possible key appears just once in the collection. In an associative array, the association between a key and a value is often known as a "binding", and the same word "binding" may also be used to refer to the process of creating a new association. The operations that are usually defined for an associative array are: Add or insert: add a new  pair to the collection, binding the new key to its new value. The arguments to this operation are the key and the value. Reassign: replace the value in one of the  pairs that are already in the collection, binding an old key to a new value. As with an insertion, the arguments to this operation are the key and the value. Remove or delete: remove a  pair from the collection, unbinding a given key from its value. The argument to this operation is the key. Lookup: find the value (if any) that is bound to a given key. The argument to this operation is the key, and the value is returned from the operation. If no value is found, some associative array implementations raise an exception.
