Does C++ have a built-in associative array?
In cplusplus there is not an associative array so to speak, meaning that there is not an array library you can include to use as associative array. There are ways you can create one with a combination from user defined data types with custom templates. Probably not recommended unless you've designed and written many custom templates. The safer way to find what you are looking for, would be in the standard template library, commonly referred to as STL, it has three main groups: sequence containers (exp. lists), container adapters (exp. stacks) and associative containers (sets). Associative containers would include, set, map, multimap, and multiset. In these containers you could add objects of different data types or even classes e.g. Structs, to the same container, enabling you the programmer to have similar capabilities as an associative array, or like a container of objects.
