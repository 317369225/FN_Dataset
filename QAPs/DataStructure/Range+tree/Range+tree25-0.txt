Algorithms: Where can I learn more about cool (novel?) data structures and algorithms?
Programming Pearls (2nd Edition): Jon Bentley: 0785342657883: Amazon.com: Books is a bit old but an awesome read. Targeted towards beginners it goes through industry war stories. Contains discussions about bloom filters and suffix arrays used in industry problems. Introduction to Algorithms | The MIT Press and Algorithm Design: Jon Kleinberg, Éva Tardos: 9780321295354: Amazon.com: Books have a lot of breadth. If you want to have a strong base you can go through one of these. If you want to go deeper you can try: MIT's Advanced Algorithms and the 6.851: Advanced Data Structures classes. The lecture notes and problem sets are a great resource and are close to the state of the art in the field while books are a few years behind. Computational Geometry, Algorithms and Applications is a great book for computational geometry. Algorithms on Strings, Trees and Sequences: Computer Science and Computational Biology: Dan Gusfield: 9780521585194: Amazon.com: Books or Jewels of Stringology: Maxime Crochemore, Wojciech Rytter: 9789810247829: Amazon.com: Books are great for string data structures and algorithms. Network Flows: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications: Ravindra K. Ahuja, Thomas L. Magnanti, James B. Orlin: 9780136175490: Amazon.com: Books is awesome for network flows in particular and graph algorithms in general. Introduction to Information Retrieval is pretty good if you're interested in algorithms used in search engines. Probably the easiest to read in the list. The Art of Multiprocessor Programming: Maurice Herlihy, Nir Shavit: 9780123705914: Amazon.com: Books contains a ton of algorithms for concurrent programming. How do you build different locks how can your program have more throughput. They are quite fun to look into. I heard this one is pretty good for distributed systems theory but haven't looked at it much Distributed Algorithms (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems): Nancy A. Lynch: 9781558603486: Amazon.com: Books Hacker's Delight: Henry S. Warren: 0785342914658: Amazon.com: Books is a gem containing a ton of interesting bitwise tricks. Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions: Gayle Laakmann McDowell: 9780984782802: Amazon.com: Books is great if you're interested in a refresher for programming interviews. Any list of resources should include The Art of Computer Programming, Volumes 1-4A Boxed Set (Box Set): Donald E. Knuth: 9780321751041: Amazon.com: Books although I don't like the style too much. There's lots of math, a pseudo assembly language and more of a theoretical approach than an intuitive one. This stack overflow question has a great data structure list What are the lesser known but useful data structures?
