How do I do a range update in a segment tree without using lazy propagation?
Without lazy propagation, you would update the tree in the normal way, i.e., Start at the root of the tree, find out if the node is within the specified range, ignore if it is not within range, else update the value if it is a leaf node, else repeat the same on its children. This way, the update propagates from the root to the leaf nodes each time you do a range update. The problem is that when the range is large, the time complexity of this becomes O(n), i.e., the advantage of using a Segment tree is lost and it becomes equivalent to using a plain array. So why would you want to do this?
