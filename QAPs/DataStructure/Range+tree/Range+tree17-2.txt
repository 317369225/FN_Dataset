Data Structures:Â What data structure would allow adding an element, removing an element, and querying for the number of elements in the range (a, b), all in O(logn) time?
You might want to look into a range tree. Otherwise, a balanced search tree where each node keeps track of the leftmost and rightmost elements in its subtree as well as the number of elements in its subtree works.
