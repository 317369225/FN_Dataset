What range of climates can coffee trees be cultivated in?
Arabica coffee is grown in relatively cool climates in the region between the Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn. Arabica coffee beans grows in narrower temperature range than robusta coffee and has two optimal growing climates: The subtropical regions, at high altitudes of 16-24° with well-defined rainy and dry seasons at an altitude between 1800-3600 feet.  There is one coffee growing season and one maturation season, usually in the coldest part of autumn.  Mexico, Jamaica, the Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais regions in Brazil, and Zimbabwe are examples of areas with these climate conditions. The equatorial regions at latitudes lower than 10° and altitudes of 3600-6300 feet with frequent rainfall.  This climate results in almost continuous flowering and two coffee harvesting seasons.  The period of highest rainfall determines the main harvesting period, while the period of least rainfall determines the second harvest season. Examples of countries that have this climate are Kenya, Colombia, and Ethiopia.The optimum temperature is between 60-75ºF year round.  Photosynthesis is slowed at higher temperatures and frost damage can occur when temperatures hover around 0ºC.  Ideally, 1500-2500 mm of rain falling over a nine month period with a three month dry season coinciding with the harvest.  Irrigation can be used in dryer regions.  Robusta coffee is grown at altitudes of up to 3000 feet at latitudes less than 10°.  It is much more tolerant to warm conditions than Arabica coffee.
