What's the difference between Range Trees and Segment Trees?
The basic idea behind the two data structures is the same: they are static balanced binary search trees. In theory the segment tree is useful for querying/storing actual segments, and the range tree is useful for querying/storing points, but in competitive programming, the distinction is less clear. In contests, segment trees are usually used for maintaining a sequence and performing range updates/queries like "add x to [a, b)", or "return the sum of [a, b)". This is similar to a range tree in that you're doing operations on an ordered sequence, but it's called a segment tree anyway.
