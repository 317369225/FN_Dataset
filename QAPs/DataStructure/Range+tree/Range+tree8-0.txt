Is there a standard algorithm to determine if a given point lies in any rectangle (out of a set of rectangles)?
[EDIT] Let given rect be ABCD. Method 0. Simplest way might be to check if the point falls between the pair of parallel lines (AB,CD and AD,BC). For this, obtain the equation of these lines (using end-point co-ordinates), let's say y = mx + c and y = mx + d (with c < d). Then a given point (j,k) lies between these 2 lines if, (c < k - mj < d) Other inefficient methods - Method 1. Identify rect PQRS in which ABCD fits. If the given point is within bounds of PQRS, proceed to check if it's also within bounds of each shaded blue triangle (using simple inequalities like x < X1, x > X2, also you will need equation of the hypotenuse that can be figured out from the end points), if not then it must be in ABCD. Method 2. Identify yellow and violet triangles (should not be too difficult, need to find point of intersection of 2 lines) and also white rectangle inside ABCD. One by one check if the given point exist inside any of these triangles or rectangle (again using the same logic as in Method 1). Finally, given N rectangles foreach rectangle    apply Method 0 (or 1 or 2) end There might be more efficient ways though ...
