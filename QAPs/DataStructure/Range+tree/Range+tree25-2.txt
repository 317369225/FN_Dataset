Algorithms:Â Where can I learn more about cool (novel?) data structures and algorithms?
Some books: Amazon.com: The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants (The Virtual Laboratory) (9780387972978): Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz, Aristid Lindenmayer, J.S. Hanan, F.D. Fracchia, D.R. Fowler, M.J.M. de Boer, L. Mercer: Books And to a slightly lesser extent, the other two books in the series: http://www.amazon.com/Algorithmi... http://www.amazon.com/Algorithmi... I really enjoyed this book on pseudorandom numbers, though the Amazon reviews aren't so great. One of the reviewers deducts stars for so much of the book covering analysis of PRNGs, which I really liked. http://www.amazon.com/Infinite-G... Also in the same category as the above: http://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Im...
