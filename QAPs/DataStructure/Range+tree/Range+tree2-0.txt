What are some sources (books, etc.) from where I can learn about Interval, Segment, Range trees?
I found Introduction to Algorithms and Algorithms in C++ helpful for reinforcing my knowledge of data structures. It is completely possible, however, to learn data structures and algorithms online. Browsing the internet will give a variety of sources of varying quality, but if you spend time, it's not exceptionally difficult to build a good understanding. Start with reading Wikipedia articles, which give high-level descriptions but often lack good pseudocode and extensions. Then dive into google and selectively absorb information. For example, a google search eventually yields Segment tree - PEGWiki, which is well-written source complete with diagrams, pseudocode, and extensions of the data structure. Unfortunately, this link doesn't appear until the second page. Thus, you should carefully go through the results while exploring links, reinforcing ideas that appear multiple times, and taking careful note of new ideas and applications. It's important to note that being able to code these data structures without help requires even more work on your part. You need to understand how to piece together components, why they're there, why they work, and how to extend them. From there, you can challenge yourself further by solving programming competition problems and reading more advanced papers.
