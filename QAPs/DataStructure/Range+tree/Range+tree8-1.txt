Is there a standard algorithm to determine if a given point lies in any rectangle (out of a set of rectangles)?
The rectangles can be stored as orthogonal trees for optimizing the queries if the number of queries are large. To check if a point lies inside a rectangle the following method can be used: Let ABCD be a rectangle where A,B,C,D are vertices taken in order and P be a point. Take cross product of sides of rectangle and P. AB X AP, BC X BP , CD X CP , DA X DP. (The cross product should be taken in one order; either clockwise or anti-clockwise.) If all of the cross products have same sign then the point is inside the rectangle else not.
