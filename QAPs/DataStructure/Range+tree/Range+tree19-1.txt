How is it possible that Gennady beats nearly every PhD on TopCoder?
I think that the answers by Richard Peng and Miguel Oliveira cover this particular case well.  I will just add that I think the premise of this question overstates the value of a PhD by quite a bit.  I interviewed over 1,000 candidates in algorithms, architecture, coding, and so forth over the years while building high-performing engineering teams -- and I would say that the PhD candidates maybe did about 5-10% better than undergraduates from top schools.  This is on a broad set of technical and quantitative skills and a fairly large sample size -- not just that the very top guy in the competitive field is better than most PhDs. If your end goal is technical proficiency, whether it is for competing or for building real software in Silicon Valley or Wall Street, the 4-5 years of time invested into a PhD is hardly worthwhile.
