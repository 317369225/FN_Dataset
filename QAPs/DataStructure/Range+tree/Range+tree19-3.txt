How is it possible that Gennady beats nearly every PhD on TopCoder?
Strongest competitive programmers are actively courted by companies before they even start graduate studies. As a result, many do not start, and of those who start some do not get a PhD. When you work on a PhD degree, it is not a great idea to spend time honing your competition programming skills. If you are planning to play chess, you don't train for basketball (and vice versa). Most PhDs have better things to do than compete on Topcoder. Updated 58w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
