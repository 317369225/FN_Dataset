Algorithms: Where can I learn more about cool (novel?) data structures and algorithms?
Use it or Lose it: Strive for long term understanding. A couple of years ago, I was in the classes taught by greatest  Theoretical Computer Science professors like Dr. Skiena and Dr. Bender.  At that time, I have learned a lot about Algorithms. It was a blast of  new knowledge about novel data structures (Skip Lists, Suffix trees,  Range trees, bloom filters and a lot of other cool stuff) in short span  of time. But as time passed by after my graduation, I realized that my  knowledge in algorithms started to fade... So, I believed in this saying:: At the same time, a former (probably the coolest and visual-oriented) colleague of mine Chris Laffra, who had similar interests to revise his Algorithm skill set had created  PyAlgoViz - Home. It uses simple Python code to develop cool visualizations of algorithms and data structures and renders them on the browser using d3js. Example: It only took less than 25 lines of Python code for most of the Algorithmic visualizations I created. The image below have visualizations of data structures (they are not static as we see in the image below, but are graphics which move) I was the very first few adapters of this tool and I started with basic examples. When I first created my basic example, I was not aware of how the technology stack of this site worked, I ended up templating from the other existing code snippets (Yes, the visualizations as well as data structure codes are open source and anyone can read them :) ). In my opinion, Learning algorithms by writing, creating and visualizing them is one of the best ways to learn them. As a clever philosopher, Confucius said, "I Do and I Understand!" PS: Please feel free to look at over 50 cool visualizations of various data structures. Browse the code and keep contributing!
