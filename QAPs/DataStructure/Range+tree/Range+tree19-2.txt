How is it possible that Gennady beats nearly every PhD on TopCoder?
Gennady is obviously exceptionally intelligent Even though Gennady is only 20 years-old, he has many years of practice and experience (he was already competing at IOI at 11 years-old) Competitive programming is a sport. As such, training is very important both to learn new things and keep you sharp I don't think any PhD student or PhD devotes multiple hours a day to training like Gennady does PhD (students or graduates) likely participate on topcoder mostly just for fun as their work has little to nothing to do with algorithm competitions-like problems
