Can you be a good software engineer and not perform brilliantly in programming competitions like Codeforces, Topcoder, Codechef, etc.?
Yes absolutely. "Good software engineer" can be a relative term.  Therefore from my perspective, I have and do work with both good and great and amazingly talented engineers.  Of these none of them have entered contests for software  engineering.   From experience, good engineers will typically be those that do good for their customers and their employer.  They are also typically the ones who do engineering as a hobby as well and dabble in things on there own.
