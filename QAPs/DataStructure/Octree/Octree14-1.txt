What should I do or Where should I begin to become a good computer graphics engineer/programmer?
My advice, write a raytracer from scratch. It has such a shallow learning curve and you are constantly rewarded with better and better images, also debugging is very visual. You will learn a lot about vectors, matrices, lighting, physics, data structures/algorithms, optimisation techniques (BVH, kd trees, BSP, octrees, etc). You can also get into making it realtime, which is a great challenge and will lead you into GPU programming. A lot of what you learn will be useful for other fields, such as games or medical imaging.
