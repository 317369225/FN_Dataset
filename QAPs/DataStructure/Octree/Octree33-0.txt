Assume that you have a co-ordinate of 10 billion stars in your database (x, y, z values). How can you find the 100 closest stars to earth? What would be its space-time complexity (Big(O) notation)?
As the problem is stated, the runtime is O(n) because you have to do all 10 billion distance checks to find the 100 closest stars. However, since you're always finding the distance to Earth, you can pre-calculate the distances and just note which 100 are the closest, which would mean that you have have a one-time O(n) cost but after that the runtime cost is basically free. If the stars change position or if you need to measure distances to other points, consider an octree for your stars. By selecting appropriate cube sizes you can drastically reduce computation time.
