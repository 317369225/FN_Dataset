Is this so called "Unlimited Detail Real-Time Rendering Technology" theoretically possible?
The thing is, this method relies on repetition of stored, instanced content. The result may seem detailed, but note that it is also heterogenous - the same stuff, over and over. Voxel rendering and voxel techniques in general, however, are very cool and despite being very memory-intensive (experiment around with a voxel fluid simulator like maya fluids for a bit and you'll see what I mean) are very compelling. But this particular source is making aggrandizing claims which are targeted towards raising money more than raising the current state of the art. What we see here is not dissimilar to the ideas behind SolidAngle's Arnold deferred asset rendering or the render asset packaging of instances in Isotropix Clarisse, which unlike this demo are actual products being used today.
