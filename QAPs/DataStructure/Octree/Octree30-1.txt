What are data structures and why do we use them?
Since all non-trivial software requires data structures to organize its data, the answer is "pretty much everything you can do on a computer is an application of data structures." Data structures are not some esoteric side topic, they are fundamental to writing software. Video games: the levels, graphics, music, text, 3d models, and graphics engine use complicated data structures for representing them. Databases: lots of classic data structures for storing the data; trees, hashes, lists, etc. This is what many think of when talking about data structures. Operating systems: disk storage, GUI elements, and driver management are some examples of necessary data managed by the OS. Office software: word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations all are built from data structures to represent the documents. Web browsing: the DOM used for representing web pages is a notoriously complex structure. It's also the fundamental technology behind the way browsers work. Networking: the packets being sent over the Internet have a particular structure. Routing tables, which tell the packets where to go, are also a data structure. Searching/indexing: from Google to the search bar in your computer, this is all about organizing your computer's information in a structured way so that you can traverse it quickly. Mapping: the fundamental magic behind mapping software is a gigantic database of geographic information, connected together in a way that permits routing. Science: they run a lot of simulations for things like fluids, protein folding, weather patterns, structural behaviors, etc. All simulations are essentially an algorithm applied to a complicated data structure. I haven't gone into the specifics about types of data structures; there are too many thousands of possibilities, and this question is too broad for that. Hopefully this at least gives you a feel for how important they are to programming.
