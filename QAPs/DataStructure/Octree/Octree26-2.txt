Can I learn algorithms by just writing code?
You can learn some of the foundations on which algorithms are based on just by writing code: logic, control flow, recursions (and thus induction) if you go that far. However learning anything further in algorithms really depends on what code you are writing. If you are making a compiler or a operating system, you will end up learning some solid algorithm concepts like regular expressions and stack/heap algorithms. However if you are writing javascript to design a website, you really will not learn much algorithms. Most college algorithm courses have very well constructed programming assignments like a maze solvers or making a picture collage to specifically target key algorithm concepts. You can learn algorithms the fastest through code if you use those. Trying to really learn algorithms through a day-to-day programmer's code is really going to take very long! Here is a photo collage of a cat made out of tiny other images from UIUC's CS225 constructed to teach octree data structures and related graph algorithms.
