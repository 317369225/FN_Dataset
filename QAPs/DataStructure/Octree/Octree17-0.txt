I am a computer science 3rd-year student. I have got an internship at 2 companies, one is an aerospace company and the other one is a company where I will be on a PHP framework as a web developer. Which one is better?
The answer is - It depends on the quality of work that would get at both these places, and your passion for web development / algorithms. When should you join the aerospace company? Being a computer science student, you are expected to get a very decent project at an aerospace company. I can tell this from my experience of interning at a startup leading in projects related to Aero / Fluid Dynamics. I got an opportunity to work on a very complex algorithm - Adaptive Mesh Refining using a fully threaded octree, which involved algorithms,parallel programming and code profiling. All these would help you in the long run. What you can do is the company about the details of the project that you are going to work on, and decide for yourself. When should you join web development? N.B. In general, the work involved in web development is relatively boring, unless you are very passionate about web design and development. On the other hand, web development is awesome when you work on something you believe can really make an impact. Again, talk to those people and get to know some details about your project. If they choose not to give you any detail, I would advise you not to go for it. Hope that helps. Cheers and all the best!
