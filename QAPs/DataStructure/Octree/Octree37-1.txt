Do most computer scientists realize that game design is generally more fun than computer science research?
Well being a computer scientist with some knowledge on game design I give you sort of an insider answer. Most of the people that likes CS are problem solvers, and they love challenges that goes with designing solutions, usually on algorithms and code. I can tell you that that can be really fun, more than designing or playing games. It's curious to see that some programmers actually relax from a day of work by coding!, usually on personal projects that compels them. Not to say that game design is not fun and doesn't involve problem solving, but is a very different deal since you have to design an experience for a player, an not just solve objective abstract problems. Actually most of the CS people that I know tend to hate any research that goes with the human factor (psycology). So yeah, it comes to tastes in the end. While probably they will love to play a game or develop for it, that doesn't mean that they can't have fun with abstract problem solving which is what pure CS is. Me? I love both!
