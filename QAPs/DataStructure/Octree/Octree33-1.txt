Assume that you have a co-ordinate of 10 billion stars in your database (x, y, z values). How can you find the 100 closest stars to earth? What would be its space-time complexity (Big(O) notation)?
You need to first find the distance from Earth to each of the stars. Assuming 'n' stars, that's an O(n) operation. Once you have the distances, you need to pick the 100 closest stars, which simply is "picking the smallest k values from a list", where the list stores the distance from Earth to that corresponding star. You can do the operation in O(n) using sorting (Sort the list using bucket sort or radix sort, and pick the first 'k' elements), or O(nlogk) using a max-heap (Construct the max-heap of size k in O(k) using the first k elements. Insert the next n - k elements only if its less than the root node of the max-heap. Worst case O(k + (n - k)logk). Delete all elements in O(klogk)). So the total time complexity of the algorithm is O(n). You need O(n) space to store the array of distances and O(k) for the max-heap. So total space complexity is O(n).
