What is your secret weapon?
I have three of them. Hope they would be helpful. 1. Ignoring things that I cannot change (Power of acceptance): Every time I find something that irritates, discourages or saddens me, I try to do something about it. To be honest, I make all possible efforts I can to change that thing. But once I realize that controlling a particular situation is out of my hand; I back off. I immediately stop all my ongoing efforts of correcting it as soon as the realization dawns on me. This is a very important thing. We must try to let go off things for which we have little or no say at all. Thinking about it brings unwanted depression and distress. I would recommend every body to accept every situation and not worry about everything unnecessarily. 2. Being courteous: Courtesy is a very important, decent and a wonderful quality which everyone must try to acquire. Showing courtesy and respect to people not only wins them over but also presents a positive image of the person. Courtesy does not cost anything yet it can buy things that are priceless. 3. Loving without reservations: I use this particular weapon for my own selfish gains. Everybody whom I love gets an unbounded and immeasurable love from me. I believe in loving without expecting. This has not only saved me from the pain of expectations but has also helped me in gaining some priceless people in my life. We must understand that love should be kept free from expectations, complaints and demands. Try to spread as much happiness as you can. And do you know who would benefit the most? YOU YOURSELF. The peace of mind and the sense of satisfaction that you would achieve would be the biggest and the best gift you could ask for in this life. Also, thanks a lot Sotonye Sir. :)
