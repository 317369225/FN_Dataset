What should I do or Where should I begin to become a good computer graphics engineer/programmer?
I think it depends on what you want to do. Chirag's answer is a good one if you're interested in doing games and/or game engines or interactive systems. But there is little utility to OpenGL (and none at all to Direct3D) if you're interested in doing something like visual effects for film. In that case, you will want to learn a system like Renderman for imaging and/or one of the scripting systems built into interactive 3D systems (back in the day, the big one was MEL which was the modeling language built into the Alias system. Your mileage may vary). But in the end, the challenge is really not the programming languages or APIs. It's really just having (or developing) the ability to think in spatial terms, being able to visualize things in 3D space and implementing things based on that understanding. I spent almost 25 years doing computer graphics of all kinds, and that's what I really saw people struggle with. From my experience, about 30%-40% of the population will get there. The rest probably wont.
