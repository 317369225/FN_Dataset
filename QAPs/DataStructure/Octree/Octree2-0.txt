Can a self-taught programmer get a job without knowing data structures or algorithms?
Sure, I am technically a qualified engineer but I have spent my career as a programmer, including senior game programmer/researcher. The only sorting algorithm I could implement without access to books or the internet is bubblesort. But on the other hand, I have implemented things like kd-trees, octrees, BSP trees, A* search, genetic algorithms, neural networks, physics engines, graphics engines, game engines, raytracers, rasterisers, etc. The quality of good programmers is measured by how quickly, easily, neatly, and bug-free they can get stuff done and how well they work well in a team, not how many algorithms books they have read.
