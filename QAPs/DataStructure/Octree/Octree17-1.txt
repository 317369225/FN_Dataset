I am a computer science 3rd-year student. I have got an internship at 2 companies, one is an aerospace company and the other one is a company where I will be on a PHP framework as a web developer. Which one is better?
You didn't provide all the factors yet. What are your preferences? Do you want to work in Aerospace company or do you want to become a Web Developer? Which one is paying more? Which one is going to give you more learning? Despite all factor, choose based on what you want. No one can help you in deciding what do you want. Good Luck!
