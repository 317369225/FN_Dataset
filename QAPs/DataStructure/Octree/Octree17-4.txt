I am a computer science 3rd-year student. I have got an internship at 2 companies, one is an aerospace company and the other one is a company where I will be on a PHP framework as a web developer. Which one is better?
It is impossible to suggest a choice without knowing about technology involved with both internship (As you didn't say anything about aerospace internship). Try to collect some info about aerospace company's internship.
