What sort of software projects require graph algorithms or network flow algorithms?
I've seen quite a few graph algorithms show up while working on software for editing 3d objects. The most complex stuff shows up when writing tools like "select between two edges" or "automatically rebuild non-manifold topology." Flood-fill algorithms show up constantly. They show up a lot in video games as well. Most game levels are a connected graph of some kind, and game objects need to navigate their world. The player will need collision detection, and the computer controlled actors usually have some ability to get themselves from A to B, possibly while staying out of the way of C. Scientific simulations are often done using huge networks of nodes, or use an overlying network of cells (like an octree) to speed up calculations. The nodes need to find nearby collisions or interactions, and the graph provides that information. Simulations can take a very long time to run, so this is one area where you not only solve graph problems, but you put in a lot of time to speed them up.
