Can a self-taught programmer get a job without knowing data structures or algorithms?
Sure, if you want to be a run-of-the-mill programmer. (no offense to anybody, it's just a generally accepted truth) You will struggle solving simple problems that an otherwise average programmer would just breeze through. You will soon enough realize that your code is slow, dirty and it can hardly scale or be maintained. However, all things considered, you don't need to be an algorithms guru if you don't want to.  You should know what's out there, the most commonly used data structures and their space/time trade off. You might get away for a while not knowing any of these, but you will need to make peace with the thought that your skills will mostly always be at the lower-end of the spectrum. Also, don't fool yourself believing that if you learnt some fancy technology that allows you to do some uber-awesome stuff you are a good programmer. Technology changes fast. You will always have to relearn stuff over and over again at some point and pretty much anybody can do that. Think of  data-structures (and algorithms eventually) for a programmer as a basic tool box for a mechanic. There might be some awesome electric jack hammers out there, but knowing how to use an old-fashioned hammer will always prove useful. P.S: I am always amazed when people ask these kind of questions. I personally consider data structures and algorithms are one of the most beautiful and elegant aspects of coding. If you don't enjoy these, are you sure you want to go forward with programming ? It will only get uglier as you go ...
