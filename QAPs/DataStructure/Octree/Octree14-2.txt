What should I do or Where should I begin to become a good computer graphics engineer/programmer?
I will answer assuming you are talking about graphics programming. Graphics programming is about rendering a 3D scene with shading applied to it. There are two graphics APIs which can be used to write such programs, OpenGL and Direct3D. Pick any of these two APIs (however, underlying principles are same for both APIs), and start programming. You will find a lot of online tutorials that can guide you to write basic programs. Start with a "Hello Triangle" program and move on to render a cube. Then, there are shading techniques like gouraud shading, phong shading, etc. Try implementing those also. Once you are comfortable with the basic stuff, you are ready to move on to a little advanced techniques like shadow mapping, SSAO, etc. EDIT: For OpenGL API, OpenGL Programming Guide is a nice book. For in-depth understanding of real time rendering, Real Time Rendering, 3rd Edition is a great book. Updated 138w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
