If you want to get better at computer science algorithms what should you do?
Work on some open source project, solve people's problems in Stackoverflow. It's a edifying experience to read other people's code to see how they tackled a problem. Make a blog, write utilities, try to automate stuff. I say you would become better if you learn to write algorithms for some purpose then to just skim through some material and learning a generic algorithm. I say true learning happens when you meet a problem in a project google it up, realize that this problem is a famous one and there are many solutions to it, learn about these solutions and learn about the algorithms behind them ! As an example I was once making this project. I faced this situation where a smaller string is repeated many times to form a bigger string. Now I would recieve the bigger string from my user and I have to output the smaller string. Upon googling I came to know about the tortoise and hair algorithm which could solve this problem unless the smaller string has some alphabets repeated in it, in which case it gets complicated. See now, I no longer remember the exact situation where I came across this problem but I only remember the tortoise and hair algorithm, still, which might come in handy some time for some other problem. Read my blog to see if you could find anything interesting to make in a language of your choice. www.adityasastry.in
