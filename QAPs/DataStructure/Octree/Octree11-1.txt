When will a ray tracing chip be available in the mainstream market?
Not really an answer, but I think it would be important to formulate your question more precisely... ray tracing is quite a generic term considered how many different applications/forms are in use (just think of the importance sampling issue - Monte Carlo vs. Metropolis vs. RT+Photon Mapping, etc.). For instance Mental Images is working quite close on the dye, so in some sense the new NVidia Tesla iterations are to some extend RT hardware. Also another interesting question is whether it might be more feasible to use cloud approaches!?
