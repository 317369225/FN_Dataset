What data structure would I need to store a world like in Minecraft, where there are billions of boxes in a huge randomly generated world?
AFAIK Minecraft is using an Octree, like most other modern games. About the random generation, if you seed a PRNG with the same value, it will give the same sequence of results - so if nothing is modified you can basically store the entire level by just storing the seed (a single number), and running the PRNG dynamically when more data is needed. About a possibly more efficient way to implement voxel-based games, check out An Analysis of Minecraft-like Engines :)
