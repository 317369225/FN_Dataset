Is this so called "Unlimited Detail Real-Time Rendering Technology" theoretically possible?
I'll tell you what I think it is. I think they have a fairly nice implementation of Sparse Voxel Octrees or something, which runs at a decent resolution at about a frame per second (on a highest end PC at the time) or something like that. Then, they record the input where someone is walking around the world in VERY low resolution (interactive) and play it back in the application at full resolutionÂ  + antialiasing + shadows and save out the frames to a video. This is how I made silky smooth videos to iphone games I made with a crappy computer and no screen capture hardware/software. Presumably they made these videos for publicity to get fairly gullible people to invest, and counting on Moore's Law to provide the technology capable of decent performance within a few years. That's why they are so secretive and do not show an interactive demo. I don't think what they are doing is illegal or particularly unethical, but simply that they are guilty of exaggeration and hyperbole.
