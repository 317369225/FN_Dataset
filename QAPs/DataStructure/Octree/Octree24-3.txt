What is your secret weapon?
Having a playlist of very energizing, lively and uplifting songs in my music player has helped me a lot. It may sound trivial but they give you some sort of strength to get out of the situations which turn you off and demotivate you. Usually I listen to slow tracks which are melodious, calm and bluesy. But when I start feeling low, I recognize that feeling and play those up-tempo songs and get back on the track. An easy-to-use weapon. :) Thanks for A2A Sotonye Anga.
