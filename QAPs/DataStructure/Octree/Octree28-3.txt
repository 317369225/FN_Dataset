Computer Graphics: Are modern game engines threats to traditional renderers?
There's a lot of renderman infrastructure they would have to replace if a company decided to do so.  I'm not really sure why they would though.  Anything accomplished in a real-time engine could be ported to renderman.  Many advancements in real-time graphics were originally implemented in offline renderers.  I could imagine that the tools that the artists use could become more responsive from this technology, but the final renderings don't need that. I'm happy that someone produced a high quality commercial product around sparse voxel octrees that wasn't total vaporware.
