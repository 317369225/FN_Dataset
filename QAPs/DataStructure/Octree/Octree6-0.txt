What is one way programming has helped you look at the world differently?
Learning to program was the first thing I ever did that was actually difficult. It taught me the value of hard work. I started learning to program when I was about 9 years old. I thought that since I was naturally good at math, I would also be naturally good at programming. This turned out to be wrong. I struggled to write even basic programs. For example, I couldn't begin to imagine how to print out patterns like this: *        ****    ****************    ****        * (The size is given as input, of course. See PEG Judge - CCC01J1 - Dressing Up) So for two years I sucked at programming, and I was convinced it was just something I was "bad at". Eventually I started taking a directed approach to improving at programming. I practiced more and drew up flow charts to help me visualize control flow. In grade 9 I started doing the USACO training pages and reading Sedgewick. In the summer after grade 10, I solved hundreds of SPOJ problems. After all this practice, I eventually managed to qualify for the IOI. I learned my lesson. I now never assume that talent can substitute for hard work. Even when learning things that aren't really supposed to be that hard, such as basic classical electrodynamics (after I already knew vector calculus), I forced myself to do nearly every single exercise in the textbook.
