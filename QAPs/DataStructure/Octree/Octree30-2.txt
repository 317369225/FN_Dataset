What are data structures and why do we use them?
Data Structures are required to store data is an efficient manner. Certain data processing operations are cheaper in terms of computation time and space if the data is stored in a particular manner. Think of a telephone directory. Imagine if all the telephone numbers were unorganised. It would be extremely difficult to look up someone's number. The directory stores the data in a particular way (sorted lexicographically) such that cost (time) of looking up someone's number is very low. Now whenever the cost of one operation is reduced, the cost of another operation increases. Imagine adding a new number to the telephone directory. In an unorganised directory you can simply append a new page with all the new numbers. But in the organised directory you will have to look up the correct page for each new number to be inserted and then shift all the number to create space. This may change most of the pages in the directory. Thus you will have to reprint. But we hardly ever add any new number to a telephone directory. All new numbers are added once a year and new version is rolled out. Thus a data structure is used to exploit real-life constraints in order to optimise certain frequently used operations.
