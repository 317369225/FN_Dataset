I am a computer science 3rd-year student. I have got an internship at 2 companies, one is an aerospace company and the other one is a company where I will be on a PHP framework as a web developer. Which one is better?
Have you done internship before? If not, then as a Computer Science student you need to have an Internship experience before entering your 4th year. Why? :- This is the fastest way to learn new things You will get Industrial exposure It will benefit you at the time of placement as wellNow coming to your question, which one to choose? I would say choose that one in which you get to work on things that you love or would love to hack on. The one that will affect your future in a significant way. Don't consider relocating yourself as an obstruction if you will get to work with some cool guys, on cool things and ,most importantly, on stuff you like.
