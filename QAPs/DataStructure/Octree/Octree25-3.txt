What sort of software projects require graph algorithms or network flow algorithms?
only know basic usecase. don't beat me if it is little info. you need use graph algorithm if you work on maps; typcially, we need use it when we do some traffic optimation on transportation network. we can simulate network devices using graph ideas. we could use graph theory to analyze the social network.
