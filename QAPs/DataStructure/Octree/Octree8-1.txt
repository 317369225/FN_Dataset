What are some fast and scalable algorithms to determine whether a given 3D point set has a (unique) geometrically-similar embedding into a 4D point set?
First plot your data in Parallel Coordinates. Since Parallel Coordinates causes a lot of clutter when you have 1000s of high-dimensional points, you can use Density Plots to figure out the underlying structures. Asimov's Grand Tour on parallel coordinates shows you various permutations (views) of parallel coordinates from different angles etc, which can help you find the needle in the haystack.
