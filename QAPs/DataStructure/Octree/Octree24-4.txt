What is your secret weapon?
Oh, Sotonye. It's surely this: (picture: cuassassins | Bwog) Except I fill it with ice water first. Actually, I suspect what sets me apart is a list you don't want to sit down for. We'd be here till Christmas. In 2025. What do you love doing? Dancing to outdated music, flitting about like a bird, walking to the library, reading books that have nothing to do with me (recently: "On Your Retirement" and "Physics for Men"*), talking to random strangers without getting kidnapped, eating bad spam, watching 30 Rock/ Suits/ Community/ Movies, creeping up on Bigfoot in his sleep, creeping up on Bigfoot in general, cooking for two, sleeping in, drawing incredibly hot women. I wish I could do more, though. Most of all, I love helping people and molesting cats. And marking hijacked essays. (Homophobia's not cool, though.) *Not a sexist book, but about men's physics- e.g. the science of aiming at the toilet, "escaping spooning", hitting on two women at once- okay, nevermind, it really is sexist. Do you realize that no one is without a secret weapon? Thanks, Sotonye. I love how your questions and generous A2As bring together all of us, and compel us to write for you. Thank you.
