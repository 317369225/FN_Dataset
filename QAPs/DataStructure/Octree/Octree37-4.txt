Do most computer scientists realize that game design is generally more fun than computer science research?
Some (many?) people would argue that playing games is more fun than design them. That said, in many aspects computer science is like a game: we have the luxury of being able to "create our problems", in a way, thus we design rules, apply them, and hopefully "win" (read: make a proof). It's just that our tools of the trade are different.
