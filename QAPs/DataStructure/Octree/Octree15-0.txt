How do I get started with octamap in ros?
First you can get some basic idea by reading http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~hornunga/pub/hornung13roscon.pdf . You don't need to fully understand the details, you just need to get a big picture of octomap so that you understand what you're doing when following some tutorials. (In case you think the slides are too vague, check http://www2.informatik.uni-freib... .) For installation, you can use apt-get to install (octomap - ROS Wiki). Learn more of the data (.ot, .bt, etc.) you'll manipulate with octomap. (OctoMap 3D scan dataset) Run the executable (simple_example, OctoMap/octomap) generated from simple_example.cpp (OctoMap/octomap) Use octovis to see the octree generated. (octovis simple_tree.bt) Get to know how to transform octree to pointcloud by checking octree2pointcloud.cpp (OctoMap/octomap). Build maps from pointcloud by octomap_server. Start using octomap in your project! If you encounter some problems, check ROS Answers: Open Source Q&A Forum for help.
