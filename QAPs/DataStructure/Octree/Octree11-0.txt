When will a ray tracing chip be available in the mainstream market?
I personally doubt that dedicated ray tracing hardware makes much sense nowadays. Graphics hardware is moving away from fixed functionality to higher programmability. Even game developers, for whom 3D hardware is essentially built, want full control and the ability to run everything in software. The hardware implementation of ray tracing is even harder than that of a rasterizer, as ray tracing requires acceleration structures that have to fit in memory and are accessed almost randomly. Ray tracing is a versatile tool that can be used in many contexts, but it is hard to implement it efficiently on a parallel architecture without making trade-offs on the software side. Caustic Graphics made some noise a few years ago when they announced a fast dedicated ray tracing card. Everybody started waiting anxiously, but in the end only an FPGA implementation was released with mediocre performance. In addition, it was very expensive (~$4000, if I remember correctly) which did not justify a purchase, as ray tracing was the only thing it could do. Also, the software stack (OpenRL) had a lot of limitations. In the mean time NVIDIA had made tremendous progress with their GPUs and the CUDA platform, which enabled efficient implementations of entirely software ray tracing implementations. OptiX, iray, V-Ray, Octane and other renderers already take advantage of the GPU and achieve good performance. In summary, I think we are entering the era of software graphics. Programmable parallel processing units are becoming more affordable and capable. Cloud solutions are also becoming mainstream.
