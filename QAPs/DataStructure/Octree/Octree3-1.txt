What data structure would I need to store a world like in Minecraft, where there are billions of boxes in a huge randomly generated world?
Ignoring the Z-axis (vertical) minecraft worlds can be stored as 2-dimensional integer arrays. Where: 1 = Grass 2 = Water 3 = Sand A small world could be stored as: [1][1][1] [1][2][2] [2][2][3] Considering the size of the blocks in minecraft, storing many of these is not that difficult.  (To include the Z-axis, just use a 3-dimensional array) Minecraft also uses a "chunk" system, meaning that it breaks the world up into many sections.  This helps reduce the amount of memory needed load the world for the player. After this, the majority of what happens in the game is based on random number generation.  This requires virtually no disk space because most if not all of the things that are spawned randomly are despawned within one game-day. Finally, minecraft doesn't actually generate a new chunk until you enounter it.  So despite the fact that the world can go on "endlessly", only the parts of the world that you have explored actually exist and require any disk space.
