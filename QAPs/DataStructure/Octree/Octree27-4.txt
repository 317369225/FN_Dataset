How do I build an approach to understand any data structures and algorithm problem?
Problem solving is about one thing: relating too separate ideas in such a way that a desired objective is achieved. Thinking analytically is simple: Break down the system logically until it can't be broken down anymore. Do all of the parts still make logical sense? Are you missing parts to bridge the logic. I can't tell you how many programers and engineers I meet that cannot and will not think in this particular manner breaking problems down and following the logic. Of course all of the other suggestions here are important too, but I think focusing on the procedure of what makes a good analytical thinker and problem solver is equally as important. Also, even better than simply asking for books is asking for real life people. Find a mentor and pick their brain constantly about how they perform the analytical and problem solving tasks you want to be proficient at as well.
