What are the difficulties of implementing a physical based rendering engine like pbrt using ray tracing on GPU?
In my humble opinion, there is a main advantage and a main problem in the use of GPU for ray tracing. The main advantage is the possibility to have millions of simultaneous threads, one for each ray. The main problem is the competition of the threads for the bottle-neck in the memory access. This problem can be sorted through a clever use ofÂ  the memory access, using the cache memories to reduce the amount of access to the global memory. Some clever concepts are the "Morton curve", "hierarchical structures", "LBVH", "HLBVH", "radix-sort", "prefix-sum", etc. These concepts are used to speed-up GPU architectures.
