Do most computer scientists realize that game design is generally more fun than computer science research?
I worked on a simulation of the ISS years ago, and as part of the work we met with NASA scientists and engineers at a couple of their facilities to talk about how the ISS worked and how it would be finished.  Part way through the process, after we'd gotten to know each other, a couple of us game designers mentioned how we had childhood dreams of working in the space program.  The engineers laughed and said they had regrets they hadn't become game developers... http://space-station-sim.en.soft...
