What are some of the reasons to take a graphics computer science course if I have no plan to work in the game industry?
I am a professional programmer, specialising in computer graphics. Computer graphics is full of many algorithms and techniques that are used in other areas. For example, spatial partitioning (quadtrees, octrees, spatial hashing, kd trees, bsp trees, etc) is used in games and graphics programs to speed up rendering and collision calculations, but it is a very generic technique that will be useful in any area. There are other things that you might learn that will be useful in unexpected ways: Splines, noise filtering, stochastic sampling, GPU programming, linear algebra (in practice), etc. Not only that, but it is also immensly fun.
