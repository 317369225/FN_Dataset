What should I do or Where should I begin to become a good computer graphics engineer/programmer?
No. We have artists to do our artwork :)  WHile it helps to be able to throw together "programmer art" for prototypes, its not essential.  Yo can either get proto art from your artists or scrounge it on the net. I do recommend at least one intro design course as it will teach you language that your artists use and make communication easier. Im not sure why you didn't grasp the graphics coruse concepts-- its all math.  Mostly Trig for 2D and Vector Algebra for 3D.  Id think as an engineering major you would have had vector algebra, yes?  if not, you need it.
