What is the difference between kd tree and octree? Which one is advantageous?
If you're in 3D, you should probably use an octree.  Otherwise, probably a k-d tree. k-d trees are binary trees, where as octrees are octonary trees.  k-d trees cut space into two half-spaces at each internal node, where as octrees cut space into eight quadrants.  It's pretty easy to see how octrees would be better in 3D but k-d trees would work in higher/lower dimensions.
