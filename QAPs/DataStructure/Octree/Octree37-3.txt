Do most computer scientists realize that game design is generally more fun than computer science research?
I began a Computer Science degree straight out of high school. It took me about a year to realise that it wasn't for me and that I should find education that catered towards games design/development rather than computer science. I transferred to an 'Interactive Entertainment' degree and never regretted the change. Now to answer your question (rather than just giving you an anecdote), in my opinion games design isn't even programming. I do game design and programming work and they are two completely different disciplines. Design is planning, balancing, puzzle design, high level mechanic design etc. Programming is implementing everything in the design, which includes using what computer scientists have given us as well as a hell of a lot of problem solving. So basically you have asked if computer scientists realize that planning, writing design docs and dreaming up mechanics is more fun than problem solving and implementing complex functions. I dare say very few programmers/computer scientists would say that is the case.
