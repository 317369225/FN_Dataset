How do I build an approach to understand any data structures and algorithm problem?
I am going to share with you the reality of being a Professional Programmer: In a real job situation, Data Structure and Algorithm issues only make up 5% of everything that a Professional Programmer needs to solve in daily basis.  There other, more important things, that a Professional Programmer must take into account.  You certainly won't need to solve a permutation of strings problem, when there are bigger issues to take care of. Most of the time you will use a common, already been solved Algorithm and Data Structure when you create a software, you don't really need to spend days in trying to search the most efficient way of doing things. If you want to be a Professional Programmer and an Analytical one to boot, find a real life problem and try to design and program a software in a way that is not only solving the problem but also user-friendly. Yes, learning about Algorithm and Data Structure will give you a good base for your future work, but don't be too obsessed about it.  Learn about Software design pattern or User interface design, etc. These will give you better grounding to become a Professional Programmer.
