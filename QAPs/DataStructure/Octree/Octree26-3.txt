Can I learn algorithms by just writing code?
If you literally mean what you wrote, then you mean "can I invent all the algorithms I need by sitting down and typing [instead of studying]". The answer is no. The body of algorithms (or rather, Computer Science, which is part of Discrete Mathematics) we can draw upon was developed over thousands of years by millions of very intelligent and dedicated people. You aren't going to be able to recapitulate this sitting at your deskâ€”and nor is it necessary. However, practical exercises can help you study CS, as other answers suggest.
