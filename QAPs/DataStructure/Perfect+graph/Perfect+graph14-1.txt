Where can I find an example of a perfectly organized Chart of Accounts for small business accounting?
1)  QuickBooks has a wizard to set up a chart of accounts relevant for your industry and the legal form of your company.   A good chart of accounts should be compatible with your business tax returns and your business financial statements.  http://support.quickbooks.intuit... 2) If you have a small business, try to download your business accounts to http://waveaccounting.com/ and see what kind of expense list it offers for your business.   It is free and you can delete your account afterwards.
