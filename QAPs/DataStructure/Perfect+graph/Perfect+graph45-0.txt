Is there any way of graphing multiple equations on a single graph? For example, combining two equations such as sin(x) and cos(x) into one equation.
sin(pi/2) and cos(pi/2) are each single values.  Their graphs would each be a dot.  If you want to know how to graph multiple things on a graph, WolframAlpha is perfect for quick and easy graphing. http://www.wolframalpha.com/inpu...
