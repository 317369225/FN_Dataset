How did the Chinese GDP increase so rapidly after 1990 as compared to India?
I would say that the biggest factor is literacy rate. Both India and China are Asian countries with a huge population. Both are somewhat resource-poor. China has even less arable land than India. The only thing it can use to pull itself out of poverty, and the single biggest reason for FDI, is labor. So China invested in labor. There is a good New York Times article on this: The New York Times A 2009 report from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which measured the performance of 470,000 15-year-old students from 34 OECD countries and another 31 partner countries, in the areas of reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy, made for some extremely troubling reading. The assessment, conducted every three years, reveals that the United States ranks 17th in reading literacy, 31st in mathematics literacy and 23rd in science literacy - while China comfortably tops each category. Direct comparison with India Especially for women China's economic growth is driven by labor that are well-educated and relatively cheap. It was literally driven by armies of Chinese high school graduates making shoes for $1.50/hour, computer engineers writing software for $20,000/year, and PhDs writing new algorithms for $60,000/year. And they do so happily and gratefully, because it's the most money they've ever made!
