What is one bad thing you are good at?
Always thinking to sleep. Out of 24 hours a day, I sleep for 8 hours and keep thinking to sleep for rest 16 hours. I believe this creature is likewise adept at sleeping. If you notice those dark spots around eyes, it looks like sleepy eyes all the time.  In fact, I got a nickname of Panda when at senior high school, because I wore big and black glasses at that time, just like its black eyes. I also like dreaming while asleep. It is really interesting. Do you think so? O(∩_∩)O~
