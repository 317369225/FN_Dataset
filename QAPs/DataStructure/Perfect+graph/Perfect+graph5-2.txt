What is one bad thing you are good at?
One Bad thing..?? C'mon Dude I have a list... 1. Well you know, it is always fun doing random things which you are not supposed to do. But isn't it bad if you are screwed up all the time by this behavior of yours and still you are repeating the same act of stupidity... I am always like "Yea I know it is harmful but I can't help it.. " 2. Another ridiculous thing about me is that I don't give a damn about anyone teaching me good manners... (read ANYONE).               Yes, I am a good listener but actually I don't care what you are teaching me.. I may act like I don't care, but believe me, deep down I literally don't care. Sometimes it proves to be a good habit but not ALWAYS... 3. And yes I am good at manipulating the results... Once I managed to get perfect graph by readings from a defective CRO (Cathode Ray Oscilloscope) in my ECS practical examination. See how I did that.. And I got an A grade in my Electronic circuit and simulations (ECS) practical. WARNING: "The above act was performed either by a professional or was under supervision of a moron, So don't try this at your place without proper practice and guidance. " In the end from my experiences so far, I would like to say that, Always be thankful for all the bad things in life, for they open your eyes to the good things you weren't paying attention to before. Thanks Ayush for A2A, I really enjoyed writing this.. :) P.S.- Pictures shown here are not mine. I can't make anything that beautiful by my own hand.
