Which student of IIT Madras writes the best notes?
Vipul Shrivastava from BT of 2012 batch. Let me tell you why his notes are by far the best. For starters his notes have everything which the Profs say in the class. NO BIGGY... a lot of people have that. Colour coded... uses 4 different colours for showing the importance of what he has written. No TOO Psued... a decent amount of guys and mostly all muggu girls/NM's have this feature in there notes Google & Wiki notes... after every class he wiki's everything to correct and add points he missed, and then he google it again to cross check. (as according to Prof's Wiki is not a trusted source). Slightly Different... we all use wiki and google, but not many take notes Books & Paper... He then proceed to copy down solved examples from the referred books in classes and makes small boxes in the notes to mention things and facts in reference papers. I think my point must be getting clearer... Finally... Before any quiz/end_sem he makes starts condensing his notes. He writes any and everything important in a A4 sheet in tiny but very neat hand writing. This A4 sheet is so awesome that many times, without mugging anything but that sheet, I received average to above average marks in quizzes. And anyone who has read this sheet can verify this fact. He notes have saved many lives, not only in BT Dept but also in rest of insti... And when you ask him why does he have to write so much, he would just say,  sometimes people need more than just notes sometimes people need to have  their faith rewarded. His were the notes we didn't deserve but need  then... we called him muggu coz he cud take it... coz he is not RG... he  is a silent guardian, a watchful protector, A Dark Knight... :P Updated 119w ago • View Upvotes
