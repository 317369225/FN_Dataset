Who are some women in mathematics most people do not know about, but should? Why?
Julia Robinson certainly deserves mention for her involvement in the solution of Hilbert's tenth problem concerning Diophantine equations.   She received her Ph.D. from UC-Berkeley in 1948 under Alfred Tarski. The topic was: definability, and arithmetic decision problems. In spite of continued struggles with illness, she accepted an appointment to full professor at Berkeley in ’75, where her work continued to focus predominately on decision problems.   Robinson was the 1982 Noether Lecturer, and a MacArthur Fellow.
