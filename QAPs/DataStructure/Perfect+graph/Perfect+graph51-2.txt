What are the best sources to learn web coding (in a short time)?
Mayank gave an excellent answer with go-to references to use throughout your web development journey. While his "where do you learn this crap" section includes the most relevant sources possible (the documentation itself), a beginner will need other resources to actually learn the material. Luckily, we live in the age of the Internet and there are quite frankly hundreds of websites/programs that will teach you both web development (Front-End) and the programming behind it (Back-End). Before I begin, here's a list of almost a hundred free programming textbooks on Stackoverflow if you prefer that medium: http://stackoverflow.com/questio... Anyways, at one end of the spectrum there are programs that accumulate a wealth of content for you to learn on your own with videos and interactive web apps: Free: [Codecademy] http://www.codecademy.com/: If you're just starting to learn - this can get you introduced to basic concepts. I'd describe it as "coding on training wheels" [Code.org] http://code.org/learn -  Interactive tutorials/games for general programming concepts. They were the ones who organized Hour of Code! [Khan Academy] http://www.khanacademy.org/#comp...: Salman Khan's a great teacher. I've seen all his Organic Chem and Bio videos when I was studying for the MCAT. Great introduction to fundamental CS concepts http://www.skillcrush.com/terms/: They provide an excellent list of common terms you'll hear in any programming/web development conversation. Very easy to understand definitions! http://www.bentobox.io/: interactive tutorials of everything from HTML/CSS to Angular, Backbone, Coffescript and more! [CodeYear] http://www.codeyear.com/: Looks like a supplement to codecademy. Next, we move on the programs with monthly/course fees: [Codeschool] http://www.codeschool.com/ - grouped by specific "tracks" with additioanl screencasts [Treehouse (company)] http://teamtreehouse.com/ [Tuts+] http://net.tutsplus.com/ [lynda.com (product)] http://www.lynda.com/ [Udemy (company)] http://www.udemy.com/courses/Tec... [Coursera] https://www.coursera.org/ deserves their own section for being the emblem of a MOOC: As an example, here's my current dashboard of courses: There are also quite a few CS courses all hosted online! Introduction to Computer Science and Programming - MIT OpenCourseWare Introduction to C++ - MIT OpenCourseWare Introduction to Computer Science: Programming Methodology - Stanford Engineering Everywhere Data Structures - UC Berkeley An Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - UMass (Boston) Now at the OTHER end of the spectrum you have "bootcamps" which are considerably more expensive (8-15k) but provide extensive support. Depending on which you choose [get accepted to], you'll be coding 40-80 hours a week. http://www.thinkful.com/bootcamps/   - Has information on almost every in-person "bootcamp" The Ultimate Guide to Coding Bootcamps: The Exhaustive List  - a comprehensive article from SkilledUp that provides additional information on all of them - check out their "most selective" article as well! That was me just 3 months ago. I was looking for a way to learn how to become a web developer [eventually full-stack] and needed a course that fit my needs. I tried to use the free resources referenced in the beginning of this post but realized I needed a project based curriculum to actually apply the new skills. I also became quite frustrated when I would get "stuck."  After doing extensive research, I chose Thinkful (company) (http://thinkful.com). Many of the students have full-time/part-time jobs or are current college students (they recommend ~10 hours a week for Front-End and ~15 for Python). They also had the structured path and most importantly a personal mentor to do live code reviews (via screenshare on Google Hangout). Two months into the course, I applied for a marketing/front-end internship for the school and was accepted full-time :) Here's a post from my first day:  Has anyone "attended" Thinkful and what was their experience? Bit more info: Flexibility is the biggest strength of our program. The mentors [and students] are all over the world, so we'll be able to accommodate any requests. Whether you're a complete beginner (like I was) or have significant experience, you'd gain significant value from the curriculum. Since the payment is for monthly access to the whole program, you'd able to work on the parts of the curriculum that you need. At the recommended pace, our students finish in 3 months but some may finish in 2 or take another month!  If you finish the course, you'll get permanent access to the curriculum :) The final product of either course is pretty awesome (a personal website for Front-End, an capstone project for Python & Rails, and an iPhone app for iOS). If you'd like see some examples of student projects read blog.thinkful.com. Feel free to send me a message if you'd like to view some sample projects or have ANY questions about either course :) Anyway, this is just one of many options to start your learning. If you found this post helpful, let me know and I can post a more advanced learning guide as well as a back-end version. I wish everyone who reads this the best of luck on their programming journey!
