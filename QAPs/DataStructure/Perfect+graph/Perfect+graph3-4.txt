What are the most advanced mathematics that apply to architecture?
Interestingly, until the advent of computer aided design, the mathematics used in architecture has been relatively simple. Architect haveÂ  generally even left structural computations to the structural engineers. Architects have always worked through the medium of drawing, which is really applied geometry. Euclid would have been pretty well prepared. Leonardo and other Renaissance men had the advantage of perspective, which is applied projective geometry. Descartes helped out with his melding of geometry and algebra. But in my career as an architect I never encountered an architect who used calculus for anything. Buckminster Fuller got into some interesting three dimensional geometry, but even he didn't need to get into regions much beyond good old geometry. No group theory, Boolean algebra, even topology. Nowadays, it is generally not the designers who are doing the coding for the amazing modelling software and the sophisticated math required. They use the programs as tools for their visual thinking and creating. So, while advanced math has come to serve architecture, you don't need to be master of advanced math to be an architect.
