Does drinking a moderate amount of alcohol help prevent heart disease even if a person is in perfect condition?
It depends on who you ask. A nutritional epidemiologist might say that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, because that's what some research has shown. However, people who take a whole diet and lifestyle approach to health might say that we can't attribute protective associations to specific foods or drinks. After studying nutritional epidemiology in grad school, I take the whole diet and lifestyle approach to health. I don't think alcohol alone can help prevent heart disease, regardless of whether or not someone is in perfect health. What matters more for heart health is overall diet, and other lifestyle habits including exercise and smoking habits.
