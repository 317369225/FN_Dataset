What is string theory?
Nobody is going to be able to understand string theory from a few science videos. These videos have metaphors and analogies to give you a vague sense of what string theory is about and to get you excited about it. As I believe you're suspecting, those metaphors are not the real thing. You have good insight when you say that, despite the videos, you don't understand what the real thing is. When people say that life is a journey, they don't mean that you should buy highway maps to help you figure out how to live your life. Likewise, imagining vibrating strings won't help you understand string theory. See Jeff Kesselman's answer to What are strings "made of" in string theory? There's no shortcut: If you want to learn string theory for real, you need to spend several years in college and graduate school learning lots of physics and math.
