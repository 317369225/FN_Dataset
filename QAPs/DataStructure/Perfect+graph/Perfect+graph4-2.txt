Who are some women in mathematics most people do not know about, but should? Why?
(A2A) I think if you asked most people to name a mathematician, male or female, you'd be lucky if they could come up with anyone at all -- maybe they'd think of Isaac Newton.  So literally anyone would in some sense be a correct answer to this question. There are a fairly small number of mathematicians throughout history who've triggered a complete paradigm shift.  The only one I know of who was a woman was Emmy Noether, without whose work the 20th-century shift replacing analysis with algebra at the center of mathematics would have been inconceivable.   (She also did some unrelated work in physics, causing Einstein and others to call her the most important female physicist of all time, but I don't really know anything about that.)
