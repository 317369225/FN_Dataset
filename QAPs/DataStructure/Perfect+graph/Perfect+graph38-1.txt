How do Indian people decide what soccer team to support in the World Cup?
I would like to answer it for Malayalis..As said in one of the post, Most of the Keralites especially from Malabar region will have an allegiance towards a team since the age of 10.Same goes for southern Kerala, but this football fever is not that intense. I became a Brazil fan at that age and is like that till now. I was absorbed by the beautiful football they played at 1994 World Cup. Especially of Romario and Bebeto. Most of the fans, Mainly of Brazil and Argentina, stays loyal to their team. They won't switch teams when their fav team fails. They cry. And then they simply wait for next world cup. You will find football fans fighting out for their favorites not only at time of world cup, but also at time of Euro cup, Copa America and Confederation Cup. There were intense when fans committed suicide when their team failed at world cup. That explains the craziness towards football. That's the pic of our office Kochi, Kerala, India
