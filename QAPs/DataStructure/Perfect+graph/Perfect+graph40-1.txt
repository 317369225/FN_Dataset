What are the algorithms to generate a random maze?
There are many algorithms to generate mazes from a rectangular grid, ensuring a unique solution. You can find a list here. The essential idea is to convert the grid into a graph and try to obtain a unique path on the graph from start vertex to end vertex. The obvious way to go about this is to generate a spanning tree of the graph. This can be done using any spanning tree generation algorithm. I had written a C++ program using randomised Kruskal's algorithm which generates uniqe-solution mazes from grids of arbitrary sizes. gnuplot is used to generate the visual representation. Here is a sample maze: The source code is present at github: mazegenerator.
