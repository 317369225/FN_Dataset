Why does Indian Railways still use the same dot-matrix printer?
The Dot matrix printers are cheap and easily available in the market. They can make carbon copies of the print out unlike non-impact printers. The printing costs are the lowest as compared to other printers. The printout fades gradually rather than coming to a halt suddenly. You therefore get plenty of time to change the ribbon before crisis emerges. They use paper continuously unlike other printers that require frequent change of paper. The maintenance cost is low as compared to other printers. They tolerate dirty and hot conditions as are found in industrial environments.
