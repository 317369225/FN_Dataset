Who has used Periscope? How would you rate this tool compared to Chartio?
Periscope has been a game changer at Flexport. It gives us a real-time dashboard that answers any questions we want to know about our business. Our engineering team loves it, they can generate incredible charts and tables with simple SQL that live forever, updating in real-time, so they don't have to keep generating the same reports for folks over and over again.  Our business teams love it even more.  P&G took 15 years to build a real-time dashboard showing them the health of all their business units. It took us about an hour with Periscope. The product keeps getting better too. Just in the last couple of months they rolled out two new features we're already using.  Heat mapping of geographic data is a really cool new feature we're excited to use. And they also rolled out the ability to port all our Salesforce data into our own database so we can track sales pipeline metrics. I recommend Periscope to all my friends building startups to the point where they are tired of hearing about it.
