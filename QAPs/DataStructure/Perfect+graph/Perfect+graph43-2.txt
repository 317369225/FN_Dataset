What is going on with (x^2 - 9)/(x+3)? Why do weird things happen when x gets close to -3?
These waves are the result of rounding error in your calculator. If your calculator had perfect accuracy, the graph would be a perfectly straight line, since [math](x^2-9)/(x+3) = x-3[/math] for all [math]x \neq 3[/math], and there would be no waves. I can't tell you for certain why you're seeing this specific artifact, but here's my best guess. What you're seeing is the following issue: when you take a number [math]x[/math] that's extremely close to 3, [math]x^2[/math] will be extremely close to 9. Your calculator only has finite accuracy, so it will truncate this number after a certain number of digits. This create sudden transitions, where this truncated number changes from (say) 9.00005 to 9.00004 to 9.00003, and so forth (in reality, it probably does this in binary, and there are many more "digits", but the idea is the same). The numerator is less accurate than the numerator, since a lot of accuracy is lost in rounding while computing [math]x^2[/math], while the denominator is probably computed quite well in scientific notation (since the leading zeros disappear, the remaing digits can be recorded to many places). So I think these little sine waves are actually little hyperbolas: each time the numerator has a transition in its last significant digit, it is replaces with a new constant, while the denominator continues to vary smoothly. So you get little pieces that look like the graph [math]y = C/(x+3)[/math], where C is a constant.
