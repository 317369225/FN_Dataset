How do Indian people decide what soccer team to support in the World Cup?
Brazil and Argentina are starting favorites, those who follow European Leagues are a little more discerning in selecting their favorite countries. Those who have played football during school/college pick the teams based on the performance of the teams during the groups stages. Finally there are those few who pick their favourites based on fan support.
