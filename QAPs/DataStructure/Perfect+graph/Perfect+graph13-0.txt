Graphs which have an odd number of perfect matchings correspond to invertible matrices. Is this true? How?
For bipartite graphs, yes. Any 0/1 square matrix [math]A[/math] can be naturally associated with a bipartite graph [math]G[/math] with vertices [math]x_1,x_2, \ldots, x_n[/math] in one part and [math]y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n [/math] in the other, and [math]x_i [/math] and [math]y_j[/math] adjacent if and only if [math]a_{ij}=1[/math]. We say that [math]A[/math] is the biadjacency matrix of [math]G[/math]. The permanent of the biadjacency matrix of a bipartite graph [math]G[/math] equals the number of perfect matchings of [math]G[/math]. Since [math]a+b[/math] and [math]a-b[/math] have the same parity, the determinant and the permanent have the same parity. In particular, if the graph has an odd number of perfect matchings, then the determinant of the biadjacency matrix is odd, and therefore non-zero. Counting perfect matchings in general graphs is much more difficult. Here is a reference: http://www.siam.org/meetings/ana...
