What are the best sources to learn web coding (in a short time)?
Learning how to code websites is a three step process: 1) Learning how to build websites using HTML and CSS 2) Learning how to serve pages and create HTML dynamically using a server 3) Learning how to make HTML pages interactive using JavaScript (and often jQuery as well) For #1, I personally recommend Twitter Bootstrap for getting started with HTML and CSS. For #2, you would probably need to choose between JavaScript, Python, Ruby and then dig into either the following frameworks, depending on the programming language of your choice: Django/Flask/Tornado (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby) or node.js (JavaScript). For #3, I recommend digging into jQuery, specifically using the Twitter Bootstrap JavaScript library. If you choose to learn JavaScript or Python, I created interactive tutorial websites dedicated for learning those programming languages at an introductory level using an online interpreter: Learn JavaScript - Free Interactive JavaScript Tutorial Learn Python - Free Interactive Python Tutorial I also recommend CodeAcademy to learn JavaScript and Python for a more organized learning process, my website is less structured than CodeAcademy.
