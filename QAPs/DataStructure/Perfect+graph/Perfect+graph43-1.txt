What is going on with (x^2 - 9)/(x+3)? Why do weird things happen when x gets close to -3?
I'll safely assume you're talking about this? It's pretty odd looking. As x approaches -3, the function as you can graphical figure out gets extremely odd, probably because it's reaching a point where it's undefined (@ x= -3) This in calculus would be called discontinuity, removable discontinuity at that, because     y = (x^2-9)/(x+3) can be rewritten can it not? It's also the same thing as y = x-3 , but with a small domain constraint, where x cannot equal 3 Here's what you would write in the event you see something like this and you evaluate it Hope this helps out a bit, I actually found that interesting.
