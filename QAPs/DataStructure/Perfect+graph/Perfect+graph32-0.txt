Does drinking a moderate amount of alcohol help prevent heart disease even if a person is in perfect condition?
This graph shows that drinking about one alcoholic drink every other day results in a lower mortality than drinking no alcohol at all: from http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/...  "Alcohol Dosing and Total Mortality in Men and WomenAn Updated Meta-analysis of 34 Prospective Studies" Augusto Di Castelnuovo et al 2006: From Page on onlinejacc.org  "Alcohol Consumption and Cardiovascular Mortality Among U.S. Adults, 1987 to 2002" by Mukamai et al, 2010. Other papers say that only wine is helpful in lowering mortality, not beer or liquor, even in smokers: from Biological Research "Alcohol and Mortality from All Causes                         " by Serge Renaud et al 2004: From: Dealcoholized Red Wine Decreases Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure and Increases Plasma Nitric Oxide Dealcoholized red wine lowers blood pressure more than red wine or gin, so there is something in red wine (maybe it's Resveratrol found in the skin of red grapes and/or other polyphenols) that's beneficial for your health, it isn't the alcohol: The lowering of blood pressure would prevent cardiovascular diseases from occuring.
