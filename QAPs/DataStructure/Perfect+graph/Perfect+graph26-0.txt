Does every star emit a full spectrum of light (like our sun does)?
Yes. All stars (including our sun) emit light at every frequency, from radio waves to gamma rays. They all follow the same formula, called Black-body radiation. EDIT: as several people who are capable of reading my answer but not of reading the other comments have pointed out, the sun is not a perfect blackbody. The graph below describes a perfect blackbody, but all real objects have atoms that absorb some specific frequencies. As you can see, it depends on the temperature, so stars of different temperatures will produce different ratios of wavelengths. Really hot stars will emit more ultraviolet and x-rays than our sun does, but since there's more energy there they'll also emit more visible light than our sun puts out.
