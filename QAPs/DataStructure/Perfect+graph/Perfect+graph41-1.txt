How can I tell if see a normal distribution?
Normal Distribution is a symmetric distribution. With this said, the mean, median and the mode are all the same for a normal distribution. The equality of the mean, median and mode makes a normal distribution curve to be a Bell curve . This is the graphical representation of a normal distribution curve :- Here in the graph you can see :- Mean = Median = Mode. Symmetry in the center. This means that the distribution is symmetrically skewed. 50% of the data is to the left to the mean and remaining 50% is to the right of the mean. And of course, it is a Bell shaped curve. Let us see a few histograms. Negatively skewed :- This will have a negatively skewed graph somewhat like this :- Positively Skewed :- This will have a positively skewed graph somewhat like :- Symmetrically Skewed :- The histogram and the graph of a symmetric distribution is like this :- But there is one problem with the histograms. When you construct a histogram, you often fail to correctly get a perfectly skewed graph. This is where Quantile plots are required. This is what a Normal Quantile Plot looks like :- You can also relate to normality using the Central limit theorem . But here you would require samples and all the samples should be independent. But if you want to tell if a data confines to a normal distribution you would find their mean = median = mode. (I wrote this because of the OP's comment to another answer by Jay Verkuilen.)Â
