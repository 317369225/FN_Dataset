How should I go about writing a research paper?
CS is mostly a conference based field, although ymmv depending on which country you are in. Assuming you have done top notch work and have an interesting and original piece of knowledge to share, you should look for call for papers from the various conferences that are related to networks and security. I can think of NSDI, CCS, USENIX SEC, OAKLAND. They have their own formats and page limits and such. Once you've gone through that, it's time to analyze where your work has a chance of being published. You should look around and see what each place expects. After that it's just a matter of writing it up, explaining your work/idea/finding and submitting and waiting to hear from them. Be careful: there are a lot of fake/ill-reputed journals looking to prey on researchers. The CS community in the US and Europe mostly publishes in conferences with the occasional journal paper in places like ACM TOC etc. Verify the repute of a journal before sending your work there or avoid journals completely.
