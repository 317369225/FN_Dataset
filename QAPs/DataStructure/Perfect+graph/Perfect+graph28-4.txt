How could I gain weight in a healthy way?
The simple equation to gain mass is: calories consumed > calories burnt. If you are skinny and want to get big, you need to eat big. Especially if you are a 'hard-gainer' ie, someone who eats whatever they want and doesn't put on much weight. Hit the gym hard for 3 or 4 days a week doing heavy sets with 6-9 reps, full body compound exercises such as squats, deadlifts, chest press, overhead raises and pullups. In addition to this, eat as much protein and carbs as you can get your hands on, as a famous bodybuilder once said - if it can move, eat it.
