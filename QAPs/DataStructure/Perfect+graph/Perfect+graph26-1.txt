Does every star emit a full spectrum of light (like our sun does)?
Yes. Depending on the temperature of the star the spectrum will shift though. Between the star and earth some light (frequencies) may be absorbed (which gives absorption bands) but that has nothing to do what the star emits. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wik...
