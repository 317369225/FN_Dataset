How did the Chinese GDP increase so rapidly after 1990 as compared to India?
This question has come up in dozens of forms in the past. The quick summary is that China moved out of socialism by 1978, while India's move away from socialism started 13 years late and even that is slow and unconvincing. 1. China's rapid urbanization vs. India's slow urbanizationIn the 1970s, India's urbanization was ahead of China's and since then China rapidly accelerated. India's progress has been slower due to a myriad of issues including the absence of good land acquisition laws. Urbanization in most countries directly correspond to GDP growth. 2. China was able attract foreign investment betterWith better policies towards capitalism, China was able to attract more investments especially from abroad. India's approach towards foreign investment has been especially cautious. 3. China was able to industrialize betterFor industrialization I will just give you one key chart - of automotive production. Look at the red dots to see when China and Korea overtook India. 4. Drastic change in working age populationDue to the one-child policy, China's new births dropped a lot and that meant that the working people as a % of population increased. With fewer kids to manage, the parents could also educate them and also save a lot. Caused an explosion in growth from this perfect storm. India's births also slowed down, but it was more gradual. However, that one-child policy has started to bite China now and as projected in this graph below, China's GDP growth might slow a bit. By 2025, India and China would have an equal % of working age population and India's birth rate will come to the level of the United States. Fertility rates (# of children per woman)
