Which student of IIT Kanpur writes best notes?
Somil Bansal (Y8) Even though the question says 'writes', I would go back into the past because people still have photocopies of his notes in case they need to refer in future. His notes (which were extensively photocopied by most of the Y9 and many Y10 people of Hall 9) were comprehensive and neat. And his notes were not just as it is copy of what was taught in class. In some courses, his notes had his own simplified insights and texts which explained more than what was taught in the class. Both in terms of the quality of the content and the number of people being benefited by them his notes are unparalleled.
