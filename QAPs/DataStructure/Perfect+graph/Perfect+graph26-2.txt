Does every star emit a full spectrum of light (like our sun does)?
Take Joshuah's answer and add a little detail. All stars create the same spectrum - in the radio field it's called "DC to daylight", but it means from 0 frequency (that's DC - it's not changing at any speed, except from the time you turn it on until the time you turn it off) to the highest frequency any sub-atomic particle can vibrate at (which is probably the frequecies of gamma rays, but who knows - someone may discover radiation at frequencies beyond that some day, just as Sir William Herschel discovered a "color" lower in frequency than red.  (We call it infrared - we also call it heat.) That's inside the star.  As the photons make their slow way out of the star (it takes a LONG time), some are absorbed by an atom of something, they hit which reradiates the energy at a different frequency, so there are holes (Fraunhofer lines) in the spectrum of the light leaving the outer fringes of the star's atmosphere (the corona) and the Fraunhofer lines are different for each star.
