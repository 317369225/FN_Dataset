What are your current all time stats on Quora?
There are lies, damn lies, then there are stats....(Twain, twisted). Seeing it in black and white made me realize that I spin my wheels more often than not.

Despite all I write about clothing, movies and sports (gad I'm so deep), my two most upvoted answers are to the following questions: What are the best "_____ walked into a bar" jokes? Would you rather get hit over the head with a giant dildo, a shovel, or a glass bottle? I've been a long time Quora user (1551496) whose activity dropped off in April this year.Â  Changes in life.
