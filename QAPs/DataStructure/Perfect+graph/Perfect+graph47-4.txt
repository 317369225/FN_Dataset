What are your current all time stats on Quora?
Ohhh I love this feature... I suggested something like this way back (others did too) and never expected it to be made. But there is one sadness it brings to mind... One tiny sadness. If you could ask a space alien only one question what would it be and why?My most viewed question only has a very small percentage of real answers. Most of the 175 answers to that question should be collapsed as joke answers IMHO. I do however give a very special thanks to those people like Joshua Engel who answered the question seriously like it was actually intended. I am very happy that my favorite question I ever asked on Quora What images will change the way a person sees the world after viewing them? is following in a close second. It is a terrible, beautiful, poignant and thought provoking question with both beautiful and horrific images but I really do think it is a huge asset to Quora that everyone needs to see from beginning to end at least once. Maybe If I can promote it to 2,500 people I can get it above the ET question... Sadly even for me and my 79,000 credits the 12k that it would take to promote that much is still pretty high.
