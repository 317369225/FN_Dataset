How can I tell if see a normal distribution?
Graphically you should consider a method such as the normal quantile plot (Qâ€“Q plot). Histograms and boxplots have their place but they can really hide a lot of information. The normal quantile plot is aimed squarely at assessing whether a sample is Gaussian. If you want to use a hypothesis test, there are a number of variations of the Normality test. These are useful but don't really tell you what the issue is. In general you would want to make use of both jointly, for instance using normality tests to screen through many variables (set your alpha level fairly stringently for this, say 0.01) and then follow up with quantile plots to see what the nature of non-normality is.
