What is one bad thing you are good at?
losing I try a hell lot of new stuff and lose a lot . But , I have kinda become immune to that , which brings us to the second bad thing I am good at . Not giving a fuck Seriously , I don't give a flying fuck about a lot of things valued very much conventionally .Â  Which , brings us to the third point . Usage of the word fuck I just use it generously and creatively . Though , by a misplaced sense of self righteousness , I am also trying to stop the usage .
