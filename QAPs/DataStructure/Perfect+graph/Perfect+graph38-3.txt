How do Indian people decide what soccer team to support in the World Cup?
Indians have the luxury to choose any team of their choice to support in football and that luxury ain't bad. Any Indian could support Team 1 at the start of the tournament and end up supporting a totally different team in the finals and also not be labelled as a traitor. An Indian can just enjoy all the games with the maximum spirit irrespective of the team that is playing, they can support a player for his good game without criticizing him for not being a player of your homeland. This is to an extent same as supporting IPL, not all the states of India have their team but the fan following is practically unlimited. 29 states and 8 teams don't quite match up right? For example, a cricket enthusiast from Gujarat may support Rajasthan or Mumbai or any team for that matter and enjoy all the matches. So, as an Indian we may feel bad for India not being one the 32 qualifiers, Patriotism exceeds everything but till the time India is one of the top 32 contenders one may support any team that he/she prefers to. A Sincere Request : Never pretend to be a fan of FIFA if you don't genuinely like the game. You may love cricket or any other game its not necessary for everyone to be a fan of soccer just because their friends are, everyone should only follow what they truly believe in.
