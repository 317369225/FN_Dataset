How did the Chinese GDP increase so rapidly after 1990 as compared to India?
There are two parts to this interesting question and I will be taking it one at a time. - Why did China's GDP increase so rapidly after the 1990s ? - Why was India's GDP growth rate slow during the 1990s ? First let's go to China ( 中国 ) China's growth during the past decades is famously known as The Chinese Economic Miracle which followed a Dual-sector model During the 1970 s China, like its Asian counterparts was poor and largely peasant Agrarian system 80 % of the labor was engaged in rural agricultural sector Agricultural labor productivity was low due to the presence of surplus labor relative to other scarce resources China saw revolutionary economic reforms under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping The Four Modernizations goal set Zhou Enlai and enacted by Deng Xiaoping became the cornerstone for China's growth The focus was on Agriculture, National Defense, Industry and Science & Technology Establishment of overseas on-the-job training and academic programs, set-up of information processing centers at key government units, and the development of methods to make informed decisions within the Chinese context based on market principles were the initial projects Rural liberalization led to development in the agricultural sector and to the establishment of Township and Village Enterprises  Steady marketization of economic activities and the integration of China into the international economy generated a large demand for labor which over time made China a manufacturing hub Setting up of Special Economic Zones of the People's Republic of China  attracted foreign companies and foreign investment which led to enormous increase in the productivity of the surplus labor in China The literacy rate in China was important factor which catapulted its future growth Especially the empowerment of women through education brought in the additional skilled labor along with the existing work force The government focused on infrastructure development prior to rapid industrialization Another important point which cannot be ignored is that being run by a single party, the Communist Party of China, there were not many oppositions to any of the proposed reforms or policies by the government which resulted in quick decisions and speedy development Now let's come to India ( भारत ) Let's start with a fact that India was under colonial rule for a long time and drained of resources, technology, education etc., India adopted a Soviet-type economic planning where the domestic markets are protected and was against profit The model focused on fixing prices on commodities thereby reducing possibilities of profits and market liberalization Since the domestic manufacturers were confident of government protection from losses, it lead to lethargy and lack of innovation in respective fields Though such shielding is appreciated for initial phases of development, the problem was the unwillingness to change policies with changing time Not opening the market early increased the gap between the International markets and the Indian markets In spite of launching five-year plans due to a number of political instabilities growth was sluggish  Though setting up of the Indian Institutes of Technology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences and National Institutes of Technology helped producing skilled engineers and doctors being a highly business unfriendly environment, India started to face brain-drain The Licence Raj, the main reason for such a business unfriendly ecosystem lead to poor Foreign direct investment Even N. R. Narayana Murthy once commented in an interview on how the Licence Raj posed immense difficulties during his early years in Infosys The older generation was the victim of the Licence Raj. Of the 21 years of my CEOship, about 11 years were lost in darkness. I used to make 50 visits to Delhi for small things. We did not have current account convertibility; we could not open offices. To import even a small thing, it required huge efforts. India did not have success with Special economic zone like China due to the lack of infrastructure to complement the industrialization Literacy rate in India is another concerning factor, at 74.4 % To put things to perspective China reached this figure in the mid 1980 s But over the past decade India seems to catch up with the international competition by relaxing certain policies pertaining to starting a business. One should also understand that merely increasing the GDP of a nation does not mean the state is developed. Rather other factors like Human Development Index , pollution, wealth inequality should also be considered. Thanks for reading.
