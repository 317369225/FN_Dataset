How did the Chinese GDP increase so rapidly after 1990 as compared to India?
Two things: Early Mover advantage and access to a bigger export market (surplus trade). Early Mover advantage: It was China's willingness to open up its economy during the 80's and the higher FDI followed there upon helped China to grow rapidly. After Mao's death in 1976, China was ready for a new thought. Deng Xiaoping's reforms helped the Chinese economy get a new shape. History of the People's Republic of China (1976â€“89) Some of the ground work for that was already done by Henry Kissinger. So China got access to a biggest market in the world and using the cash inflows to invest in itself helped it's economy greatly. In comparison, Economic liberalisation in India started in 1991, more than a decade later than China. After 2008 financial crisis, global economy slowed down, so the economy of China is cooling down too. But China got sufficient time build its infra but India's infra is not completely on the same level to compete though it seems to be playing the catch up now with a little higher growth rate than China. Access to bigger export market: Though India too opened up its economy, except IT and Pharma, its other export industries did not grow much. So India is a trade deficit country while China is a trade surplus nation. Rest of the markets were captured and pioneered by China as it had built its infra and has competitive advantages as an early mover. But twenty years from now, will China enjoy the same advantages? Only if India and other countries do not make progress. But what you need to observe is, China and India are not a recent phenomenon. Both India and China were economic superpowers few centuries ago and now getting back to their grooves. I wrote a blog post on that subject: Are India and China growing or recovering?
