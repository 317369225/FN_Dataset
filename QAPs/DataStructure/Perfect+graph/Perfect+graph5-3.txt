What is one bad thing you are good at?
I  have a unique feature of killing mosquitoes at will. Of course given they are abundant around me at that particular instance. As I have been living at places with innumerable mosquitoes since my childhood, it was only natural to hate them. The fact that no organisation has started a movement for mosquito protection only helped. I would see people around me, friends and family deeply troubled by these swanky li'l pests and helpless. The general method to kill them is through repelant liquids or coils or creams. This led me think. What I started to do was observe their behaviour. I would sleep without a repel method and let them bite me. I suffered many bites. But over this course I extracted patterns. Based on these findings of behavioural patterns of the mosquitoes, I can literally just wave my hand and kill a mosquito at will. It is as rare to find a dodo, as it is to see me missing a shot. What this ability does to me, is make me free of one more tension in daily life. I don't worry about those coils and liquids anymore. And I am really very good at this. I can just hear to a mosquito sound and kill it in sleep. And I make sure I kill as many possible before I go to bed.  The most important thing, they aren't infinite. No. If you keep killing, you will reach the end of the clan. Thanks God. Updated 94w ago • View Upvotes
