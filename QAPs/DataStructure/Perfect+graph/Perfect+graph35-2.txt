How should I go about writing a research paper?
Structure (how to write the paper) Abstract (150-200 words summary of your paper) - advice: leave a page in the beginning and write this when you are dome writimg your whole paper. Introduction Literature Review (consists of background info on your subject and why you chose that specific topic to write on) Materials and Methods (if you are going to use any for your oractical research, including survey) Results and Discussion Conclusion Future Scope References How to publish the paper Do a google search for available online journals for your topic Choose a few journals you want to publish your work in (best to base it on relevance) E-mail them with your paper title, abstract and personal details and ask if this can be published in their journal. Hope for a response. If no response within few days, try other journals. If positive response, then send them a pdf format of your paper. But before that, proofread it for zero grammatical and spelling errors.
