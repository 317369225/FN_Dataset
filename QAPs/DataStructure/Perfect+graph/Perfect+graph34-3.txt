What are some good ways to improve English grammar and writing abilities for a non native speaker?
READ as much as possible. It improves the flair of your writing subconsciously and it also takes care of your grammar most of the times.Â  WRITE as often as possible. In my experience, once you stop writing, it kind of start creating vacuums of expression and ideas. Try not to break the rhythm and flow. IMITATE whenever you cannot innovate. The suggestion has questionable morals but I feel good imitators can turn into better innovators. For a start, pick up some unusual or interesting expressions, innovative usage of words and practice it often. After some time you'll feel the urge to improvise on it and before you know it consciously, you'll go innovative with the usage.(There is a difference between outright copying/lifting and drawing an inspiration from something.) Good Vocabulary and good writing aren't perfectly correlated. In fact sometimes it becomes a hindrance in propagating your thoughts. But one still needs to acquire those (sometimes esoteric) words in his armory as there is no substitute to a word which speaks your mind and replace a filler. I guess for a non-native English speakers, anything with and anything in English should help him/her improve the skills but you'd start surprising yourself once you start thinking in English!!!
