Should I avoid becoming an investment banker?
You are looking for a career in finance. Investment banking is only one part of finance. Much of investment banking is -mergers & acquisitions -advising and making value determinations (often related to the above M&A) -bringing new securities to market (called underwritting) which is a SELL-SIDE activity. -making markets in securities, often securities the i-bank has under written. -hedging activities, both for clients and the i-bank -proprietary trading (prop trading) which is often related to hedging On what is called the BUY-SIDE, there are large pools of money - Pension funds, University & charity endowments, Mutual funds, hedge funds, etc. >>It sounds like you might be happier on the BUY-SIDE of investing. I would also speculate that you might prefer an organization that tends towards value investing, contrarian investing, or global investing rather than one oriented to trading and speculation. Value investing tends to have longer time horizons and less portfolio turnover than average, and most of the time does not have the frantic pace of some trading. Private equity & Venture Capital also require very long hours. ***** ***** You might want to consider a summer job at a place that runs a large number of mutual funds, like Fidelity, Wellington, Vanguard, etc. The larger places have their on in-house training systems, and you will also get a huge network of connections from as large organization.  Also the large organization experience  acts like a "brand" when you have moved on.
