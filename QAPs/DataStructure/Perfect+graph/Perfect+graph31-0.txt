Who has used Periscope? How would you rate this tool compared to Chartio?
As a longtime Quora user, I've seen founders show up to promote their products and laughed. I guess this question is my comeuppance. Periscope has grown about 15X in the last year, so I feel confident saying that the answer to your question is: Yes, people have used it. As for why you'd use it instead of (or in addition to) Chartio or other tools, the reasons tend to be: You want your analyses to run much faster than they would otherwise. Unlike pure visualization tools, Periscope has a sophisticated caching layer that averages a 150X speedup over customer databases. You want fine-grained control over the visualization. Periscope tends to be the choice of super technical analysts on super data-driven teams, and they have pushed us to build a ton of customization into our visualizations. You want to actually enjoy writing SQL to get your data. Our users spend several hours per day in the SQL editor. We've taken inspiration from some of the best-loved programming IDEs in crafting a superior SQL editing experience. All of these sum up to make Periscope the analysis suite of choice for fulltime, professional data analysts on exceptionally data-driven teams: It's very fast, it's very customizable, and the editing experience is first class. This brings us to why you might choose not to go with Periscope. (Yes, it has happened.) In my experience the reason tends to be: You want something less sophisticated for a non-analyst to use in making his or her own simple charts. If you don't know SQL or you prefer a drag-n-drop interface, I'd hazard that you won't be happy using it. Hope this helps! Updated 38w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
