Does every star emit a full spectrum of light (like our sun does)?
Joshua's answer is correct and nicely detailed. However the upper layers of a star are considered the atmosphere and they too belong to the star. Here we find cooler gas and ions of elements and, depending on what constituent elements are present, additional absorption and emission lines which overlay the black body spectrum. This is exciting as it helps us know more about a star. For one example, we can gauge metallicity by which we can determine it to be first, second , or later generations stars.
