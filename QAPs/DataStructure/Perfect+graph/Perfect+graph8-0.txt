Which have been some landmark STEM publications (papers or theses) that have either opened up an entirely new area of knowledge or completely finished off one?
I have some examples in mind, but i'm sure that many others exist ! In Physics : The PhD thesis of Louis de Broglie about the "Matter wave" theory. This thesis led to the Nobel Prize of Physics (1929). The PhD thesis of Marie Curie "Research on Radioactive Substances". Probably one of the most famous scientific document of the 20th century. She won 2 Nobel Prize (Physics and Chemistry) not especially for this thesis, but it formed the core of her researchs. The PhD thesis of Albert Einstein (Maybe you have heard about him ?) “A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions”. It laid down the framework for his next breakthrough work on Brownian Motion. It seems that Einstein’s doctoral thesis is his most cited work to date. The PhD thesis of Richard Feynman “The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics”. In Mathematics : The PhD thesis of Maria Chudnovsky in Graph Theory, which proved the strong perfect graph theorem (giving a characterization of perfect graphs). The letter that Évariste Galois gave to his friend Auguste Chevalier just before he died (at 20 years old !). This letter laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory, two major branches of abstract algebra. The PhD thesis (28 pages !!) of John Forbes Nash, Jr., “Non Cooperative Games” formed the building block for the Nash equilibrium, and his subsequent Nobel Prize in Economics (1994). Those are some examples among many others ! Note : I believe/know that the thesis of Maria Chudnovsky is not really comparable to the others, who are some of the most important papers of all time, but I've thought about it first because I'm interested about these works !
