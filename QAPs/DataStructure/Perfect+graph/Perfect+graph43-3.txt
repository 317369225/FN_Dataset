What is going on with (x^2 - 9)/(x+3)? Why do weird things happen when x gets close to -3?
That's your calculator's limit of error kicking in. Truncation, rounding errors, bit-wise operator resolution restrictions, all that jazz gets very lively when plotted in a Cartesian coordinate system at extremely high resolution! Plot that equation on Mathway | Graphing Calculator and zoom in like you said to the point (-3,-6). At first you will see what looks like a gap in an otherwise straight line. (That is actually an astoundingly steep vertical limit at x = -3, which drives the plot to y --> -/+ infinity, by the way.) Here comes the fun part. As you approach accuracy of 0.0000001 on the number line, you'll notice the waviness similar to that described in your original post. If you grab (click and hold) and drag the graph just a smidgen one way or the other; then you'll see the plotted values changing and shifting around on the Cartesian plane! That is the most apparently obvious example I can provide to you of what happens when the scoped (zoomed-in) resolution of a display area far surpasses the resolution of the digital device and algorithms tasked with processing the formula being plotted into it. And so that is what's going on with (x^2 - 9)/(x + 3) and why weird and bizarre things happen on your calculator when x gets close to -3 and you're zoomed in to an accuracy of about -2.9999999. Keep trying to break things. Testing limits. Experimenting on fringe conditions. The world can never have enough revolutionary innovators or brilliant scientists!
