Why does Indian Railways still use the same dot-matrix printer?
Firstly they are very robust, suitable for heavy duty and I dont think that moving to advanced printer is advisable as we know how efficient our Indian Railways is, Secondly the printing is cheap Thirdly, when it comes to new technologies, railways has hardly shown interest in them, just have a look at our trains, by international standards one wont call them anything better than a 1970s train, perhaps even worse seeing the maintainence and service.
