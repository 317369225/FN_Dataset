What would be the perfect chart to compare different kind of FIAT currencies?
Standard is to calculate the strength of a currency by creating a trade weighted basket (i.e. EUR against its trading partners USD, CNY etc, weighted by volume of trade against total). Referencing wiki: Trade-weighted effective exchange rate index. Gold and other commodities have their own intrinsic supply and demand driven factors and may make comparison difficult.
