What are some good ways to improve English grammar and writing abilities for a non native speaker?
To be absolutely honest with you, there isn't an actual way to improve. If you're blogging on your own, you only have yourself as the fallback. As you are your own backup, it depends how good you are (or can be) in self-correction. The good news is that most people's self-correction gets better over time with sustained practice in writing. In short, the more you write, the better your writing skills will be. You know that writing cannot be done in isolation, so plenty of reading will contribute to overall improvement. One stopgap measure is to add in another person to your blog as a contributor, editor or admin. That other person then acts as your copyeditor. The problem with that, of course, is copyediting does take time and effort, and that person may (or will) balk at the workload for you (unless you pay the person, which may or may not be possible in your case). Another stopgap measure is to use online tools. There are a number of popular ones (hemmingwayapp.com and grammarly.com come to mind immediately). Problem is, they're mechanistic and rely on dead-pan recognition to give "standardised" results, which may or may not be useful for your purposes. Other than that, perhaps you can pick up some tips from my various posts on Quora: How on earth do I write this? by The Naked Listener on Quora What do you want me to say about this? by The Naked Listener on Quora A Crash-Test Dummy's Loot Guide to Blogging (Part 1) by The Naked Listener on Quora A Crash-Test Dummy's Loot Guide to Blogging (Part 2: Finale) by The Naked Listener on Quora The ideal length for everything ... well, almost by The Naked Listener on Quora Blogging must-haves for fun and profit by The Naked Listener on Quora Each of those posts take only an average 7 minutes of reading time.
