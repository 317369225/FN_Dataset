What are the very basic algorithms that every Computer Science student must be aware of?
A nice afternoon read is the "Magic Algorithms" page: The Aggregate Magic Algorithms While it's neither "very basic" nor a "must be aware of" list in general, I would suggest that it's a lot of fun to study and comes in very handy at times. For the "must be aware of" algorithms, they are more related to data structures, and can be found in the famous Aho, Ullman etc. book: Data Structures and Algorithms: Alfred V. Aho, Jeffrey D. Ullman, John E. Hopcroft: 9780201000238: Amazon.com: Books
