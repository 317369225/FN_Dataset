Who are some women in mathematics most people do not know about, but should? Why?
Some more mathematicians who happen to be women, closer to the present day: Marina Ratner proved deep and fundamental results in ergodic theory. Maryam Mirzakhani is considered to be on the short list to receive a Fields medal this year. She won gold medals at two IMOs, was a Clay Mathematics Institute research fellow, and delivered a plenary lecture at ICM 2010. Claire Voisin is a leading expert on Hodge Theory and won the EMS prize in 1992. Shafi Goldwasser is one of the world's premier researchers in the mathematics of computer science and cryptography. She has won the  Gödel Prize twice, and went on to receive the Turing Award in 2012. Cathleen Morawetz made fundamental contributions to the theory of partial differential equations. She is to date the only woman to have received the Steele prize for lifetime achievement. She was also honored with the National Medal of Science and numerous other prizes and honors. Karen Vogtmann made major contributions to the study of free groups. Lisa Sauermann has one of the most astonishing all-time track records in the history of the International Math Olympiad, achieving one silver and four gold medals, the last of which with a perfect score of 42.
