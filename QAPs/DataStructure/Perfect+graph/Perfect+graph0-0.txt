Are trees perfect graphs?
Yes. A tree is a perfect graph. Let's look at the definitions:- Tree : A tree is an acyclic undirected graph Perfect graph : A graph in which the chromatic number of every induced subgraph is equal to the size if the largest clique of that subgraph Chromatic number of a graph : The minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of that graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color Clique of a graph : A subset of vertices of an undirected graph, such that its induced subgraph is complete, that is, if you have a subgraph of size 'k', and all the vertices are adjacent to each other - this means you have a k sized clique. It is easy to observe that the size of the largest clique you can have in a tree is 2 (you cannot have a clique of size 3 as it would involve a triangle - a cycle which is not allowed in a tree). Therefore every subgraph of a tree will have a maximum clique of size 2. Also, the chromatic number of a tree is equal to 2. Try and visualize a tree as levels of nodes. The root is the 0th level, the children of the root are at the 1st level and their children on the 2nd level and so on. So you can view the tree as nodes belonging to alternating even and odd levels. Since nodes belonging to the same level are not adjacent, each level can be colored using the same two colors ( color 1 for even levels and color 2 for odd levels ). So it follows that the maximum sized clique of any subgraph of a tree is 2 and so is the chromatic number. Thus the answer!
