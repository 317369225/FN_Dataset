Which student of IIT Madras writes the best notes?
In electrical 2010 batch, there are two contenders. Nitin Prasad and Praveen Venkatesh. Both write notes very meticulously. Nitin Prasad even has multiple colors for various sections of the notes. Both have amazing hand writing. If I were to choose one of them, I would say Praveen Venkatesh because he also adds his own intuition to the notes which make understanding the topic really easy.
