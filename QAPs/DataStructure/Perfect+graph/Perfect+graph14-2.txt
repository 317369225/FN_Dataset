Where can I find an example of a perfectly organized Chart of Accounts for small business accounting?
I second Garrick Saito's response: your chart of accounts is a customized accounting  system, designed specifically for your company that aligns with your financial structure and offers the level of detail required in your financial statements. Here's a little more detail about the essential categories of accounts: Assets - everything your company owns (or is  owed), including current assets. fixed assets, accounts receivable,  inventory. In this category, also include an account for accumulated  depreciation for each asset. Liabilities – everything your company owes (or  may owe). Current liabilities include your accounts payable and taxes  (both payroll and sales). Long-term liabilities might include a mortgage  or some other long-term debt account. Owner’s equity – your business investments. This  account should include common stock and preferred stock, in the case  that you have investors at some point. Revenue – Sales revenue is your primary source  of income. You may also choose to include accounts for sales discounts  or returns. It’s also a good idea to create an interest income account  for any income earned on company investments. Consider, too, the cost of  goods and other related sales costs under your revenue account. Expenses – For expenses, you may want to start  with the Schedule C IRS Form. While the point of your chart of accounts  isn’t merely to help you to file your taxes, this tax form is still a  good starting point to build on for creating your expense account. This  form includes such things as advertising, contract labor, employee  benefits, legal and professional services, repairs, and more.
