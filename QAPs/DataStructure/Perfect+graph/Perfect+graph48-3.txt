What is an intuitive explanation of A* search?
Great answers here but they mostly go pretty deep. I wanted to try leaving a much more simplified answer (specifically with weighted graphs). Suppose you have a map with a bunch of destinations. You assign "weights" to every connection (between points). This could be simply the distance, or it could also include things like height and terrain type. It can be anything you need it to be. Now when you want to find the shortest path from your location to a destination you simply get the path with the lowest weight. A* does this but it also calculates a heuristic to make it more efficient. To simplify the explanation of this process it essentially draws a line directly to the target in order to choose the path(s) that is more likely to be the shortest. This helps to figure out if for example the path it is looking at isn't even in the right direction. Anyway that's as simple as I can make it (at least typing on my phone). Hopefully it does help and not confuse. The other answers are better information but this is intended for simplicity.
