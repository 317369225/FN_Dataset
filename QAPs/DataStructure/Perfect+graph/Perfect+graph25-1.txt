How should one balance teaching to an exam against ensuring genuine learning?
I think as teachers we get so caught up in tests, and test results, that the actual learning is sacrificed. Sure, I can teach anyone the quadratic equation, or PEMDAS, but teaching some one when to use it, and why to use it and how to use it, that is the most important task. Teach someone to cook fish, and they won't go hungary for the night, teach someone to fish, and they won't starve to death. Understanding the subject matter, understanding why things happen, will lead to better grades.
