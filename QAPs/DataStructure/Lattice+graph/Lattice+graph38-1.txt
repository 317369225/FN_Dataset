What is the highest math class that you found application?
As a PhD student in theoretical math, pretty much any math class that I have taken has some sort of application for me. But, perhaps, that is cheating. One aspect of my research is to better understand thin groups and how they work. Thin groups have a surprisingly down to earth application---they are a key part of a particular method of numerical integration (i.e. finding an approximation of the volume under a surface). There is an open problem in the theory of thin groups called the local-global conjecture. If we could find a way to prove it, it would show that this method of numerical integration is optimal in a specifically defined way.
