What are some interesting examples of graphs with uncountably many vertices?
A graph in which the vertices are all points in the plane, and edges connect each pair of points with Euclidean distance 1. This graph does have a finite chromatic number: we know how to color the entire plane using 7 colors so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We also know a reasonably easy argument that the chromatic number of this graph must be at least 4. And that's where we are stuck: the actual minimum number of colors needed is still unknown. This open problem is known as the Hadwigerâ€“Nelson problem. There are also some known results on graphs with uncountably many vertices. For example, it can be proved that a graph with uncountably many vertices of degree 3 and more cannot be planar. (This is actually a very nice exercise!) Also, all kinds of lattices can be visualized as graphs. For instance: real numbers and the relation [math]\leq[/math] on them subsets of natural numbers, ordered by inclusion relations of equivalence on the natural numbers, ordered by refinementThere are many such graphs with uncountably many nodes.
