How should I prepare for the CS 124 (Data Structures and Algorithms) midterm at Harvard?
I'm currently taking the class - this is only speculation. If my advice turns out to be wrong, please don't blame me! Other topics worth studying include minimum spanning trees, greedy algorithms, and the Fast Fourier Transform. Find dynamic programming algorithms questions and do them. The first midterm did not emphasize specific graph-traversal algorithms from class. Instead, it focused on writing algorithms and proving their runtimes / correctness. Similarly, I expect this second midterm to deemphasize specific topics like the Fourier Transform (which I imagine are difficult to write problems for) in favor of more general algorithms questions. DP (and to a lesser extent greedy) algorithms specifically come to mind because of their diversity and their comparative ease to write. Sample problems You have an M x N lattice grid with "blocks" on certain points that you cannot occupy. If you can only move right and down, how many ways are there to get from the top-left corner to the bottom-right? Resources This TopCoder post (HT Diane Yang) The Introduction to Algorithms textbook has a long chapter on DP. For quick practice, Gayle has a helpful chapter on Recursion / Dynamic Programming (with solutions) in Cracking the Coding Interview. Updated 95w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
