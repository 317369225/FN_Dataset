What's some stuff that MIT students like?
Free food. There's an entire community at MIT of shameless free food enthusiasts. There are several mailing lists that exist solely for the dissemination of information about free food. Depending on the location and time of day, broadcasting to this list might result in a ferocious pack  of vultures[1] descending on even the tiniest bits of food. Many of the efforts undertaken in the search for free food are quite bold. It's fairly commonplace to see people walk into a company info session (or other type of talk), grab a plate of food, and immediately walk out again. Some are audacious enough to crash closed events in order to find a free meal. The most brazen adventurers, however, don't just settle for a single plate—they'll walk straight into an event and back out again with a full serving tray or more of food. In light of this, some of the more astute event organizers have responded by posting guards around food tables to thwart this type of behavior. There is actually so much free food at MIT that it's probably possible to survive without spending any money at all on eating. At one point, I personally went over two months eating at least one meal worth of free food every week day. (This, however, was probably not the healthiest thing to do as free food tends towards the likes of pizza and greasy Chinese food.) After five years at the Institute though, some foods have been ruined for me forever—Bertucci's pizza (probably the most common form of free food) is no longer stomachable, and even the smell of it is unsettling. -- Incidentally, "vultures" is the name of one of the email lists.
