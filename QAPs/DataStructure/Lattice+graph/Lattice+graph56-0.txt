What kind of data structures could be used in a natural language processing project?
There are some more specific data structures for NLP when dealing with ambiguity, which is encountered in all aspects of NLP. Word lattices are used in early stages in both speech and text segmentation. They are a specific kind of Directed acyclic graph (DAG). Confusion networks seem to be a more advanced/powerful relative of the lattice just mentioned. Parse forests are ambiguity-supporting relatives of parse trees. One key subtype is the Shared packed parse forest (SPPF). I am not an expert, just an interested amature ploughing through papers in the field.
