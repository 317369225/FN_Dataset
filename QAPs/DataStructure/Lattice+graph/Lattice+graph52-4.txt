What is the difference between homomorphism and homeomorphism?
Topological spaces, groups, and rings are examples of sets endowed with some additional structure.  A structure-preserving map between two topological spaces is one that sends points that are "close" to one another in the first to points that are "close" to one another in the second (a continuous map); such a map that is also a bijection is called a homeomorphism.  A structure-preserving map between two groups is one that preserves the group operation (a homomorphism); such a map that is also a bijection is called an isomorphism. In the language of category theory, we can say that homeomorphisms are isomorphisms (invertible morphisms) in the category of topological spaces, while homomorphisms are morphisms in the category of groups.
