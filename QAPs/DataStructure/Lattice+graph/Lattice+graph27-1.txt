What are some interesting examples of graphs with uncountably many vertices?
Such things often arise as large categories. For instance, consider abstractly having a node in a graph for each set S that exists. Then draw directed edges from node S_a to node S_b, one for every function that exists from set S_a to set S_b. The result is a graph of all sets and functions between them, commonly called the category Set. You would need lots of paper and ink to draw this graph. I'd be interested to see some nontrivial examples that don't come from category theory! Updated 47w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
