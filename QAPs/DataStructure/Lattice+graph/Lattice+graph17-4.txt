Do good mathematicians visualize everything (even algebra)?
I've a feeling that different mathematicians use different techniques. Some are highly visual and others operate on a more algebraic view point. I remember a plenary at the British Mathematical Congress by Martin Rees where he contrasted the algebraic and geometric approaches to mathematics and how they can work together. Myself, I'm very much in the visual camp, even more than that I like creating interactive visualisations so you can alter various parameters and see the effect. I've developed a number of such apps on my website singsurf.org. To reply to the comment. To my mind the real entities in mathematics,  are geometrical  shapes and the equations are just ways of describing those shape. This is probably quite an extreme view. From this view I think there is an over emphasis on polynomials which work nicely algebraically but don't represent much in the real world. Quadratics in particular get a lot of attention because they are nice and easy to solve algebraically, but are unrepresentative of many real world equations.
