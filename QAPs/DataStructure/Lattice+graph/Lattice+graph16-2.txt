What are the most unexpected places you've seen determinants come up?
A closed-form expression for the number of ways to tile an M by N rectangle with 1x2 and 2x1 dominoes is: [math]\displaystyle\prod_{m = 1}^M \prod_{n = 1}^N \left(4 \cos^2 \left(\frac{\pi m}{M+1}\right) + 4 \cos^2 \left(\frac{\pi n}{N+1}\right)\right)^{\frac{1}{4}}[/math] In particular (believe it or not): For any choice of M, N, this expression evaluates to an integer. The expression evaluates to 0 if and only if M and N are both odd. If you hold either M or N constant at 2 and vary the other, you produce the Fibonacci numbers. This result was independently found in 1961 by P.W. Kasteleyn and by H.N.V. Temperley and Michael E. Fisher.  It came up as a problem in statistical mechanics; it's a simplification of a problem in which you assume that diatomic molecules take up two neighboring cells in a lattice and want to find the number of possible arrangements of molecules in the case where all cells are filled and where the lattice is planar. The proof involves reformulating the problem as finding the number of perfect matchings in a graph.  This can be expressed as the permanent of the adjacency matrix, but finding the permanent of even {0, 1}-matrices is hard (#P complete).  However, determinants can be computed efficiently, and so the remainder of the proof consists of finding a matrix whose determinant is equal to the permanent we want to know; it turns out that by choosing an appropriate signing of the edges in the graph, we can show that the signed adjacency matrix has determinant equal to the permanent of the original graph's adjacency matrix, which has the closed form above.
