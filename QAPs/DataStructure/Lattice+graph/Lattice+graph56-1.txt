What kind of data structures could be used in a natural language processing project?
I have worked in the area of NLP for a while, and like most people who work in NLP, never focussed on what Data Structures to choose, as opposed to what techniques to apply. Let's understand how data structures will be useful in NLP based projects. Besides storing and retrieving text (strings), data structures would not play other part, in determining the performance of the outcome. What we need is efficient storage and faster retrieval of text, in projects of these sorts. So keeping the above in mind, my choice would be "trees", "heaps", and "hashtable".
