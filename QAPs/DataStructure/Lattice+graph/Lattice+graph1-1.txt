What is the difference between a mathematical lattice and a directed acyclic graph?
A lattice is more specific than you need.  What you are after is a (strict) poset, for example < (<= would be non-strict, which is similar).  Think of an arrow in your DAG as a <.  The < must be irreflexive (e.g., no self loops in a node), asymmetric (e.g., you don't allow two nodes to point at each other, it is always one way only), and transitive e.g. "reachable" (if node a < b and b < c, then a < c too).  Note that if you WERE to have a cycle (no longer a DAG), say c < a too, then it would no longer qualify as a poset, because it would break asymmetry (a < c and c < a but asymmetry says this can't be so!). A lattice is a "pointy" poset, e.g., every two nodes has a common point above and below them (eventually). Even more specific is a bounded lattice, which has an ultimate pointy "top" and an ultimate pointy "bottom".
