What are the important topics in engineering mathematics for the GATE CS 2016?
The thing which makes GATE a little difficult to crack is it's vast syllabus. The exam will touch almost each topic, therefore if you wish to score top rank, you cannot afford to drop any topic, not even web technologies. Maths is a subject which prepared nicely will help you get 30 marks just like that. And it will also help you in future, since maths is all prevalent. So my advice would be to prepare Maths very nicely. Nonetheless, I will mention important subtopics within each main topic. Logic: Inference rules and quantifiers Combinatory: P&C, Recurrence relations Probability: Conditional, Random variables, expectation Set theory: Relations, partial orders, lattice Graph Theory: Spanning trees, colouring, planarity, isomorphism Linear Algebra: Full Numerical Methods: Newton Raphson, LU decomposition Calculus: Limits, Integration 1 Question from each main topic is almost guaranteed.
