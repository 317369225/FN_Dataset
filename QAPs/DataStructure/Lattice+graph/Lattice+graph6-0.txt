How can I solve [math]p^q - q^p = 1844[/math]?
A trivial solution for any equation of the form [math]p^q - q^p = n[/math] is [math]p=n+1,q=1[/math]. However, these solutions are obviously uninteresting. We are looking for solutions with [math]p,q>1[/math]. Just by trying out a few small numbers I easily found one non-trivial solution: [math]3^7 - 7^3 = 1844[/math] There may be other solutions, since I have not proven that this is the only non-trivial solution. In general, the equation [math]p^q - q^p = n[/math] is an exponential Diophantine equation, and no general method is known for solving this type of equations. I think it's safe to assume that there is no closed-form non-trivial general solution [math]p(n),q(n)[/math] that works for any [math]n[/math]. In fact, I'm not sure there even is a solution for any [math]n[/math], but again, this statement needs to be proven. For a specific [math]n[/math] it's very easy to write code (for example in Mathematica) that will find a solution if it exists and if the numbers involved are small enough. An expert in number theory will probably have much more to say on this subject :)
