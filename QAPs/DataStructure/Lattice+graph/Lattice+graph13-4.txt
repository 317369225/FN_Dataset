Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?
I would suggest to use both if you have the choice. They complete each other gracefully and will make your life better if you leverage their strengths and avoid their weaknesses. Here is a comparative list. R Pluses R is great for prototyping and for statistical analysis. It has a huge set of libraries available for different statistical type analysis. Check The Comprehensive R Archive Network. RStudio IDE is a definitely a big plus. It eases most of the tedious tasks and fastens your workflow. Minuses The syntax could be obscure sometimes. It is harder to integrate to a production workflow. In my opinion, it is better suited for "consultancy-type" tasks. The libraries documentation isn't always user friendly. Python Pluses Python is great for scripting and automating your different data mining pipelines. It is the de facto scripting language nowadays. It also integrates easily in a production workflow. Besides, it can be used across different parts of your software engineering team (back-end, cloud architecture...). The scikit-learn library is awesome for machine-learning tasks. Ipython (and its notebook) is also a powerful tool for exploratory analysis and presentations. Minuses It isn't as thorough for statistical analysis as R, but it has come a long way these recent years In my opinion, the learning curve is steeper than R, since you can do much more with Python. To conclude Use R and Python. Learn how they inter-operate together. Start with one and then add the other to your workflow. As I like to remind myself: "choosing the tools should never be the primary problem". When in doubt, use the one that is available and that gets the work done quickly. Hope this helps!
