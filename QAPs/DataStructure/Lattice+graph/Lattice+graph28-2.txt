Which tools do you use for visualization? What do you think of Tableau? R? SAS? (for graphs).
If you don't want to learn programming, then Tableau is right for you. Otherwise the answer depends on what you know already and if you're willing to learn more. R and SAS are tools as well as languages. SAS is not bad for basic visualizations and they even have a Tableau lookalike now, but SAS licenses are expensive and not worth it if you ask me. R is better and free, and if you invest time in learning ggplot2 in R you will have a powerful visualization tool at your disposal. But if you're new to R then expect a learning curve. If you want ultimate flexibility and the ability to create interactive plots take a look at D3.js. But once again be prepared to spend a lot of time learning it (it in this case is JavaScript and basic HTML stuff).
