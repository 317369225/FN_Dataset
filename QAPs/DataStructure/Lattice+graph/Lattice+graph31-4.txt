What are the mathematics needed for pursuing a PhD in Theoretical Computer Science and specifically in algorithm research?
The three pillars of TCS ( at least the math part ) are Probability. You need to have good idea about Markov chains, CLT, convergence and if possible, martingales. But I seldom saw application of continuous measures in the TCS. Linear algebra. I cannot emphasis more. This is a must. Probability is used mainly as a tool set for analysis, but linear algebra, more of than not, gives you idea of improvement. Combinatorics. Classic and vintage. And used left and right in almost all the legs of TCS.As you grow as a researcher you pick up other different topics befitting your orientation. They are not must but they will immensely help you. Most of the topics are already mentioned in Obinna's answer.
