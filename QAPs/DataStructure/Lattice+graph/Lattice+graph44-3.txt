What are some seriously insightful or enlightening infographics?
Wow, this is a tough one! It took some time to choose among almost 19.000 infographics (on Visual Loop), and it's virtually impossible to pick "the best". So, I'm going with GDS' work about space exploration, mainly because I love the subject, and the design is great. http://www.flickr.com/photos/gds...
