Who is the most diverse mathematician of all time?
The main contenders would be Euler and Gauss, both of whom worked in pretty much every area that existed in their time (and both of whom invented several areas that exist in our time.)Â  If you want someone more recent, people have variously argued that Hilbert, Poincare, and von Neumann were among the last mathematicians to have a serious grasp of all areas of math rather than just one or two.
