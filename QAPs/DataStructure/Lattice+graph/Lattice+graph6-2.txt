How can I solve [math]p^q - q^p = 1844[/math]?
Thank you for the A2A. To be honest, there isn't much to add to Barak's answer (perhaps if I knew more algebraic number theory). I thought for a bit that perhaps that this problem might have some sort of special solution, but if there is, I don't know what. The big problem is that while it is certainly conjectured that there should be a finite number of solutions to this equation (in particular, it would follows from Pillai's conjecture: mentioned in the Wikipedia article Catalan's conjecture), the general conjecture is very much still open. In fact, even if a proof of that fact is given, it still might not help, if you do not have some sort of bound on either the number of solutions or the range in which they can occur. To some extent, the best case scenario (for now) is that we might be able to reduce it to a brute force search. There are observations that you can make to make your search more efficient. For example, you can consider what happens if you try to solve this problem over some finite ring [math] \mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z} [/math] instead of the full ring of integers [math] \mathbb{Z} [/math]. In particular, by making use of this kind of reasoning, it isn't too hard to see that all of your solutions must either be pairs of numbers that are congruent to 1 mod 4, or pairs congruent to 3 mod 4. Considerations like this will help you to cut down your search space a little bit (if you are clever, you might be able to get it down to 1/10 of the original size). Again, if your search space is potentially infinite, this doesn't help. A side note: if the ABC conjecture is true (in particular, if Mochizuki's proof is correct), then it would follow that the number of solutions to this equation must be finite.
