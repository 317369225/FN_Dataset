What are some cool possible applications of the D-Wave quantum computer?
A few Japanese researchers (including one from Google) put out an arXiv pre-print (yesterday) on using quantum annealing for Dirichlet Processes [0]. They solve a version of the problem that attempts to sample from the raw posterior without a) making a variational approximation b) doing MCMC. In principle, you can perform MAP estimation for the Dirichlet Process posterior with Simulated Annealing, although it will take a very long time. Very roughly, you can think of their annealing algorithm this as running many parallel (but coupled) Chinese Restaurant Processes until they all converge on some state. [0] Page on Arxiv [1] Apologies to Michael Betancourt, who probably will laugh at this paper's usage of a spin-glass path integral to represent the DP. I kind of found it funny too, because you probably will spend at least [math]\mathcal{O}(|V|^2)[/math] just converting the DP variables to these spin-glass variables (where [math]|V|[/math] is the size of your vocabulary/number of customers)
