What is the best open source speech recogniser to use? How do you use them?
You can try CMU Sphinx - Speech Recognition Toolkit The main advantages over other toolkits like HTK is that with CMUSphinx you don't need to train any models or spend your time in tuning ASR part, you mostly get a result out-of-box with preexisting models with pretty good accuracy. CMUSphinx provides a range of APIs in many language like C, C++, Java, Python, you can select the language of your choice. To process the file in US English just download the latest code and models from CMUSphinx website (the most accurate model is En-US Generic), you need both acoustic and language model and run the decoding: ffmpeg -i file.mp3 -ar 16000 -ac 1 file.wavpocketsphinx_continuous -infile file.wav -hmm en-us -lm en-us.lm.dmp -dict cmu07a.dic That would give you the transcription for analyze with your tools. For better accuracy of audio summarization you need to learn how to work on lattices. Lattice is a graph of possible decoding variants together with the scores which enables you to build more effective text and meaning extraction. Due to the fact it incorporates more results it can capture the things you need more accurately.
