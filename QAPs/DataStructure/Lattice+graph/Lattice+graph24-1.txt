Combinatorics: Take an m x n piece of grid paper, and in each box pick two opposite corners at random to connect.  What can be said about the resulting pattern?
The model you describe is simply critical Percolation on the square lattice [math]\mathbb{Z}^2[/math], together with its closed-dual, when you rotate it by 45 degrees. Let me explain. To see the connection, first consider the vertices of the rectangle. partition them into 2 sets [math]A[/math] and [math]B[/math]: those for which the sum of their coordinates is even, and those for which its odd and notice that the diagonals only connect two vertices of the same set. Now, if you take the set [math]A[/math] and all the diagonals and rotate the picture by 45 degrees you'll get a square lattice again. So for the moment, let's take the set [math]A[/math] and let's look only at the diagonals you've added that connect two vertices in [math]A[/math]. Each such potential diagonal has probability [math]\frac12[/math] of being added and they are all independent. In other words this is critical percolation on the square lattice. What about the set [math]B[/math]? a vertex in [math]B[/math] is in the center of a square formed by vertices in [math]A[/math] and it's connected to a neighbor vertex in [math]B[/math] if and only if the corresponding vertices in [math]A[/math] are not connected. Hence, we are talking about the complement of the Dual graph. The paths you are interested in are the outer boundary of a connected component of the vertices in [math]A[/math] or [math]B[/math]. These should follow roughly a power law with some known exponent (which I cannot remember now). I write "should" because it is rigorously known only for some planar lattices (most notably the triangular lattice), but it is conjectured to be Universal (that is, the same for a large class of lattices).
