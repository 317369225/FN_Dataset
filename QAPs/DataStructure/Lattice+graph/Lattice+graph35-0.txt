What are some advanced math textbooks with lots of pictorial examples?
On the analysis and dynamical systems side, the following have a lot of pictures: Vladimir Arnold was a strong believer in using physical intuition and pictures as parts of proofs. For instance, in Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics and Geometric Methods in the the Theory of Ordinary Differential Equations, we have the famous cat map [0]: Moreover, his papers on the ADE classification of Lie Algebras also had tons of pictures of the various lattices involved. An example of the types of pictures that Arnold drew for combinatorial objects include this cover: The book Counterexamples in Analysis (Gelbaum, Olmsted) has plenty of pictures, especially in Chapter 10 (on plane sets) The Princeton Analysis series due to Elias Stein and Rami Shakarchi has a very pictoral introduction to analysis. Their complex analysis book, in particular, has a lot of pictures. In terms of algebra, I think that the best 'picture books' outside of algebraic geometry come from graph theory and combinatorics. For instance, Stanley's excellent Enumerative Combinatorics has a ton of pictures (of discrete objects and games). Some of the drawings correspond to representations of various algebraic objects (e.g. modules via Young Tableaux, etc.), so you could view this as a 'pictoral algebra book' I believe that Biggs book, Algebraic Graph Theory, has a fairly large number of pictures (for an algebra book!). In particular, taking advantage of drawings to decompose symmetry groups of graphs appears to be popular in Chapters 4 and 5.
