What are some open problems in algebraic combinatorics?
A nice list by Godsil can be found here: Problems in Algebraic Combinatorics Here are some that I like: Is there a regular graph with valency 57, diameter two and girth five? Is there a set of [math]{m+1 \choose 2}[/math] equiangular lines in [math]\mathbb{R}^m[/math] when [math]m > 23[/math]? Another list of open problems in this field compiled by Stanley can be found here. Though it should be noted that this area is quite vast and not so well defined. It can contain many topics from Coding theory, Finite geometry, Representation theory, and Group theory. Here's what theÂ  Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics says about its scope: The Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics publishes papers in which combinatorics and algebra interact in a significant and interesting fashion. This interaction might occur through the study of combinatorial structures using algebraic methods, or the application of combinatorial methods to algebraic problems. The combinatorics might be enumerative, or involve matroids, posets, polytopes, codes, designs, or finite geometries. The algebra could be group theory, representation theory, lattice theory or commutative algebra, to mention just a few possibilities.
