What are some of the common parallel algorithmic problems?
The “Seven Dwarfs” of Symbolic Computation (see http://www4.ncsu.edu/~kaltofen/b... ) SymDwf 1. Exact linear algebra, integer lattices SymDwf 2. Exact polynomial and diﬀerential algebra, Gr¨obner bases SymDwf 3. Inverse symbolic problems, e.g., interpolation and parameterization SymDwf 4. Tarski’s algebraic theory of real geometry SymDwf 5. Hybrid symbolic-numeric computation SymDwf 6. Computation of closed form solutions SymDwf 7.
