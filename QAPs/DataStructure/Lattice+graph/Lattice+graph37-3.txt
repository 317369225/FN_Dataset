I'm more than halfway through the whole Specialization track and I feel that it has given me a good foundation to Data Science. I can't say though that I will have enough of the skills required to pursue Data Science as a career. It is R-centric and I love R, but as I practice with it outside of the courses, I find a few things (outside of Statistics and Math in general) lacking, in which case I resort to Python or Ruby. There's one particular course--Statistical Inference--that I had a lot of difficulty coping with and the lectures seem rushed, but I found another Coursera course--the Data Analysis and Statistical Inference course from Duke University--a great supplement as it tackled the same concepts much better and more in-depth. I'd say it has been worth my while so far (since I'm new to this field), though I would go for other, more advanced Data Science-related courses and tracks once I finish this as I feel this particular track is not enough. Edit (December 1, 2015): I've completed all nine courses, and I'm taking the Capstone in a few days. Updated 9w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
