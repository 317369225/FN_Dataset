Which tools do you use for visualization? What do you think of Tableau? R? SAS? (for graphs).
(Comparing only R and SAS) SAS now has both good default graphics on the statistical PROCs, decent (and easy) basic plots with the SG PROCs and the ability to create a vast majority of graphs with the graph template language (PROC TEMPLATE).Â  High points of SAS: All statistical PROCs have sensible defaults (or easily accessed graphs) SAS' own developers use GTL, so there are templates available Tech support Low point Price Complexity of PROC TEMPLATE (GTL) R has default graphs only where the package developer has written them, but has an amazing array of packages. Also, if you are creating a complex graph from scratch, its base, ggplot and lattice packages are all easier to use than the graph template language. 1. High points 2. Flexibilty 3. Cost (can't beat free!) Low points 1. Huge range of packages can make it hard to tell which is best for your needs 2. Each statistical package has its own syntax and only has graphs if the author put them
