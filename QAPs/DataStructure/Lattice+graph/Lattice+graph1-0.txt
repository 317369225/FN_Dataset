What is the difference between a mathematical lattice and a directed acyclic graph?
Any pair of elements in a lattice have a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound. With a partial ordering relation giving the direction of edges in your graph, this should mean that beginning from a pair of vertices, you can trace paths from them which sooner or later will cross each other: along forward edges to the upper bound, and backward edges to the lower bound (or the other way around, if you prefer the opposite order :) ). For the relation on the set this means that there will be a minimum and a maximum element, for your graph, the equivalent should be something like a 'start' ('bottom') and an 'end' ('top') vertex with only outbound and inbound edges, respectively.
