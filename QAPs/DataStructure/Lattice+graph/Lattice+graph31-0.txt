What are the mathematics needed for pursuing a PhD in Theoretical Computer Science and specifically in algorithm research?
It varies by your specific topic.  I study graph algorithms (in particular, distance sensitivity oracles) and none of the papers I'm reading use sophisticated math.  The most they use is some standard techniques involving Chernoff bounds* and high-school level probability. That being said, it's good to have as extensive a math background as possible, since the ideas from math may inspire your research results. * I didn't know these before I started, but it was easy to look them up.
