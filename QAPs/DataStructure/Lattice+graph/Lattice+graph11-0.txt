What is a Gabriel graph and when is it useful?
Odd, I just answered the post office problem question, which is the Nearest Neighbor problem in geometry, relating to algorithms that compute the nearest point in a mathematical space to a given specific point. The Gabriel graph is similar, it shows in one view of the relations of proximity or nearness between points on a plane in Euclidean geometry. it is used in computations for the same area of geometry concerned with tiling of surfaces and planes, computations on real and virtual lattices, and generalized graph theory.Â  Very non-technical explanation.
