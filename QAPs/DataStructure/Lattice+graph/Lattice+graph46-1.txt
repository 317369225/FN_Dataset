Who is the most diverse mathematician of all time?
Leonhard Euler "Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all" introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation. Worked in almost all fields of mathematics: geometry, infinitesimal calculus, trigonometry, algebra and number theory, as well as continuum physics, lunar theory and other areas of physics. If printed, his works, many of which are of fundamental interest, would occupy between 60 and 80 quarto volumes. Only mathematician to have two numbers named after him: the immensely important Euler's Number in calculus, e, approximately equal to 2.71828, and the Euler-Mascheroni Constant γ (gamma) sometimes referred to as just "Euler's constant", approximately equal to 0.57721.

Paul Erdős  (Pronounced AIR-dosh) Erdős published more papers than any other mathematician in history, working with hundreds of collaborators. worked on problems in combinatorics, graph theory, number theory, classical analysis, approximation theory, set theory, and probability theory. at the age of four, he could calculate in his head how many seconds a person had lived, given their age. He wrote around 1,525 mathematical articles in his lifetime, mostly with co-authors. Erdős was much more of a "problem solver" than a "theory developer". Of his contributions, the development of Ramsey theory and the application of the probabilistic method especially stand out. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pau...
