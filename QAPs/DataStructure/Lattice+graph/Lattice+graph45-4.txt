How does one become good at solving algorithm/programming problems?
My question to you : Did you ever know about technique like Merge sort(or say Divide and conquer) before you read it in CLRS? I guess No, though here also your phrase "why didn't I think like this before." is applicable. What did you do in this case? You just studied it, learnt it and implemented it and now you're kind of a master in Merge Sort. Same goes with other problems too. As you are a beginner, I would suggest that follow this strategy: Try to solve the problem by already known techniques to you for about half an hour. If you fail, just be shameless (yeah right! Shameless) and search for it on Google. I am sure you'll find some method to overcome your problem. Study it, Learn it and Implement it.As the time goes you'll see that you're now able to form solutions to the problem yourself. Now, I suggest that try to reduce searching and increase thinking part because this is necessary and soon..... You'll also find yourself giving advice to a beginner.....:) I would not try to recommend some resources i.e. links or books as thousands of such resources are there and I am sure someone would mention them.
