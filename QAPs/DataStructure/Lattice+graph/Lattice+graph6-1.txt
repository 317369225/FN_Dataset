How can I solve [math]p^q - q^p = 1844[/math]?
One general procedure is to solve the equation over the reals or rationals first and look for where the curve might intersect the integer lattice. The graph of [math]p^q - q^p = N[/math] over the reals has a trivial solution [math]p=N+1, q = 1[/math].   From that point it decreases to a minimum and then starts increasing again.  (This statement can probably be made rigorous by looking at the partial derivatives--- for now, let's just go with "by inspection") The real solutions on the right-hand segment of the graph where it's increasing all lie close to the line p=q.  In fact, they lie so close that there can't be any integer solutions there.  Let's show this. Suppose for integer [math]p[/math] and real [math]q[/math] with [math]p,q > N > 10[/math] that [math]p^q - q^p = N[/math].  We know the solution for [math]p^q - q^p = 0[/math] is just [math]p=q[/math].   We'd like to show that the solution for [math]N[/math] must be bounded below [math]q=p+1[/math], or equivalently, [math]p^{p+1}-(p+1)^p > N[/math]. This was surprisingly hard for me to prove, let's just examine p = 10, then [math]10^{11} - 11^{10} = 74062575399[/math] which obviously fits the bill, and I'll take a shortcut by asking Wolfram Alpha for the derivative, which is p^p (1 + p + p Log[p]) - (1 + p)^p (p/(1 + p) + Log[1 + p]) which is greater than 0 in the range we care about, so the difference will not decrease for larger [math]p[/math]. So to recap: we know integer solutions exist only on the left hand side of the graph.  For 'large' p or q, there cannot be any integer solutions because the graph is asymptotically close to [math]p=q[/math].  Therefore there are only finitely many solutions.
