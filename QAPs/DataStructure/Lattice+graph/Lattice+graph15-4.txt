What are some examples of deceptively simple-looking math problems?
There are a lot responses with open problems here, and I thought I'd add one that some of you could solve, even though it's pretty tough. I'd peg it at early-mid olympiad level. But it looks so easy! Prove that any convex pentagon with vertices on the lattice points must have a lattice point in its interior. A solution was requested, so I'll post it: . . . . . . . . Are you sure you want to see it? Here's a hint first. Hint: If you're like me, your first inclination when you see "prove that any convex pentagon..." is to try Pick's Theorem. Ignore that inclination; it's a red herring. Instead, try solving the following easier problem first: Given 5 lattice points with no three collinear, prove that there is another lattice point on a line segment connecting two of them. . . . . . . . . Alright, here you go. This problem is from a very old ARML Power Round (in the days before they started just renaming all the terms from graph theory and asking you to prove basic theorems). Solution: Color the lattice points as follows: A lattice point [math](a,b)[/math] is: blue if [math]a,b[/math] are both even. green if [math]a[/math] is even and [math]b[/math] is odd. red if [math]a[/math] is odd and [math]b[/math] is even. yellow if [math]a,b[/math] are both odd. We claim that between any two points of the same color, there is another lattice point of a different color. The midpoint must be a lattice point, as the [math]x[/math] and [math]y[/math] distances between the two points are both even. To show that there is a point of a different color, strongly induct on the number of lattice points points between them, as between any two points of the same color, there must be another point. Now return to the pentagon. By pigeonhole principle, at least two of the vertices have the same color. If they are not adjacent, we are done as we can take their midpoint. If they are, suppose wlog that they are blue, and that there is a green point on their edge. Then if any of the other three points are blue or green, we can connect them to another blue or green point, and take the midpoint. If they are just red and yellow, they must wlog have two neighboring points being red and the last yellow. But then between the two red points there is a point of a different color, and whatever that color is we can connect it to another of its color and take the midpoint, which is inside the pentagon. This completes the proof. Updated 37w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
