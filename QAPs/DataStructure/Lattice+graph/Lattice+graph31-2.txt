What are the mathematics needed for pursuing a PhD in Theoretical Computer Science and specifically in algorithm research?
Probability is used a lot, over and over again. There is a lot of linear algebra (ring, field theory) in Cryptography, and Quantum. There is quite a bit of calculus, but also very specific tricks. Theory CS uses a lot of math, but the skills are more of a specific kind. Being a Math major in a TCS PhD, I feel inadequate most of the time because the pure math subjects I know, aren't directly applied anywhere. They however help me to learn the math tools used in TCS faster and better.
