What are the subjects in the second year in CSE? Is it going to be difficult for me if I know only C++? If yes, what should I learn during vacations?
Chill, and enjoy your vacations with your family. This maybe the last vacation that you can enjoy without thinking too much about career/internships/placements. 3rd sem isn't that difficult.
