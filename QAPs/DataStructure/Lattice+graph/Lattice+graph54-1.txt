Are wind turbines responsible for the deaths of large numbers of wild birds?
The American Bird Conservancy have published some figures for the USA which put this problem in context. Wind turbines are apparently responsible for about half a million bird deaths (2013 figures), however this compared with 6.8 million for communication towers (2012), 175 million for power lines (2005), and 300 million to 1 billion for glass windows in buildings, see Birds and Collisions. Amazing figures, but wind turbines seem to be a relatively minor worry.
