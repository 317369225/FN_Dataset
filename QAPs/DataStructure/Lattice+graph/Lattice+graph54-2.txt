Are wind turbines responsible for the deaths of large numbers of wild birds?
A recent report found that 99% of birds actually alter their flight paths to avoid off-shore wind turbines: http://www.theguardian.com/envir... I imagine that changing colour contrast could make some difference, but depends on how it's done - some birds might actually be attracted to certain colors. Moreover, the NIMBYs won't be happy if the ideal colour combination for birds renders these turbines even more of an eyesore for humans!Â  What might be more significant is for the turbines to emit a flashing UV light as this would easily visible to birds, while invisible to humans?
