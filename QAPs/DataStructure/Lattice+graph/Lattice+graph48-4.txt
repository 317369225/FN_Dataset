How significant is bird and bat mortality due to wind turbines?
No one knows how many birds collide with wind turbines. They are located on gated, inaccessible hilltops and areas where humans cannot possibly assess strikes. So for you to make the statement that wind turbines will save 70 million birds annually is a number pulled out of the air. I live in the Tehachapi Pass surrounded on 2 sides with WTGs and have not seen or heard owls, Golden Eagles or California condors in years. The claim is that no condors have collided. However, only 1 wind energy operator out of 12 wind energy developers that committed to installing system in their environmental impact reports have installed a radar system to pick up condor transmitters. Rumor is that a man watches for condor on a hill 7 days a week. Text from North Sky River Environmental Impact Report.  http://www.co.kern.ca.us/plannin...  MM-4.4-14.
