What's some stuff that MIT students like?
Believe it or not, the parties are legendary. I'm not going to give away any secrets, but I will tell you this: if you know where to look/ask, there are amazing parties here. They are often well hidden. The facilities, obviously, are beyond anything I've seen elsewhere: labs, machine shops, fablabs etc.. The food here is horrible mind you.
