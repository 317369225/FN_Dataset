What are some examples of deceptively simple-looking math problems?
As others pointed out, mathematics is overflowing with "deceptively simple-looking" problems. Since antiquity people realized that simple-to-state doesn't equal simple-to-solve, and some of the most attractive and tantalizing problems that have shaped mathematics have short, elegant statements and long, arduous solutions (or none at all). For most trained mathematicians, number-theoretic problems are no longer "deceptively simple-looking": After you've encountered Fermat's Last Theorem, the Goldbach Conjecture, the 3n+1 problem and countless other problems (a few of which are mentioned in other answers) you develop a healthy respect for such questions; in fact, you're more likely to assume that a problem is very hard even when it isn't rather than the other way around. Example: prove that every prime > 2 is the difference of two squares. I won't divulge the solution but it's really very elementary, and I've seen people struggle with this for days just because it seems so dangerously similar to very hard problems. Nevertheless, even professional mathematicians continue to be awed by problems that really seem like they ought to be easy or trivial - even to their trained eye - only to discover that they totally aren't. Sometimes they're just clever problems, and sometimes they are actually completely open and nobody has any idea how to approach them. One example that comes to mind is Van der Waerden's theorem. A question came up: If the natural numbers are split into two sets, must one of those sets contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions? Everyone assumed it should be easy to prove or disprove, and by "everyone" I mean the top mathematical minds of the time (the question arose, and was widely researched, in GÃ¶ttingen around 1928. See Khintchine's "Three Pearls of Number Theory" for a delightful account). This was, indeed, shown to be true, but the solution is very far from being simple. So, I submit that this is a provably "deceptively simply-looking" problem. Here's one from the category of "clever problems": The seating arrangement of the people in your department is changed, and it turns out that you guys now occupy more cubicles than you did before. Show that at least two people must have fewer cubicle-mates than they did prior to the re-arrangement. It seems obvious, but not quite that easy to prove. Here's a personal favorite: 1) c is a positive real number such that [math]n^c[/math] is an integer for every natural number n. Must c be an integer? 2) c is a positive real number such that [math]2^c, 3^c[/math] and [math]5^c[/math] are integers. Must c be an integer? 3) c is a positive real number such that [math]2^c[/math] and [math]3^c[/math] are integers. Must c be an integer? Look simple, don't they? Question 1) is a rather tricky olympiad-grade problem. There's a fairly short, elegant solution but it's not an easy exercise. Question 2) is solvable but requires some of the most advanced machinery of 20th century mathematics. Question 3) is open. Nobody knows if this is true (it probably is) and how to prove it if it is. Inconceivable.
