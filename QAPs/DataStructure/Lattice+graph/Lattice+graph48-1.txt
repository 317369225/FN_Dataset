How significant is bird and bat mortality due to wind turbines?
The birds & windmills story is a myth.  Surprisingly it seems, windmills are not very dangerous to birds at all!  Particularly not compared to pet cats and clean windows. Here is a graphic from the 2014 "State of the birds" report listing most common human related causes of death for birds. You can check out the whole report here... http://www.stateofthebirds.org/2...  I have a good friend that lives on a windfarm in Scotland. The property is on the migratory path for several species.  He says that he never sees injured birds or bird carcasses around the windmills.  However he does find that every year a good number of birds kill themselves flying into his closed windows.
