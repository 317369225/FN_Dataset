What is the highest math class that you found application?
I took calculus and vectors in high school and apply them regularly. I'm in university and I'm still applying my advanced calc and numerical methods knowledge. I'm sure I'll use all my mathematical knowledge once I've graduated. I'm going to be an engineer. Math is extremely relevant to me. It bothers me when people say things like "you're never going to use that high school math"! Y'know what I haven't used and probably will never use again? Essay writing. History. Geography. Chemistry. Biology. But plenty of people do use that stuff. It is the height of arrogance to think that something is useless just because you don't use it. (Not calling out you, in particular, OP, just the people who say shit like that)
