What's some stuff that MIT students like?
Although I haven't been a student on campus for 29 years, MIT sealed my desire for lifelong learning. I'll always identify as an "MIT student." From my vantage point, I take the long view into account. No one has yet stated the obvious. MIT students like solving problems.
