Data Visualization: What is the easiest and most elegant way to get started with R plotting?
You may check the ggplot2 package by Hadley Wickham. The grammar of graphics in ggplot2 will help understand and make plots from a higher perspective. There are numerous tutorials for R Base graphics, but from my experience, once you are familiar with ggplot2, you'll find it extremely elegant and useful for basic/complex plots as well as plots for publications. You could also use the R plotting library from plotly, which allows you to make interactive, publication-quality graphs in the browser. You may also take a look at the lattice and grid packages in R. All these packages have accompanying books available. Updated 110w ago • View Upvotes
