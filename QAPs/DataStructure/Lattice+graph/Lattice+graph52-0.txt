What is the difference between homomorphism and homeomorphism?
Each is a name for a particular kind of structure-preserving map, but these two in particular aren't closely related.Â  Perhaps the following table will be helpful: Category: Structure-preserving maps; Invertible, structure-preserving maps Groups: (group) homomorphism; (group) isomorphism Rings: (ring) homomorphism; (ring) isomorphism Vector Spaces: linear transformation, invertible linear transformation Topological Spaces: continuous map; homeomorphism Differentiable Manifolds: differentiable map; diffeomorphism Riemannian Manifolds: conformal map; conformal isometry (Some of these objects naturally fit into more than one category -- for instance, you could consider other classes of morphisms on Riemannian manifolds and get a category.)
