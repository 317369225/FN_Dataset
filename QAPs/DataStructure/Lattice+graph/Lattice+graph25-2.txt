Is there any case where students during the process of writing their thesis or dissertations have discovered or invented something that has made them famous?
Jocelyn Bell was Anthony Hewish's graduate student at Cambridge in 1967 when she discovered pulsars.  Hewish got the Nobel Prize but she didn't.  Hewish had designed and built the radio telescope they used, so he certainly deserved credit, but so did she.  However, it was 1967 and women just weren't taken seriously, no matter how good their work.  Rosalind Franklin had a similar problem with the discovery of DNA.  It was her unique and pathbreaking data that was used by Watson and Crick (without her permission) as they worked together (and without involving Franklin) to come up with the first understanding of the structure of DNA.
