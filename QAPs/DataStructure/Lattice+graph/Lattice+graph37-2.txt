★★★☆☆My background :I am a master of computing student and I do have some knowledge of R.  There are a lot of good resources for learning R but I think John Hopkin's data science specialization track on Coursera just isn't one of them. There is no structured feel to the content of some courses perhaps because they had to fragment their previous data analytics offering on Coursera into a series of 9 courses. For example during the "Exploratory Data Analysis" class,  clustering algorithms and principle component analysis were brought up and were actually described at length. I can see how that can be jarring and confusing for people who signed up to learn about exploratory data analysis. The programming assignments for the "R Programming course" were also very contrived. I felt like I was trying to simulate SQL queries using rather clunky R code as opposed to getting familiar with the data structures and functional programming aspects of R I browsed through the practical machine learning course which very briefly introduced decision trees and some ensemble methods like bagging, boosting and random forest. What caught my attention was the rather thorough introduction to using the Caret library to split data, tune and compare models. I think this is definitely a great inclusion to a practical machine learning course as it really simplifies data pre-processing, tuning and validation. People who are interested in jumping into Kaggle should definitely check it out. The lecturer also points out some great resources like "Introduction to Statistical Learning" for learning more about applying  machine learning algorithms in R. (Those who are interested in learning more about the Caret package should check out the  Applied Predictive Modeling book which was written by the the author of the caret package Max Kuhn) I haven't taken all 9 courses but from what I have seen I probably won't recommend this data science specialization track to anyone who isn't familiar with R.
