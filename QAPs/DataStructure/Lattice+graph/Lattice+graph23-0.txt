Why is the average number of sides in a 2D lattice 6?
Euler's formula states that, for a planar graph, [math] V - E + F = 2 [/math] First we're going to assume the plane is infinite, Then [math] V,E,F \gg 1 [/math] so we can safely ignore that comparatively small 2, and [math] V - E + F \approx 0 [/math] Now if the vertices are three-fold, I assume from the diagrams that this means that only three edges can meet at a vertex. This puts a restriction on the relationship between V and E. Since each vertex shares the edge with one other vertex, there are three edges for every two vertices. Thus E/V = 3/2 or [math] V = \frac{2}{3} E [/math] Then [math] F = E - V = \frac{E}{3} [/math] or E/F = 3/1. So, there are 3 edges per face overall. But since each face shares an edge with one other face when we are in an infinite two-dimensional plane, this means that on average the polygons in the plane are 6-sided.
