What are some seriously insightful or enlightening infographics?
I hereby nominate this map of my own corner of the blogosphere. In future years, it will be recognized as the pioneering example of the correct way to map the blogosphere and I will be hailed as the Mercator of virtual geography. Oh well, who am I kidding. xkcd is the pioneer here. No wait, it actually goes further back to the 19th century. On a serious note, such maps are unusual among infographics because they attempt to visualize right-brain data instead of left-brain.
