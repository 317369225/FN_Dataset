How can I solve [math]p^q - q^p = 1844[/math]?
There exists NO general way to solve a Diophantine equation has been proven in 1960s / 1970s. It is Hilbert's tenth problem. Please refer to its wiki page for the detailed description: Hilbert's tenth problem EDIT: I apologize for my misleading answer to this question. "The exists no general way to solve a Diophantine equation" means that we cannot find a way to solve an arbitrary Diophantine equation. It does not mean there is no general way to solve Diophantine equations of a particular form, such as in this question: p^q - q^p = N, where N, and p, q are positive integer. Hence, my answer is not really an appropriate answer to the original question "Is there a general way to solve such problems p^q - q^p = N, where N, p, and q are positive integers?" Sorry about that.
