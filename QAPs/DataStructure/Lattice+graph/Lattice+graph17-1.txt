Do good mathematicians visualize everything (even algebra)?
I think that it is always important to try and gain intuition about what you are doing. You should have an internal model that you refer to that should suggest whether a result might be true or not. It is not always possible to visualize things, however. I can approximate a space-filling curve in my head, but I know I will never be able to get the real thing---however, I know the method by which it is constructed, and I understand how it works mathematically. And that is a geometric example---it is very well suited to be visualized. Abstract algebra offers objects that are far harder to visualize---in principle, I'm sure that you could try to visualize the Monster group as a group of geometric transformations on some high dimensional space, but no one ever does so because that is terrible. However, if you study the Monster group, you learn how it fits together with other objects, so even though you can't visualize it, you understand roughly how it works. There are also things that I don't bother visualizing any more---basic algebra and a lot of calculus tends to fall into that category. I do so when I am teaching---otherwise, I have been working with it for so long that it has become second nature. It is a little bit like riding a bike or playing chess---initially, you think hard about your movements, but once you have had enough practice, you start doing certain things automatically, without thinking.
