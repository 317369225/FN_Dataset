Is there any case where students during the process of writing their thesis or dissertations have discovered or invented something that has made them famous?
One of the travesties of the Nobel Awards is the omission of Lise Meitner from the award to Otto Hahn and F. Strassman for the discovery of nuclear fission. Meitner explicated the Physics of the Fission Reaction after it was demonstrated by Hahn and Strassman. Could it be that in pre-WWII Germany a Jewish, Female Scientist would get a Nobel Prize? Lise Meitner did get a major honor when a new transuranic element was named Meitnerium. The Periodic Table will be used long after Nobel Prizes will be remembered!
