Do good mathematicians visualize everything (even algebra)?
A2A. I would say, no. Not everything. Moreover, I was taught to get rid of visualization at uni. Why so? Sure, there are some branches of math where you can have visual or quasi-visual examples or illustrations (automata theory, graph theory, even Boolean algebra or lattice theory as well as finite groups). However, there are too many things that cannot be visualized correctly. I'll give an example. «Our» «real-life» space is usually used as visualization of Euclidean three-dimensional space and many round objects are even taken as examples of spheres or balls (in geometrical sense). They are, of course, not. Here is why: Banach–Tarski paradox implies that you can create many balls out of one, and all these balls will be equal to original one. This is, unfortunately, impossible in real world. Moreover, there are some branches of maths that cannot be visualized at all and don't need that visualization. How would you visualize logic? Or maybe general algebra or set theory? And, most importantly, almost every branch of maths can be understood and studied without reference to some images or pictures.
