What are some advanced math textbooks with lots of pictorial examples?
Epitomizing this category of books is Fulton and Harris, Representation theory: a first course. Their subject is not often treated with so many pictures and examples, so this is an especially unique book. In fact, if anything the book contains too many pictures and examples. A subject more amenable to visualization is algebraic geometry. Here Harris, Algebraic geometry: a first course, is particularly good visually. Maybe a less obvious choice is Mumford's Red book of varieties and schemes. While not unduly loaded with pictures, it contains all the right pictures, including the famous "treasure map" of Spec Z[x] (which is about as eye-opening as a hand-drawn mathematical image can be, in my opinion): As Alon mentioned, good differential geometry and topology books also have lots of pictures. Spivak's Comprehensive introduction to differential geometry comes to mind, as does Hatcher's Algebraic topology.
