A taxonomy is structured like a tree or hierarchy; what is an example of a classification system that is structured like a lattice?
You're looking for a system based on an (ordered) relation that is not necessarily partially ordered.  So, let's say you have a company where people are classified by project.  Moreover, the project leads have big personalities, so much so that the company tracks how the project leads socialize with one another.  From information on who 'friends' who, who follows whose Twitter feed, and who emails who, you could figure out the (directed) friendship links between project leads. If all that's in place, then your employees would be classified according to a lattice structure of projects, based on project lead friendships.
