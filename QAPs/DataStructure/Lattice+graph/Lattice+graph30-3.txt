A taxonomy is structured like a tree or hierarchy; what is an example of a classification system that is structured like a lattice?
An access control system.  Read/write/create/delete/etc as actions (as one dimension).  All your users and user roles (as another dimension).  The lattice is placed on every object which is to be secured. There is even an access control system called the "Lattice-based access control": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lat...
