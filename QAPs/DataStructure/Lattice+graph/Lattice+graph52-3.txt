What is the difference between homomorphism and homeomorphism?
Alon, continuous maps are structure-preserving maps, if we choose to axiomatise topology in terms of the closure operation (for Hausdorff spaces, we can use the operation of taking a limit): or in the non-standard-analysis version, "If x is infinitely close to y, then f(x) is infinitely close to f(y)". The backwards 'inverse of an open set is open' characterisation is useful, but a pedagogical pain in the pajamas. James, as Alon said, homeomorphisms are not "also homomorphisms", simply because that term is mostly used for algebraic objects like groups and rings, not topological ones. The term isomorphism is used more broadly, because category theory applies to so many objects.  A morphism between vector spaces is a linear mapping;  a morphism between groups is a homomorphism;  a morphism between topological spaces is a continuous mapping; a morphism between sets is a bijection;  and so on.  In each category, an isomorphism is a morphism with a two-sided inverse.  In a concrete category (where the objects are sets plus structure) having a two-sided inverse is usually equivalent to being bijective, but this is a theorem -- for that category -- not a definition.  An isomorphism of measure spaces need not be bijective.
