What are some examples of graphs with an infinite number of vertices?
Consider the space of all finite binary sequences represented as a directed graph. The vertices are finite binary sequences, and there is a directed edge from node A to node B if node B is a sequence that is a one bit extension of A. So for example there are edges 0101011001 ---> 01010110010 and 0101011001 ---> 01010110011. In fact every node has two edges leaving it, and (except for the node representing the empty string) one edge entering it, so this graph forms a full binary tree, with the empty string at the root.
