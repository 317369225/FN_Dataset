Who is the most diverse mathematician of all time?
Euler and Gauss are two, but the third is Emmy Noether. Noether put algebras on a firm footing after 2000 years of nobody else's having been able to do so. Nothing that Gauss or Euler or practically anybody else has ever done has the slightest real meaning without this; it would all just be tinkering with numbers.
