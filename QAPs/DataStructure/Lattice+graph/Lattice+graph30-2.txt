A taxonomy is structured like a tree or hierarchy; what is an example of a classification system that is structured like a lattice?
A lattice seems to suggest a regular pattern of classes with regular connections between those classes. I am unaware of any classification scheme that works with such rigid constraints. If instead of lattice you mean any graph like structure, then I would say that an ontology (in the computer science sense of the work) fits that description (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ont... ). A practical implementation of such an ontology would be the W3C RDFS standard (see: http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/ ). A simpler system that will allow you to model graph like structures is RDF, but it lacks the expressive power to deal with classes and instances.
