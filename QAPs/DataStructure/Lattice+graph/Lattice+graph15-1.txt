What are some examples of deceptively simple-looking math problems?
In a slightly different light, I'm going to present a problem that seems simple but is undecidable in general. The general question is simple: given an arbitrary polynomial with integer variables, does it have a solution? Sometimes, it's quite easy: [math] x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 29 [/math] You can probably do it in your head: [math] \begin{align} x &= 1 \\ y &= 1 \\z &= 3 \\ \end{align} [/math] Sometimes it's more tricky: [math] x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 30 [/math] Can you figure out a solution to this one? You can't! But other people did, although it took until 1999! Why? This is why: [math] \begin{align} x &= -283059965 \\ y &= -2218888517 \\ z &= 2220422932 \\ \end{align} [/math] Yeah. So what about this one? [math] x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 33 [/math] That's still an open problem. In fact, it turns out there's no algorithm to solve these kinds of equations. Just like the (in)famous halting problem, this is undecidable. The problems look so simple, but they're not just unsolved—they're fundamentally unsolvable! How's that for difficult? I originally read about this in some slides I can't find anymore. Happily, there's a great article about the topic from a Berkeley professor (now at MIT): "Undecidability in Number Theory".
