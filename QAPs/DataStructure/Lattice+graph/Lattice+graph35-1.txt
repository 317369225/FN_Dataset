What are some advanced math textbooks with lots of pictorial examples?
Bill Thurston's "Three-Dimensional Geometry and Topology" has lots of illustrations. The editor, Silvio Levy, reproduced many hand-drawn figures by Thurston using Mathematica. Stillwell's books often contain diagrams. Here's one from the excellent "Classical Topology and Combinatorial Group Theory". Tristan Needham's "Visual Complex Analysis" is heavily picture-based, as you can guess from its name. I'm not familiar with it but it looks great. Many books on differential geometry, low-dimensional topology and knot theory contain pictures. I'll add some examples if I think of specific ones.
