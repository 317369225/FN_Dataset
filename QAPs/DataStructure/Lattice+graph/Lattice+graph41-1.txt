What is a lattice in discrete mathematics?
In mathematics, a lattice is a partially ordered set in which every two elements have a unique supremum(also called a least upper bound or join) and a unique infimum (also called a greatest lower bound ormeet). An example is given by the natural numbers, partially ordered by divisibility, for which the unique supremum is the least common multiple and the unique infimum is the greatest common divisor.
