★★★☆☆I have completed all 9 courses and I liked most of them. I think they are the starting point in learning Data science. They tried to cover as much as they can but didn't cover deeply. I never worked in R and R Programming course did give me basic idea of using R. Even though they didn't cover much about R but doing quizzes and assignments I learnt lot of stuff about R and then there was course on Getting and Cleaning Data and covered R deeply. Next course Exploratory Data Analysis also teaches you to use R for creating different charts/graphs but again you will have to learn by yourself for more deeper understanding. Only two courses I liked least were Statistical Inference and Regression Models, may be they didn't provide basic foundations. It was important for me because I hadn't had in touch with Probability theories etc since long time. These two courses gave me hard time because I had to go multiple websites to learn basic concepts. I would suggest to walk through the videos on Khan Academy if you are out of touch before taking above two courses. Practical Machine Learning will not teach you the Machine Learning algorithms from scratch but just teaches you to how to use different R packages to perform Modelling and Machine Learning tasks on your data. Developing Data Products, Reproducible research and Data scientist toolbox are easy ones. They are not most important ones but after these courses you will know different packages/tools/websites to effectively present your data science work.
