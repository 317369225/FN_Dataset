How can R create a histogram from a vector of strings without converting to numeric?
Note: I answered what I think you meant, which was "How can I create a bar chart from a vector of strings without converting to numeric?"  As Hadley pointed out, histograms are for continuous variables, bar charts are for categorical. Assuming you have a vector of strings like example.data <- c( "a", "b", "c", "b", "b", "a", "a" ) With base graphics: plot( as.factor( example.data )) In lattice: require( lattice )histogram( ~as.factor( example.data )) In ggplot2: require( ggplot2 )qplot( example.data ) Updated 263w ago • View Upvotes
