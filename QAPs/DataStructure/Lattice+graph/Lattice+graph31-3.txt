What are the mathematics needed for pursuing a PhD in Theoretical Computer Science and specifically in algorithm research?
One that I haven't seen mentioned, but is very handy to know something about: Convex analysis and optimization. A surprisingly large fraction of computer science (both upper and lower bounds) can be framed as instantiations of convex optimization problems, or invocations of the min-max theorem or another form of duality. (e.g. the classic min-cut = max-flow theorem, Yao's min-max principle for proving lower bounds on randomized algorithms, the equivalence of weak and strong learnability, the hard core lemma in complexity theory, and many other things are really just applications of Lagrangian duality) Also, as others have said, probability is a workhorse... If you want to learn the most relevant stuff, I recommend the book "Concentration of Measure for the Analysis of Randomized Algorithms" by Dubhashi and Panconesi.
