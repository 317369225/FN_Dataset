What are some examples of deceptively simple-looking math problems?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col... Take any natural number n. If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n/2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n+1. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1. [The problem is still unsolved] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gol... Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and in all of mathematics. It states:   Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two   primes. The conjecture has been shown to be correct up through 4 × 10^18 and is generally assumed to be true, but no mathematical proof exists despite considerable effort.
