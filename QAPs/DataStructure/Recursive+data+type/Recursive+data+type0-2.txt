Why are lists the fundamental data structures in most, if not all functional programming languages?
Why do you believe this to be true?  We functional programmers certainly do not.  Lisp did emphasize lists, and that was a tremendous breakthrough in its day because it introduced the concept of a persistent data structure.  So, historically, it might be that purely functional lists (without rplaca and rplacd introduced by barbarians) were the first example of a persistent data structure, and Lisp was the first to show how important those are.  The entire OO world has missed this point fundamentally, and will forever be lost on the wrong path for this very reason.
