What is the best and most efficient way to start learning to code?
Only you would the effective way to learn. You know about yourself better than any other guy. You would know what takes you longer, reading about a concept or implementing it. Based on that you must divide you time and focus. Since you have chosen C++ as you primary language, first you should compile a list of basic concepts and features For example, The basic constructs in the language syntax. C++ evolved from C with object oriented concept. So you need to learn that. Then there are the libraries - STL (the builtin plethora of data structures and basic routines similar to java.util library.), some graphic libraries like openGL or whatever you feel comfortable (if you want to go into graphics), some computation libraries etc. These libraries would go on the research and industry part of the language. Proficiency in a language comes if you can implement what you have in mind. Learning a language just does not mean studying the theory. You need to apply so that you know how to use them. You could learn and implement various algorithms and data structures. This is the period when you get to tinker with the language and will discover tricks as then you will be in contact with the community. (Best way to try this out is Competitive programming.) Once you know the application part, you need to apply it in the correct place. The best place is Open source projects (https://github.com/trending?l=cpp ). They are awesome because all the code written by awesome programmer and software engineers is available with documentation, which would further allow you to discover tricks and better methods to do things, If you found an even better method then you can contact them and bam! you are a contributor to the project. Basically you need to study and apply it asap. Practice makes perfect.
