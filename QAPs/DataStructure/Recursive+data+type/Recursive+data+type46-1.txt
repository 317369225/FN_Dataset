Why should or shouldn't I use Swift to write OS X or iOS apps the Functional Programming way?
Let's get this straight. Swift is not a functional language. It just has some functional elements like map/reduce and treats functions as first class citizens. But I also read that LLVM makes no promises on optimizing tail recursive functions. It does not have a List implementation , nor head/tail methods which are essential for constructing functional algorithms. Flatmap exists but in a very limited way. Enums are great but they don't really replace algebraic data types yet. Monads, which are the bread and butter of pure functional languages cannot be modeled in Swift as far as I know.
