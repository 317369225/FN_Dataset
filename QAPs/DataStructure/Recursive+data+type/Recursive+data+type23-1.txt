What is the main difficulty in parallel computing?
The key difficulty in parallel computing is that standard computer science does not describe algorithms to implement a couple fundamental operations in a massively parallel way on conventional switch fabric topologies. If your application requires one ofÂ  these operations, efficient parallelism will be problematic. The first problem is indexed structures and overlay networks that can efficiently handle interval data types e.g. geospatial polygons or search constraints. The second problem is massively parallelizable join algorithms, which are critical for manipulation of relationships between entities e.g. social graph analysis or semantic databases. If you solve these two problems then we know how to implement a complete and parallelizable recursive relational algebra upon which to build parallel systems, greatly extending the scope of what people can parallelize today.
