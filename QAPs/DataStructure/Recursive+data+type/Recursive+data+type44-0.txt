What are the differences between SQL Standard and MySQL syntax?
There is a page in the MySQL manual about this: 1.8.5 MySQL Differences from Standard SQL Though that page is incomplete. It doesn't describe extra things MySQL has implemented, which are not part of the standard, like most of its builtin functions, some data types, etc. All databases have some features they've added as enhancements beyond the SQL standard. Also keep in mind that many parts of standard SQL are optional for vendors to implement. For example, MySQL doesn't support recursive CTE functions, but that alone doesn't make MySQL not comply with the standard, it only means MySQL doesn't comply with the *full* standard. In fact, there are no SQL vendors who comply with the full standard. For example, there's no database currently on the market that implements SQL assertions.
