What is recursion?
I highly recommend Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid  by Douglas Hofstadter. It covers the importance of recursion in consciousness, mathematics, computer science, art and music. It changed my understanding of the Universe. Recursion is closely related to iteration and self-referential systems. My main research is the mathematics of tetration or iterated exponentiation. See http://www.tetration.org . There are two valid ways to represent a dynamical system in physics, as a PDE or as an iterated function. Almost all chaotic systems and fractals are generated by iterated functions or recursion. But even the physics of the entire Universe is supposed to be represented by a matrix operator that transforms the system from one instant into the next. The recursion or iteration of this process allows the dynamics of the  system to be plotted over time. So you could say that in quantum mechanics the state of the Universe as it changes over time can be determined through recursion where the laws of physics are represented by a function that transforms the Universe from one instant to the next,
