What does the following statement mean in Scala?
The statement does not declare that the name loop is equal to Int, which as you correctly note is a data type. The syntax def name : T1 = body defines name to have type T1, and the def tells the program to assign that name to be synonymous to body, which in practice means that name is bound to the result of evaluating body at runtime. Now, one thing you can do with a def is define a recursive name, in particular a recursive function. The snippet above is circular in a useless way -- at runtime, you'll get an infinite loop with no resolution. But "circular" definitions can be perfectly useful if they "bottom out" at some base case.
