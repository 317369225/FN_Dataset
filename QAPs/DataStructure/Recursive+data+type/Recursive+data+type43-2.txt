This sentence is false. Is the previous sentence true or is it false?
Short answer: The sentence and its attendant question are deliberately recursive, and as such have no absolute value. Longer answer: A sentence is a series of symbols bound together by syntax and grammar to communicate an idea. The symbols are meant to represent things, they are not things in themselves (unless talking about parts of speech, but even then, the word "word" represents the idea of a word, not strictly itself). Taken apart, the subject of the sentence, "This sentence," is directly addressing itself, which means the symbols are representing themselves. The predicate of the sentence, "is false," implies that the subject can have a true or false value. Since a symbol for "this symbol" has no meaning, it cannot have a true or false value assigned to it since it is entirely without substance. It would be equally [in]valid to assert that "'the' is false." It is a meaningless construction since the symbols comprising the statement do not represent anything that can be true or false. As an aside, I read an article this morning about Javascript and unusual quirks of the language. One thing I found fascinating--I am not a Javascript programmer--is that the language assigns "truthy" and "falsy" values to things which do not strictly resolve logically. http://www.smashingmagazine.com/... An excerpt: Here, weâ€™re attempting to compare the number 0 to the boolean 'false'. Because these data types are incompatible, JavaScript secretly coerces our variable into its truthy or falsy equivalent, which in the case of 0 ... is falsy.
