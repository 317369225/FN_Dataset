Why is there so much hype about functional programming?
I'll be brief. First, C (nor Pascal, nor Fortran, nor Algol etc) isn't functional language, as Scott Berry already pointed out. Haskell is functional language. At least check out Lisp (Scheme/Racket/Clojure). Second, OOP languages failed to fulfill their promise to produce highly modular and reusable components, to model domain naturally and capture domain constraints and symantics and concurrent/distributed programming in OO-languages is real mess. Functional languages (like Haskell) often are much better at all three issues. At least concurrent/distributed programming is sane this way. :)
