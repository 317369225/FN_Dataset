What is the best and most efficient way to start learning to code?
Practicing is probably the best way to learn coding. When I was a beginner what I used to do after learning a new topic was to solve more and more programming problems that are relevant to the topic I learn't. And I personally believe that practicing is the only efficient way to learn coding. Start from the basics to learn the programming structure and syntax. Code few basic Hello, World like programs. Then move on to some arithmetic and algebraic programs. Further some programs based on conditions(if else) and so on... one by one. Here are some collections of programming exercises for every beginner to start with Basic Programming problems exercises and solutions If else programming problems exercises and solutions Switch case programming problems exercises and solutions Loop programming problems exercises and solutions All the best.
