Is C++ a low level language?
I'd say it's a high-level low-level language.   It's strictly imperative, with no complicated built-in datatypes requiring a runtime of any sophistication.   It is reasonably clear what correct machine code looks like for any expression.   Pointers are direct and dangerous.  This is low-level stuff. At the time of creation, it had then-modern flow-of control constructs.   It is, as of c89, fairly strongly typed, and becoming more so over time.  This makes it high-level compared to assembler and predecessor system-implementation-languages. It is not high level compared to anything with dynamic intrinsic data structures, containers, hash maps, vector or matrix operations in the language, or anything that lacks pointers and has garbage collection.
