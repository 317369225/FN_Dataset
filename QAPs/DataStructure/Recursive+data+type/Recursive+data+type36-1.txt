Self-taught: After teaching myself programming for one year, how much of the subject should I know?
It is difficult to answer to this question without more information - for example, which subject was your degree in? Is this one year the only time in your life you have ever programmed?   One question which you should ask yourself - have I written a non-trivial application in it? I am not a programmer by profession - but did it for a few months many years ago. Taught myself Erlang - and wrote a simple chat server with it. Taught myself C - and implemented a simple library to read/write PNG images, a subset of the specification in RFC 2083. Of course, the code may not have been 'good' under any benchmarks but at least it served its purpose.
