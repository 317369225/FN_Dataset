How does a programmer become a brogrammer?
Male programmers are finally catching up to where girl-coders have been for several years? Don't spend all your time BBMing at the club - girls see it, girls know you're talking about them, and it makes you look douche (not bro).  Double if you have a wingman with you. Have the nice car.  However, avoid the douche move of racing, drifting, or anything meant to resemble either one.  Massive tickets, impounds, and wrecks are not bro. Get your finances in order before trying to impress girls.  Bounced checks, maxed credit cards and bankruptcy are douche, not bro. Respect the girl-coders.  Some of them can set you on your @$$, no matter how hard you rage at the gym.  Also, girl-code is prettier. Share the steak and eggs at breakfast.  Girls require protein, too, and you don't produce enough of it on your own. Feel free to go metro.  Be aware that if you're prettier than the girls, all your brogramming will be for naught.  Girls WILL assume you are closeted and you WILL be relegated to Friend Status. Code.  Code hard... but know when to put it away.  If a girl walks past in a see-through teddy, and you don't even look up because you're neck-deep in code, expect to spend a lot of time celibate no matter how bro you go.
