What are the best courses at Stanford?
ME101 - This class is a great introduction to mechanical engineering and creative thinking. I would recommend it to all, both engineers and humanities majors, because it teaches a different kind of thinking than many other text book classes and does a great job of getting you to think on your feet. ME203 - Also known as the class where you get to use the PRL or ME shop. This was certainly one of my favorite classes at Stanford, and if you are mechanically oriented or love to build things I highly recommend it, although it is often hard to get into. Prof. Dave Beach has been teaching this class for 30 years but he still brings the passion to manufacturing techniques. But by far the best part of the course is the shop, where you learn to use mills, lathes, sand casting among many other tools and techniques. Of course the most rewarding part is getting to design and build anything you want. Just remember "No adhesives damnit!" ME313 - CNC manufacturing. If you took 203 and loved it, and found your self wanting to build even more amazing and complicated projects I highly recommend this class.Â  Learning to use the CNC mills in this class was certainly a delight as was Craig Millroy. After this class you really could build just about anything. There is nothing more amazing than seeing your design come to life out of a block of 6061 Aluminum. CS 147/247 - If you like design and you like computer science, you might like Human Computer Interaction. This could also be a good class for non techies interested in web and iphone apps and learning what it takes to prototype these products. Much more applied than many other CS classes. dSchool classes - They change a lot, so I would recommend the dSchool boot camp class (although I never took it). If you are a grad student I would who is interested at finding new ways to look at problems I would suggest a dSchool class. Its all about collaboration so get ready to get dirty and work together.
