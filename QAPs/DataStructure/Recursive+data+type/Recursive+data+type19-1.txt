How do I learn C++ in one night? I know its possible.
I think it depends on your prior programming experience if you want to learn C++ in one night, but still if you just want to go through most important concepts in one or two hours than I think following video might be a help. This video covers following (very basic) concepts of C++. Data Types Arithmetic Arrays Loops User Input Strings Vectors Functions and Recursive Function File I/O Exception Handling Pointers Reference Operator Classes / Objects Private Static Variables Public / Encapsulation Constructors Static Functions this Inheritance Call Superclass Constructor Execute Static Method Virtual Methods Polymorphism Abstract Data Type I hope this helps.
