How do I learn C++ in one night? I know its possible.
It is impossible to learn C++ in a single night(assuming you are talking about a night on the earth). C++ is so vast and also expanding that even the founder(Stroustrup) may not be able to keep up with it sometimes. If you are talking about writing an introductory programming, we can do that in a single night.But learning entire C++ is almost an impossible task even for a master ofÂ  programming .It typically takes years of experience to learn a language in and out. Just going through the basic concepts involved without writing a single piece of code is just a mere waste of time.This applies to any programming language.Mastery of a programming language takes years. This should give a much more insight into this issue Page on norvig.com.
