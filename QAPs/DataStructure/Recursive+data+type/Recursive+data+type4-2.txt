What is recursion?
To understand recursion you first need to understand recursion. All jokes aside, recursion is defined as a breaking a problem into smaller problems of the same form. For example: [math]n! = n\times(n-1)![/math] could be expressed as: [math]5! = 5\times4![/math] then... [math]5! = 5\times4\times3![/math] and so on... You can probably see the recursive nature of factorials here. In computer science recursion is better defined as a function that calls itself, for example, this is what a recursive function can look like using C++: int Fact(int n) {    if (n <= 1) {        return 1;    } else {        return n * Fact(n - 1);    }} Russian dolls are a helpful analogy for thinking of recursion: Updated 201w ago • View Upvotes
