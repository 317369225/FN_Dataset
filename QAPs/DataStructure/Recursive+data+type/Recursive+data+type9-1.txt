Which C questions are asked in TCS interviews?
Just last week I cleared TCS interview. I'm a Mech engg. I wrote Basics of C in CV They asked me which c program i know and asked to write the same common question on C and about C asked among my friends include 1) fibonical series. 2) Swapping 2 number without 3rd variable. 3) To find greatest of three number. 4) write the types of loops in c. 5) why do we use getch. 6) difference between printf and puts. 7) pointers and bubble sort (in extreme cases). 8) Program to show switch statement. 9) for one candiate they asked to write c program to make chicken bryani using switch statement. other than this if you mention any projects they will fixate on that so make sure you know everything about that, I improve your communication skills, don't give one word answer. finally "All the best do well"
