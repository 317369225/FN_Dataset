What are the high level programming languages?
Wouldn't the highest level language be conversational English?  That would be the furthest from machine language and the closest to how humans communicate and define functions and processes.  When will we be able to just talk to a computer and describe in a spoken language what we want it to do and have it do it?  Seems like just another level of translators that convert English to C.  The average vocabulary is only about a thousand words, and you do have some things like context and tenses, but it can't be that hard. Even if it makes a few misinterpretations, more conversations could fix the problems and fine tune the functioning.  Forget using pointers and variables and understanding how a computer works, just do what I say!  I'm guessing this type of programming language will need to understand profanity, at least in the first few versions. The real plus is that once you have this capability, let it read everything so it learns how to do a lot of things.  Kind of the equivalent of using libraries of subroutines or functions.  That way you can tell it design a house and it will know what to ask you. You'll either end up with a very useful machine, or Skynet.  Hard to say which way it will go, lol.
