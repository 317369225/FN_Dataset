What math concepts a programmer should know to make things easier?
Boolean algebra is a concept that I believe every programmers should know. Some basics like isRaining || true is always true isRaining || false is equivalent to isRaining isRaining || !isRaining is always true isRaining && false is always false isRaining && true is equivalent to isRaining isRaining && !isRaining is always false and more advanced stuff !isRaining && !isSnowing is equivalent to !(isRaining || isSnowing) !(mailSent && mailReceived) is equivalent to !mailSent || !mailReceived The concept is quite handy when you need to change and move the existing code around.
