What math concepts a programmer should know to make things easier?
Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations The very simplest method is explicit Euler. Physics is a very intuitive example of how this is used. Let's say you have a cannon shooting a ball and want to track the ball position as it flies through the air. You know the start position, muzzle velocity and acceleration due to gravity. You can simulate the trajectory using integration. By integrating acceleration, we get velocity, and integrating velocity we get position. So our simulation looks like this: ball_position = cannon_postion;ball_velocity = muzzle_velocity;ball_acceleration = gravity / ball_mass; // this is a constantupdate(const float timestep) {   ball_position = ball_position + ball_velocity * timestep;   ball_velocity = ball_velocity + ball_acceleration * timestep;} This is fast and simple, but quite inaccurate and easy to blow up (head off to infinity). You can increase the accuracy/stability by decreasing the timestep, but then that means a lot more simulation steps, so you you lose the advantage of it being fast. There are other methods of integrating which have different complexity, accuracy and speed. Verlet integration is often used in things like games, because it is fast and stable, but not very accurate. For engineering simulations, 4th order Rungeâ€“Kutta integration is used because it is very very accurate, but requires a lot more computation.
