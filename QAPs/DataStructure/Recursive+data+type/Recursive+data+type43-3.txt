This sentence is false. Is the previous sentence true or is it false?
As you can see from the other answers, the most common response to this paradox is to claim that the statement is meaningless, and hence neither true nor false. The views among philosophers are more varied, however. Some indeed claim that it is meaningless by virtue of its self-reference. Others claim it is meaningful but neither true nor false as it is not grounded in any actual fact about the world. Some claim it is both true and false: a true contradiction, or dialetheia. Some claim it is simply false, since any statement implicitly asserts its own truth and "this sentence is true and false" is simply false. Others yet claim it is ambiguous and can be interpreted in ways that make it either true or false. For a slightly longer discussion of these approaches, see Liar paradox on my Quora blog Paradoxicon.
