What are the best courses at Stanford?
Any class taught by philosophy professors Nadeem Hussain and Chris Bobonich. They're articulate, lively, engaging, and hilarious. Each lecture is more like a little show than a lecture. I would also highly, highly recommend the following two classes: DANCE146: Social Dances of North America. Richard Powers is a fabulous teacher. You learn some basic waltz, swing dancing, and other partnered dances, which is all insanely fun, but coincidentally, you may also come out as a nicer person at the end. The best thing about Richard's teaching is that he constantly tells you to welcome mistakes as an opportunity to try something different, to dance for the pleasure and comfort of your partner, and to realize that everyone dances differently--so it's your goal to pay close attention to what your partner does and be willing to compromise. If you take these lessons to heart, you can cross-apply them to your love life and other relationships. DRAMA103: Beginning Improv. Improv is the art of creating dramatic scenes spontaneously, without a script. Really fun, with extremely silly games designed to make you less self-conscious. You learn how to be comfortable looking foolish in front of other people, and how to support each other. I think improv also teaches you to be a funnier person--for example, one thing that gets hammered into you is that the obvious choice is often the most coherent and amusing one. You learn to be braver about offering the first idea that pops into your head, but you also learn to welcome unexpected contributions from other players, and to build on top of those contributions to create a satisfying and coherent scene.
