What is the main difficulty in parallel computing?
In short, the main obstacle in going parallel is "going parallel", closely followed by "going parallel at scale". Its easy for us to think in parallel or do things in parallel. Classic example, men building a wall with bricks. Try expressing that as a computer program. The program has to mimic the workers. The first and foremost problem you will encounter is synchronization. How many bricks are left? How much work is left? Is any one else laying a brick in this place? etc. Now imagine doing this with a 1000 processors building a extremely large wall. There are several approaches to design the algorithms to overcome a lot of these things. But its not easy to: identify the parallelism in your problem express that parallelism in way that does not require a lot of synchronization implement the parallel algorithm There is lot more to it. I hope this blurb was able to provide enough information to help you appreciate the problems in going parallel. Updated 225w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
