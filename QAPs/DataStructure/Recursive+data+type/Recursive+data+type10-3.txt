What is the reason for fewer selections from IIT, Guwahati in GSoC 2014 compared to other IITs, NITs, BITS, and IIITs?
Its not about concentrating on fests or other activities, else you can call it the interest and dedication towards Gsoc'14 or calling it dis way would be more precise, may be people got to have many other options to work out with, in which they are much more interested. Talking like this may sound like backing other students.but well,I think people who are reading this already know that success can't be an over night dream. Remember, this type of question will not at all alter the confidence or interest or commitment of any one in both positive and negative ways else it is a waste of time reading the answers !!!     #I wasted a bit though Updated 92w ago • View Upvotes
