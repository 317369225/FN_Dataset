Why do interviewers care so much about algorithm and data structure?
Companies refine their interview process based on results, and often try new things. The fact that they ask about algorithms so much is quite reasonable. You mention Linux - why not Windows or MacOS? Anyway, what you can do on the command line is fairly limited compared to the use of even simple-minded algorithms, can be very slow on large datasets, and is unusable when you need to modify a large application to do something new. SQL requires a database, whereas even in the database space, there is a significant "NoSQL" segment of alternative interfaces. And you are right that not many students know SQL. Nor do they need to. It's specialized knowledge. Data structures beyond the ones you mentioned are very important. Hash tables and Balanced Search Trees (BSTs) in particular. In some cases, you need to understand, use or modify data structures not found in common textbooks, such as Bloom Filters. In some cases, you need to come up with new data structures or combinations. But even for simpler data structures, thorough knowledge is often correlated with the understanding of advanced data structures. Would you hire someone whose knowledge is limited to simple data structures? The Linux command line (Linux utilities) is not something that is easy to teach and can be boring - you learn that yourself. However, the study of algorithms and data structures requires a structured environment and comes with the study of algorithmic complexity.
