What is recursion?
In programming, recursion usually looks like a function referencing itself within its own definition in such a way that a chain of references is created. Here's an example in Python: def factorial(n):    if (n <= 1):        return 1    else:        return n * factorial(n - 1) Recursion is different from infinite recursion, when an infinite chain of references is created. It's also different from iteration (while loops, for loops, etc). Recursion is really useful for solving certain types of problems, e.g. working with a recursive data set like a tree. In the real world, an example of recursion might be pointing a camera at the monitor it's output to, and you'll see the monitor on the monitor nested self-similarly within itself down to a finite point.
