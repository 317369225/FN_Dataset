What are the necessary CS subjects I need to learn to become a software engineer or get placed in a reputed software company? I'm an ECE undergraduate student in my 3rd year of study.
Here are some topics you need to get familiar with: Data Structures : Stacks, Linked Lists, Queus, Trees - Binary Trees, BSTs, Tries, AVL trees, Red-Black trees etc, Graph. Basic programming concepts - variables, iteration, recursion, data types, for/while loops etc. Be proficient in some programming languages - C++, Java, Python etc. Best way is to do practice, competitive programming and making projects. Databases. Algorithms - techniques like divide and conquer, greedy, dynamic programming. Time and space complexity. Common algorithms like quick sort, binary search, breadth first search, depth first search, shortest paths in a graph and more. And for all this you can take the relevant courses in your college, or there is a huge amount of stuff available for free on the internet. I'd recommend Coursera.
