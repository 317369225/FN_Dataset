What is the reason for fewer selections from IIT, Guwahati in GSoC 2014 compared to other IITs, NITs, BITS, and IIITs?
I am quite sure that you are a freshman in IIT Guwahati like me. First of all i dont think posts like this should be publicly asked on quora  ,you know the obvious reason for it.Now since you have already asked here comes my views. Keep in my mind i am just a freshman and most of these  are the problems that i have faced or what my seniors have told me about. The main problem which i feel is that freshers aren't encouraged to code more . This could probably be due to administrative issue of keeping junior senior interaction at a bare minimum. Now this problem compounds in 2nd year,where due to the workload ,its difficult to make much progress once you dont have a good start. I have huge respect for the activites of the coding club but i believe that the frequency of hackathons/coding competitions has to increase much more. This semester we just had one hackathon. I think we need at least once every month. People do qualify from IIT Guwahati for Gsoc and other competitions but it is less since we dont have a particularly strong coding culture and hence  the people who are good coders are unable to pass on their knowledge to the succeeding generations.
