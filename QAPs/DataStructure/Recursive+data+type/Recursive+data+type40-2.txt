What is the best and most efficient way to start learning to code?
The best way to learn to code is to actually start coding. Start with the Hello World program Next try some basic arithmetic to understand different data types. Use the mod operator and division to understand the precision of each data type. Next Start writing programs which accept input from the user. Once you are done with that, move to conditional statements. Use if-else, else-if ladders and switch cases. Next is iteration. Understand the difference between do-while, while and for loop. Then try to make patterns using the same.By now you should be able to make programs like ATM simulator and Calculator. Next comes your first step to data structures - "Arrays". Learn understand and implement the sorting and searching algorithms Next comes "Strings".By now you can make programs like databases for libraries and banks. Start making functions now. Understand the way parameters and function which return a value work. Once you are familiar with the working of functions, start using recursion. Try to redo all your programs which u did using iterations using recursion (though not all of them can be done via recurion). I believe that for a beginner, this knowledge of code is sufficient. Further when you switch to C++ or Java, you'll be introduced to concepts of OOP and will learn to work with classes. And if you ever come across a doubt or find yourself confused then you can always use stackoverflow :) Do let me know if you found my answer useful. And welcome to the wonderful world of programming :D
