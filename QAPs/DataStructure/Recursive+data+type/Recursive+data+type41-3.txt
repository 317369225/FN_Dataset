How are students in Indian colleges taught programming?
We had a Lab in our 6th semester, in which we were supposed to do assignments on different programming languages. After the submission, we used to have one lab exam. So, one day Python programming was tested. Question: Print all possible permutations of a string. Example: input: abc, output: abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba. One of my friends who was sitting near me, didn't know how to solve it. He secretly pulled out his smartphone and searched for the code over internet. He got the code in C++ for the same question, but now he didn't know how to convert it to Python. So, he compiled the program: g++ a.cpp stored the a.out file, and he called the teacher. When the teacher came, he executed the same stored file: ./a.out The output was correct. The teacher didn't ask him to show his code plus he (the teacher) didn't even know how a python program is executed. Whereas, I coded correctly in python myself. I got 8/10 and he got 10/10. He laughed at me after the exam got over. :-( Updated 46w ago • View Upvotes • Not for Reproduction
