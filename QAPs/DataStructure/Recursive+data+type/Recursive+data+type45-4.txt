What math concepts a programmer should know to make things easier?
The thing that has helped me the most isn't so much math as it is logic. Way back in 3rd or 4th grade, they had us do a ton of games like these, up to 20 or 30 different things that had to be accounted for. Logic Puzzles by Puzzle Baron The concept is pretty simple, an example would be having to figure out table arrangements at a family dinner. Grandpa can't sit next to uncle George, Sally and Ben must be at the children's table, but Stephen is old enough now that he could sit at either. What you need to do is figure out all of the intersections between those rules so that everyone is happy. When you're writing code, it's not just about writing something that runs properly when you use known test data. The larger part is knowing all the ways your code might be run *improperly* and making sure it fails gracefully or doesn't fail at all. It doesn't matter how mathematically perfect, beautiful, lightweight, and simple the code is. If the application fails because someone forgets to fill in a form field or a database that you expect to always be there doesn't respond in time, it's pretty much worthless. Other than that, at least with the website / php coding that I do, it's mostly just algebra - keeping track of variables and what their types are. Operators for modifying them are a bit different in every language, and for different types. So 'adding' to a string might use "." or "::" but adding numbers will probably be "+".Â  Understanding functions and how object oriented programming work is key, but I'm not sure if that falls under the realm of math. And, hey, at the end of the day, knowing how to use google to find the answer for whatever's got you stuck can usually get you past any lack of math knowledge. ;)
