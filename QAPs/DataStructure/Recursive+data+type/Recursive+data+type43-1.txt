This sentence is false. Is the previous sentence true or is it false?
This is a restatement of the Liar's Paradox (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lia...), and the closely related Russell's paradox (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rus...). There are different takes on the liar's paradox. Perhaps the easiest response to understand is Arthur Prior's. When we say "My hair is black" I really mean: "it is true that my hair is black" or alternatively: "this statement is true and my hair is black." Consequently, when I say "this sentence is false," I really mean "this statement is true and this statement is false" which is clearly a contradiction.
