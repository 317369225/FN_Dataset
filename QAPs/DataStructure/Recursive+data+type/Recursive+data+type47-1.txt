Why does the CodeChef online judge give me a SIGSEGV error while the code runs just fine on my machine for the practice problem FCTRL2 (Small Factorials)?
This will not work for the current question. All you are doing is simply applying the recursive brute force solution to solve this. However for larger values of n, this method will not work at all. My friend, the value of 100! is very very large. To be precise, the value of 100! is "93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000" , So obviously this won't fit into any data type in C/C++ (at least not one in my knowledge). So the logic to this question is based on manipulating the result by considering as an array of digits. As Anup Kalbalia Sir pointed out, check out the editorial available and before submitting your code, be sure to test it manually specially on boundary values. Happy Coding !!!
