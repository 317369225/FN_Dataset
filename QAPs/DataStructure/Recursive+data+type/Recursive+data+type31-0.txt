What is the best method to understand recursive functions?
See How to Design Programs (first or second edition). It will teach you where recursion comes from and how to write programs over it. The Design Recipe leads you directly to when recursion applies and how to use it in programs. It also makes the critical distinction between structural and generative recursion, which you need to understand. In particular, problems like fibonacci and factorial are some of the worst problems for learning recursion; if you were first exposed to it through them, you need to start afresh, and HtDP enables you to make that start.
