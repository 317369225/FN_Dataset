What are the advantages of using C++ over C?
Object polymorphism makes certain types of problems, particularly those with hierarchical or recursive data structures, easier to reason about.  Templates reduce the amount of duplicate code when you need a family of functions that do the same operation to different data types, including defined types.  Namespaces reduce the probability of collisions between symbols.  Complex expressions involving defined data types can be written in less space using operator overloading. Finally, if you don't need any of that fancy stuff, you can always just code in straight C. Updated 47w ago • View Upvotes
