I have been reached out to have an interview at Google. How much time should I give myself to prepare?
Google cares more about how you think rather than whether you have correct syntax or not. Don't worry about that. 'Google' level algorithms can all be found in Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. I'd highly recommend you get the book and use the questions as practice. Make sure you're understanding the solutions and not just memorizing them. If you have basic knowledge of data structures, a week is more than enough time to prepare. Each category of questions uses the same types of thinking. Get the hang of dynamic programming, questions related to strings, recursion, data structures, and search algorithms. Remember that it's okay to say the trivial answer in the beginning. It's better than saying no answer. They want to see how you think, and how you evolve the trivial solution into a time and space efficient one.
