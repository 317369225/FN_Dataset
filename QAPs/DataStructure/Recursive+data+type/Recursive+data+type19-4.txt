How do I learn C++ in one night? I know its possible.
Can you learn English in one night? No. It is the same with C++ Programming Language. Furthermore, C++ is changing. Every version will introduce new language features and libraries. New version should come along somewhere in 2017. Learning is a continuous process, there's no end to it. You could learn Python in few nights but you still will only get the basic of it. But if you talk about the language like C++, hell no. I've been learning C++ for three months now, sometime I learn day and night, so far I've only touch the surface of it. In one night, maybe you will be able to learn adequate level of understanding of all the basic keywords and syntaxes in C++ without learning the standard libraries. I myself only managed to learn few STL libraries within these three months. It would take years to truly have good understanding of these libraries. For you to learn C++ is to have good understanding of all STL and Boost libraries. But even then you will only have grasped the basic.
