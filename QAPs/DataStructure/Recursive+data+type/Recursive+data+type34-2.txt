Why is there so much hype about functional programming?
Compared to traditional imperative programming styles which require you to type many redundant things to do simple stuff, FP enables you to type only things that you really need to type Example, before Java 8 to retrieve sub list: List ourSubList ... For looping ourList   Inside check for criteria     Populate ourSubList After Java 8 List ourSubList = ourList.stream().filter(...).collect(...); Basically the trend of programming language nowadays is to become less and less verbose and FP is helping us to achieve that goal
