Why is there so much hype about functional programming?
You're mixing up imperative programming languages and functional programming languages. C isn't a functional language. Most people probably don't start with a functional language, most will start with imperative, or these days, often they'll start off with OOP. There is hype around functional languages because at some point there needs to be hype around *something*. I remember when Java was fashionable beyond belief, there were countless programs called J-something. I remember when Ruby was the hot-shit, I remember when using Delphi was totally cool. Functional programming is having it's day in the sun, I'm sure the sun will shift onto something else soon enough, then given enough time, it'll shift back, then away again, ad infinitum. Functional programming has it's merits same as everything else, it'll have it's 15 minutes of fame, as did everything else.
