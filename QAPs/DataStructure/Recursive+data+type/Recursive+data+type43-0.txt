This sentence is false. Is the previous sentence true or is it false?
No. Having passed the 100-vote threshold, I'm going to add some pointless elaboration, not for the purpose of explanation but for the purpose of furthering my rage when the administrators collapse it anyway. The sentence is neither true nor false; therefore the answer to the question is "no".  The "law of the excluded middle" and other logical axioms only apply to logical systems with rigorously defined rules. The sentence above, stated in English, is of necessity vague and the only meaningful answer is "no". A more precise answer would involve a rigorous definition of the semantics in which the statement is to be interpreted, though Kurt Gödel and Bertrand Russell showed that this still leaves us with situations in which statements can be neither true nor false within the system.
