What is the best and most efficient way to start learning to code?
Start learning Python first. Any other language will be easy like anything. Trust me. Learn Python first. Its the easiest and the most effective language in CS.which can do a lot of things, its very powerful language. But if u are just focused on C and C++, then i will say there is no need to learn in order. Learn it parallely.u will understand better. All the best.
