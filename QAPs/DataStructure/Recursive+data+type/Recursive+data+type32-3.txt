Is Emacs Lisp the same as Common Lisp?
Best way to know is to try porting a clisp app in emacs. One is indistinct data types (other than inefficient recursion & syntactics): Characters are distinct from integers in Common Lisp,whereas a character in Emacs Lisp is nothing more than an integer. Similarly,all integers are  fixnums be it rational/complex/large number. All arrays are one-dimensional. No readtables or pathnames. Streams are a set of existing data types rather than a new data type of their own.  Hash tables, random-states, structures, and packages are built from Lisp vectors or lists rather than being distinct types.
