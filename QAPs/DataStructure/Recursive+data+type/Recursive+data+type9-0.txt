Which C questions are asked in TCS interviews?
What are pointers? Array vs. Linked List ? Basic Star Pattern programs? Data Structures like (Stacks, Queue, etc) not programs but basic information about  them and just overlook of implementation. Fibonacci series, palindromes , string reverse: Using Recursions , Using user defined functions or by using direct inbuilt functions. Sorting and searching concepts like bubble sort, insertion sort selection sort. Overview of Hashing and some different but important concepts. They may ask for data types, dynamic allocations, and also ask to find errors in sample codes, or they can ask for Output of the sample code. They can give a scenario and ask to code for it.Questions are endless but id concepts are good then you can easily crack it. They just ask for basics of C languages, but your theoretical foundations of C must be good enough.  You have to answer each Why? How? and What? of the concepts they ask. You have to answer each Why? How? and What? of the concepts you explain to them (CROSS QUESTIONS Hahaha...). Additional Points (if you are from C.S.E or C.Tech) prepare also for subjects like OS(operating systems) DBMS(Database management system) DS(Data Structures) just the basics will do the job but again conceptually you must be strong. P.S : Just for the freshers interview
