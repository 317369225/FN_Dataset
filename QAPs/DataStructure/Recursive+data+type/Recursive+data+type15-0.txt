Why do interviewers care so much about algorithm and data structure?
Companies have reasons for conducting interviews this way and they might even be able to convince themselves it works. However, the sad and honest truth is that companies are bad at interviewing and hiring in general. How many companies can actually back up their interviewing approach with data? From Google's SVP of People Operations (6/19/13): Years ago, we did a study to determine whether anyone at Google is particularly good at hiring. We looked at tens of thousands of interviews, and everyone who had done the interviews and what they scored the candidate, and how that person ultimately performed in their job. We found zero relationship. http://nyti.ms/11MuanK Hiring is an extremely difficult problem and companies are just trying to do their best with what they have at their disposal. Just because many companies ask similar lines of questioning doesn't mean they have it all figured out.
