Parallel Computing: How do I broadcast a vector of derived datatype using MPI?
MPI data types are defined recursively. You can define a Struct datatype to describe a structure, and then define a Contiguous or Vector dataype to create an array of those structures. As coincidence would have it, I'm working on a book about parallel programming. Parallel Computing Book Go to booksources>examples>mpi>c for some examples programs; they are explained in the text of the book. Another option is to use MPI_Pack and MPI_Unpack. I'm not sure why those aren't discussed more often, as I found them quite useful for sending heterogeneous data. Updated 110w ago • View Upvotes
