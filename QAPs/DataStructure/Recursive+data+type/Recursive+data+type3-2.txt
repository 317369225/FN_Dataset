What are the necessary CS subjects I need to learn to become a software engineer or get placed in a reputed software company? I'm an ECE undergraduate student in my 3rd year of study.
You better be good in all the CS related papers you have as part of your curriculum. I think you must have following either as elective or compulsory papers : C, networking, os concepts, distributed systems, microcontrollers and their programming, microprocessor and probably one paper on C++. In a way you are already ready for interviews. Another point: being from ece, people will not expect you to be excellent in data structures. Knowing linked lists, stacks and queues should be enough. Similar is with DBMS exposure. Problem you might face in interviews will probably not be you missing CS knowledge, rather it will beÂ  you not knowing anything/very little from your own papers!!
