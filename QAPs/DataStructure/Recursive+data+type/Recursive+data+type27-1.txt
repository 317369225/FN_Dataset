Are there any useful recursive functions that do not contain a base case?
There are two circumstances in which this makes sense: You want to write an infinite loop. This makes sense for a variety of long-running programs such as servers. This will only work in a language that properly implements space-safe function calls, such as Scheme or ML. Donâ€™t try it in Python or Java. You are generating an infinite data structure. This only works if you use laziness (or something morally equivalent) to delay evaluation. For example, the Haskell function to generate an infinite list that enumerates the integers from a given starting point has only a recursive case.
