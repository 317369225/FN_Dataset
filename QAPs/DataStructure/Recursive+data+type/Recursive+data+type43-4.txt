This sentence is false. Is the previous sentence true or is it false?
To Joshua's answer, I would add, "and this is also not really important."  I know Bertrand Russell wanted everyone to drop everything and attend to paradoxes.  Some of academic philosophy still claims that paradoxes of this kind prove there's something wrong with logic or mathematics or the way our minds are wired.  But I think you're better off to smile at the humor and continue on to solve the problems you can solve.
