Why does the CodeChef online judge give me a SIGSEGV error while the code runs just fine on my machine for the practice problem FCTRL2 (Small Factorials)?
A SIGSEGV is an error(signal) caused by an invalid memory reference. This problem can't be solved using a simple brute force approach. Remember that in the problem 'n' can range till 100. What is factorial(30) ? It is '265252859812191058636308480000000' with approx. 33 digits. Even 'long long' will not support this. You code works only for few values of 'n'. Try cases like 35,50, 99 to get to know where you're actually wrong.  There's actually a logical way of solving this problem. You can find the way here SPOJ FCTRL2 - Algorithmist , Tutorial For Small Factorials (Go through these links only after giving your best try.) And one more thing to say, You've declared the array  n[t] before taking the input 't'. I have changed it. :D Hope that helps you. Happy coding.
