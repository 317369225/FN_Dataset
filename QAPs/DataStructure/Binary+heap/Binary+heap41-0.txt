How does std::priority_queue work in C++?What happens when a new element is pushed into it?
Here is the definition of priority queue template <class T, class Container = vector<T>,   class Compare = less<typename Container::value_type> > class priority_queue; Element gets push backed to the vector (or other container if you specify it, by default it's vector) and then shift up the element to keep the heap property. Heap property: Binary heap Here is some details from priority_queue::push - C++ Reference: This member function effectively calls the member function push_back of the underlying container object, and then reorders it to its location in the heap by calling the push_heap algorithm on the range that includes all the elements of the container.
