What is heap size in a binary heap?Is it the no. of levels in the heap? How should I calculate it? Can you explain heapify in an easy way?
See basically, binary heap is a data structure that is created using a   binary tree. A binary heap is a complete binary tree.Heap is nothing but  an  array of elements.Heap size represents the number of elements in the  heap stored within the array.The nodes are always filled from left to  right. Now, coming to the number of levels in the heap.The  number of levels are the levels of the tree.            For example: Consider a  binary tree with one root node and two children(forms a triangle like  structure) then, the number of levels will be 2.One for the root  node(or, parent node) and the other for its children. Now that you know the number of levels and the heap size, lets find out what heapify is? Heapify is a property that checks whether the properties stateed below are followed or not. We have two types of properties (heapify): 1) Max-heapify 2) Min-heapfiy Max-heapify  is a property which checks that the value of root node should be  greater than the value of its children (assuming the children are  themselves max-heaps). Keeping this property in mind, you can sort the  data using swapping or other methods. Min-heapify is the reverse of Max-heapify.
