Is it natural for a good programmer to forget syntax/algorithms over time if you don't use it a lot?
Very true and I am experiencing the same. So I am also trying a couple of approaches. Based on the following thoughts Remembering algorithms are not important but coming up with algorithms to a particular problems is definitely important. (Same as understanding proof is relatively easier than proving by self) The more you experience A, easier you can come up with A. But B might be forgotten. Brain can remember better when you have different experiences on a same topic. We don't like a thing if we don't know much about it. A few Strategies I am trying Core concepts like programming paradigms, algorithmic thinking formulating with data structure, and etc are everywhere in IT world. Diving in depth of them is worth in my whole career. Knowing multiple frameworks and languages are time consuming. Let's focus on less than two or three so increase chance to experience of them.  Apply algorithmic thinking in life problems so increase connections between theory and reality in brain. Therefore, the memory lasts longer.  I am trying to learn Math again. Hope you find yours.
