What is the coolest data structure?Which one makes you say, "Wow! That's cool!"? What makes it so cool? What are some applications?
I'd like to add one data structure that has been very surprisingly missing from other answers, Segment Trees. It's a binary tree used to answer range queries. The cool about it is that it acts as a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to range queries. Want to process range queries in one or higher dimensions, check. Or, you want to update nodes on the fly with lazy propagation, it has that too. It performs better than interval trees in higher dimensions and has the same time complexity as that of BIT(binary indexed tree) when it comes to queries onÂ  cumulative sums. And virtually anything than can be done with interval trees and BIT can also be accomplished with a segment tree. So here it is, Segment Tree, For all you range query needs.
