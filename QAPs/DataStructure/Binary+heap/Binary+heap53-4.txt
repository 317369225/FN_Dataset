I have experience in programming. Currently I'm planning to study either algorithms or data structures. Which one should I get started with?
You need to learn Data Structures first. Knowing Data Structures first is like knowing car parts. After knowing different parts you can create all kinds of cars. After getting knowledge of Data Structures you can create algorithms using Data structures. You will be able to create good and efficient algorithm after having good knowledge of Data Structures. Firstly concentrate on basic Data Structures and then start solving basic algorithms. After you get confidence in solving algorithms you can go ahead and read advance data structures.
