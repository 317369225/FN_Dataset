How did you go from understanding algorithms to being able to design them yourself?
The starting point for coming up with an algorithm to solve a particular problem is first of all to be able to model that problem in terms of variables. Then start by describing what you want to happen to those variables in terms of discrete non-ambiguous steps for the simplest possible scenario. The easy aspects such as if-else-then conditions will be the easiest to list down. You can then identify the need for loops when you try to expand on the scenario and voila you have an algorithm. Recursion, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, etc are essentially optimizations. Here is a simple example: The problem statement is that you have to find the largest integer in a given set, e.g. {10, 2, 4, 3, 11, 20} So start by stating the problem for the simplest scenario in terms of variables: Find the largest integer given the set of two integers {x, y}. The answer is quite trivial: if (x > y) then print "x is the largest integer" else print "y is the largest integer" Now expand this to a larger set say {x, y, z} and you will see that the if-else-then block becomes more complex. If you now instead think of a better way to store a set of integers with an unknown length then immediately you will have the answer: Use arrays! So then rephrase the problem: Given an array of integers find the largest integer. Given that elements of an array are accessed using their index we can now rephrase the solution as follows given that we know the length of the array possibly as an input, say 3: if ints[0] > ints[1] then { if ints[0] > ints [2] then { print ints[0] is the largest } else if ints[2] > ints[1] then { print ints[2] is the largest } else print ints } else if ints[1] > ints[2] then { print ints[1] is the largest } else print ints[2] is the largest } Now hopefully you can see the need for a loop if you make the length a variable as well and voila: int[] ints = [user input] int length = ints.length int maxInt = 0   for int i = 0; i < length; i++ { if maxInt < ints[i] then maxInt = ints[i] }   print "The largest integer is: " + maxInt And there you go! This is actually the example that helped me understand the need for variables and how to define an algorithm once the problem was expressed in terms of variables. It may be trivial but till date I have not found a better way to design an algorithm. I hope it helps!
