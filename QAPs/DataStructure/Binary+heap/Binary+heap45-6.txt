How did you go from understanding algorithms to being able to design them yourself?
In general you can just look at all the problems you know, and try to fit the new problem to one of the existing solved problems. If that doesn't work, there are specific approaches to solving problems, such as dynamic programming, etc., which can help you come up with an answer. I recommend reading The Algorithm Design Manual: Steven S Skiena: 9781848000698: Amazon.com: Books, it's an amazing book that covers this topic very clearly. Another good book is Competitive Programming 3, or you can just read something like Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming, Volumes 1-4A Boxed Set: 9780321751041: Computer Science Books @ Amazon.com
