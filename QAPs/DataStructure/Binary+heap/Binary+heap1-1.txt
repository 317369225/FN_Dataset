How many Binary heaps can be made from N distinct elements?Two heaps should be considered the same if their (in order, post order, pre order) traversals are the same (i.e. left and right children can be distinguished)
let P(N) be the desired permutations, then, P(N) = summation (C(N,M) * P(M) * P(N-M-1) ) over M  0<=M<=N-1  where C(N,M) is number of ways to choose M elements from N. M is the number of elements smaller than the root. Explanation : root is the minimum, thus it can go to only 1 specific location in the array. so, the problem P(N) can be divided into two sub-problems , each solving both-subtrees of the root. This is the rough idea, i might have missed few boundary cases.
