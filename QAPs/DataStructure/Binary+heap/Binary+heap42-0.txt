For which undergraduate years should most students understand the content of CLRS Introduction to Algorithms?Do most students finish the content in their first year, or is it until the second year at most? New to CLRS, planning to self-study it.
At a Canadian university, typically you should be able to understand most of the content in CLRS by the end of your third year; in fact, CLRS is often the textbook for a third year algorithms course. Note however that such a course can only cover a small fraction of the topics in CLRS, and no undergraduate student can reasonably be expected to finish all the content. There are also parts of CLRS that are much more advanced than what a typical undergrad would be expected to handle. (For example, don't worry if you can't understand matroid theory.) Edit: Eugene Yarovoi's ballpark figure sounds about right to me---you'll actually cover about half of the topics in the book. Not in great depth, but you will probably learn about Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, dynamic programming, push-relabel algorithms, and stuff like that.
