How does one become good at solving algorithm/programming problems?
Spending time discussing problems with people who're good (and perhaps better than you) at Algorithms/Problem Solving is a great way to get better at Algorithms. I have been quite lucky to have roommates and friends who're much better than me at Problem solving and Algorithms. These people have been very humble and patient in sharing problem solving approaches and insights. The time I spent with them helped me get better much faster than I otherwise could have. So find some like minded people! Reading books helps, but I found it a rather slow process. I found watching video lectures a faster way to understand common techniques / concepts.Â  There are several video lecture series and online courses from universities like MIT, UC etc.. Once you understand the gist / core idea from the video lecture, it's a good idea to go back to the text book and read/revise the material thoroughly. Ultimately, understanding the material is key here. Once you understand the material thoroughly, you would be able to spot problems that can be solved using what you already know. disclaimer: I am no expert.
