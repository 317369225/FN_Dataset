Is it natural for a good programmer to forget syntax/algorithms over time if you don't use it a lot?
Yes, it is very natural for keep forgetting syntax, library function names and arguments, command-line options and all other stuff when you're not using it on the regular basis. I programmed in C++ for over 12 years and even though I remember all the concepts very clearly, things will progress rather slowly if I start coding in it now. The good news is, you start recalling stuff very quickly, and somehow, at least for me, one thing pulls another as your brain slowly returns to a once-forgotten context. Some things, like DOS INT 21h, stick for decades. Algorithms and, as you say, general approach to a problem are a bit different. Understanding and insight is what keeps it in memory best. It's much harder to forget the solution if you know how to devise it yourself based on logic, not knowledge. Seek for a deeper understanding, similarities to and differences from solutions to other problems, and fundamental concepts and principles (such as divide-and-conquer or dynamic programming), and you'll make things much harder to forget. And of course, nothing beats practice. The more experience you have using an algorithm or operating a data structure, the better you will remember and understand them. As a final solution, if you still struggle remembering something, try implementing it from scratch - e.g. binary heap, quicksort, Dijkstra's algorithm, etc. Nothing really gives you more insight into how algorithms and data structures work than implementing and debugging them yourself. Once you reach a deep understanding, you will never forget it.
