What is an interesting data structure for programming that most programmers haven't heard of?
Last summer when I enrolled for CS50 on edx I learned about a really fascinating data structure Trie.Â  And I was almost crazy behind this data structure when found about it's applications, one of which is Dictionary Representation(https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=...). Trie is also used to implement auto complete feature in our smartphones. One can argue that this is highly inefficient data structure for storing something. However, as the data grows, efficiency of Trie escalate really quickly and do the work responsibly. P.S Here is a link to CS50 notes, where you can find relevant videos and explanation of this Data Structure. https://study.cs50.net/tries
