Is it natural for a good programmer to forget syntax/algorithms over time if you don't use it a lot?
Everyone looses access to learned skills when they go unused. The rate and amount of lost access varies widely among individuals. We do not loose the memory, we loose the connection to it. The more significant the use of knowledge is, the more durable the connection. When you relearn something, you learn at a highly accelerated rate because re-establishing one connection reinvigorates connections to related knowledge. Doing occasional (monthly) reviews of areas of knowledge will keep the connections active. This can be done by study or, more commonly, reading about the topic. I have not seen studies, but I suspect programmers who retain a broad range of skills are also avid readers.
