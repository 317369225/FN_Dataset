Can we reduce the running time of huffman code to O(log log n) by replacing the binary heap with Van Emde Boas tree?
By "the running time of Huffman code" I take it you mean the time required to construct the code tree. I don't think this can work, because a Van Emde Boas tree can be used only with integer keys, whereas the elements you want to insert are the weighted partial code trees as they are constructed during Huffman's algorithm. Also, the integer keys need to have the correct ordering relation, so we cannot just assign integers to partial code trees. In short, I don't see how this could be made to work.
