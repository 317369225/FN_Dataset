Why is it when removing the root of a binary heap that we replace it with the rightmost element in the last level?I know it is guaranteed to work, but is it the most efficient way?
Leaving this answer; although it is incorrect, for the sake of relevant discussion on the comment chain related to the implementation of a heap using an array, and how this relates to the right-most node on the bottom row being the optimal choice. --- Assuming this refers to a sorted heap, and that the sort algorithm places lower numbers in the left child and higher numbers in the right child, the right-most node in the tree of the left child of the root by definition has the next lower value than the value of the root -- and that is why it is a correct node to elevate as the new root. There could be an exceptional case, though, when multiple nodes have the same value. What other approach do you suggest?
