For which undergraduate years should most students understand the content of CLRS Introduction to Algorithms?Do most students finish the content in their first year, or is it until the second year at most? New to CLRS, planning to self-study it.
I'm not undergraduate, but in my CLRS (3rd edition) they say : (for the student) "We have tried, however, to make this a book that will be useful to you now as a course textbook and also later in your career as a mathematical desk reference or an engineering handbook." (for the teacher) : "In an undergraduate course, you might use only the earlier sections from a chapter; in a graduate course, you might cover the entire chapter" It's huge, and some topics won't not be taught in the 1st and 2nd year.
