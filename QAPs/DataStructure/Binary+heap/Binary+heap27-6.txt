How does one become good at solving algorithm/programming problems?
My 2 cents. Most of it is already said. One more way to learn is to put emotions (which in term involves our subconscious mind) in the problem. Not an easy thing but works when visualization/logical progression/ zoom in - zoom out/ generalization - specialization/ mind maps are helping but not leading to final solution. e.g. a sorted data can thought of as a group of people with different heights partitions can be colored buckets decision paths can be a maze in a dense jungle counting problems can involve your kid(s) to highlight a special case shortest job first can be thought of as a lazy guy against an active dude Not sure if I am able to explain but somehow put emotions in the prob. Learning is all about love.
