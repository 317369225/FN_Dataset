What are the 10 must-know algorithms and data structures for a software engineer?
The question is too restrictive and not very practical. (why 10 items list? when and by whom will these be used?) Of course, taking theoretic and formal instruction and preparing to be a software engineer, some algorithms and data structures will be very popular for one to learn. But, "on the field", it depends a lot. It's like asking: "what knowledge does a mechanical engineer use the most?". Is it working for a bicycle shop or on NASA shuttles? And, yes, there are a lot of common traits, but I don't think the way the question is put is helpful in any way. Programming games you would usually use other data structures than on enterprise applications. What are you trying to achieve with an answer? Do you want to start learning to program? (a formal education then may be a good start) Are you a journalist just curious to learn about these technologies for a story research? etc... And, not to seem that I am just complaining, I will also give you "some" answer: take Knuth and Cormen books and take 10 items from there. Or, better, take any introductory book on these topics and look at the contents, because these books usually have good structure. You can then search for these online or on other books if the contents on the first book does not satisfy you. On topic, others gave better answers, even if biased on their experience. I just wanted to make a remark.
