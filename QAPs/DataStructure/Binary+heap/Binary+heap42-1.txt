For which undergraduate years should most students understand the content of CLRS Introduction to Algorithms?Do most students finish the content in their first year, or is it until the second year at most? New to CLRS, planning to self-study it.
Most PhDs in computer science, as well as some professors of computer science at major universities, do not understand all of CLRS. That is, if they don't specialize in algorithms. CLRS actually has a lot of content. Most undergraduate students learn a little less than one-half of the book by the time they graduate. Graduate students not specializing in algorithms will probably learn a little more than half. There's some pretty esoteric stuff in the book. There's this data structure called a van Emde Boas tree that is hardly ever seen in practice and is mostly of theoretical interest. There's a type of heap called the Fibonacci heap that is hardly ever used because it's much easier to use a regular ol' binary heap. So...it's not all that surprising that most people don't understand everything in the book. It was intended as a reference as well as a textbook, for students and professionals alike.
