Is it natural for a good programmer to forget syntax/algorithms over time if you don't use it a lot?
I've been a programmer for a couple decades and have known hundreds of programming languages and many many tricks. When I code I keep the manual for the language I'm using close at hand and I keep notes on the tricks I discover. Even as an expert you aren't going to remember everything and things change rapidly so what you knew yesterday may be invalid today. Instead focus on understanding what is going on behind the scenes. It helps to understand how the computer works, how the network works, how the operating system works, how the compiler works, etc. All the best tricks come about by knowing how data is moving through the computer and taking advantage of unintended features. You will pick up the zen of programming by focusing on the edge cases where you aren't sure what the best way is and trying every possible way of doing it you can think of and comparing the results. And don't just believe what you Google or what some professor said because often they are wrong.
