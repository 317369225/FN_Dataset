How much work did it take to get on the US IOI team?Specifically, how many hours per week, how many problems on which online judges, and how many practice contests.
Same exact situation as Johnny Ho -- I qualified for camp after about a year of work, and did USACO training (and a bit of Codeforces) for about 20-25 hours a week for the year after that.
