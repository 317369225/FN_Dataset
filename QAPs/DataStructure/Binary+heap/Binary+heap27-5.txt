How does one become good at solving algorithm/programming problems?
It's always practice that makes you perfect. No miracles will occur in your life such that within a month or 2 you can't see result. It would take time for you to improve, but never give up and try each and every day. Find a time in your time table for problem solving. I'm sure that what you said about "not giving up easily" is not enough. I can say that at times we would need to submit around hundred times to get the right answer for a problem.  You should not give up until you get the answer. You can practice problems from online coding platforms like HackerRank, HackerEarth - Programming challenges and Developer jobs  , Programming Competition,Programming Contest,Online Computer Programming You can also follow Code Monk - Be a better programmer. Hope it will help. Happy coding!!!!!!!!
