Why is it when removing the root of a binary heap that we replace it with the rightmost element in the last level?I know it is guaranteed to work, but is it the most efficient way?
A heap ( lets take max-heap) has to satisfy two properties viz. 1. Order Property - parent should have higher priority than its children 2. Structure Property- should be a complete binary Tree With Deletion, the order property is destroyed which needs to be restored , keeping in mind the structure property as well, so the safest element that can be removed without disturbing the Structure property is the right most element of the last row
