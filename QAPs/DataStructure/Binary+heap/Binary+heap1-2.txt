How many Binary heaps can be made from N distinct elements?Two heaps should be considered the same if their (in order, post order, pre order) traversals are the same (i.e. left and right children can be distinguished)
Interesting question. It is equivalent to the problem as input is in numbers: from 1 to N definition: f(n) is the number of distinct heaps from 1 to n. f(1) : 1 f(2) : 1 * f(1) f(3) : 1 * f(1) * f(1) f(4) : 1 * C(3, 2) * f(2) * f(1) f(5) : 1 * C(4, 3) * f(3) * f(1) f(6) : 1 * C(5, 3) * f(3) * f(2) … f(n) : 1 * C(n-1, X) * f(X) * f(n-1-X)   X: number of nodes in left sub tree choose X element to be put into the left sub-tree, and recursively invoke.
