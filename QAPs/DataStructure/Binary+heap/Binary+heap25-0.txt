What is an interesting data structure for programming that most programmers haven't heard of?
What strikes me is that many well known data structures can support operations that are not part of their usual API. For example, Everyone knows binary heaps. But many don't realize that if you make sure you can map a heap entry back to its position in the tree, then you can dynamically modify any item's priority efficiently, which is pretty cool. In hash map implementations, you can look up a reference to the value of a (key, value) pair if you have the key. But you usually cannot get a reference to the key object in the hash table. This can be important if your program works with a lot of duplicate strings and you want to canonize them.Beside that, I think Bloom filters and Union find deserve to be more widely appreciated. And when you want to build the fastest possible Scrabble engine, you will need to use a GADDAG, which no-one has ever heard of :-)
