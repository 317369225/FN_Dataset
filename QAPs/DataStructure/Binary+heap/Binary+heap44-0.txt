How much work did it take to get on the US IOI team?Specifically, how many hours per week, how many problems on which online judges, and how many practice contests.
I started learning algorithms in eighth grade but did not take any of the contests (back then there was just one division and I didn't want to embarrass myself).  So I mostly just did reading, about 2-3 hours a week. The following year, I practiced for about 10 hours a week during the school year, did all the contests, and made camp -- as the youngest person to have gone to camp as of that time, I got made fun of quite a bit by Rob Kolstad and did not make the team.  However I learned a lot from the older students, including Percy Liang and Jon McAlister (of later TopCoder fame).  Jon in particular pointed me to the UVA Online Judge and I used that resource a good bit over the summer between ninth and tenth grade.  This is when I practiced the most-- probably 30-40 hours a week, completing several hundred online judge problems. During tenth grade and my last year in eleventh grade, I spent 5-10 hours/week on USACO, and came close to making the team in 2000 and comfortably made the team in 2001. At this point I was also doing research, learning advanced math, and practicing for IPhO, so I didn't practice for USACO as much, but growing in other areas gave me additional confidence, which is an important factor on game day as well.
