How do we find the minimum element with O(1) complexity from Max-Heapify?
Sorry for sounding contrary but I have an issue with the question itself. The choice of data structure should match the functionality that we expect from it.Â  So, if we want to find the largest element of a MaxHeap, it makes sense because our work and our choice of data structure are in congruence. If we are trying to find the smallest element in a MaxHeap - the first question that arises is why did we store the data in a MaxHeap?? But on the other hand, if we are stuck with a MaxHeap, I do not see any other method but to use a O(log N) search to find the smallest element.
