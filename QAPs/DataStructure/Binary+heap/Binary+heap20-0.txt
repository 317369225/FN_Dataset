Why is the complexity of pop function of a standard C++ priority queue O(log n)?
The C++ priority queue is implemented using a binary heap. Popping removes the top of the binary heap, but then the resulting hole needs to be bubbled down to the bottom of the heap structure, which is O(logn)  deep. Other heap implementations can do many heap operations faster, but binary heaps are simple and do the job. They are only slower than things like Fibonacci heaps if you have a crazy number of keys. Binary heaps are also extremely memory efficient. Updated 10 Sep • View Upvotes
