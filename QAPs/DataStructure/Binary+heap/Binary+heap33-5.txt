What are the 10 must-know algorithms and data structures for a software engineer?
Must know data structures: 1. Strings 2. Arrays 3. Linked Lists 4. Stacks 5. Trees - Binary Tree, BST, AVL Tree, Trie 6. Graphs 7. Heaps 8. Hash You must know at least these data structures if you are software engineer. It is difficult to list just 10 algorithms that every software engineer must know, but you can go through these links which have algorithms that must be known to every software engineer: Arrays - YouTube Recursion - YouTube Binary Search Problems Linked Lists - YouTube Trees - YouTube Dynamic Programming Graph - YouTube Stack - YouTube Strings You can also checkout these algorithms here: IDeserve - Unique learning platform to enhance algorithmic skills. Hope this helps.
