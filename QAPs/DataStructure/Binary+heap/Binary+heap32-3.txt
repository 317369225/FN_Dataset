How can I design an efficient data structure that supports findMin, findMax, deleteMin, deleteMax, Insert, and delete?I need to design an efficient data structure that supports: findMin & findMax (most frequent) deleteMin & deleteMax (moderate frequent) Insert & delete (least frequent)
1. If you want to design something like this, go ahead and design. 2. If you want a solution that does all this, just use finger tree, no need to invent anything.
