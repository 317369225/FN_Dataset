What are the most important sort algorithms?
The most basic sort algorithms are - (all having time complexity O(n 2 )  ) Insertion sort Bubble sort Selection sort Most used (in almost all practical purpose) sort algorithm Quicksort (worst case time complexity O(n 2 )  however average case time complexityO(nlogn)  ) Merge sort (Used in many DataBase implementations; worst case time complexity O(nlogn)  ) Finally a non-comparison based sort - (all of the above algorithms are Comparison sort) Radix sort (worst case time complexity O(dn)  ) (Other honorable mentions are Bucket sort, Heapsort, Bead sort, Pigeonhole sort, Timsort (sorting algorithm for sorting Objects in Java) and finally Dual pivot quick-sort (Java 7's algorithm for sorting array of primitives)).
