How much work did it take to get on the US IOI team?Specifically, how many hours per week, how many problems on which online judges, and how many practice contests.
I first made it on to the US team in 2013, my junior year. Here's a rough breakdown of how I studied in each of my years. Middle school: I already had a math background (USAMO qualifier), which definitely helped me in competitive programming. Freshman year: I did not train very efficiently, mostly spending my time getting stuck on the USACO training pages. I might've put in 8 hours a week whenever I advanced to a new section in the training pages, but for the most part, I was stuck. Sophomore year: Before the first contest, I started clearing the first five pages of the codeforces problem set (about 500 problems). I promoted to gold in the first contest and started training on past contest problems. I made camp at the end of the year, where I found better resources to train with. On average, I spent around 6 hours a week. Junior year: I continued doing archived gold contests, and also worked through some old COCI, POI/OIG, and IOI problems. I also participated in a lot of codeforces/topcoder contests. At this point, I could comfortably score nearly all the points in the gold contests, but I still barely qualified for the IOI team. I'd estimate I spent on average 10 hours a week. In total, that comes to about 1000 hours. Â In my senior year (I was aiming for a gold medal this time), I think I put in around 600-700 hours and I comfortably qualified for the team again.
