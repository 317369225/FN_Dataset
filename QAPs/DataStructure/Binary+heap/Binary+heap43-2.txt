Is it natural for a good programmer to forget syntax/algorithms over time if you don't use it a lot?
Yes it is natural, and it is not a problem at all. I have been programming C++ for 23 years now (including major projects like Skype core), had a Python gap for a year, and when beginning a new C++ thing, had to look up what C++ "if-then-else" syntax was. Then 6 months later, had to write a Python script, and had forgotten the "for" loop syntax in Python. After looking up some of these basic things, I was immediately as productive as before. I'm sure in a job interview, it does look odd though.
