How much work did it take to get on the US IOI team?Specifically, how many hours per week, how many problems on which online judges, and how many practice contests.
I guessÂ  I can also give my data point from when I attended USACO camp in 2005 with the Canadian team. I think I'd have ranked 3rd among US contestants that time: training pages, about 150 problems (?) about 300 on UVA online judge IOI 01~04, about 30 problems 50% of 5 years of POI (01~04), about 80 problems CHN NOI 01~04, about 30 problems (plus reading the solutions of NOI 94~00) 3 years of CHN winter camp / CTSC (03~05, 20 problems) 2~3 years of Balkan/Baltic OIs (02~04), 30 problems 2 years of USACO (Fall 03~Open 05), about 40 problems 2 years of Canadian selections, 20 problems a bunch of speed contests in Canada, maybe another 40 problems So a total of about 750 problems, 300 of which are extremely easy ones that are comparable to CF Div2 A/Bs. Time wise most of the UVA happened over Christmas 04, all the training pages happened over March break 03 and summer 04 (Fence Rails is TROLLOL). The rest were just 2~3 problems / week, so maybe 5~6 hours of coding plus another 3~4 hours of thinking per week? Techniques wise my toolbox was the standard basic DP + data structures setup. If memory serves correctly, the thing that I typed the most that week was standard array based binary heaps.... (STL is for noobs, Pascal style C++ FTW).
