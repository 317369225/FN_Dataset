How much work did it take to get on the US IOI team?Specifically, how many hours per week, how many problems on which online judges, and how many practice contests.
It took me a year to get to gold and then to USAICO camp (where I got udderly crushed), one more year of camp (where I got crushed again), and one more year to do well enough at camp to qualify for IOI. Each year I learned a lot just from camp, and from taking more contests and seeing more types of problems: it's actually quite hard to find and get introduced to a lot of algorithms on your own. In terms of time spent, I probably spent about 20-25 hours a week on average, which mostly involves trying different problems and improving mechanics. This would be substantially higher if you take into account latent thinking time: suffice to say I didn't devote 100% of my attention while in school.
