Why mysql uses B/B+ trees and not Fibonacci heap structure?Hi all, i agree with B+ tree reduces IO time. My question is, there are better structures like Fibonacci heap. which will reduce a lot of time for insertion, deletion, union etc. Can some one explain why B/B+ tree was a choice for mysql creators.
A very important operation in SQL is the range query, to find all keys between two values. The B-Tree has good support for this. I'm not an expert on Fibonacci heaps but it's not clear that this would be equally straightforward. Other helpful features of B-Trees for a disk based database are fixed size nodes, with guaranteed minimum occupancy. (Also see Douglas Comer, "The Ubiquitous B-Tree")
