Is it natural for a good programmer to forget syntax/algorithms over time if you don't use it a lot?
The first language I learnt was Algol in the early 70's, so my major problem is remembering how many different languages I've learnt over the years. As for 'what is natural for a good programmer'; That's a good question I'll ask if I ever meet one. As others have pointed out, don't concentrate on learning many languages, just use one and try and make real world apps concentrating on the quality of the algorithms and the data structures. The particular syntax and libraries of a particular platform become irrelevant in professional programming, in a few weeks you will remember all that you use on a regular basis. People testing you for jobs know this. So if they ask you for an example in a language you don't know, tell them. If they are a serious employer they will be more than happy to see your solution in any language, they know that if your methods and approach are correct you will soon be up to speed in any language.
