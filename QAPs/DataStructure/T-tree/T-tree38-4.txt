Computer Programming: What's the funniest piece of code you've seen a student submit?
I had a student submit a program that was no more complex than  a 'hello world' program for a rather complex assignment and gave me suggestions on how to make my grading style better. This happened in 2014 when I was a TA for Operating System Principles course and it is very programming intensive. The students are required to submit a makefile, their program and a README file which has the implementation details and documentation. Their fourth programming assignment was the last and it was due during the finals week. So most students did not do as well as they would normally do due to exams, projects and what not. The assignment requested was to write a program that sorts a single large array of unsorted integers using multiple threads while handling the synchronization issues between the threads. The number of threads will be specified using command line arguments, the maximum number of threads is 4. They were given a sample executable (without the code) that shows the expected output. This one student just replicated the behaviour of the provided sample executable using println () statements by first reading the number of threads passed as commandline argument and then printing out the values that the provided executable printed out for the same commandline argument. In his README file, he basically said that my grading could be laxed a little and suggested me to consider the 'time' that he has spent pondering and writing his program. Needless to say he received a zero. Updated 6w ago • View Upvotes
