What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?
I, too, feel Euclid's postulates are pretty obvious.  They better be.  After all, they're taken as assumptions, and it's best that assumptions be clear and obvious.  After all, they don't come with proofs. One of his postulates is not all that obvious, though.  Euclid's Elements, Book I, Postulate 5: Even understanding what it means takes effort.  You can see how it's used in  Proposition 29, and that may help extract its meaning.  (For a couple thousand years people tried to prove it.  But that's a discussion for a different question.) What's surprising, however, is that such obvious assumptions can be used to prove some interesting results, like Book III, Proposition 35.  Referring to the figure below, it says AE times EC is equal to BE times ED. A theory in mathematics progresses from you-don't-say statements, ones that make you wonder why anyone ever though to mention them, to some rather surprising results. Number theory is another theory that starts with simple axioms like this one: two different positive integers cannot have the same successor. (The successor of an integer is the next larger integer.)  Like, duh?  From the axioms of number theory you can prove such "you don't say" theorems as every number is either even or odd, and if you add one positive integer to another, then the sum is greater than either.  Yet number theory includes extremely difficult theorems, like Wiles' theorem (a.k.a. Fermat's last theorem), and many unsolved problems. Updated 85w ago • View Upvotes
