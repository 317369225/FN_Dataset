What are some interesting git operations and commands?
git log --all --decorate --graph  --oneline It displays a nice graph providing us with information about all the branches both local as well as remote ( tracking and non-tracking) ,merges, location where the head currently points. It even displays your notes, and tags. ​ Here in this command , --oneline - provides one line description of the commits. --graph - draws a text based graph on left hand side. --decorate -  it adds the names of branches/tags to commit. --all --> it displays every info. >>  git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s" This gives us a nice formatted output.
