How can the theory of constraints help business?
The list of steps are simple and have been explained earlier . I would say that the basis for the work is make it work like a project 1.To determine the list of dependent steps, steps in paralell and the end date .   2.Now your steps themselves have to be estimated correctly by those who estimate  but they put a lot of buffer due to the image problem which persists.   3.Just tell your team that while you want them to focus on doing the tasks 100% when they start , their estimate timelines are not written in stone and they can have a 50% probability of completion .This is most important so that the pressure on them is removed while importance is not removed   4. Now ask for the estimates and the critical chain becomes your constraint . you will find that project completion time is significantly brought down as all buffers in steps are removed and usually it is 50% of a planned project time .   6. the remaining 50% time is your project buffer and you need to act only when the buffer is consumed more than 60%  at any point in time   Can explain over a call if you need clarity ...and do give me a shout
