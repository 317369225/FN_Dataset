Quora Credit Co-Op v2.0:Â Who are great new users to follow in December 2011?
Who has asked the most questions on Quora? A few of the people from this list have an awesome track record of good questions, but seldom post an answer. As a consequence, they most probably are in danger of curbing their question output unless they start getting disbursements. If you don't like their questions, you may find this to be a good thing; however the Co-Op has a different philosophy. Now I don't want to single out any names (I would define them as those with a Q/A ratio >10), but the Co-Op should discuss disbursements to such users, even though they are not new and they have enough followers each to distribute their questions. Also, here's a couple of users that ask more or as many questions than they're answering, usually in non-mainstream topics, so they will need the credits: http://www.quora.com/Maximiliaan... http://www.quora.com/Andrew-M.-F... http://www.quora.com/Johnny-Ramb... http://www.quora.com/Benjamin-Vi... http://www.quora.com/Kai-Hove/qu...
