Can you solve this simple mathematical puzzle?
Suppose there are t trees and h horses in a yard. Case 1- As it is given in question that if we tie one horse with each tree then 3 horses remain untied. So this means we have (h-3) horses that are tied in this case. Therefore we can say that                 (h-3)=t Case 2- If we tie 2 horses with each tree then 2 trees will be left with no horses tied with it. So in this case we can say that                  h=2*(t-2) Now put value of t obtained from Case 1 in  equation obtained from Case 2. Hence we will be having h=2*(h-3-2) After solving this equation we can get value of h; h=2h-10 h=10 that is yard has 10 horses and t=(h-3)=(10-3)=7 this means yard has 7 trees. Thanks for A2A!!!
