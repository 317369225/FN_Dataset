What is constructor?
Constructor is a method which is called automatically when a object is declared. Some point to consider about constructor. It's name is same as that of class name. It does not have any return type. It generally used to initialize the value of newly formed object. A default constructor is called automatically, if no constructor is declared in class which initialize int, float with zero and String, Char with None. Constructor are of 3 types default, parameterized and copy.Eg. <code> class Tree{ int height; int weight; Tree(){ height = 0; weight = 0; } // default constructor. Tree(int height,int weight){ this.height = height; this.weight = weight; } // parameterized constructor Tree(Tree a){ this.height = a.height; this.weight = a.weight; } // copy constructor (In java copy constructor is counted under parameterized constructor. Since it is one of its kind) } class Main{ public static void main(String args[]){ Tree t = new Tree();// object created with default constructor Tree y = new Tree(12,34); // object created with parameterized constructor Tree r = new Tree(y); // Copy constructor } } </code> Updated 44w ago
