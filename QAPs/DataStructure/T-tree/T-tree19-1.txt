Can you solve this simple mathematical puzzle?
Clearly, there are 3 more horses than the trees. e.g. 4 horses, 1 tree or 5 horses 2 trees , 6 horses-3 trees, and so on. Also, no horses are left when two hourses are tied to each tree, which means horses are in multiple of two. so, consideration set reduces to 4 H, 1T , 6H 3T, 8H 5T, 10H 7T , and so on. Second statement says, half the number of horses is 2 less than tree. Checking this on above set... we get our desired solution at 10 H and 7T. Since, the numbers are small, this method is generally faster than making quadratic equation. And it forces you to think, which is a fun thing to do :)
