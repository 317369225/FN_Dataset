How do I give a tight asymptotic bound to the recurrence [math]T (n) = 2^{n/2} T(n/2) + 2^n[/math] and how to draw a recursion tree?
Note that all the logs here are to the base 2. My answer is : T(n) = ( 2^n ) log(n)         Check : T(n/2) = ( 2^(n/2) ) log(n/2)         2^(n/2)*T(n/2) = (2^n)log(n/2) 2^(n/2)*T(n/2) + 2^n = (2^n)log(n) = T(n) Proof : T(n) = 2^(n/2)*T(n/2) + 2^n ( Substitute the value for T(n/2) in terms of T(n/4) ) =2^(n/2)*( 2^(n/4)*T(n/4) + 2^(n/2) ) + 2^n   =2^(3n/4)*T(n/4) + 2^(n)  + 2^n   =2^(3n/4)*T(n/4) + 2*2^(n) Substitute the value of T(n/4) in terms of T(n/8) =2^(3n/4)*( 2^(n/8)*T(n/8) + 2^(n/4) ) + 2*2^(n) =2^(7n/8)*T(n/8) + 3*2^(n) = .... =2^(n) log(n)
