How many people would it take to defeat a T-Rex barehanded?
As per Aaron Leff, any animal can be trapped so if you just want victory over a T-Rex then all that is needed is one man with the time and energy to dig a very, very big hole.  Using a baited pit trap is the smartest way to take on a creature much larger than you.  One is the minimum, but there are other options. If you are referring to the British band, T Rex then you win because I believe they are all dead: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._... Finally, if you are actually desiring to gather up a bunch of friends and tackle a fully grown, 6000 Kg. T Rex in open combat then you would need 80 men on flat ground, but only 40 if you have higher ground like a hillside.  If you are fortunate enough to have tree cover then the task can be handled by around 20 men with 10 in the trees and 10 to bait the dino into range for your buddies in the trees to drop down upon the T Rex.  You would need 2 to 3 people to land on the T Rex and start stabbing it until it weakens or tires.  The rest would follow and try their best to trip the T-Rex onto the ground where the advantage would shift to the humans. You can expect a 80% casualty rate in any scenario except the open pit trap.
