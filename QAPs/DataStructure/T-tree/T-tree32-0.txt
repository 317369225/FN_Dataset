Complete the Sentence: How would you complete the sentence, "I like spending but I won't spend on you because __________"?
I think this has been asked to give an excuse to someone for not spending or not being able to spend money on someone. I like spending money but I will not spend on you because:- I would like to spend something more precious on you as you are very very special to me. So,  I would be very happy to spend my time and even whole life on you because you are priceless to me ~:-) I feel it would be insulting if I talk of spending a little money on a almighty king. You are the king of my heart and I don't want to displease you by some foolish act ~:-) I know money can't buy evereything, especially love and trust ~:-) By this answer I want to highlight that money is not everything and many things are more important than money. Things of more importance are love, trust, faith, sympathy, and many more things which are more or less unique to so called humans. They should be given more importance. After all Being Humane is more important than Being Human ~:-)
