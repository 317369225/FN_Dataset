What is constructor?
Constructors It is a method and it invokes at the time of object creation. Method can be a constructor when Class name and method name is same Method not declared with any explicit return type(Ex: void, int, float etc..,) Types: (Only two types) Default constructor  and No-org constructor Parameterized constructor Default Constructor: If there is no constructor in class, compiler automatically creates a constructor and this constructor is used to provide default values to the object like 0, null etc. depending on the type called default constructor. The access level of the default constructor is same as the access level (public, private, protected and default) of class defined. public class Animal{} will automatically be modified(by adding default constructor) as follows public class Animal{    public Animal() {    }} Ex: public class first { int id; String s; double d; boolean b; void display() { System.out.println(+id+","+s+","+d+","+"b"); } public static void main(String a[]) { first f=new first(); f.display(); } } Output: >javac first.java >java first 0,null,0.0,false Key point: If you define at least  one constructor, the default constructor not generated. No-org constructor: (Just a convention though as some programmer prefer to call this  explicitly defined no arguments constructor as default constructor.(Need more clarity)) A constructor which is explicitly defined and has no arguments is called no-org constructor. (According to Docs) Key point: NO-org constructor cannot initialize the variables. I think I am clear if not feel free to ask me..
