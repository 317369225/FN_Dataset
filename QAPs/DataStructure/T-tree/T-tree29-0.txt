How do you say numbers, from 0 to 10, in your language? How do you pronounce it? And what language is it?
Philippines: (In Spanish, Tagalog, and Visayan) * may have spelling variances by geography obviously. [1] Uno, Isa, Usa [2] Dos, Dalawa, Duha [3] Tres, Tatlo, Tulo [4] Quatro (Kwatro), Apat, Upat [5] Cinco (Singko), Lima, Lima [6] Seis (Sa-is), Anim, Unom [7] Siete (Siyete), Pito, Pito [8] Ocho (Otso), Walo, Walo [9] Nueve (Nuwebe), Siyam, Siyam [10] Diez (Dyis), Sampo, Napulo The usage is convoluted to explain properly or when or where to use such and such. For example, most Spanish numbers are used widely when quantifying money for payment. Other than that, there's a mixture of personal preference and/or convenience. A funny sidenote is that compared to Tagalog, Visayan does not have their own definitive 11-xx, so what happened is that they deferred to their Spanish counterparts. What I mean is, whereas Tagalog has labing-isa for 11, labing-dalawa for 12, and so on, Visayan only has onse, dose, trese, etc. ADDENDUM: The Philippines does not have its own term for zero, weirdly enough, so zero remains zero. Or sero.
