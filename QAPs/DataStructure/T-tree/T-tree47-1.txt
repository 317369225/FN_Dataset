"How can I implement Graph/Tree algorithms in java ?"
If you are able to implement something in C you should be able to implement in Java as well. The only reason I can think of why you are not able to do it is due to lack of sufficient knowledge of the java language. You don't have pointers available in Java but all objects are accessed by references so you could create self referential structures in java as well. Â  Look at these codes to see how the self referential data structures are coded BST - BST.java Red Black Trees - RedBlackBST.java Further have a look at Java Algorithms and Clients this page has most of the standard algorithms implemented in Java if while implementing you are stuck at some point you can refer to their implementation and try to re implement on your own with out seeing it.
