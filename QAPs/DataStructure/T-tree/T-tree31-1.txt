R- Romeo and Juliet, Dire Straits S- Sad Lisa, Cat Stevens T- The raven that refused to sing, Steven Wilson U- Under the bridge- RHCP V- Valerie, Amy Winehouse W- White Rabbit, Jefferson Airplane X- X&Y,The Coldplay (and not much choice otherwise) Y- You can't always get what you want, The Rolling Stones Z- Zombie, The Cranberries (no choice else!) Not all songs are my favourite from that band, or this list doesn't even include all my favourite songs,  but guess this is as optimised as my personal alphabet-wise list can get.
