How can I check if a binary tree is a sub-tree of another binary tree in O(n) in Java?
Without going into the details, there is a problem with your solution concept. Imagine two trees, one is a root containing the number 3 with a left child that also contains 3. The other is a root with a right child containing 3. These trees are not equal, but any traversal will give the list [3,3],Â  so by comparing these lists they look equivalent. You need to enclose markers in the list to represent tree structure, for example by adding -1 to the list to denote an empty subtree. Then, only a single traversal should suffice.
