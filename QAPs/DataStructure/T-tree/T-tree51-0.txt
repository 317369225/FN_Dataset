Is ANT dead as a wireless protocol?
ANT offers several features, that never can´t be covered by BLE. ANT is available with Samsung S4 and Note 3. Samsung sold 40 million Galaxy S 4 units worldwide, just six months after the device hit the market. The 60 million ANT devices got 40 million brothers from one day to another. I there is a nice number of sisters called Note 3. Remember that Samsung is already selling more devices than Apple. Things that ANT can do and BLE can´t do: - Tree topology - Point to multipoint. If a BLE slave/peripheral is connected to a master/central then it can´t talk to another master/central device - ANT devices can be master and slave in same time. BLE not. - Non synchronized communication. You can out 300 ANT devices on one table, power it one and each of it will find a time slot and will not interfere with the others BLE has not the features to replace ANT. That is the reason why ANT will not die.
