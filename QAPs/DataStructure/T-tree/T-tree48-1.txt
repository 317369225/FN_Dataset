What is constructor?
In class based object oriented programming, a constructor in a class is a special type of subroutine called to create an object. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables. The constructors can appear anywhere in the code for the class. However, by convention, most people put them before any other functions that aren't constructors. class Bicycle {	// class-level variables	private int gear;	private int cadence;	private int speed;	// constructor	public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {		gear = startGear;		cadence = startCadence;		speed = startSpeed;	}	// another method (not a constructor)	public void ShiftUp() {	}} As for the variable names, all 6 are actually variable names, but the scope is differnet. The ones specified as parameters to the constructor (startCadence, startSpeed, startGear) are only available within the constructor. The other 3 (gear, cadence, speed) are probably class-wide variables, available to all methods. More details Check
