How do I use structural induction to prove that the height of Tn is n-1 for any integer n>=2?
induction assumption: the height of T(n) = n-1. You show that for n + 1, the assumption still holds, namely, T(n+1) = n, inductively. By its recursive definition T(n+1) = a root R with edges connecting R to the roots of T(n-1) and T(n-2). We know by the assumption that the height of T(n-1) = n-2 and T(n-2) = n-3. Now, since you have a root sitting on top of these two trees, you take whichever sub tree that's higher and plus 1 for the edge connecting to the root R. Thus the height of T(n-1) = n-2 + 1 = n-1. Base cases trivially hold true. Base case + inductive step proven = Proof done.
