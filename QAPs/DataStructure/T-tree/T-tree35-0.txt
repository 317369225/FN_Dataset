Why is it that if you remove an edge from a tree it becomes disconnected?
The notion of a tree has several equivalent definitions. The most convenient one in this context would be the one that says that a tree is a minimally connected graph - that is to say, it is connected, but the removal of any edge would disconnect it. Then the answer to the question would be by definition. A tree is, equivalently, a connected graph without any cycles. Starting from this notion, suppose you remove an edge (u,v) from a tree T, and the remaining graph is still connected. Then, let P be the path from u to v in the remaining graph. When we go back to T, P along with (u,v) constitutes a cycle, a contradiction.
