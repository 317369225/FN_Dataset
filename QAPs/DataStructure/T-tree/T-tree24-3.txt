How can I check if a binary tree is a sub-tree of another binary tree in O(n) in Java?
First of all, you don't have a program until it compiles, and line 103 won't compile.  So to start with, why not just delete line 103 that won't compile. Second is that converting to string and looking for substrings will take forever and waste huge amounts of memory. Instead I would suggest you get the first element of the subtree, and search for it in the tree with a standard traversal.  If you find it, then do an element by element comparison as you iterate both trees.  You either find the substring compares completely, or you go on with your search of the main tree travesal.
