What is the most obvious theorem in mathematics?
Triangle inequality theorem. The triangle inequality theorem states that any side of a triangle is always shorter than the sum of the other two sides. It is obviously true, because the shortest path between two points is a straight line (in Euclidean geometry). It is that obvious, that it's called the "Donkey Theorem". If you put a donkey, a rock and a haystack on the three angles of a triangle, the donkey will go straight to the haystack. Even the donkey knows that each side of a triangle is shorter than the sum of the other two. Updated 24w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
