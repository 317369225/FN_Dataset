If you could pick a song for each letter of the English Alphabet, which ones would you choose?
I have too much fun doing things like this. I upped the challenge and also picked artists with the same letter as the song (except Q, X, and Z). All of these are either in my iTunes or Spotify lists.   Ae Ae – Angelique Kidjo Best Laid Plans – James Blunt Call Your Girlfriend – Michelle Chamuel Dublin Sky – Darren Hayes Explosions – Ellie Goulding Fired – Ben Folds; Freedom Cry – Deep Forest (couldn’t decide) Giving Me a Chance – Gotye Happiness – Hurts I Love It – Icona Pop Jimmy Dean and Steve McQueen – Julian Velard Keep It Comin’ Love – KC & The Sunshine Band Lady Grinning Soul – Lucia Micarelli Make You Happy – Mika; Madness – Muse (couldn’t decide) Nemo – Nightwish Oh My Goodness – Olly Murs Perfectionist – Landon Pigg Que Sera Sera – Doris Day (my Quora blog title is a riff on this) Rainy Days and Mondays – Emmy Rossum Slip Slidin’ Away – Paul Simon This Old Man – Tori Amos Unforgettable Fire, The – U2 Viva La Vida – Vitamin String Quartet White and  Nerdy – Weird Al XWarmm – The Reverb Junkie You Don’t Know – Will Young Zululand (reprise) – Eileen Ivers
