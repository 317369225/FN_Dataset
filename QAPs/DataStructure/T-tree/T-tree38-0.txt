Computer Programming: What's the funniest piece of code you've seen a student submit?
In Compiler Theory class at Chico State, the final project was the standard "write a very limited compiler that would convert a sub-sub-subset of Pascal into C."  It was our first practical exposure to Lex and Yacc.  We hadn't done any group projects yet, so we didn't learn the importance of using logically-named variables.  My project was full of the funniest semi-obscene acronyms I could find on UseNet: dilligaff, dilligas, bohica, etc.(This was the days before the Web was widespread.) I thought the TA just ran his test cases through the code. the tossed the output through the C compiler to see if it worked or not.  No one said anything about the funny names, unlike Kate Liotta.  I got 100% on the project (I think I was the only person in the class to do so), so I didn't mind. A year later, while I was at my internship, the TA calls me up and throws two names at me.  I replied I didn't recognize them.  "They're handing in your project."  One of them at least had the decency to copy-and-replace the variable names (hopefully with ones that denoted their actual utility!) The other person simply copied the files and presented it as his own work. I would have loved to see them (individually) be asked to walk the TA through some of my brainbreakers in there.
