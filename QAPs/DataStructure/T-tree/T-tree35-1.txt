Why is it that if you remove an edge from a tree it becomes disconnected?
A tree by definition is a graph having N vertices and N-1 edges in such a way that each vertex has at least one edge. Simple intuition will show you that the Nth edge will create a cycle (small or big depending on the connectivity). Once you have realized the above point, again by intuition, you will see that removing any 1 edge will result in 2 disjoint trees (forest as it is called). This was to explain the concept in simple terms. For concrete mathematical explanation, you can refer to CLRS' book on algorithms. Before that, make sure you are somewhat comfortable with set theory. :)
