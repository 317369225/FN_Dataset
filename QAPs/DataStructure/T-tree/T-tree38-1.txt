Computer Programming:Â What's the funniest piece of code you've seen a student submit?
I have never been an instructor or TA, but I am reminded of a genuinely awful thing I did on an assignment once. I wrote up the entire project, took excellent care with code organization, obtained perfect correctness... then I went through and did a find-and-replace, substituting all method names and variable names with breakfast-themed names. Variables were simply breakfast foods, and method names were breakfast-related actions (e.g. "butterMyToast," "syrupMySausage"). The reaction from the professor was a rather scolding "Don't ever do that again." (But I have to say, there was a faint chuckle in his voice as he said that, and I suspect he was rather amused.)
