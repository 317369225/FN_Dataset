When should I use double equals sign instead of triple equals sign in PHP?
The difference between == and === is simple. == compares the content of the variables to see if they are same; if $A =12345 and $B = 12345 > == will be true. also if $A = 12345 and  $B= "12345" > == will be true as it is independent of the type  of variable and only compare the content. On the other hand === will return true in first case as both are integers and has equal value but false on second as even though both values are same, one is integer and other is string. Update : The double = sign is used like in cases where you want to compare just the values like when for some reason you accept a mobile number as string and need to compare with the number in database that you have stored as integer. without having to use int($xxx) or char($xxx)
