How many people would it take to defeat a T-Rex barehanded?
So I'm thinking you can take on this task in a number of ways.  Rory Young has a ninja approach depending on how deep you can cut or gather But a barehanded approach on a T-Rex that is 5 meters tall would take more then a small group to do so. Poison? Which would be my first underhanded idea Barehanded This could be tricky lets work backwards.  We need to get it on the ground to beat it to death? with our fist or some swift kicks to the jaw, ligaments, skull.  We would need to take hold of its legs so it couldn't move and hope the T-Rex doesn't just rollover on us. Then we would try to control the neck and then start the beating. How many people to stop a 8 ton animal from moving? 15 people for each leg(including casualties from falling and trying to escape), this would add 3000 pounds to each leg.  Without its legs and shitty arms I don't know how it would get up. Second group of at least 20 people who can avoid the mouth to start attacking the upper region of the body as the 30 people ( - dead ) to beat up the tendons and ligaments of the legs.  After a few hundred unrelenting kicks and punches around the knee should immobilize the creature. If successful those 30 people would move to the mid section to start annihilating that. Make sure you have enough people for Attempt #2.
