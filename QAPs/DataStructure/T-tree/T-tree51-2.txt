Is ANT dead as a wireless protocol?
Yes , But one thing is important is the Legacy , ANT+ still supports more than 10 million devices . BTLE is expected to grow however has still not seen Mass adoption in the Health care or fitness area . The power consumption and the size of the Bluetooth stack is too big for small embedded systemsÂ  (, i guess the bluetooth stack exceeds 4kb , but i am not entirely sure ). ANT+ is a pretty light weight protocol. Also BTLE only supports BT 4.0 devices and NOT the earlier versions due to absence of the Dual mode in the earlier versions. The advantage of developing i bluetooth is that it will form the base of most device given the product up gradation cycle.
