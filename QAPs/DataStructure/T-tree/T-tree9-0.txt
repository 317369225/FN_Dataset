How can the theory of constraints help business?
By helping managers to focus on the few important issues, and ignore the majority of unimportant details. This comes from the concept of: Inherent simplicity. The idea that the more organized a system is, the simpler it inherently behaves. And from that, there are very few variables that a manager needs to be focused on. This seems very much in line with the concept of "emergence" as described in complexity science. In the midst of chaos, something tangible and stable can arise. The vast majority of the little details simply don't matter. I would also mention Dr Goldratt's use of critical thinking (in his Thinking Processes) which is unusual in that he allows argument maps (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arg...) to depict self-reinforcing loops. This (in my opinion) makes the technique much more practically useful. A lot of our thinking is self-sealing in some way, and having a way of seeing this is a valuable aid in changing our minds.
