What are some interesting git operations and commands?
I love the 'git lol' command. It doesn't come by default, need to run this command once for your system to create an alias: git config --global --add alias.lol "log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --all" It displays the branches and the commits in the following fashion. Very helpful indeed! Command source: http://uberblo.gs/2010/12/git-lo... Image source: http://blog.kfish.org/2010/04/gi...
