How many people would it take to defeat a T-Rex barehanded?
The key word in the question is "barehanded"--most of these answers presume the use of knives and/or shovels. Perhaps you can dig a pit trap with your bare hands by yourself, but I'm not sure a 48-hour head start is in the spirit of the question.   So I think we are looking at a scenario like the ones in horror movies where a billion mice, or bugs, or whatever, overwhelm some guy, like in the ant sequence of Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull:     Except ants, it's people, and instead of some Soviet goon, it's a Tyrannosaurus Rex.   In that case--not having actually done this myself--it's primarily a question of strength. T-Rexes were strong, but they still followed the laws of physics, so their strength was a direct function of muscle mass. A large T-rex would be about 15,000 pounds, or 75 average men. Assume a T-Rex is more muscular, as apex predators often are, so let's give it the benefit of the doubt and say it is as strong as 300 men.   So, assuming that everyone uses leverage to their best advantage, if you have more than 300 men, you should be able to knock the T-Rex over, at which point the advantage shifts towards the humans through eye-gouging, twisting arms and talons, etc.   Sure, some will get eaten along the way, but probably not the 80% given in some other answers. Imagine 300 small dogs attacking you (a comparable size difference). Even if you had knives in both hands, how many would you kill? Twenty? Fifty?   A T-Rex is still dangerous on the ground, and it has experience killing things, so let’s give it additional benefit of the doubt, so say you have 100 casualties. Since you want to finish with enough people to finish the fight, start with 400.   So, my best guess is 400 people.  I look forward to hearing from someone who has tried it.
