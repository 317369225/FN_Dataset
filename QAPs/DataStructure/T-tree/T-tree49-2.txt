How many people would it take to defeat a T-Rex barehanded?
I think 10 reasonably healthy people could dig a triangular -shaped deep hole (using stone shovels of course) and bait it into falling in whereupon it breaks its leg.Â  Then, when it goes into shock and further slips into sleep they can take turns kicking it in the throat -- the triangular shaped hole providing easy access to the the dino-neck versus the standard giant-pit approach. This is a link to a paper on the structure of dinosaur necks: http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/pu... That being said only a monster would harm a beautiful dinosaur.
