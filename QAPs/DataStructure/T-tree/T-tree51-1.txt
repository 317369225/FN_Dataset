Is ANT dead as a wireless protocol?
Yes, Bluetooth 4.0 will beat ANT+ in the low power personal wireless market.     Bluetooth 4.0 has comparable or better performance characteristics in almost every respect: throughput, range, simplicity, power use.  Furthermore, as you point out, ANT+ is proprietary and arguably controlled by a single industry player, Garmin.    One possible advantage for ANT+ is its support of multiple node mesh networks as opposed to Bluetooth's piconet (7-node) master-slave topology.  A flexible mesh topology would be an advantage for things like sensor networks.   With 60 million claimed installs, ANT+ is hardly dead.
