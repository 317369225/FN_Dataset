When should I use double equals sign instead of triple equals sign in PHP?
You should avoid double equals signs at all costs. Edit... reasoning: A double equals sign comparison is never necessary.  It's better to be explicit about what you're checking rather than vague.  Being explicit in code lends to fewer mistakes and increased readability. For example, suppose you're writing a cookie library, and you make a function to determine whether a cookie's value has been set.  Maybe that function checks whether $cookie == null.  Then later, some other developer decides to store a path in a cookie.  Maybe one of the pages calls the library function to see if a cookie is unset, and if it is, it defaults the path to '/root'.  Maybe an empty string if a valid cookie value.  Now, if the cookie ever gets set to an empty string, the cookie library will think the cookie hasn't been set, and will default it to '/root'... making it impossible to actually persist an empty path as a cookie value.  What a mess.  You can avoid this hassle by being explicit in your equality checks. There is no reason to rely on double equals.  It's just laziness.
