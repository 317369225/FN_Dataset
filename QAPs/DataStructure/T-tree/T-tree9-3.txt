How can the theory of constraints help business?
Some good answers here but I would also focus on the DRUM beat as suggested by Goldratt.  Think of it as the orchestra conductor's wand, it sets the pace.  In many things you want to set the pace. An example I am thinking about is setting up weekly meetings to get an update or drive a project.  Those weekly meetings are the drumbeat or cadence for accountability.
