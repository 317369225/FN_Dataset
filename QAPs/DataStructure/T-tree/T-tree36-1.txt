How do I use structural induction to prove that the height of Tn is n-1 for any integer n>=2?
In the base case, what you really care about is the height of T(2) = 1 because it consists of a single root node. Inductive step: Lets assume for 3<=i<=k that the height of a tree T(k) = k-1. Consider the tree T(k+1). It consists of a root node and edges from it's root node to the trees T(k) and T(k-1). By our inductive hypothesis, these subtrees have height k-1 and k-2 respectively. Thus the height of T(k+1) = 1 (because of it's root) + max(k-1,k-2) = 1+k-1=k. Thus, the height of T(k+1)=k completing the inductive step.
