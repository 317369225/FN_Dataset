Huffman Coding - How to prove decoding tree must be a full n-ary tree?
The proof in the book of KT is very easy to follow. Algorithm Design: Jon Kleinberg, Ã‰va Tardos: 9780321295354: Books. Let T denote the binary tree corresponding to the optimal prefix code, and suppose it contains a node u with exactly one child v. Now convert T into a tree T' by replacing node u with v. There're two possible cases, u is the root and u is not. When u is the root, then just delete u, and use v as the root. When u is not the root, suppose node w is the parent of u in Tree T. Now we delete u and make v be a child of w in the place of u. So we could find this change will decrease the encoding of any leaf rooted at u, but does not affect all the other leaves. So T' has a smaller encoding than the optimal T which is the contradiction.
