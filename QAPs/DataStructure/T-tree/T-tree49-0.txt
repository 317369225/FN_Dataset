How many people would it take to defeat a T-Rex barehanded?
ONE! Not quite bare-handed but there is a traditional hunting method used on African elephants that would probably work. The Shangaan people of South-Eastern Zimbabwe used to hunt elephant in a clever, unique and effective manner. One man would sneak up behind an elephant as it was sleeping (everyone and everything has to sleep sometimes) and quickly sever the Achilles-tendon of one leg. An elephant cannot go anywhere on three legs and they could therefore safely spear it from a relatively close distance until it bled to death. I reckon that the same would work with a T-Rex. In fact he would be even less mobile than the elephant with only one leg. He could then be killed by spears in the same way as the shangaans finished off the elephant.
