How do you keep up with a smart toddler?
You don't mention anything about his physical capabilities and often children that are early in cognitive abilities lag behind in physical development. As much as it is important to stimulate them mentally, physical activities are also vitally important. I would recommend lots of outdoor time, and perhaps a gymnastics class or something involving movement and music. Remember that each child develops at their own rate, and like early walkers things usually balance out later in life and promoting all aspects of development is equally important.
