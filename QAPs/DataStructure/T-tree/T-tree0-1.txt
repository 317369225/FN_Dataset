Where can I buy a Porcupine Tree T-shirt in New Delhi?
Hysteria bangalore was good but the one in new delhi doesnt have good stuff...I tried Clyde's in Palika but he was asking 900 for a 'Fear of a blank planet' t-shirt. I asked one of my friends to get it from Bangalore and even Hysteria Bangalore did not have it so he got the same 'Fear of a blank planet' t-shirt from Wise Guy in Brigade raod, Bangalore for 600 bucks only.
