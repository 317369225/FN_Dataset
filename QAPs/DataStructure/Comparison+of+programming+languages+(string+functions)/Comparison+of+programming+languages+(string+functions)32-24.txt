What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
Originally Answered: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?Other answers have beautifully explained both the terms with respect to programming languages, I won't repeat that stuff. I'll try to explain the same in layman's terms:- Say you understand English but not Spanish. Scene 1:- If you want to read a book originally written in Spanish, you'll buy a copy that is translated in English... compiler/translator (complete book is translated) Scene 2:- You are listening the English interpretation of live speech, delivered in Spanish... interpreter (sentence by sentence interpretation)
