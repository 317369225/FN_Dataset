What bad programming/architecture habits can a self-taught PHP coder develop?..and how to get rid of them?
Most of the things said here are said assuming that the coders will be coding only the backend. There are however a lot many who code only at the view level, mostly template designers. If you use PHP primarily in the view level, I would also suggest that a basic knowledge of Apache Programming alongwith PHP also saves a lot of overload. A programmer has to know how things work under the hood. There are lot of resources available from authentic sources available for developers.
