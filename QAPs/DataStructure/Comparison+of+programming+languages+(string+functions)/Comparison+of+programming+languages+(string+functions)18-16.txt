As a starting Python programmer I see a lot of praise for the Python language (and so far I can only agree). Isn't there anything bad to say about it? What is a real con?
Real Con? I especially hate the strange Dynamic Typing + Strong Typing combination. For example, this will cause exception: print 1 + "abc" Basically, you can never safely do var1 + "some string" if you don't do type checking of var1. This strong typing behavior, coupled with the dynamic typing nature of Python, resulting you never really sure about what type of arguments your functions are going to get, and what you can do to tell the callers to prepare the correct types. (Personally I have to put types in the argument names such as "def myFunc(paramStr):". I hate this. )
