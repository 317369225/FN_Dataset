What are the best programming practices and coding standards independent of programming languages?
Originally Answered: What are the best programming practices?It is always good to learn and practice coding. It helps a person to develop skills . Below are the few points to practice in programming: 1. Commenting and Documentation As it is a common tendency to forget, it is always better to have a comment for a loop or any complex task. 2. Indentation It makes the code look beautiful, simple and easy to understand. You can try "Python" scripting. 3. If the code is complex and involves repetition Create subroutine and call when it is required. 4. Have consistency in naming convention You can name Class in Camel Convention. AppStart;RunTimeCheck. Similarly for subroutine: appstart;runtimecheck. 5. Separation of algorithm from the code It is always good to have a seperate subroutine for algorithm rather than involving along with data.
