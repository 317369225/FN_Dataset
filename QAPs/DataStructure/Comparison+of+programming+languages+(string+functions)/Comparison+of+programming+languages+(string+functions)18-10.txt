As a starting Python programmer I see a lot of praise for the Python language (and so far I can only agree). Isn't there anything bad to say about it? What is a real con?
I came at Python after years of Java and I discovered I really liked it for some jobs but not for others.   I think every new software engineer and most old ones should learn Python. The thing about it is Python seems to be like the bash shell scripting language in that it isn't something you learn as much as something you pick up.   You have some little task to do, you use google to find out how to do that thing, then code it.  You learn by doing it not by studying it.   Each such iteration of that adds to your proficiency.  Python is great for that. For putting complex systems together -- not so much.  Yes people have done it and I am working on projects like that now, but those systems are damn hard for people not involved in writing them to comprehend.  In Java you have to write a contract for each class and interface and by god the language allows no deviation at compile time.   In Python such contracts are a definite maybe -- violated any time a whim occurs.   This is also true of Javascript. In other words I would much rather be annoyed by the IDE telling me my code is wrong rather than having to debug something that happens 30 seconds into a complex run-time scenario with a debugger to see that something wasn't documented or I didn't understand it right. So go ahead and enjoy Python -- just keep in mind it isn't good for everything.
