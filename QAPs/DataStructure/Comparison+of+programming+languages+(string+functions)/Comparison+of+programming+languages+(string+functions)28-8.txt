What can be done with Ruby or Python that just can't be done with PHP?
Without getting into opinion or topics of software development, and strictly speaking from a language comparison, one of the features of the Ruby programming language that is not currently possible with PHP is the ability to change core functionality at runtime; also known as opening classes; also known as monkey patching. For example, you can add a method to the String class that wasn't previously part of the language. It helps that all objects in Ruby are classes. For example, in PHP, true/false/null are just keywords. In Ruby, they are full-fledged classes, so you can perform operations on them like unknown_object.empty? Another feature that is not currently available in PHP is the ability to "mix in" functionality or namespace objects using a feature called Modules. PHP only supports subclassing as a way to extend functionality to other classes.
