Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?Python has come up a long way in data analysis with its Scipy, Numpy and Pandas platforms. Is R still a better data analysis language than Python? Has anyone else used Python with Pandas to a large extent in data analysis projects?
I use both. Python has a pretty impressive machine learning library, and can be used for making web apps, desktop software, as well as command line utilities. It's usually better than R for scraping websites or "data munging" as it were. It's also better for making any sort of product with because you can do just about anything with it, and debugging and writing clean code is far easier. R I use more for exploratory analysis as well as general purpose data analysis. Basically, I use it anytime I don't need to write production code and just need to answer a question or write up a report. It seems like you have to worry less about the details and can just get things done. There's probably a library out there somewhere that has the statistical method you're after in it, and it's incredibly easy to install it. Also, R's subsetting implementation and graphics packages are IMO better than what's available in Python. Both are getting better at doing what the other does well though. You already noted that Python has Pandas to mimic R functionality. R has a web app framework I haven't actually used yet called Shiny. It seems like it's better for utilities vs. making a product though, but I can see that it's competing with Python in some regards. The aforementioned are by no means the only examples. As others have noted, there are libraries to use R with Python, and vice versa. I'd just recommend using both. When you need something that is general purpose Python is better. When you just need to do data analysis / research and answer a question or write a report, R is better.
