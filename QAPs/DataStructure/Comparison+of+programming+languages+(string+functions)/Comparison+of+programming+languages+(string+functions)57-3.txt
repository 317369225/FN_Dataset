Haskell (programming language):Â What are type classes and how are they useful?
From scientific point of view, type classes are theories (like in model theory); and their models are models. E.g. (in scala) trait Ord[A] {  def lt(x: A, y: A): Boolean} Specifies a theory of ordering; any partially ordered set... hmm, type is a model of it. The notion may be confusing because on many occasions (e.g. List[T]) parametric polymorphism specifies something like a functor (we need something more for it to be a functor). Not in the case of type classes which are used to provide some kind of structure declaration.
