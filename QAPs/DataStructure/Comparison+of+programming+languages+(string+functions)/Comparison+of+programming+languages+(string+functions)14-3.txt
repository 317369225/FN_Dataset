Which is a more difficult programming language to learn, Java or JavaScript?
It depends how far you want to push your skills in programming and what to do. Javascript is easy to start with since as Mattias said, you just start with any editor or just the console of a browser while with Java you need to grasp some concepts before being able to write something decent (OOP, compile, deploy...) however if you want to learn to write good software you'll invest more time than just learning java. Brief, go with java, learning curve is slightly steeper than JS but once you learn it, any other general purpose or scripting language is a matter of couple of hours to learn the syntax and a week to grasp most important libraries.
