Why are Java 8 lambda expressions regarded as a big change in the Java programming language?
I think adding Lambda expression introduced in java 8 is indeed big change. because I think its the compromise made by java. The best thing about java is that its a pure OOP language. and with introduction of lambda expression java has drop the hint , it has shown that they are ready to compromise ( which I think wouldn't have happen under Sun Microsystems, anyways). As mentioned in other answers this has made java more modern hacker friendly user friendly - and tried to add functional programming aspect .. but it comes at price.. it has loose the readability new Thread(new Runnable() { public void run() { System.out.println("New thread"); } }).start(); this block of code gives clear information that parameter type of constructor of class Thread is Runnable which is an interface and we are passing object of class which implements and this interface and hence we have implemented the method run()..clear isn't it? now what about this new Thread(() -> { System.out.println("New thread"; }).start(); short and concise sure ..appreciated but readability - no!!
