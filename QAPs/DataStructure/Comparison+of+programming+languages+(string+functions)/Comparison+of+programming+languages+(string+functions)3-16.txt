PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
First and certainly, Python is easier to learn rather than JAVA. But I guess the question is: -- what is the goal to building website?     If you want to build up a personal website/blog, or you just want to learn some web development, I would suggested using Python/PHP as the study curve is not that steep. Indeed, lots of problem you meet for building a website, is not "how to program this" but "what is the best solution to solve the problem and meet the needs". Choosing a easy-to-use programming language can help you more focusing on finding the problem solutions.    If you want to build up a website to provide certain web service for people, then you should clarify what is the needs for the website. Based on those needs, you can then select the most adequate and suitable web-dev framework. There are couple very popular frameworks today, like Django which is a python - core framework, or J2EE which is a JAVA core framework. Then you naturally get your question's answer. You *choose* this programming language is because this framework can solve you needs.
