Why can't binary be reversed to source code exactly as it was before compilation?
With a lot of programming languages compilation discards a lot of the metadata and does a lot of optimization. You can, in fact, decompile a program into code again, but the names of functions and variables will likely have been lost, some of the organization of things will be different. In fact some functions might have been placed inline to save time (calling a function takes time and memory, so many compilers will replace calls to small functions with the code they contain). Java is somewhat of an exception as it DOES contain most of the function and variable names and its compilation optimization is comparatively minimal.
