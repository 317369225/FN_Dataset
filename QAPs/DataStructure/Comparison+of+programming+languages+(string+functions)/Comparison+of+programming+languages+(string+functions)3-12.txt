PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
Java is not that bad now days, here is an example of creating a simple website using Spark micro web framework: import static spark.Spark.*; public class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args) { get("/hello", (req, res) -> "Hello World"); } } Just run it and see the output at: http://localhost:4567/hello That's it :) For more stuffs, you can go here -> A tiny Java web framework Edit: Comparison of python and Java: Availability of Resources: Both languages provide sufficient functionalities, libraries, community support to get the thing done. Length of Code and Readability: The Java code will seem longer as compared to python, but the most of codes are auto-generated, auto-completed by IDE. Python codes are certainly more readable but a well designed Java code won't disappoint you. Performance: 1. Sparkjava: 48631.24 Requests/sec Average Latency 1.29ms 2. Python + Flask:  11751 Requests/sec  Average Latency 55.54ms (Source-> Express vs Flask vs Go vs Sparkjava vs Sinatra). Performance of Java is way better than Python.  5. Scaling: Python faces some scalability issues. (Why do people say that Java is more scalable than python?) Conclusion: If you want to get the thing done in quickest possible way     choose Python else     choose Java Updated Sat • View Upvotes
