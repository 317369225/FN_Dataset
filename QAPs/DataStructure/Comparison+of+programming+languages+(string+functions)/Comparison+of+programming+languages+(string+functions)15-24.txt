Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?Python has come up a long way in data analysis with its Scipy, Numpy and Pandas platforms. Is R still a better data analysis language than Python? Has anyone else used Python with Pandas to a large extent in data analysis projects?
Python is good for data clean up, R for building statistical models Updated: http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/10... Python tends to outperform R in such areas as: Web scraping and crawling: though rvest has simplified web scraping and crawling within R, Python’s beautifulsoup and Scrapy are more mature and deliver more functionality. Database connections: though R has a large number of options for connecting to databases, Python’s sqlachemy offers this in a single package and is widely used in production environments. Whereas R outperforms Python in such areas as: Statistical analysis options: though Python’s combination of Scipy, Pandas and statsmodels offer a great set of statistical analysis tools, R is built specifically around statistical analysis applications and so provides a much larger collection of such tools. Interactive graphics/dashboards: bokeh, plotlyand intuitics have all recently extended the use of Python graphics onto web browsers, but getting an example up and running using shiny and shiny dashboard in R is faster, and often requires less code.
