Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?Python has come up a long way in data analysis with its Scipy, Numpy and Pandas platforms. Is R still a better data analysis language than Python? Has anyone else used Python with Pandas to a large extent in data analysis projects?
Originally Answered: Which one is better for data science, R or Python?I used both R and Python for quite some time, but, since you reminded me, I haven't opened R for about 6 months now. R has a bit more statistical libraries, but you might not even notice. pandas+scipy+numpy+scikit covers most of what you'd need. In addition, Python is a "real" programming language after all, and arguably the most versatile one, while R is just a package for statistics. So, Python has LOTS more than just stats, plus it is reasonably easy befriended with other languages (i.e., C inline code for improved performance, or importing of R libraries). My observation is that people with statistical background prefer R, while people with scientific or CS background prefer python. R has interface and a few tools to make for easy interactive workflow, but Python is way more versatile and more appropriate for those who want more control.
