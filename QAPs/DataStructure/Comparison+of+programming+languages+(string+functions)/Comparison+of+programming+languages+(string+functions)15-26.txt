Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?Python has come up a long way in data analysis with its Scipy, Numpy and Pandas platforms. Is R still a better data analysis language than Python? Has anyone else used Python with Pandas to a large extent in data analysis projects?
I've used Pandas and I find it really helpful.  I'd still use R for really statistics-heavy analysis projects.    I usually do data manipulation and simple stats in Python, and then move to R for any more complex statistics.
