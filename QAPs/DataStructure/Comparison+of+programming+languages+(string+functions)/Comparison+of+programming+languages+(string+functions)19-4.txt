What bad programming/architecture habits can a self-taught PHP coder develop?..and how to get rid of them?
When learning a new language or attempting to refine my skills in a language with which I am already familiar, my first step is to seek out language experts. These will often be found as blog or book authors. In the case of PHP, http://www.phptherightway.com is an excellent resource. Next up, you should seek out a PHP code base written by someone (or a team) whom you respect. I'd suggest the Symfony framework, http://symfony.com Pretty much everyone can improve and you should never stop learning! Never assume you have learned it all; and give back if you think you have :-)
