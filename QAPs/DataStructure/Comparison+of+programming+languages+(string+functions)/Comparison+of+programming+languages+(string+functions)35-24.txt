Why do many software engineers not like Java?
There's an old adage in software development "There are only two types of programming languages: those that everyone complains about, and those that nobody uses." For any language that has a decent amount of software written using it, there will be at least some contingency of developers who hate it. My reasons for disliking Java? It is neither high level enough to be enjoyable or easy to use (ala Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc.) nor is it low level enough to be fast and powerful (ala C, C++, D, etc.). It doesn't have the ease of iteration that a dynamic language has, yet it still runs in a VM. Last I used Java, there were no unsigned integral types, so even if you didn't need the negative bits, you still needed to carry around the memory cost of them. Thus, it is a statically typed system with totally inadequate fundamental types. It has the idea that software design is simplified by pedantically sticking to one programming paradigm (i.e. OOP), but this only causes software to become more complex and verbose in order to work around the limitations of the paradigm. Java is filled with dichotomies like this.
