What are the top ten things a beginner must know about JavaScript?
JavaScript is not only used in client-side programming (browser). Like DOM manipulation, making Ajax requests, etc. There is also server-side JavaScript. Namely, node.js. Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. JavaScript's asynchronous capabilities make it the best suit for an event-driven server-side programming language.
