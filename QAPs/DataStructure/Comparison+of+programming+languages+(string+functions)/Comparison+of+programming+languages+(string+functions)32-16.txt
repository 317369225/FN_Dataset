What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
Originally Answered: What is the significant difference between a compiler and an interpreter?well, The difference between Compiler and Interpreter:  Compiler:             1. Compiler Takes Entire program as input Interpreter  2. Intermediate Object Code is Generated  3. Conditional Control Statements are Executes faster  4. Memory Requirement : More(Since Object Code is Generated)  5. Program need not be compiled every time  6. Errors are displayed after entire program is checked  7. Example : C Compiler Interpreter: 1. Interpreter Takes Single instruction as input 2. No Intermediate Object Code is Generated 3. Conditional Control Statements are Executes slower 4. Memory Requirement is Less 5. Every time higher level program is converted into lower level program 6. Errors are displayed for every instruction interpreted (if any) 7. Example : BASIC Just understand the concept of the compiler and interpreter: 1.We give complete program as input to the compiler. 2.However interpreter takes single line of code as input at a time and execute that line. It will terminate the execution of the code as soon as it finds the error. 3.Memory requirement is less in case of interpreter because no object code is created in case of interpreter.
