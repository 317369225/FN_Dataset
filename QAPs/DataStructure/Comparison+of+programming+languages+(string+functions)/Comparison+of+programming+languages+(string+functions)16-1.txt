How would you explain Java to a 15 year old that knows nothing about programming?What are the Java 101 and basics? What are examples you use Java for? Looking for answers that are aimed for someone that does not know anything about programming at all.
Just get an introductory programming textbook. The programming language it uses it not really that important (though simpler is better, personally I think Java is fine). Understanding programming in anything other than simplistic terms is a gradual process that takes time, reading and practice. It can't really be explained in just one go (not in any meaningful sense). You could describe how programming is just providing a sequence of instructions to be carried out (and that Java is just one of many languages that you can choose to use to achieve this), but that's not going to give a very deep understanding of it -- simply reading the first chapter or two of an introductory textbook will probably yield best results. Actually looking at what code looks like (preferably very simple code) and having some understanding of what it is doing is the only way to really understand what programming is.
