PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
I've wrote 4 different servers in 4 different languages last two weeks (Java+Spring, Ruby on Rails, NodeJS and Golang). By far, the one that is easiest to create a server without any additional framework and using only the builtin packages is Golang. The lanagua is very, very simple yet has amazing funcionality for webapps (such as built in struct JSON marshaling). This is code for a simple server (taken from Writing Web Applications: ) package main import ( "fmt" "net/http" ) Â  func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hi there, I love %s!", r.URL.Path[1:]) } func main() { http.HandleFunc("/", handler) http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil) }
