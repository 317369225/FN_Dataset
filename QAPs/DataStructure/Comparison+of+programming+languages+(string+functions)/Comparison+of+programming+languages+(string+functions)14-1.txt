Which is a more difficult programming language to learn, Java or JavaScript?
JavaScript is probably much easier to get started with. As time goes on, JavaScript probably becomes a lot more difficult. Static, explicitly declared types in Java make it easy to look at code and understand what it does. It's hard to explain to a non-programmer why that matters (I'm assuming you're not a programmer, apologies if I'm wrong), but in a way: Java is like explaining something in plain English, clearly and without ambiguity. JavaScript is like explaining something in txtspk. It makes perfect sense in the context of your conversation at the time, but go back to it in 2 years, out of context, it's nonsensical gibberish.
