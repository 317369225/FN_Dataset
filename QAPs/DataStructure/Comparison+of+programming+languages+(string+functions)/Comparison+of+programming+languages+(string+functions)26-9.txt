Which have been some of the most funniest/craziest Vivas that you have appeared for at NSIT?
Physics Lab - 1st Semester. The professor seemed to be hurrying through the viva, he asked only 1 question to the students and fairly simple ones. Professor to Student 1: "What experiment did you perform?" Student 1: Sir, To verify the resolving Power of Telescope... Â * Asks, the students 1-3 fairly simple questions on Resolving power. (Not even a single question was passed) * Question to me: "Acha toh yeh batao, "Resolution" ka Hindi kya hota hai?"
