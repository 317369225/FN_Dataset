Why was Lisp the language of choice for AI research?
Artificial intelligence research generates many significant programming problems. While in other programming communities this succession of problems generally produces new languages, and for good reason, in any large programming task a useful organizing principle is to control and isolate traffic within the task modules via the invention of language, Lisp has such simple semantics and syntax. The former class of languages tend to become less primitive, and as a result contain complex functions replicated many times. The advantage, or rather freedom of Lisp is this very simplicity.
