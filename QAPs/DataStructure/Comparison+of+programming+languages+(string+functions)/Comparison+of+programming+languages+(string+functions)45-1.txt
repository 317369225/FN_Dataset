How would one use Python to read a file with floating numbers, compute their averages and print the averages?
Problem is, this is obviously a homework question and we shouldn't be doing their homework for them.  If they had a particular question about reading numbers or looping, that would be fine.  But there is no question there, just basically "do my homework".   As a hint, they probably want to: Get the second parameter from the command line. Open that file Read the numbers. Add them Divide by the number of numbers. Print that out. That could be done with about six lines of Perl. We can't go into any more detail without giving it all away.
