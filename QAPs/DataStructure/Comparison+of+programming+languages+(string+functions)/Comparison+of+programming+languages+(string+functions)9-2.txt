In comparison to Ruby, what is the role of object-oriented programming in JavaScript?Hope this makes sense. I'm looking to understand how JavaScript uses Object Oriented principles. Any insights would be appreciated....
There is no role of object oriented programming, it is just a paradigm and a methodology which provides lot of benefits (in particular situations). As it is a methodology which remains the same throughout all the programming langauges, it makes no sense to compare it between Ruby and Javascript.
