Which is a more difficult programming language to learn, Java or JavaScript?
Both are very simple languages to learn for a beginner programmer. Both languages have a couple of stupid design choices, but they don't cause too much trouble. I would say that JavaScript is easier for a beginner programmer as you don't need any tooling to get started, just a text editor and a web browser and you're off. With Java you'll need an IDE and it comes with quite an ecosystem in one fell swoop. If you already know a C-style programming language, Java will be easier as it will be more similar to what you are used to.
