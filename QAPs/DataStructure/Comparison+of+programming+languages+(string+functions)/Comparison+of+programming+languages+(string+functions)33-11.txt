What are the top ten things a beginner must know about JavaScript?
Unobtrusive JavaScript It is not a technique as such, it’s a way of thinking. To better understand what this is and why we need it, let’s consider the many uncertainties involved in JavaScript programming: Some browsers may ignore your script completely because they don’t support JavaScript or their support is too old-fashioned. Even when a browser can support JavaScript, users may turn it off for security reasons, or their corporate firewall may block it by removing all <script> tags. Even when a browser supports JavaScript, it may not understand parts of your script because it has a proprietary implementation of some parts of the DOM specification (IE is usually the culprit here). Even when the script is interpreted correctly, it may depend on HTML that is very complicated and/or might change in unpredictable ways. Even when your programming context is blessed with perfect HTML, you cannot be certain of the input device your users will use. Many scripts work only when the user uses a mouse, and forget about people who use the keyboard instead (a lot of disabled users cannot use a mouse, and some people simply prefer the keyboard). Even when your script avoids all these dangers and works perfectly, other programmers may not understand it.
