What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
Both compiler and interpreter read your source code and convert it into computer understandable form. The way they do this is different. Compiler : This takes your whole code and reads it at once pointing out, if your program has errors, all the errors in your program. If you do not have an error it successfully converts your source code to some machine understandable form. For example, Consider a teacher who points out all the errors in an article and makes her student correct all the errors before the article is submitted. You can say the teacher 'compiled' the article. Interpreter :  This takes your code and reads it  line by line and points out the error whenever it encounters an error, it won't read your next line if you do not remove the error. If you do not have  an error it successfully converts your source code to some machine  understandable form. For example, Consider a teacher who doesn't let you move on to the next line if there is a mistake. You can say the teacher 'interpreted' the  article. Hope this helps.
