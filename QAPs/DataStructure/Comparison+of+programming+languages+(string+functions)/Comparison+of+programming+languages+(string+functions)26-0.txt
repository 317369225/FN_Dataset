Which have been some of the most funniest/craziest Vivas that you have appeared for at NSIT?
Engineering Drawing viva: 4 students, I'm on the far right. RJP sir starts from left. He's talking about a certain symbol used in E.D. that we had NO idea about. Sir : Iski orientation kya hoti hai Student 1 : face uppar Sir: galat! 2 : face left Sir: galat! 3 : face neeche Sir : galat! Me: um.. face right (only possible thing left to say) Sir : exactly! very good! you can go, rest all stay. I got full marks in my viva. With just that one question, mind you.
