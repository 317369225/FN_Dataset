Which have been some of the most funniest/craziest Vivas that you have appeared for at NSIT?
Semester- IV Subject- electrical workshop Duration- 90 mins I do not know the name of the teacher but after the first question he asked me- "beta tum Afghanistan se ho Kya?" Next- ache tumhe pta hai na Taliban Kaha ka hai? Pakistan ka president pta hai kon hai? Woh kis ka husband hai? Next- tumhara naam Kya hai? Iska matlab Kya Hota hai. Tumhare parents ne kaha se dhunda? For the rest of the time. He kept reciting shaloka's, asking GK questions and in the last 30 mins he told us the qualities of being a Brahmin and Kshatriya.
