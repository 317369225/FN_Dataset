How many API's have you've worked with. Working with an API is a huge part of my job as a JS developer. I've worked with about 10 in my career so far and a few are already on the roster for the months ahead. Why would you use a library like jQuery or Angular when raw JavaScript is available? This is a big one where the answer should move the dev into intermediate/mid level status. What approaches have you taken to refactor code after your first working version? If they don't have anything to talk about here its possible that they have not refactored any code.

Asking about AJAX, JSON, JSONP, opinions on the most recent ECMA Script version (JS6), React, Node, Angular, etc are all critical parts of JavaScript.
