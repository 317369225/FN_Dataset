What are the best programming practices and coding standards independent of programming languages?
Some of the Best Programming Practices and Coding standards are as below. Code should be self explanatory as much as possible. Give meaningful names to your functions, variables and classes. Proper comments especially when your code involves complicated logic. Avoid commenting code where logic is evident. Keep comments simple. Code should be modular, reuseable , extendable, maintainable. Professional developers should remember that they are not the only ones reading the code they have written. Follow OOPs concepts strictly when coding in Object oriented languages. Unit Testing whenever possible. Add proper comments when committing your code into an revision control system. Avoid hard-coding parameters like port numbers, database connection strings, etc. Maintain coding conventions uniformly throughout your code. Implement GOF design patterns wherever possible. Use existing standard libraries for basic functions like sorting, comparisons, searching, date-time functions etc instead of reinventing the wheel. Naming conventions, code indentation, commenting standards may vary from language to language. ForÂ  Java coding conventions, refer Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language: Contents
