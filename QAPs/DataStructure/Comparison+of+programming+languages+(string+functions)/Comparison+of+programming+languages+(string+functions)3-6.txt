PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
As others have already noted, this is really multiple questions. - Is Python or Java easier to learn? - Is Python or Java better for building a website? Python's easier to learn in my experience.  I've learned Java and Python, and Python was much simpler for me.  Your mileage may vary. As for building a website - Python is used pretty commonly to write code that generates HTML; Java is used for systems that move data around behind the scenes.  You would use Java to write a service that loads customer data behind the scenes and then makes that available to the Python front end.
