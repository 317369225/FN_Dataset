How do iOS developers feel about Swift, Apple's new programming language?
From my viewpoint, I currently don't think Swift is worth it right now for new developers. There are so many libraries that are written in Objective C, and while you can use a bridging header, a fundamental knowledge of Objective C is still required if you want to understand how they work by reading source code. Also, I like the Objective C syntax better, but that's just me. This being said, Swift is absolutely fantastic for experienced developers who have a great understanding of Objective C. It has so many new features that can make our lives exponentially easier, such as optionals.
