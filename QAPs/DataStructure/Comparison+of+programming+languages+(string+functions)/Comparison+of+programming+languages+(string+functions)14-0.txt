Which is a more difficult programming language to learn, Java or JavaScript?
I'd argue that Java is a harder programming language to learn since you need to grok more concepts before you'll be able to write code that leverages a lot of the standard library or any moderately complex third party library. This isn't an exhaustive list but just for the purpose of this discussion, I'd say you'd need at least a basic understanding of: Fundamental object oriented concepts (objects, instance methods, inheritance, statics/singletons) Autoboxing and Unboxing Generics in Java Interface (Java) Java String comparison FAQ: How to compare Java Strings Java annotation Factory method pattern Java concurrency Comparing that to pure Javascript (no DOM) I think you'd need a basic understanding of: Inheritance and the prototype chain Closures First-class function With Javascript I think Prototypical inheritance and first class functions are the big ones and everything flows from there.
