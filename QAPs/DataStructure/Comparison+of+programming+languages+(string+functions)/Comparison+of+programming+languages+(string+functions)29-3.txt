How do you judge a JavaScript programmer by only 5 questions?
This is funny because if you ask them to give you 5 questions about JavaScript, it will speak a lot about the developer as well. Then by asking why they choose those questions, you will have a pretty clear understanding of what the programmer typically uses JavaScript for and to what extent. Oh wait... is it what you are doing? Nice! Anyway, I think for the library builder, as mentioned in some of the answers, it's clear that context juggling is important for clean API, so things like apply, call, bind, closure, prototypical inheritance etc. float to the top very quickly. For the architect, questions like MV* will be more prominent. For the one who has to regularly maintain legacy stuff like me, I will definitely ask question about build process. In other words, to judge JS programmers by only 5 questions, ask them to choose those 5 questions themselves.
