What basic PHP/MySQL interview questions should I focus on?
Originally Answered: What kind of questions should I expect In a PHP interview for freshers? Here are the questions I would be asking How can you safely pass user-supplied parameters to a database query to minimize the risk of SQL injection attacks? When should I pass variables by value and by reference? Explain to me what is recursion. Explain to me what are abstract classes. What process do you use when refactoring your code? What annoys you the most about PHP today? If a person can answer these questions, I can save a lot of time by not talking about basics. I call it relying on class inheritance in real life. ;)
