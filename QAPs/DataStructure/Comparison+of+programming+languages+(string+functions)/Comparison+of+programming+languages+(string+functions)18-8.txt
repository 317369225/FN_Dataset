As a starting Python programmer I see a lot of praise for the Python language (and so far I can only agree). Isn't there anything bad to say about it? What is a real con?
The most commonly cited con of Python (to my knowledge) is that it is slow. In the worst of cases in can be hundreds of times slower than equivalent C++ code, in the best cases, it is only a few times slower. These aren't exact numbers, but it should give you a rough idea. EDIT: I forgot to mention, and some other people have, that a serious issue with Python is, as it is interpreted, you don't find basic errors through compilation. This can often catch many small errors (such as typos in variable names), which is very nice and probably my least favourite thing about python which does not do it. Haskell has a wonderful compiler (better than any other I've used). Although it can be frustrating sometimes, it catches a large percentage of the errors, especially simple errors. Once my program compiles, I very rarely have any bugs left. Usually none.
