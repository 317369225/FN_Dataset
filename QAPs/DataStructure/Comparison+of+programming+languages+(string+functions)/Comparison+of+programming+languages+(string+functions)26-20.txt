Which have been some of the most funniest/craziest Vivas that you have appeared for at NSIT?
I still remember the day when PRK sir was taking our VIVA , he was questioning about recrystallization temp. .I was sitting with a blanked face and then the person next to me tried answering the que. - sir it is that temp. when crystals are made again . PRK sr - hame dobara crystals chahiye hi kyu ? student - sir ... sir ... pata nhi PRK sr - are bolo bolo .. student - sr apke samne nervousness ho rhi h .. PRK sr - tumhare samne answer pda h or Tum answer ko hi LAAT mar rhe ho .. student - *BLANK*
