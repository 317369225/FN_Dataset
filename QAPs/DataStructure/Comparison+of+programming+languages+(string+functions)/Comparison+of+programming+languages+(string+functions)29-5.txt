How do you judge a JavaScript programmer by only 5 questions?
Because your question isn't clear about: Which position do you want to hire him ? Which level do you want to hire him ? Which task do you like him to do ? So, I just have some general questions: 1.  Do you know any languages like C#, Java, C++. And you hope the answer should be yes. And I think most interviewees will answer yes, too. Because rarely developers haven't programmed on those languages yet. Then the real question is:  What are the differences between the OOP in "that" language and the OOP in Javascript. This question is nice because the programmer should know those things: OOP in C#, Java, C++. Very strong point. Many programmers can program Java, C# without know clearly about OOP. OOP in Javascript. Wow, so fantastic. Fewer programmers know Javascript has OOP, too. Tell the difference. Fantastic of fantastic.  If your interviewee can answer this question clearly, he's great. He maybe don't know difference between == and ===. He maybe don't know many javascript frameworks. He maybe don't know many things ... All of that, just because he don't have enough time with javascript. But, he has strong passion in career, in programming language and he has logistic thinking. Hire him.2. Discuss about Design Patten in Javascript I emphasize about "discuss". this means this question doesn't have exactly answer. You just listen for him answer about how many design patterns he know. For each design pattern, you can ask he why he use that ? are there any trade-off in those patterns ? How about those patterns in another languages ? (if they know another language clearly). This question emphasizes interviewee's software engineering skill. If you don't know any patterns, don't worry. Listen the how confidence he answers, you can guess about his skill. And if you understand design pattern (better in Javascript), great. 3. Have you ever used  or listened about Javascript build tools  Hardly to believe that a great programmer don't use any javascript build-tools these days.  Of course, you can ask him more about this build tool for understanding does he really understand. 4. Have you ever used a javascript testing framework Same as question 3. Hardly to believe a great programmer don't use any testing framework in their life. At this step, if your interviewee can answer yes to both 3 and 4, I don't believe this guy doesn't have intermediate level or above Javascript skill. 5. Tell me your Javascript Naming Convention This question tests about how he care about naming convention in javascript. It's important. And a person who takes care about this will always write clear and concise code.
