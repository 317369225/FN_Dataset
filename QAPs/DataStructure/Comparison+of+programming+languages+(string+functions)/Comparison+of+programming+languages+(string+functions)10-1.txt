If I was interviewing for a SWE position in Python, and you were the interviewer, what are the top 5 things about the language that would disappoint you if I did not know them?
Probably depends on the focus of the company, but I'd be surprised if you were not at least aware of: The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) in CPython and its implications for concurrent programs. Argument passing style and its implications for your code. For example, what is a hazard of using a dictionary object as a default argument, e.g. def foo(bar={}): Iterators/Generators. For example, what happens when yield is called vs return? Virtualenv+pip. At least one of the testing/mocking frameworks available (nose, flexmock, mock, unittest).That said, all of the above are easily learned. I'd be far more disappointed if you were to claim Python experience but weren't capable of writing basic code necessary to solve a problem.
