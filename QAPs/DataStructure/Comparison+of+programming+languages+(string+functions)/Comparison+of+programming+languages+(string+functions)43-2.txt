How did Richard Wagner change the face of music?
Wagner developed the leitmotif, a tune associated with a person or thing that woven with others makes up the masterful tapestry of his scores. So when you listen to the music in the beginning of Act 3 of Siegfreid, you know from the musical cues that Wotan the leader of the Norse gods is riding, on horseback, somewhere in a hurry, brooding, in particular brooding about the coming fall of the gods, and that the woman he summons to consult with (if her rising out of the earth wasn't already a hint) is Erda with Earth goddess. Oh yeah, you also don't really have to understand German to know it's a done deal and the gods are doomed from her reply. But it doesn't sound contrived at all, much of it is just great music that endures. For the novice, I highly recommend Siegfried's funeral music for the exact moment when the hero's sword triumphs brightly banishing the darkness. So yes, you can hear this in John Williams' scores as he invokes the Dark Lord of the Sith, Luke, Leia, John Dunbar, Two Socks (but with much less finesse IMO)
