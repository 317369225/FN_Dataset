Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?Python has come up a long way in data analysis with its Scipy, Numpy and Pandas platforms. Is R still a better data analysis language than Python? Has anyone else used Python with Pandas to a large extent in data analysis projects?
Originally Answered: Should I pick R or Python for data analytics?I love python and I have a love-hate relationships with R. My opinion on this topic is that if all you are going to do is data analysis -- you may stick with R. But if you need to do heavy parsing and/or preprocessing, do (by yourself) communication with the "outer world" -- then go for Python.Â  Historically, R was de-facto standard for data analysis. However, during the couple of recent years the situation has changed dramatically. Most of the credit for this change should go, in my opinion, to the developers of IPython Notebook that revolutionized the workflow of a data scientist, which gave a boost to the development of great analysis-centric tools such as Pandas. One of the arguments that was used in the past in the R vs Python discussions was that R was "a tool for statisticians written by statisticians", while Python was "just a programming language with some libraries". Nowadays, Python has tons of tools "written for analysts by analysts", but it is still a real programming language, something that I cannot say about R.
