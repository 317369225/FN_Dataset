PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
To answer your question quickly it would be Python hands down. BUT, you should have included the most used language on the web which is PHP.  I have built simple websites as well as very complicated web apps with it.  Here is a list why you should go with PHP: - most hosts have PHP ready to go. - PHP hooks up to most databases really easily. - PHP runs most websites. - PHP is extremely easy to learn. - Extremely powerful project run on PHP which will get you 90% of the way by just installing them.  Like - Drupal, Wordpress, Joomla, Open Commerce. Good luck.
