It's powerful, easy to learn/use, easy to set up, safe, fast and has a good standard library. It is also supported by almost all (if not all) hosting providers -- even free ones! The documentation for the language is superb. Java's a good generic language which is useful for a great variety of applications. It can be used as a replacement for PHP, but that's going to be much more difficult. PHP is a scripting language so it's programs are meant to be short and to the point. Java is a programming language where you must follow all of the tiny details to get it to work efficiently. I use C++ for web dev when writing an application and sometimes PHP. C++ is quite difficult for small applications -- because I tend to build the web server into the app itself!
