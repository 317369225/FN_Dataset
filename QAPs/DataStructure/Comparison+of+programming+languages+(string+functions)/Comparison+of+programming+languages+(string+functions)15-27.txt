Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?Python has come up a long way in data analysis with its Scipy, Numpy and Pandas platforms. Is R still a better data analysis language than Python? Has anyone else used Python with Pandas to a large extent in data analysis projects?
Originally Answered: Should I pick R or Python for data analytics?If you're already a Python programmer and you work in any Enterprise company where people care about security and sturdy code, then you have already made a good choice. Python is old already and has active support from tech industry. If you're transitioning from something else to either R or Python, I would say R because I notice most of the new libraries and features comes to R first being followed by Python. This is true most of the times, there may be some exceptions. Updated 31 Jul â€¢ View Upvotes
