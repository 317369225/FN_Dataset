How would you explain Java to a 15 year old that knows nothing about programming?What are the Java 101 and basics? What are examples you use Java for? Looking for answers that are aimed for someone that does not know anything about programming at all.
I'd question starting with Java. I say that as a Java programmer who thinks Java is a useful tool. Start with Python or Ruby or JavaScript and move on to Java. Java syntax is complex. Static typing is harder to get at first than dynamic typing. Having to think about type casting and so on isn't something a new programmer should have to think about just to start playing around. So, the best thing is to start with a more appropriate language. But if you choose not to take such good advice, I'd suggest the best thing to do would be to start by saying "ignore the whole concept of classes. They are important and useful, but we'll get to them later." Then start by doing Hello, World! in a main method. Then build up from there: if statements, nested if statements, variables, comparison, arithmetic, understanding of the basic types (int, float, String etc.). Familiarise them with the syntax. Use age-appropriate examples: perhaps use something like Processing (programming language) (which does 2D graphics on top of Java) to make it more interesting. Avoid all the bloated enterprise bullshit that Java people have built, because frankly AbstractBeanSyntaxConnectionModifierFactoryFactorys are not suitable for adults, let alone teenagers with pliable brains. Teach them about building functions, and eventaully building classes and objects. Make sure they understand each step before moving on. If you are teaching them directly, you should be able to take any reasonably good programming book—of which there are many for Java—and translate the examples and ideas into something that will be interesting for a 15-year-old.
