What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
Originally Answered: What is the difference between a compiler and interpreter?A compiler transforms a program from one language(source) to another language(target). Generally the source language is a high level programming language like C/C++ and target language is the machine language of the target architecture(x86,arm). Once the target code is generated the job of the compiler is over. The aim of the compiler is to 1) Check the the source program conforms to the syntax and semantics of the source programming language. 2) Generate code that is correct. The generated code should do exactly what the program in source language meant. 3) Perform optimizations so that the generated code runs on the target fast. 4) Do these as fast as possible An interpreter is a program that takes in a program written in a source language and runs the program. You can think that the source code is a set of instructions to the interpreter. The interpreter will generally do a syntax check first on the source language to ensure it is a valid program and tries to interpret the source code line by line. Interpreters are generally used in cases where flexibility and programmability is the main aim rather than high performance. These languages often have dynamic typing. We can find interpreters for scripting languages like perl,python etc. Updated 13 Nov â€¢ View Upvotes
