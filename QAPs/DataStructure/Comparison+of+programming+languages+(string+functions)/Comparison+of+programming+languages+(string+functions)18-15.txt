As a starting Python programmer I see a lot of praise for the Python language (and so far I can only agree). Isn't there anything bad to say about it? What is a real con?
It's a dynamically typed language which means that it will check the types of variables and constants just before every primitive operation. That means when you give a program the right arguments, you will run smoothly. But give the program an int and a string to perform the + operation, then you will crash. It is slow. It is very high level, which can be a nuisance if you want to write stuff for the OS. Google "downsides of python" and I'm sure more than a few results will pop up. I don't think I know of any programming language that is perfect.
