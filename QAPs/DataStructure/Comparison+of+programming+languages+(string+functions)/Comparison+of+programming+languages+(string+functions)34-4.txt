Which is better, PHP or Java?Which language suits better for an early stage web company.
Considering Java as in JSP for web development. To be honest I've never really used JSP. I use PHP because of its ease and great functionality. Learning PHP after knowing other programming languages is very undifficult. Its fairly secure too. Also i believe java server pages are slightly slower, but more so insignificantly. To each their own is what it comes down to. Hope that makes sense.
