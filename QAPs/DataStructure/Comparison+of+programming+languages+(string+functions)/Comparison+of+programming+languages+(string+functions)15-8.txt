Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?Python has come up a long way in data analysis with its Scipy, Numpy and Pandas platforms. Is R still a better data analysis language than Python? Has anyone else used Python with Pandas to a large extent in data analysis projects?
Learn Both. Everyone keeps asking this, not sure why. They are both Languages which may be difficult or easy depending on who is learning them. Python is more general purpose in addition to Machine Learning and Data Mining (Scipy, Pandas). R is more focused on Stats (1000s of packages all on stats). You'll get way more functions in R that are more flexible in terms of parameters, etc with a wide variety of statistical functions than you may find with Python. Both are free, but Python is 'generally' faster. Python has a comparatively higher job market appeal as of today (Sep, 2015). It ultimately depends on what you want to accomplish. Data Analysis is a very broad question. For Machine Learning, I'd favour Python over R mainly because it is simpler to parallelize with StarCluster and Scipy is Great and Fast, just my experience. For General Stats = R by all means. Whichever one you do end up using, search for "(your selected language) high performance" "(your selected language) multicore", "(your selected language) big data" and you'll find that both have an amazing range of past, existing and ongoing projects to address these and have components (eg., Seamless R and C++ Integration and CRAN - Package data.table in R and numexpr - Fast numerical array expression evaluator for Python and NumPy. - Google Project Hosting or PyPy - Welcome to PyPy in Python) that are quite remarkable and can do everything you want the other language to do if not more.
