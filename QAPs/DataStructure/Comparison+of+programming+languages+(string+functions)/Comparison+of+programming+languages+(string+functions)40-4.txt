How do I find the first non repeated character of a given string?
Most solutions I have seen in this post are O(n^2). Here is an O(nlogn) solution: You Can sort the string (array of characters) in O(nlogn) such that all repeated characters will be in consecutive array indicies. Iterate over the sorted array O(n), such that the first time you encounter a character at index_i NOT EQUAL (to the character at index_i-1 and index i+1) is the first unique non repeating character. Take Character of the boundary condition at the first and the last character.Edit: This above algorithm returns a the first non repeated character in the sorted string. not the first non repeating charater in the input string.
