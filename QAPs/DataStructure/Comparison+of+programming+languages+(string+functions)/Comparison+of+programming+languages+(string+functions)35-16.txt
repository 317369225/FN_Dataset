Why do many software engineers not like Java?
I guess you mean programmers. If you are the kind of programmer who wants to get the job done as fast as possible, you probably don't like Java. Try a dynamically typed language, like PHP. If you are the kind of programmer who wants his code to be elegant, succinct, declarative, you probably don't like Java. Try a functional language, like Haskell. If you tried Haskell and you liked functional but realised you need code you can actually deploy, you probably still don't like Java. Try Scala. If you tried Scala but realised statically typed languages mess with your pace, you obviously still don't like Java. Try Clojure; functional & dynamic. If you are the kind of programmer who expects to spend his time doing actual work stuff instead of spending a 3rd of his time instructing the compiler on what your data structures are and how to traverse them, then you definitely need to stay away from Java. Try a language with type inference, like any modern language of the last 10 years or so. And that's why. The one use case for Java is maintaining a legacy Java codebase. Everyone has to code in Java anyway, and thus they don't like Java.
