PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
I hear these questions quite often, where you have to choose between two languages. And the answer to such questions will never be okay, since every person has their own opinion about a specific language. One will advise you to use Python and the other will tell you Java is a better choice. So, how would you decide if you keep getting such conflicted answers? Well, each language has its own advantages and disadvantages so for an optimal solution you can try to combine both. You could, for example, build a web service in Java and use that web service from Python code. It is also possible to call Java code directly from Python, although a bit tricky: 5 Ways of Calling Java from Python If your mind is open for both languages, you can start learning both and sooner or later you will know by yourself which language you'll prefer. At first, it will be twice as hard because you have to learn two languages at once, but doing so will tell you which language will be more favorite for you. And by then, you switch to just that language. It never hurts to know a little of both, either. So, don't choose, learn both!
