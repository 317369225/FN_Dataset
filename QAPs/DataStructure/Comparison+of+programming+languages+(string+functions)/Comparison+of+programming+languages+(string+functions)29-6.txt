How do you judge a JavaScript programmer by only 5 questions?
What does JavaScript have in common with Java? Weed out the clueless people here. Alternatively you might get impressed here so this is a good question to start with. Who invented JavaScript? Another bonus point for knowing your history. Not knowing this raises some doubts at least in my mind. How do closures work? Getting technical. If you understand closures, you understand something fundamental about the language. What kind of JavaScript tools do you use? You can know someone by understanding the tools the person uses. Who are your JavaScript idols? Understand influences (or lack of), understand person.
