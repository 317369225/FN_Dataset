Which have been some of the most funniest/craziest Vivas that you have appeared for at NSIT?
Not even ONE viva has passed in last 5 semesters where i havent't screwed up! here are some excerpts.. SUBJECT-Manufacturing (semester-I) proff-Chalo ye batao, if we have a very intricate object...use banana hai..to which method will you choose? Casting,Foundry,Welding or what? Me-(Except familiarity with the terms FOUNDRY,WELDING etc.,i knew NOTHING ) Sir,actually,the thing is that..Welding ka kaam sirf welding se hi ho skta h and foundry wala foundry hi kar skta hai. Dono ek dusre ka kaam to kr nhi skte. And Casting bhi Casting se hi ho sakti h! Sheet metal ka kaam sheet metal hi kr skta hai. To hume sabki help se banana padega. Koi ek method se nahi ban saktta.! :-) SUBJECT-Control Engineering (5th sem) This incident is remembered for the weird questions asked by examiner (though not to me) Â proff-Dekho,tumhare ghar me A.C. hai...usme kuch temperature set h.Tumne remote uthaya aur A.C ka temperature kam kr diya! To question mera yeh hai ki.... "jis instant par tumne button press kiya,us instant pr REMOTE..REMOTE ka temperature increase hoga ya decrease????!!!!" I will add some more incidents later.
