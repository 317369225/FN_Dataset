What bad programming/architecture habits can a self-taught PHP coder develop?..and how to get rid of them?
Adding to Kartik's very deep answers already. Having to live with the day to day repercussions of a dreadfully bad choice of using PHP for App / Game Server and Web Server programming, here are the things that I can attribute to PHP programmers (an oxymoron). Most of the issues I have put in here are the ones we face on a day to day basis: - Abusing the global scope variables mercilessly and then referring them inside functions using 'global' keyword. While at first this creates a spaghetti piece of workable code, this very easily grows into a morass of unmaintainable monstrosity. - Not declaring the arrays beforehand and then scratching the head to find out why a variable $a[2][5] would not behave as expected. - Not putting enough thought on using functions and classes and replicating code left right and center. - When using with MySQL, not storing a reference to the db link very quickly removes any hope of building a system of splitting writes and reads. - Not knowing when to use '' and when to use "". - Not using define() to create constants to workaround issues with not having enum. Using the global scope for defining globals, constants.
