Why was Lisp the language of choice for AI research?
Here is the real answer, the one that is factual. Back in 1959, when C was just a newish fad language and assembly has not yet been invented, and python was only just invented, then John McCarthy had to choose a language for his students to learn some new fad idea called Artificial Intelligence. McCarthy knew too well that the craze of this intelligence work was at best theoretical and at worst a waste of his students time, so he wanted to give them some real experience so they could get a job when they graduated. So he weighed up the benefits ofÂ  C and Lisp and python, and found that python wouldnt really take off as a professional language, C was quite good but pointers were too hard for students at a university level. So he thought Lisp would give them a language which was already used in the workplace like banks and aerospace institutions, so that would give them real world experience to learn with. So even thought AI was just a fad, they would get benefit from learning Lisp anyway, so thats why lisp was chosen over C and python for AI in the 1950's.
