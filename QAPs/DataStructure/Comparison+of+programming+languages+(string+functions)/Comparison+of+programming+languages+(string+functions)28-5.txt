What can be done with Ruby or Python that just can't be done with PHP?
I don't know why everyone has argued from a web standpoint when there's a glaringly obvious reason why you would use Ruby and Python over PHP: software. Ruby and python both are viable contenders for writing Mac applications because cocoa supports an API for them. Further, you can write native iOS applications in Ruby Motion. The fact that you can apply your knowledge with one language to more than one environment and scenario is superb. PHP has and still will for some time be dominant on the web, but that's only because of the devs that are stubborn and set in their ways. Progressive, modern and forward thinking devs are moving towards Ruby and Python and the largest of companies in tech are moving that way as well.
