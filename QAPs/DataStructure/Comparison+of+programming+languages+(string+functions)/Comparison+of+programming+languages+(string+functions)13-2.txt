What basic PHP/MySQL interview questions should I focus on?
What basic PHP/MYSQL implies is that with the scripting language PHP and database MYSQL to hold data you can easily create a dynamic page, if you know what I mean. You should be able to perform operations like Connect to database. Dynamically insert data into the database. Retrieve data from database perform operations on the retrieved data like       echoing it or something more advanced. The second question in  which you don't know from memory the codes, what you need to do is, you need to be more able try things out on your own i,e task your self like trying out tutorials, ideas that comes to the mind these are some of the basic things that makes one remember (CONSTANT PRACTICE). if you do this before then it might not be an issue but it also depends on if the the interviewer is not really concerned with weather you know it from memory or not you cant really say but still just try to know somethings.
