What are the top ten things a beginner must know about JavaScript?
I can't name ten things. But here is one, something that beginners probably aren't fully, consciously aware of: JavaScript is single-threaded (until you use Web Workers, but even then, Web Workers have no access to your normal JavaScript global scope, and messages are pumped by the "normal" JavaScript's single thread). What does this mean? This means that, if you start an XMLHttpRequest, and then start another function foo(), you don't have to worry about the success or error callback of the XMLHttpRequest defiling variables while foo() is still executing. That's because while foo() is executing, the interpreter is not free, and any async callback (including AJAX success/error, setTimeout, setInterval, and anything else I'm missing) doesn't get to run until foo() is finished and the interpreter is free again.
