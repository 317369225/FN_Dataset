What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
Originally Answered: What is the difference between a compiler and the interpreter?A compiler is a program that takes a computer program, written in some human readable programming language, and generate a machine readable version that can be executed by a computer. An interpreter is a program that takes human readable code, or optionally simple instructions, and executes the necessary actions as it reads and interprets the code. Compilers convert code in one language into other that can be directly executed by the computer. One can compile a program once and execute the machine code indefinitely after. On the other hand, interpreters read the original code to execute the actions every time the program runs. As a result, compiled programs usually run faster, but require the step of compilation before the first execution.
