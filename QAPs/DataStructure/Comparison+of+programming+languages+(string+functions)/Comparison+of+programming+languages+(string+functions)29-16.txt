How do you judge a JavaScript programmer by only 5 questions?
I generally go through some sort of applied exercise where I ask you to solve a real problem, but through that I'm going to try to tease out knowledge about JavaScript fundamentals, including but not limited to (and in no particular order): Code reuse in JavaScript. If you read between the lines, I'm not calling out simulating classes in particular, because there are other, often more flexible ways of achieving code reuse, like mix-in, function composition, or in cases where it's appropriate, inheritance, either prototypal or classical. Asynchrony, and ways to manage its ballooning complexity (largely Promises). Context binding. Functional programming, or at least some understanding of building higher-order functions. Variable scope. Simple and old question, but I'm continuously amazed at how few people understand it.Often most of these can be hit in two questions, one applied example of building a UI widget that makes asynchronous requests to a JSON endpoint, and another more abstract example like simulating a class, or inheriting from another object.
