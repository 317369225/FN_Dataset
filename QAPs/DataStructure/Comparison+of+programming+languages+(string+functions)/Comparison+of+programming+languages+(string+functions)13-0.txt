What basic PHP/MySQL interview questions should I focus on?
For starters, make sure you can write basic/moderately difficult SQL queries. Articles like A Visual Explanation of SQL Joins could go a long ways with helping you out here. I think that'll be the biggest concern. As for the PHP side, you'll probably be fine with knowing the basic syntax along with some of PHP's quirks. This [1] question on Stack Overflow should be able to help you out, but based the description of the test being basic it could even be overkill (but hey, knowing the material in that question will make you a better developer!). Hopefully this helps, and good luck with your test/interview! [1] http://stackoverflow.com/questio...
