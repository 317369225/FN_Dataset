How do you judge a JavaScript programmer by only 5 questions?
Here is a list of questions that will enable you to have a good discussion with the programmer. 1. What are the ways to achieve cross domain ajax calls? This will generally give you a idea of how long the programmer has been familiar with JavaScript. If he only mentions CORS , he is probably new to javascript. 2. How would you improve the performance of a page with heavy DOM manipulation? This should give you an idea of whether the he has done anything beyond using standard plugins. 3. Explain any name spacing pattern you have followed. Will test his understanding of scopes . 4.Why are javascript files concatenated  for production and what could be the potential problems ? 5.  == vs === ? Just to troll him
