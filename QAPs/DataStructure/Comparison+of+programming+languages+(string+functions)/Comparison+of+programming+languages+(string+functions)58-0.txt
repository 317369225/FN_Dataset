How do iOS developers feel about Swift, Apple's new programming language?
So far, I've spoken to only one iOS or Mac developer who's not very enthusiastic about it—and he's an OpenGL guy, so he mostly writes against C APIs. Everyone else I've talked to is excited to try it out, curious about how it will improve their working lives, and eager to get their few complaints addressed by Apple's compiler team before the language reaches 1.0. I know of at least two groups in my area that are forming to study and learn it. There are already over 800 Swift projects on GitHub—most are example projects, of course, but that's still quite a lot for a language that was announced just over a week ago. I doubt a new programming language has ever been adopted this quickly or enthusiastically. Swift is going to be huge.
