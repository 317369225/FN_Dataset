Which is a more difficult programming language to learn, Java or JavaScript?
I think JavaScript is easier for the novice programmer to get things done quickly due to it's forgiving syntax and quick code, run, debug cycle in the browser. After you've become an effective novice, I think Java will help you develop your skills more quickly due to it's stricter syntax requirements and simpler implementation of object oriented programming vs prototyping and encapsulation in JavaScript. Java's syntax requirements help enforce good practices (that can mostly be applied to JavaScript as well). Mastering either JavaScript or Java is a difficult task. While many of the principles and practices that you employ will apply equally to both languages, each language also has specific features and quirks that you need to learn in order to really comprehend the impact and effect of the code that you write.
