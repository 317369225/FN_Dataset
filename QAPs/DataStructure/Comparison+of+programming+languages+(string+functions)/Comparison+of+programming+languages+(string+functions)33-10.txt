What are the top ten things a beginner must know about JavaScript?
Top 1 thing would be, "Javascript is the only language which people dare to use before learning" You should never be in this group of people. There is lot more than alert and document.write 2. Primitive types [string, number, boolean, undefined] are passed by value and the rest [of them are objects including functions] are passed by reference 3. undefined != false and undefined != '' Seriously? Even after ignoring type? [Note: === and !== is used for Type checking] 4. Scope function a () { console.log(test); var test = 10; } a(); //OP: undefined //How Come? Why not a reference error? function a () { var a = 10; return function () { console.log(typeof a, typeof b) }; } function c() { var b = "hello", d = a(); d(); } c(); //OP: number undefined //How Come? Why not a number string? 5. Strings are immutable function a() { var a = "hello"; console.log(a[0]); a[0] = 't'; console.log(a); } a(); //OP: h hello //How Come? Why not h and tello? 6. Default and Guard operators function a() { var a = 10 || "hello", b = '' || 10, c = 10 && "hello"; console.log(a, b, c); } a(); //OP: 10 10 hello //How Come? Why not true true true? 7. for..in over an array object different from for i = 0 to i < array.length 8. Prototypal Inheritence? 9. How to define a function, method and a class and why are they first class objects? 10. Javascript is fast enough; you don't need to micro optimize :) As a reference It's all abt Tamil I'm linking my site. This is a series of blog posts on javascript which depicts my learning through JS from a beginner to my current level. The posts are sorted based on recency. More older the post, more beginnerish the topic is :)
