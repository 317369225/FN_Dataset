What can be done with Ruby or Python that just can't be done with PHP?
There's very little that cannot be done with PHP -- in fact it's not really an interesting question. The more interesting question asks what things can't be done in PHP elegantly? Or simply? Or safely? Or quickly? Or shouldn't have to be done at all? These types of questions form much more useful metrics by which to compare general purpose programming languages A good example of that last category btw is PHP's maddening tendency to output errors to the socket it's reading from. I realize that PHP was originally a templating language and that this may have made sense at one time, but having to prefix calls with @ to suppress otherwise important error messages because they go to stdout warps the mind just a bit.
