How do iOS developers feel about Swift, Apple's new programming language?
Well if you are an old developer you won't learn it, but with a young developer like me? The question is Swift look more friendly then Objective-C. No more open/close square bracket anymore, everything is look clean and clear. Not stop at that, Swift also provide lots of things that are featured and it look better than what ObjC can do. In long run, Swift will be main iOS development's programming language. But there's some stuff that I feel about it: Swift are familiar to languages such as C#, Ruby, Python. Not as same as ObjC. Now you can forget semicolon at the end of statement. Swift is safe programming language and easy to learn. Syntaxes is really easy for anymore even non-experience iOS developer. Lots of developer think Swift is faster than ObjC. No, it's not. Both use a same compiler Clang LLVM and target to Cocoa (Mac OS X) and Cocoa touch (iOS). How Swift can be faster even it is compiled as same as byte code as ObjC. That's the reason why, you can use both Swift + ObjC in a same project. Swift can call ObjC functions and so do ObjC. In Xcode 6, there's new type of file: Playground. You can create and discover what Swift is, how it work, what kind of thing Swift do and its mechanism. It's quite good for any developers can get use to new programming language. Swift offer type of inference. Like other language, Swift carries out type inference. Developer don't have to spend too much time for annotating variables. Swift has generic. All developers get familiar to generic, so that Swift support it handle what developer afraid about datatype. Swift support string handler quickly! You don't have to use [NSString stringWithFormat:...] as what you do in Objc. Just \(var a). Moreover, Swift also let you use "+=" to concatenate or use "==" in comparison. Quite helpful! The finally I like best of Swift is tuples. It help you group multiple element into a compound variable.
