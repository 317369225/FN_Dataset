What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
Originally Answered: What is the significant difference between a compiler and an interpreter?A low level Explanation would be.. Compiler takes your entire code breaks it down in smaller pieces of byte (returns intermediate Object Codes). It also checks object definitions. So, a Simple Java code compiles [code]  String a=10;              String b=a*"hello"; [/code] gives you a compiler error saying the two types are incompatible.  Now imagine what a Java Interpreter would do to the same code. It will assign variable a =10 but will give you an error when it finds that you're trying to multiply String which it doesn't know how to add. So that gives you an error in interpreter error. Bottom Line Compilers do an overview check of your entire code, which is good but they do it every time, even for a small change. Interpreters don't bother you with this initial inspections, they go line by line.
