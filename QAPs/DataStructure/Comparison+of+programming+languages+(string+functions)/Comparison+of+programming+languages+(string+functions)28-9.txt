What can be done with Ruby or Python that just can't be done with PHP?
I don't think you can write a DSL very easily with PHP. Because everything in Ruby is an object, and you can extend BasicObject to add new methods, you can create a DSL with Ruby, which you can't do very easily in either of the other two languages.
