What are the top ten things a beginner must know about JavaScript?
1. Silent web browser runtime fails. You need to have web developer tools installed to detect runtime errors. It just fails silently. Complicated applications need error handling code that adds to the bloat. 2. In the web browser, you need to know the DOM (Document Object Model) to make this useful or use a library to access DOM like JQuery. 3. The code is not complied. Source is downloaded to user's device for web browsers. 4. Can be minimized for optimization if needed. 5. All the source code is open for viewing by anyone. Keep your private security or process algorithms secure using server side code. 6. It is blocking. The web browser visual render by default is blocked by JS code running. There are some workarounds. 7. Runs in a sandbox for web browsers. You may get security errors if not testing using a web server;i.e., no http(s) protocol. You just do not have access to the user's machine. 8. Its not Java! 9. Fails if you use it for the web browser DOM but the DOM is not complete. In other words you need to assure the DOM objectÂ  you are writing code for is loaded. 10. Once you realize that the key to Javascript is its function object, your programming potential accelerates. You pass them around like hors d'oeuvres at a party.
