Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?Python has come up a long way in data analysis with its Scipy, Numpy and Pandas platforms. Is R still a better data analysis language than Python? Has anyone else used Python with Pandas to a large extent in data analysis projects?
Their both very capable and I use both, but I tend to use them for different purposes. Like any tool, it's best to select the tool most appropriate to the job. Python is more properly used for conventional programmatic activities, whereas R is more properly used for data munging and more statistically-oriented activities. A knowledgable person could probably write code in both languages to solve most tasks -- but differences in syntax, data structure, and libraries mean that some tasks are more naturally and succinctly expressed in one language over the other. I tend to write most statistical, data munging, and a lot of visualization code in R. It tend to write processes and automation tasks in Python, and certain types of database interactions. All of my NLP tasks are done in Python. I also still find Perl very useful for text data processing and ELT-type tasks, though I don't use Perl as much these days because a number of my co-workers are unfamiliar with it and it can be unfathomable without prior exposure.
