What are the top ten things a beginner must know about JavaScript?
I don't have time for 10 and I'm not really qualified to give such an in depth answer, but here are some things that really helped me: 1) There are so many good references, examples and support communities for JavaScript. Here are my favorites:     a. Stack Overflow     b. JavaScript     c. W3Schools Online Web Tutorials 2) Javascript source files never get compiled (compiling happens at runtime) and it's completely visible and alterable by users. Don't use JavaScript to store passwords or any private data, and make sure you keep in mind that people can see and change JavaScripts really easily. 3) Debugging is almost pleasant with JavaScript. One thing that makes me really happy is using the console in a web browser (Chrome is my favorite) to debug and prod at my projects while watching the results in the same window. You can mess with code and all objects in real time and even rewrite functions from the console in real time. You can also of course log things to the console within your scripts (i.e. "console.log"). 4) Javascript becomes really powerful when you learn to use it with other frameworks and languages like PHP (and AJAX stuff), WebSocket, MySQL, etc. For me, the most important duo has been JavaScript and PHP. That's all I've got time for ;) Updated 17 Dec 2014 • View Upvotes
