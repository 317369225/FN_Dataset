As a beginner, should I learn C or Python as my first programming language?
It depends on what you intend to do with the resulting skills. If you want to cobble together code that does something and have no reason to care about what is being done by the underlying hardware (and don't think it's odd that whitespace carries semantic information) then choose Python.  It's an easy and forgiving language, sort of the BASIC of the early 21st century and unless you're planning to do development where the behavior of the underlying hardware is of interest (OS development, embedded systems, possibly some HPC-ish stuff) it's a perfectly fine tool.  However, even if those conditions hold true one should at least consider learning C as people who don't at least give passing consideration to what is being asked of the underlying hardware often write bloated and inefficient code regardless of language; it's also the case that it's far easier for a competent C programmer to move to languages with higher levels of abstraction (like Scala or even Erlang) than it is for someone who starts out in an environment with high levels of abstraction to move to a language like C. There are some replies to this thread that suggest that Python is more readable or that it's somehow not possible to do OOP using C.  I argue that if one's C code is unreadable then one is either sloppy or doesn't know how to properly use the language and it's the case that OOP is possible in any language, even if said language lacks explicit semantics for type extension and inheritance.
