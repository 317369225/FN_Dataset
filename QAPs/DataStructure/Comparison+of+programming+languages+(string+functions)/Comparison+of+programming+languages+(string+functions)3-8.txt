PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
The simplest website listens on a TCP port, accepts a few well-formed characters, sends back a few well-formed characters, it's a really simple programming problem. Try it with Python Try it with Java Then you write the answer to your question :) And if your website is more complicated than that, then come back with a more detailed question as to what you need to know next.... P.S. The answer to the original question: python, any day of the week in my opinion...
