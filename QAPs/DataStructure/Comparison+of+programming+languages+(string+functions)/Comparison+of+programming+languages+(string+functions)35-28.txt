Why do many software engineers not like Java?
As simple the language is to learn, it's not a good language for people who are not deeply experienced with it to use, and it's not a great language for prototyping. Java is a very structured and mature language, and also over time ended up with a bad reputation from developers who didn't use it. Take a step back and really look at java, and it's true impact on technology and you will see that there are not as many developers as you think who dislike it, and I think that a lot of the younger generation kids who are developing now are just repeating what they've heard. There's a reason its the most used production compiled language of all time, and it just keeps growing.
