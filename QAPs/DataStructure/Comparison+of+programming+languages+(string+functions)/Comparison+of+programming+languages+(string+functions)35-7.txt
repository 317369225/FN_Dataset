Why do many software engineers not like Java?
I like Java the programming language. What I don't like is how it takes half a day to get my local development environment successfully running again after checking out a fresh copy of the codebase from source control (we've fixed this by the way). But that isn't the fault of the language, but the fault of the people (me included) who didn't take time to make that a simple process. I don't like the fact that to discover a typical Java web app, I have to open 5 folders (representing the package name) just to get to the code. I don't like not knowing definitively what library (jar) is being referenced, I've seen a jar pulled in via Ivy AND a different version of the same jar in the WEB-INF/lib folder. Unfortunately, all of these problems, admittedly caused by people as opposed to the programming language, seem to be the reason software engineers don't like Java.
