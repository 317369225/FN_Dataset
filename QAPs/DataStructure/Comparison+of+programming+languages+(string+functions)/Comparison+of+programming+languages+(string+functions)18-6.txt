As a starting Python programmer I see a lot of praise for the Python language (and so far I can only agree). Isn't there anything bad to say about it? What is a real con?
Python s fantastic in many ways.  It's very clean in many ways, and the huge number of modules make it a snap to do electrical engineering, Fourier transforms, data plotting, reading/writing excel spreadsheets, doing 2D and 3D graphics, and much more, with a very few lines.  But if there isn't a built-in feature or plug-in module and you have to write a complex and explicit loop to do something, it can be a bit slow.  What I do is google "How in Python can I swap rows and columns" and someone will very often have an answer of a built-in that will do the trick very quickly. As an example of a success then a failure, I needed to parse a huge 33 gigabyte text data file and collate the data.   It only took about 60 lines of Python to do all the work.  However it took many minutes to run, and it eventually used all 4 gigabytes of memory and hung. I had to rewrite the code in Delphi, and that program was more like 600 lines, but it ran about 10 times faster and used about 1/4 the memory. So Python is very good in many ways, it's just not a solution for every problem.
