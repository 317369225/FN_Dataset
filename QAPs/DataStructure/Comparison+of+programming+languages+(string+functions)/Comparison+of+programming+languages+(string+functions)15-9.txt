Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?Python has come up a long way in data analysis with its Scipy, Numpy and Pandas platforms. Is R still a better data analysis language than Python? Has anyone else used Python with Pandas to a large extent in data analysis projects?
Originally Answered: Which is better for a data scientist: Python or R?Have an idea of both but to be a data scientist I would suggest you to master Python especially the modules of Scikit-Leran, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scipy stats. You can try Ipython with Rmagic module installed. IPython is the best environment for working with python and with the help of rmagic you will be able to use R functions indise Ipython without any difficulty. You can see some nice examples using Ipython and Rmagic on ipython.org If you are concerned about better performance then Cython (A module for integrating python and C) can be a good solution. You can speed up your algorithms dramatically using simple tweaks of cython in your code. Updated 7 May 2014 â€¢ View Upvotes
