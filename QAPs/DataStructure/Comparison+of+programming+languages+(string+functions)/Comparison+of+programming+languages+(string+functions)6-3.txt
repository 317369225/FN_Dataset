As a beginner, should I learn C or Python as my first programming language?
My general rule would be to recommend Python, because I think the REPL (read-eval-print-loop, or "interpreter") is a great thing for a beginning programmer to try things out quickly.  Plus, it's a very good language. However, in your question details, you note that you're interested in looking under the hood.  I still think C is better as a second or third language than as a first language, but if you want to look under the hood, it's pretty hard to beat C, since your operating system is almost certainly in C (Windows, OSX, Linux...)  You can go lower yet (assembly) but C is better as it can be written to be portable.  (Python I note is also wonderfully portable.) The best thing would be to combine your pleasures, learning Python first, then C, because Python and C are pretty easy to integrate together.  I have always found that knowing C has given me opportunities other folks don't have.  Every so often one of the higher level languages can't do a low-level task, and they need me to write a DLL they can call out to.  I enjoy that kind of thing.   Oddly though I've never had to do it with Python, because it can go quite low level with the right libraries.  In the case of Python you'd probably integrate C only in cases where you've profiled your Python code and found a spot that needs to run faster, and C code properly written will typically run much faster.
