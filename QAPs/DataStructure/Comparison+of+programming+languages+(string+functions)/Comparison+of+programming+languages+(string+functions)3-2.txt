PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
Using Java to build a website is like using a chainsaw to perform surgery.  You are talking about a language that is tailor-made for heavy duty Web applications (i.e. distributed enterprise systems), not websites.  As some have already pointed out, languages like Node.js, PHP or Perl are better candidates for this comparison. Having said all that, some of the previous answers are also woefully misguided and show a lack of understanding of the question, and the technologies they are proponents of.  The question was "Which language was easier to learn," not "Which takes less lines of code to get a dynamic page up and running?" For example, Ardit stated that for Python, all you need to do is download the flask library and then write a few lines of code.  Ok, by that criteria, Java wins.  Just download Java's Spring Boot library and write ZERO lines of code.  Heck, even better, .NET wins hands down -- just open up Visual Studio and select a Web App project and you're done. But none of these "shortcuts" actually teach you the fundamentals of the language itself -- they are just libraries and frameworks that are built on top of the language. In short, use the right tools for the right job, and just as importantly, make sure you understand that learning a language and using one of its vast libraries to get up and running are two different things.
