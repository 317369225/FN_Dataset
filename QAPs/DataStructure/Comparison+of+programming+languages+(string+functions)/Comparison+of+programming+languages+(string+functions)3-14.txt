PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
Pointless question.  Java can't be run on client machines, requires a jvm, and is not used normally for websites.  Python can be used on the server side, but is pretty much pointless. To do a website you need first to understand html, then css, JavaScript, the DOM, and then some server side scripting like PHP. There is no particular reason to associate web sites with either Java or Python, and neither have any particular website features.
