Which have been some of the most funniest/craziest Vivas that you have appeared for at NSIT?
3rd Sem, Power apparatus viva Prof2 is sitting behind Prof1 listening to the viva. Prof1: "Jo ceiling fan hai, woh kitne phase ka hota hai?" *Looking up at the fan* Me: "Sir, Teen!" *Prof2 starts laughing hysteriously* Prof1: "Accha, tumhare ghar me toh bahut hawa aati hogi!" *Everybody starts laughing* Prof1: "Kaun padata hai tumko?" Me: "Sir, Prof2!" *Awkward silence* I managed to pass.
