What bad programming/architecture habits can a self-taught PHP coder develop?..and how to get rid of them?
I agree that bad habits are not specific to a certain language and one must try to learn and understand the key concepts of whichever language(s) and technologies they use so as to avoid them. One thing I have observed is that when using php, its really important how you choose your variable names. Not that its unimportant in other languages but because php is perfectly fine with something like - $language = array('php', 'java', 'python', 'erlang'); //some code here..... $language = 'java'; //some more code.. echo $language[3]; //output - a This makes spotting errors difficult. Using plurals for arrays would help to some extent and make the code easy to understand.
