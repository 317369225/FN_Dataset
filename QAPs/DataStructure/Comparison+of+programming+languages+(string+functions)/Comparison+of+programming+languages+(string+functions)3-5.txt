PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
Python. Let me make a website for you. from flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/') def home(): return "Website content goes here." if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(debug=True) That's it. Put that code inside a .py file, run it and go to localhost:5000 in your browser, and you should see a basic webpage. Make sure you have installed the flask library first. Typing pip install flask in the command line should install it.
