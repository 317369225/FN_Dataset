Programming Languages: Which are the most used programming paradigms? Which are good coding examples?
OOP (Object Oriented Programming) makes everything keep state, and things happen when state changing. It is mainly about how to do, the imperative way. Functional Programming makes every step looks like flow, and data transforms from one to another then get a expected result. It just concerns what to do, the declarative way. Mainly deferences between these two paradigms are the ways about analysing. OOP is more about behaviour, and encapsulates details, to make things look simple. FP is more about flow, and keeps things working in pipeline-like procedure. Actually you can just leave it and try C++/Scala/F#/OCaml, for they have everything in themselves. XD
