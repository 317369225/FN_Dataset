What can be done with Ruby or Python that just can't be done with PHP?
Strictly speaking, nothing, they're all Turing-complete languages.  A better question might be, what is easier to do in Python, or why would Python be a better language to choose.  Of course Python can do one thing that PHP can't, make me enjoy programming. Updated 17 Aug 2011 • View Upvotes
