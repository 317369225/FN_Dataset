What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
Originally Answered: What is the main difference between compiler and interpreter?The compiler converts your source code into an executable program, which you have to run separately. The interpreter, on the other hand, directly executes the source code you feed it. Of course, I have left out a lot of details, such as that the interpreter may convert source into another 'intermediate' code & execute it, etc. The compiler also can convert many sources to object codes and these are combined by a 'linker' to make the run-able program, etc.
