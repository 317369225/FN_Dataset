How do iOS developers feel about Swift, Apple's new programming language?
A lot of developers haven’t used Swift yet, so the current perception of the language is not necessarily reflective of the language itself, rather just the current understanding/grasp of it. There is also a  perception that Swift is easier than Obj C, and yes while the code is more readable - you can do in 1 line what may have taken 6 lines before- that has nothing to do with it being dumber, it’s actually smarter. Under the hood, it’s doing the exact same thing. Whether we write in Swift or Obj C, the compiler is essentially translating it into the same thing - the debate around Swift is more about how developers like to express themselves, than anything else. Swift enables more people to begin programming: it's easier for people coming from different languages, you don’t have to worry about type as much, got rid of reference counting, you don’t have to think about pointers or memory management. So it’s a lot easier in the sense that you don’t have to worry about that overhead in the same way you do in Obj C. However, some developer’s don’t find that Swift offers enough new tools or features to justify the shift in language, and that the conciseness of the type actually limits their ability to express themselves. But again, this is a very new language, and as developers continue to use / experiment in Swift, we will get a better grasp of the language itself.
