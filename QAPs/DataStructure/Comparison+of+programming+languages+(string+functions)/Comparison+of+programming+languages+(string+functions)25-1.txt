Why are Java 8 lambda expressions regarded as a big change in the Java programming language?
The best explanation I've seen of this is from the JavaOne 2013 technical key-note with Mark Reinhold (Java chief architect) and Brian Goetz (the Lamda project lead). See the video here: Page on oracle.com Among other things, they discuss the changes to interfaces that allow interface evolution, the new method data type in Java, as well as syntax changes that support the lambda expressions. It's a pretty cool video -- when you have some time, watch it all the way through for some good chess moves!!! For the sake of full disclosure, I work at Oracle.
