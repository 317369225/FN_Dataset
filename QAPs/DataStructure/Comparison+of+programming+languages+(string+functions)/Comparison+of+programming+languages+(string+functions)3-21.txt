PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
both java and python are easy programming languages but java platform as a ecosystem is a more complicated there are plenty of frameworks on top java, you can make a website in java in hundreds of different architectures and just choosing which one to go normally takes month for a project. in python you have less choice and it makes it easier to learn the platform. let me give you an example if you are using java with a proper JSF tool you won't even need to learn java, making a web site will become drag and drop of components.
