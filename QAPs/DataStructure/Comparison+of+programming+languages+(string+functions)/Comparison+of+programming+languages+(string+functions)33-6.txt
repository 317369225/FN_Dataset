What are the top ten things a beginner must know about JavaScript?
In no particular order: "this" resolves to the instance that called the function, not necessarily the object the function is defined in. Closures can access the values from the function they are defined in. Scopes are bounded by functions, not code blocks. Variables can be defined implictly in non-strict (default) mode. You can attach functions and properties to objects ad hoc. Function arguments are optional. Functions are objects too. (x == false) evaluates to true when x is 0, but not when x is null or undefined, but (!x) evaluates to true when x is 0, null or undefined. Strict mode will throw exceptions instead of allowing silent failures - use it. The debugger is your friend.
