Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?Python has come up a long way in data analysis with its Scipy, Numpy and Pandas platforms. Is R still a better data analysis language than Python? Has anyone else used Python with Pandas to a large extent in data analysis projects?
This is a contentious issue. For what it's worth, an article in Nature has recommended Python for scientific programming and data science: http://www.nature.com/news/progr... Personally, I do not know R. I have used Python extensively to know that it is good for prototyping and data science but its dynamic typing and lack of multithreading make it less than ideal for production code.
