PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
The language is not important. Pick the one you like, but don't reinvent the wheel. If you want Java, go and learn a framework called Play. If you want Python, go and learn a framework called Django. If you want Ruby, go and learn a framework called Rails. If you want to use PHP, go and learn a framework called Laravel. Etc, and the list goes on. And there are more frameworks based in these and other languages. Just pick one. I like Django, but's just because it has a cool name. At a beginner level, they all do exactly the same, and they all have nice tutorials for you to start working.
