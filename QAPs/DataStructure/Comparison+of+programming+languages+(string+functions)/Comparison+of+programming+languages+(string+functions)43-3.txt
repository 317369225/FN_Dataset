How did Richard Wagner change the face of music?
Originally Answered: How has Richard Wagner influenced the current musical landscape of of our time and in what way is this influence seen? Examples of contemporary composers or bands/genres/songs would be great.A quick answer: I'd have to say the idea of the leitmotif is fundamental to modern film music. Every Star Wars character has their own theme music. In commercials, jingles are very closely affiliated with their product. Wagner added extramusical elements to his music, and this technique happens now more than ever.
