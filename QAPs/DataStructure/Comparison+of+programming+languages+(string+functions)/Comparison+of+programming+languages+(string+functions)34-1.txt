Originally Answered: What is much better: Java or PHP?As other people noted, you are comparing apples and oranges. If you are looking at java servlet/applet, then I personally think, even as a Java programmer, their time has passed. Especially applets. Look at Javascript (nothing to do with Java) and Node.js for the backend network and server processing as a replacement for Java applets. I don't have much experience or knowledge of PHP, but it is mostly used to make websites dynamic. Newer technologies are taking over the older ones. If you are interested in web app development consider: Ruby (on the rails framework), Angular.js (Google's programming language), GO, and even Python.
