What are the top ten things a beginner must know about JavaScript?
A beginner as in you've never done any programming before?  I'll assume that is what you mean. 1) You need to get an introduction to the language.  Go to codecadmey.com and learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 2) === (threequals) is for comparison.  !== means "does NOT equal" and = is for setting a value.  So: var apples = "oranges"; means "I want the variable named apples to now have the string value of "oranges." if (apples === "oranges") means to compare the value of the apples variable.  if(apples !== "oranges") will be true if apples is equal to anything BUT "oranges."  3) Write small functions.  There's this thing called the Single Responsibility Principal.  That means each function has one job and one job only.  4) jQuery is your friend.  Once you've got a good grasp of basic loops, arrays, if/else statements and the like, learn jQuery.  You can pick it up at codecademy as well and you'll be amazed at how powerful it is.  5) Build some more stuff.  You can't learn without building. 6) Once you've got a solid command of the basics and jQuery, start adding structure to your code.  BackboneJS and AngularJS are good frameworks for this.  Angular is a red hot framework right now.  7) Once you've got Angular down, you'll need to learn NodeJS and some sort of database, probably MongoDB. 8) While you're doing that, you might as well learn the rest of the MEAN stack.  MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS.  With that, you'll be a full stack developer using JavaScript.  Build a couple of non-trivial applications in that stack, and then go find a high paying job.  9) Now you can get into JavaScript ninja status.  People start chasing that way to soon in my opinion.  First learn to build cool stuff, then worry about how good you look while building it.  Read Douglas Crockford, read Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja.  10) Keep building.  That's the only way to master your craft.
