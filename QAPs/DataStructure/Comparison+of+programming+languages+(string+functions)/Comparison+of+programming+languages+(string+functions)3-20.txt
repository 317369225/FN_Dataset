PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
Python, without a doubt. I'm a computer science minor, and after spending over an hour just trying to get Java up and running on my computer to work along with my textbook, I couldn't even figure it out. Java is only good for organizing very large code bases, while Python is far and away one of the most straight-forward, simple-to-learn languages out there, while still being quite capable to do nearly everything you could want.
