What does a program written in a programming language without lexical scoping look like?Please include actual code examples.
The only languages I'm aware of without lexical scoping are: Original versions of BASIC INTERCAL I presume that some of the other joke languages (that followed Intercal) also don't have lexical scoping. When trying to imagine a language without lexical scoping, I can only imagine a language with ONLY global (or at least compilation-unit/file scoping) AND without parameters on subroutines or functions (or methods.)Â  Even most assemblers allow for some form of lexical scoping.
