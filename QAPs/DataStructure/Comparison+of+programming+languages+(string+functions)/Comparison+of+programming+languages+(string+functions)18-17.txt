As a starting Python programmer I see a lot of praise for the Python language (and so far I can only agree). Isn't there anything bad to say about it? What is a real con?
"Batteries included." That's Python's motto. Python is hands down the best language to mix and match stock libraries to do real world work with very concise and readable code. Alan Deikman hit the nail in the head when he compared Python to Bash. Python (for me) is Bash scripting taken to new heights. This means I can react to the boss and give him whatever he needs now in no time. But that's scripting. While I make no claim about being a software engineer, I did find it became exponentially harder to write Python code as I started building more complex software that needed maintenance. And I'm not even comparing Python to low level languages. My only comparison is JavaScript. I found that writing server-side code has been easier with Node.js than it was to write for Django. And it seems faster too.
