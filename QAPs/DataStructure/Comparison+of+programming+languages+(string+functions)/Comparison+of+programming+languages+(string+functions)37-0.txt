Mobile Applications: What's the most innovative app?(NB: mostly for Android here)

Why I feel it is innovative: 1. UI: It is designed meticulously and is impeccable. PS: I like its benzene shaped logo. 2. Concept: It has tons of categories to improve upon and also tracks your performance. Might prove helpful to students who are newbie in verbal or are preparing for exams like CAT and GRE. Edit : Lately, I am also fond of the app called Monument Valley. I simply love its design and concept. Here is the video : I still can not imagine, how the game was created. The amount of effort put into making one is just unimaginable. (Not only this game, every single game.) Their team has revealed this: Updated 21 Jan â€¢ View Upvotes
