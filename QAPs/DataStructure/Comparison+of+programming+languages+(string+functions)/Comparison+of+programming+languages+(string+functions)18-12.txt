As a starting Python programmer I see a lot of praise for the Python language (and so far I can only agree). Isn't there anything bad to say about it? What is a real con?
In my opinion, Python fails to bring anything new to the plate. It's disadvantage is that you can get a lot more power and expression from other languages that were more happy to incorporate new ideas (which often have their own disadvantage -- their ecosystems are rarely as developed as Python's). Python, and most Python code, seems to be written in an imperative style that doesn't differ much from code you'd see in C (that is, Python code tends to look like C pseudocode). Objects seem to be used for the sake of writing objects, and often seem to fail to take advantage of the OOP paradigm. At the end of the day, Python code is the same imperative code being written since the days of Algol. This also tends to be Python's strength -- if you come from most of the major languages, you get an expressive, yet easy to use language that you already know how to use.
