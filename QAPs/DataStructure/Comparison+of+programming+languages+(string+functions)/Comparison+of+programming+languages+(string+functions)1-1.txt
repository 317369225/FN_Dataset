Is PHP dead?What is the job outlook and future of PHP in the next 5 years?
Originally Answered: Is PHP dying with time?PHP is widely used today.  There are many applications written in php that are widely used today.  I do not see any sign of PHP being replaced in web and advertising agencies, for blogs, shops or simple CMSs.   Not only because of the large installed base, but also because of the recruiting problem: software developers are hard to find, especially ones who know Ruby or Pyhton well. it's a lot easier to find PHP developers. But let's assume that PHP will slowly be losing ground to Ruby and/or Python: even in 20 years there will still be PHP developers, because old programming languages NEVER DIE.  Even now there are people out there maintaining PL/1 or FORTRAN or COBOL code. The same will be true for PHP and Ruby and Python when they finally fall out of favor. Then again you could assume the really long term perspective and say: PHP dying with time, because we all are. In about 5 billion years our sun will die, I predict the end of PHP before that. Updated 19 Dec 2013 • View Upvotes
