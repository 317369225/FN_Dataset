PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
IMHO go for Python if you know something about Python. Look at some popular frameworks like DJango, Flask and many others emerging frameworks. Don't try to re-invent something look at available package if it's there use it but learn for sure. If you are new to programming then go for Ruby programming language with Ruby in Rails framework. Disclaimer: Currently I am developing a website usingÂ  DJango.
