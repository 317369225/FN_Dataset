What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
Your sister has a written a letter to your friend.(She kinda likes him) The problem is, your friend only speaks Mandarin and the letter is written in English. No problem, you speak Mandarin. Now, there are two options for passing the message to your friend. 1. You can translate the letter rewrite it in Mandarin and send it to your friend. 2. You can call your friend and translate the original letter on the go. Your friend is the computer, Mandarin is the machine language, your sister is the programmer, English is the programming language, and you are the compiler in the first option and the interpreter in the second.
