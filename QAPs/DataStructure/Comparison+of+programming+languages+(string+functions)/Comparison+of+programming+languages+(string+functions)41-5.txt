Why was Lisp the language of choice for AI research?
I think a lot of people are talking about what's great about Lisp now, but this does not seem to be the reason why Lisp was associated with AI historically. Lisp encapsulates the "symbol manipulation" view of how the mind works. While Fortran and systems languages like C were good with numbers and bytes, respectively, Lisp was good with lists and relationships of string-like symbols. This was one of the views of how the mind works that was current at the dawn of computing. This view has fallen out of favor as too simplistic. That is, yes, our minds deal with symbols, but that's the very top layer. So "good old fashioned AI" was able to get some impressive results like Eliza and game playing, but then it ran out of steam and over the past 20-30 years has been reforming itself around statistical methods, which are still going strong (e.g. Siri). Lisp was and is very good at this symbol manipulation stuff. It expresses the concepts much more naturally than a C-like or object oriented language.
