Mobile Applications: What's the most innovative app?(NB: mostly for Android here)
Augmented Reality always fascinates me. It is a new player in field of technology and has endless possibilities of it's uses and applications. Here are some of my favorite AR apps (Android) Anatomy 4DThis is one of the most outstanding app I've ever used. If you've never experienced AR, give this app a try. Though it is very limited to few ARs and might only be useful for students but it is fun and amusement for all. Also it will give idea of AR to newbies. LayarThis app is full of user-generated content. Easy to use and upload your own content. Even in relatively small town we can find plenty of information here. Layar review on TechRadar Compared to a lot of other free augmented reality apps, Layar is competently and attractively designed. Layar isn't perfect, but the detail offered, coupled with a confident  and well-designed interface, gives it a professional feel. Layar  demonstrates how augmented reality can help us every day, and feels like  the future of local information. AurasmaFantastic. This app is very underrated but it is amazing and funny at the same time. I found some teachers and educators on the internet who are using this app as a medium of teaching, and they are doing amazing. There are vast possibilities  to use this app and AR technology.
