As a beginner, should I learn C or Python as my first programming language?
Python is good for beginners because you can start doing fun stuff (GUI, games, animations, analysing data, scraping etc) with it almost straight away. C is more for guys with weird sense of fun. If you feel like coding in C makes you hate programming, go with Python. It is a good start to engage yourself in programming. But on the other hand, C will teach you lots and lots of useful stuff, you'll have to learn a lot about the internals of programming which will help you in the long run. Not worth doing if it will kill your passion for programming. Totally worth doing if you are really serious about becoming a professional.
