Why is C++ so complicated?
It's an odd comparison, if you think about it. The main difference between C++ & python/java is the "Target". What are you implementing them for? C++ is widely used to control performance, manage low level resources and a million other things that are needed to be managed within the memory and make it work with the real time response. C++ apps are powerful & fast, executed directly by the processor. Java/python are languages designed to be portable. They are Object Oriented natively. It's easier to code in java but it doesn't offer that much versatility when compared to C/C++. More or less, it all comes down to one decision in the end, that whether you want to squeeze performance out of every cpu cycle or not.
