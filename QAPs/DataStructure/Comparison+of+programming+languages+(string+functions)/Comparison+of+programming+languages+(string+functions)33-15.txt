What are the top ten things a beginner must know about JavaScript?
For a beginner the top 10 things are: 1. JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford . . . 10. JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford Just keep in mind, the recommendation is for beginner only, and it is my opinion strictly. When you start out with JavaScript, one of the main problems that you face is that everything seems to be scattered everywhere, artifacts in multiple forms and semantics,Â  and with no apparent correlation. Of the many different approaches of learning a computer programming language, two are - working down from a language reference, or working up from a computation or memory model (that is abstraction of the (virtual) machine or run-time). In JavaScript documentation in decent shape for both, language and run-time, are hard to come by. Above book is more like a language reference, something more in line like "The C Programming Language" by K&R or Java Language Reference, and it gives you a very good overview of the landscape. Finally as with learning to play a guitar, you learn to play a guitar by actually playing the guitar. You can only get so far by reading books about guitars. This holds true for all programming languages, this is particularly true with JavaScript because of the royal mess it is from a specification perspective. Get down to coding, coding and then coding something interesting. Regards.
