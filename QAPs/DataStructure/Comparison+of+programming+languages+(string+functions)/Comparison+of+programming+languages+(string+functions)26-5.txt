Prof to Student 1: You look familiar. Student 1: Huh? Prof: You look like a movie star. Student 1: (Really proudly) I do? Prof: Yes, he's really famous. (looking at me) Do you know who? Me: No sir. Student 2: Nahin sir. Student 3: No idea sir. Prof: Umm... I can't remember his name... He came in (mumbles)... Me, Student 1, 2, 3: :blank stare: Student 1 is positively beaming by now Prof: Oh! Now I remember. He is... Ashutosh Rana! Me, Student 2 and 3: Yes sir! Now we see the resemblance! He looks totally like Rana! Prof: That's it. Send the next group.
