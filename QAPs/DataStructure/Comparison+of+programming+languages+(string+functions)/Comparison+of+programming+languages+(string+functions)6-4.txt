As a beginner, should I learn C or Python as my first programming language?
Will have to disagree with many answers here to say that you should learn C first. I learned C first not so long ago and had to figure out how to do certain thingsÂ  (remember Stacks and Linked Lists anyone?) that often has me thinking on the lower-level side even as a C# developer nowadays (I'm always like "this [insert syntactic sugar] is amazing" but then there's a voice that says "...but is it expensive? Worth it?"). The problem with this is that you might have to work on your modern code design skills (OOP stuff) but that's something you will learn reading conventions and other people's code. Joel on Software <- Here is an article by Joel Spolsky more than a decade ago advocating C for Computer Science classes against other higher-level languages like Java: "If you want to teach somebody something well, you have to start at the lowest level." He would go on to co-found Stack Overflow which a lot of programmers are familiar with.
