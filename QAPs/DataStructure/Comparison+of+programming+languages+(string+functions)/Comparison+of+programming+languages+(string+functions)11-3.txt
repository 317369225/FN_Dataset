How should a Computer Science student at VIT University prepare for placement Interviews?
Keep Calm and Read Sumita Arora's book on C++(for class 12th). It'll clear all your doubts which you may have faced during the PAT Training. Even if you are not very good at programming, learn to do basic programming.(If-else-switch-loop,etc).Refer your CPPS Lab record for revision. Keep revising 'Pointers', a lot of companies ask technical questions from Pointers. Be really good at your problem solving skills. You should know what you're doing in your code. Regarding aptitude, the placement training is enough for preparation. If you want, you can join any CAT classes for better preparation. It helps! Be confident in Interviews, and ALWAYS tell the truth. If you don't know anything, admit it. When in some kind of conflict, take wise decisions. Hope it helps, and All the Best !
