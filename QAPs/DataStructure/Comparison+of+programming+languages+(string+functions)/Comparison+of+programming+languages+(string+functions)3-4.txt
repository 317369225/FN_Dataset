PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
Of course, the answer is (unanimously) Python. However, after working in the field of webpage generation for a while, I would highly suggest using the framework known as Flask (A Python Microframework).Â  You'll be able to make a website in ~8 lines of code. However, what I've mentioned above is only for someone attempting to put together a website in the interest of time. Learning Java and implementing it will be harder, but it will do you good if you use Java for a corporate or enterprise application. Most all of the corporate applications I've seen are programmed in Java, so it's definitely up to you & a choice that must be based on what you want to build. TL;DR Java is the way to go for professional and high-customization web generation, but Python should be optimal in the interest of time / ease of creation.
