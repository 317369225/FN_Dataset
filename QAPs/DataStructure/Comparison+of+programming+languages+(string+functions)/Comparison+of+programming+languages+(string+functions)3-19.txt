PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
I have been through this process about ten times. Why?  Because I always want to learn something new.  I try to shoehorn these languages (and others) into what I want.  It won't work. Ok.  So you have to decided why you chose these two languages.  There are umpteen languages out there.  Is it for job knowledge?  Just learning something new?  What is it?  I can assure you that Java will be painful.  Python will work, but you really need to understand WSGI and what's going on.  If you don't you'll just be copying and pasting and watching magic. But, in general, all things being equal, it is somewhat easier to get going with Python than Java.  I know, I know, someone will post a one liner with Spring.  I decided to go against the big boys that look down on you and chose PHP for a lot of stuff.  It was quick and made for the web.  I have found engineering is much more fun than learning a language.  Infrastructure.  I think they both have a lot of magic.  I don't like magic, and I don't like all the magic PHP functions either.
