What can be done with Ruby or Python that just can't be done with PHP?
Largely because of roots as a web scripting language, PHP was suited for creating and throwing away processes after a short time. It's a bit trickier to write long lived applications (like servers or daemons) and things that need multithreading in PHP than it is in Python for example. PHP 5.3 is much better in this regard than previous incarnations but it feels like other languages were designed with these things in mind from the ground up. If you are looking to do anything that requires efficient memory management you probably should go with python over php. Also if your problem is not even web oriented in the first place, php is an awkward solution compared to python for example
