Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?Python has come up a long way in data analysis with its Scipy, Numpy and Pandas platforms. Is R still a better data analysis language than Python? Has anyone else used Python with Pandas to a large extent in data analysis projects?
Originally Answered: Which is better for a data scientist: Python or R?Honestly, it doesn't matter. Both languages do the same data science tasks, although both have strong suits. Tech companies lean toward Python and universities lean toward R, for example, but most employers just want you to know something. Far more important than choosing the right one is getting very good at one. Build something, set up a GitHub portfolio, etc.
