What are the top ten things a beginner must know about JavaScript?
It was designed to be powerful, yet accessible to beginners. The window gives a global object to work in and to where you can point all variables and functions; Automatic semi-colon insertion (ASI), optional line breaks, and no white space rules allows for "sloppy" code; loose equality helps with basic conditionals without having to know all of the rules. It is not a toy. It is misunderstood because most colleges teach classical inheritance and static type languages such as C++ and Java - languages which JavaScript resembles in syntax only. It is a dynamically typed, interpreted language, with OOP capabilities. Most objects are mutable, including native objects. The dynamic types and object mutability and general lack of framework or convention requires greater programmer discipline. EDIT: As suggested by Baptiste Fontaine, I qualified mutable objects as "most". It used to be "all", but browsers have changed, for the better, disallowing you to indiscriminately edit native objects. Brendan Eich is the father of JavaScript. Douglas Crockford is the Godfather, who legitimized JavaScript with his book, "JavaScript - The Good Parts". The semantics and design are influenced by the Self and Scheme programming languages, although Brendan admits to "having HyperCard on the brain" during the original design. ECMAScript and JavaScript are the same thing. ECMAScript was so named because the ECMA organization was afraid of being sued by SUN for the name Java. The original idea for the name was Mocha, but Netscape was afraid of being sued by similarly named software. They decided to go with the unspecific name LiveScript, until a deal with SUN allowed them to use JavaScript and capitalize on Java's popularity. JavaScript and the HTML5 are not the same thing. HTML5 itself is more of a buzzword than a specification, as HTML is a "living standard" that constantly changes over time - but the W3C insists on a version. HTML5 is really a collection of APIs for JavaScript to communicate with, including: the DOM (Document Object Model), which allows for manipulation of node elements; the BOM (Browser Object Model), which allows access to the current document, location, history, frames and other browser-specific functionality; the CSSOM (Cascading Style Sheet Object Model) which gives access to the style sheets and rules. "this" is the hardest concept to learn in JavaScript. The concept was created so there could be objects and methods in JavaScript. "this" defaults to the global object (usually "window") which leads to many bugs as beginners attempt to create more advanced code. JavaScript has functional scope and closures, unlike many languages. JavaScript uses a lexical (or static) scope scheme, meaning that the scope is created and variables are bound when the code is deﬁned, not when executed. Closures are not bad, they are quite powerful, but given a bad name due to early Internet Explorer bugs in the garbage collection of DOM elements. Functions are literal data values that can be manipulated. They can be assigned to variables, properties of objects, the elements of an array, passed as arguments, or used as constructors for object instances The browser is a hostile coding environment. Loosely quoting Douglas Crockford, learning JavaScript and the DOM is only half the battle. Not only does your code need to work in Chrome and Firefox on your super-fast Mac Book Pro, it needs to work on an old PC with Windows XP and Internet Explorer 6, it needs to work on an Android, the iPhone, and  support various touch devices. JavaScript is single threaded. While not something that generally becomes an issue with beginners, it's interesting to note. Using an alert() dialog stops the thread execution, which you can see by placing alerts throughout your HTML page and seeing its different render states (placed at the very top, you will see the title in the tab and a blank page). Single threadedness is a very good idea as multiple threads is very difficult to manage and would inevitably lead to webpages crashing your computer. There is something called WebWorkers that allows you to access different threads and run code in parallel, so if there is something you really need threads for... you can still do it.The JavaScript  Programming Primer
