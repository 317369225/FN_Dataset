PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
Python is certainly easier to learn, whether for web app development or otherwise. Popular web frameworks in Python are Django, Flask, Bottle, Web2Py and many more. Several production web apps use Python, Quora being one of them. But Java is still the preferred choice when it comes to enterprise web applications. Several online banking applications, for example, are in Java. Java has several specifications and technologies that are not yet available in Python (for example, Enterprise Java Bean). If you learn these, you may find these skills to be in demand or be able to do certain things that you cannot do with Python. It is a matter of identifying your objective and choosing the appropriate path. Updated 25 Nov â€¢ View Upvotes
