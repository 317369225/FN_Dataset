What is the logic behind making military boot camps so intensive?Is it primarily the skill building required or is it also the sense of team it builds in the recruits since they have to go through "hell" together, or is it something else entirely?
A meaningful portion of the ritual is simply to test whether those signing up accept the total commitment required to succeed.  So much is at stake that the military can't afford to take people who don't really, really want to be there. At Navy OCS one of the DIs used to wave a Greyhound bus ticket in the face of anyone deemed to be putting forth insufficient effort at physical training, drill, whatever.  He would then loudly point out that any officer candidate who cared to could be sitting back home on the couch playing video games within a day.  Of course, the idea was unspeakably hateful to us, which is why we were there standing in the hot sun being berated by said DI in the first place.
