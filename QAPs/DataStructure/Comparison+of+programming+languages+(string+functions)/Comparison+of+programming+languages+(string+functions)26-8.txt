Which have been some of the most funniest/craziest Vivas that you have appeared for at NSIT?
And with the viva stories all over i shall tell you one of my friend. This story is of extreme wit and presence of mind both qualities actually absent in my friend. Scene 1: The day of Manufacturing workshop Viva. The faculty being none other than PRK sir. instead of making the name public of our beloved bhailog member i would name him X. The viva has started and the X arrives blank practically having no knowledge about anything in manufacturing. Thinking of as PRK sir might question him he would declare. *aise hi maar lo sir mazze kyun le rahe ho* Being allotted the welding workshop he took over half a burnt flux coated welding rod. Took help of a guy and quickly asked him to tell what all did he knew about flux rod. kept the rod into his pocket. Scene 2: He is now in face to face battle with the faculty. He plays his move while sitting gently places the flux rod from pocket to the table. And there you go PRK sir fell for the trap. PROF: accha toh jo ye flux rod rakhi hai table pe iske baare mein batao. X: *answers* leaves viva like a boss.
