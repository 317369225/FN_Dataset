What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
Originally Answered: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?Compiler takes an entire program as input, generates an intermediate object code before it is entirely converted. Interpreter on the other hand reads the program line by line, takes single instruction as input, and does not generate any intermediate object code. Compiler would need more memory, due to generation of intermediate object code, while interpreter would need much less. Also the entire program is compiled in one go, while for interpreter, the higher level program will always be translated into lower level machine language.
