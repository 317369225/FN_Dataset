What basic PHP/MySQL interview questions should I focus on?
Originally Answered: What are the typical interview questions for an entry-level PHP developer? And what do companies expect from an entry-level person initially?If I was looking to hire an entry level developer, I'd expect them to be able to: Use git to be able to checkout code from a repository and push their own changes back. I wouldn't mind if they used one of the tools both GitHub and Bitbucket offer to simplify this. Be able to write a simple application with a common framework that has a form submission with error checking and validation, saves to a database, and reads entries back out of the database coupled with some simple user authentication. An example like that is available for every framework in some way or other. If you can identify what you implemented directly from an example and then how you improved or expanded on it that would be an advantage and demonstrate learning capability and mindset. Been able to use composer and write a simple test with PHPUnit would be preferable. But honestly, I don't think there really are true entry level jobs, many people think of terms like "entry level" and junior positions not as a skill issue but a case of targeting younger candidates who don't have financial commitments and thus can be paid less and often people in that mindset neglect actually supporting their staff with training and mentoring they should be giving.
