Which is better, PHP or Java?Which language suits better for an early stage web company.
Hmm, this is actually an uncertain question. There are a lot of factors to determine whether a language is better than another.. and typically we would say for what kind of purpose, one language is better than another. So back to your question, if we are talking about building a web application quickly, PHP is definitely much better than Java. PHP has been proven to be a very successful language on Web development. There are a lot of web sites are built with PHP. On the contrast, Java is quite a general purpose language and are used in various fields, from enterprise IT systems, to GUI based applications, or even mobile applications(J2ME or Android). And it's especially successful in enterprise application fields.Â  And there are a large amount of tools to help application development/testing in Java. And the Java platform has actually evolved to be a very successful multi-language platform which can run many other languages (on top of JVM), like JRuby, Groovy, Scala, etc. I am not sure if I answered your question, but some factors about the two languages.
