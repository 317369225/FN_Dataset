As a starting Python programmer I see a lot of praise for the Python language (and so far I can only agree). Isn't there anything bad to say about it? What is a real con?
As a starting programmer, Python has an excellent track record as a first language. Once your programs grow past a page or two in length, you'll want to invest in an expressive, statically type-checked language (C# is a good mainstream example).Â  Some people devote their lives to dynamically typed languages, but the rest of us would rather the computer pointed out the obvious mistakes in our programs before we try to run them. If you really, really want to be productive and have fun, learn a decent functional programming language (either an ML variant such as F# -- or Haskell if you like laziness and the leading edge of language research). Whatever you do, don't take the OO cult too seriously :-)
