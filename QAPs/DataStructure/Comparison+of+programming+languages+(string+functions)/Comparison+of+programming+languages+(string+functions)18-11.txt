As a starting Python programmer I see a lot of praise for the Python language (and so far I can only agree). Isn't there anything bad to say about it? What is a real con?
The biggest headache I've had from Python is that it simply doesn't do well with CPU-bound operations.  The GIL prevents true parallel concurrency and Python does not take advantage of a multi-core architecture without quite a bit of optimization.  Profiling and optimizing memory is also a pain.  On the whole, most of the above issues you won't hit on most applications.  But when you do, your code becomes a hairy mess trying to adapt around Python's limitations.  That said, Python is mature enough and the community is active enough that there are already solutions out there for most of the basic problems you'll hit.  And when you understand how to handle them, you will find that Python is very versatile even with the limitations.
