Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?Python has come up a long way in data analysis with its Scipy, Numpy and Pandas platforms. Is R still a better data analysis language than Python? Has anyone else used Python with Pandas to a large extent in data analysis projects?
Originally Answered: Which is better for a data scientist: Python or R?Implied in your question is the connotation that the "other" is what the non-professional data scientists use. That just isn't true. Learn both. R is great for rapidly visualizing and has great data viz support. Python has great lib support for ml, data viz, etl and munging support and if you follow this weeks #pydata you'll see all that firsthand. Later you may find differences in terms of  performance  and production ready code. But not if you are just starting.  Both tools are rarely used in isolation and once you get into the ETL and batch portions of your data stack both are useful there too. If starting. Do some basic R data viz and basic models. Then go thru cleanup, viz and models in python. That gives you a lot of practice and feel for both. That's the path I took. But both are used by professionals I can assure you :)
