PHP (programming language): For building a website, which programming language is easier to learn: Python or Java?
I'm happy to weigh in on the "Python or Java" debate but I think that misses the point. Since your goal, as stated, is building websites, you can often get by without learning a programming language at all. Drupal and WordPress allow you to build websites in a modular fashion where the main skill set you need is information architecture, not programming. If the features you want are not available as plugins, you may have to learn some PHP. And of course, these turnkey solutions won't work in every case but for many websites, these tools are amazingly simple and powerful and a good place to start.
