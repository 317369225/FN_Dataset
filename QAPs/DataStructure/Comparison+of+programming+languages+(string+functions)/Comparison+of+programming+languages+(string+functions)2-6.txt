Why is C++ so complicated?
I think the complexity comes from the handles provided by C++ to you.  The list of languages you have provided for comparison are highly abstract at the user level. Most of the stuffs are done inside a library. Though now C++ has many library support, it is still not that abstract.  One advantage of this feature (yes, for me it is a feature) is that you need to know about the underlying principle of the library to use it properly in C++.  Using STL efficiently is not that easy.  Handles provided by C++ helps you write code in a highly customized way and helps to manipulate the system . Another reason of complexity comes from C++ being a multi-paradigm language.  But all those complexities pays of better when you design a highly complex and efficient system. A system which needs a better software (manageable, expendable  and robust) and also requires better memory and speed management.
