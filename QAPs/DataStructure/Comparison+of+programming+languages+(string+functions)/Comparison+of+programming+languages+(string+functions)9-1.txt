In comparison to Ruby, what is the role of object-oriented programming in JavaScript?Hope this makes sense. I'm looking to understand how JavaScript uses Object Oriented principles. Any insights would be appreciated....
It is hard to say which principles Javascript itself uses. In terms of things that can be built with Javascript, it is possible to follow several different schools of thought, although all will rely, at the base level, on linking objects to prototype objects (a.k.a. prototypal inheritance). If you want to use classical inheritance in Javascript, see:     Simulated Classes and Inheritance Ruby is built around classical inheritance. For simulating prototypal inheritance in Ruby, see:     An adventure in prototypes
