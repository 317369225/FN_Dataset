Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?Python has come up a long way in data analysis with its Scipy, Numpy and Pandas platforms. Is R still a better data analysis language than Python? Has anyone else used Python with Pandas to a large extent in data analysis projects?
Originally Answered: Which is better for a data scientist: Python or R?If you want to be "a professional data scientist", neither R nor Python are sufficient.  In the case of Python, it's not Python, itself, that is the "real meat".  It's the vast set of libraries (long list at Python data tools just keep getting better) that make it sing.  The same could be said of R, though R, "out of the box" does useful work in this space. Beyond the tools, themselves, is learning which tool(s) to take out of the box for a particular problem.  That is, a data scientist is more than a technician with a toolbox, as a good finance person is more than a clerk with a ledger.
