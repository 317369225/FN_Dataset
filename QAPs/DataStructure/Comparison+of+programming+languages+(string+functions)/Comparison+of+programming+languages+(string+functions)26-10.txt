Which have been some of the most funniest/craziest Vivas that you have appeared for at NSIT?
Sir: Kya ata h? (what do you know?) Me: Thoda bhut sab padha hai. (I have read little bit about everything.) Sir: Placement kaha hui hai? (Where are you placed?) Me: Samsung R&D. Sir: Banglore me hai na ye? (Is it in Banglore?) Me: Yes Sir. Sir: Ok. Jao. (Okay! Go. ) Side by side, I was thinking "kuch pooch le saari raat jag kar padha hu is viva ke liye". (ask something, I have burnt mid night oil for this viva.)
