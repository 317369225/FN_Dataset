Why do many software engineers not like Java?
From my professional experience, engineers tend to dislike frameworks built on top of Java. The majority are horror abominations to get working. Notorious delivery of stress, loss of hair and frustration. On my personal dislike list one finds: - JBoss SEAM - Enterprise Java Beans - Google Web Toolkit - Spring framework However, Java on its core is wickedly reliable and fast. The technology which Java developers tend to defend and cherish is called "POJO". Acronym for "Plain Old Java Objects". Code written in POJO is the oldest form of Java and at the same time represents its future. Fortunately, bloated frameworks don't seem to last more than 5 to 10 years in average and slowly dive back into the mist.
