What should every programmer know about hash tables and hash functions?
1. Collisions are more frequent than what you think (see birthday paradox) 2. There are very simple and efficient ways to deal with collisions (Cuckoo Hashing, Hopscotch hashing) 3. A hash function has to be fast! (see FNV, Jenkins, Murmur) 4. There's always a way to solve the problem you are having with your hash table :) 689 Views Â· 2 Upvotes
