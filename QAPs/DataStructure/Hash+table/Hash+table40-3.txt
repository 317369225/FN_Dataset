How is the size of a hash table determined? How should optimization be done for it to be fast?
It's a tuning parameter - it depends what you're trying to optimize and what resources you have or are willing to commit but thinking performance will be proportional to average collision chain length is the right thing to be managing. Â  I don't know what your application is but assuming you optimize collision handling 3-4 chains will be blisteringly fast on any modern laptop (up). If you're on a phone or smaller device you might find this is more of a size/speed trade-off. It's a common myth for this kind of hash-table that you should pick a prime number but because your hash value has a... (more)
