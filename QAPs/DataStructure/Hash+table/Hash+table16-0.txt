What is the time complexity of hash table O(1)?
Yes, the time complexity of insertion into and removal from a hash table is O(1). BUT The hash table should be well-implemented, or the efficiency can be compromised This analysis does not count the amount of time that it takes to compute the hash function itself. For strings, it typically requires O(k) to calculate the hash value, where k is the length of the string. Storing n strings in a hash table with total length m (potentially much larger than n) takes O(m) time, not O(n), because a hash value needs to be computed for all the strings. Finally, if the hash table does not have a fixed s... (more)
