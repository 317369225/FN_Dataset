What would be the hash function / shuffling function ? 3. What would be the size of the hash table , or rather will the hash table grow dynamically or statically ? 4. What would be the type of hashing needed based on ease of implementation , hash table collision rate accepted,Â  time available , complexity ? 5. Ability to scale for high number of operation on your database 6. Would there be a nee... (more)
