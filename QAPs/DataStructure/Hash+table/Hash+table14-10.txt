Why do hash tables need to store the key of a record?
Because most hashing functions aren't perfect. You're most likely to end up with a hash function that maps several of your keys to the same location in the data array, given a large enough data set. This is called collision. This is resolved by storing multiple HashTable items in a linked list, which is hashed to the same location in your primary array. Now, while the lookup is performed, more than a single key is likely to hash to the same location in your data array, and you have multiple value elements to choose from, to return to the client. This is where your key, comes in. If you stor... (more)
