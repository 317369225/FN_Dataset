Can a hash table be implemented using an array?
Certainly ... as an array of linked-lists, the dimension of that array is the range of the hash values. You convert the key value to a hash value using your hash function (which could be as simple as modulo the dimension of the array), use that hash value to directly index into the array to get the first element in the hash bucket for that hash value, follow the next pointer in the linked-list to get the next element in the hash bucket, comparing the key value against the value stored in each element in the hash bucket until you get an exact match. 324 Views
