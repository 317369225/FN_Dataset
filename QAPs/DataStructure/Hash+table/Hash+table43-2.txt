How do you create a hash table of linked lists in C?
Hashing, using an array and a linked list, is possible, not sure of the case where we could  do it , solely  using linked list. It would be rather in-efficient to use simply a linked list to hash a universe [ traversal/search  - theta(n) ] . Well, we can have a hashing function for the universe of the keys, and can hash  them according to the function. In case of collision , we could  use a linked list, to save the colliding values to the same slot as calculated by the hash function. One example of such hashing is Open-hashing. 2.1k Views · 6 Upvotes
