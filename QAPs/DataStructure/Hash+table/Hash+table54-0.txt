What are some bad uses of Python's dictionaries or Hash tables in general?
Imagine making a dictionary using a contiguous range of integers as keys.  References to it, in your code, would look like accesses to a list or an array.  However the performance characteristics and semantics would be those of a dictionary.  So this usage would not reserve ordering ... you'd have call sorted() on the keys every time you were attempting to use, or subsets of them, in order. So that would probably be the worst use of a Python dictionary.  (Actually if we think of a dictionary keyed on tuples to model a matrix, that's even worse). However a dictionary with integer keys migh... (more)
