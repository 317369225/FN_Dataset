Is a HashSet a set based on hash table or a hash table based on set?
A set is essentially a distinct list of objects in many programming languages. A Hashset is an implementation of set that essentially uses a hashing algorithm of values to do a quick check for equality before doing a more robust check. If you're familiar with hashing and hash table implementations, a bucket is created for hashes that holds a list. When you go to check for equality, you first find the bucket using your objects hash then do a normal value equality check over the list of objects to verify that the bucket does not contain the value. This allows for a big O constant lookup for t... (more)
