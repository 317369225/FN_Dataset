Why is a hash table faster than a for loop?
It may or it may not be faster. When you use a hash function you have to compute h(x) where x is your key then access the table and eventually do something else if your hashing scheme allows collisions as most do. Let’s ignore collisions for the reminder of this discussion. If the table is very small and the hash function is not very efficient and the key is very long it may happen that doing h(x) takes longer than just scanning the table linearly for the key. That’s why we have to be careful when designing hash functions, they need to be extremely fast. When using Big-O notation we also have t... (more)
