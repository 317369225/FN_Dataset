Why do hash tables need to store the key of a record?
The first problem is that you're not storing by the key, you're storing by the hash of the key. Your key could be a string, and we're going to figure out the hash of the string. Two strings can have the same hash, because there are more strings than there are integers. That means that if you don't store the keys, you can't tell the difference between hashtable["SomeString"] and hashtable["OtherStringThatUnfortunatelyHashesToTheSameValue"]. By storing the key, you can go to where you expect to find the first string and find the second string instead. You can skip that until youÂ  get the key ... (more)
