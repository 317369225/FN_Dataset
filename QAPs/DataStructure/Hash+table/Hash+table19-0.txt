What is the advantage of using hash tables?
Being able to lookup and insert data on the order of O(1) (in other words 1 operation), independent of the size of the data structure is the biggest reason. When data gets into the trillions all of those O(log n) overheads start adding up for various trees. Not everything is perfect in the hash world though. If your cost of operation is on par with the hash function, the O(1) and O(log n) will approach the same, especially when the base of the log is large. In main memory this is true, in a file it is not. How to handle collisions, and grow the table is another. You can offset the problem an... (more)
