How do I implement hash table and hash map in c++?
I've been asked to answer, so I will, but you haven't said why you want to implement them.Â  If one of my co-workers asked me this question I would say: Don't do it, the standard implementations are so well tested and are solid so there is no reason to do that at all. If instead you are just learning how hash tables and hash maps work in general, then it truly doesn't matter what language you use (with the caveat that you'd want to implement them derived from the standard container for the language and implement the standard OO generic iterators, for example, as unordered_map in C++ does, as a dictionary...
