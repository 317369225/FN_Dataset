How do distributed hash tables work?
In a distributed system there is always the need to have an efficient message exchange method between nodes. There is an approach based on DHT, i.e. distributed hash tables, a distributed data structure that allows to match keys with values. A DHT organizes nodes in a structured overlay allowing efficient routing toward the node having the smaller ID greater or equal than any given ID (the successor). DHTs have as the key the topic, they are distributed, but not repeated, i.e. they are equally partitioned among different nodes. To subscribe for messages having a given subject S it is necessary to calculate the hash HS of the subject find the node where there is the right DHT and route toward there the subscription. While flowing toward that node, leave routing information, useful when messages are sent back to subscribers. To publish a message with subject S it is necessary to calculate its hash, find the node with the DHT and while flowing to that node, follow back routes leaved in each node when subscription was made. Accessing DHTs requires a constant time, very efficient. DHT are implemented with several machines connected with an overlay network that can have cycles.
