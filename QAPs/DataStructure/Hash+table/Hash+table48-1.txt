What is the difference between an array and a hash table in a programming language?
Hash tables use arrays.  Arrays have an important property for hashing: you can access any element in a constant time if you know its index. You can use arrays for buckets.  Let's say you wanted you count up how many of each letter in a text, say, for designing something like Morse code.  You make an array with 26 entries (for the simple unaccented Roman alphabet).  Whenever you see a letter, you calculate the index and go to that entry in the array. Hash tables extend this for arbitrarily long keys.  You calculate a hash of the key and go to that index.  The problem is when multiple keys... (more)
