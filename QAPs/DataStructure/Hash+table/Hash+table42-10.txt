Why doesn't C also provide default implementations for linked lists, trees, hash tables, sorting, etc. like Java does?
Because Java the name applies to many things, in this particular case both to the language (including java.lang classes) as well as Java the Standard Edition library (that includes the java.util with those collections). Likewise the Enterprise Edition library includes a lot more code. So if you're comparing C the language with Java the language, there are some structures not present on C (proper Unicode Strings), but the collections is a library and I'm sure C also has their own equivalent. 333 Views
