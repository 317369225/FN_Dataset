What is the time complexity of hash table O(1)?
If referring to amortized (read average or usual case) complexity, then yes. The problem is usually that hash tables are not always perfect, and they may use more ancillary complexity than just storage and retrieval. E.g. if the hashing function calculates many of the positions in the same spot given the input data (hashing clashes), then the O(1) starts to creep closer to O(N). Also the hash function itself tends to be more complex than a simple comparison. Especially if working on string keys, the function would most probably have a complexity of its own relatedÂ  to the string lengths.... (more)
