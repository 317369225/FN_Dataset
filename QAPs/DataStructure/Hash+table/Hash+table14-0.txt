Why do hash tables need to store the key of a record?
A hash table isn't actually implemented as an array of values. It's implemented as an array of linked lists of (key, value) pairs. The simple explanation: Typically, when you implement a hash table, you don't actually store the value at the hash code itself. This would require a hash table as big as the max hash code. If you had hash codes as big as 2^31 - 1, you'd need a table that size. Not good. Instead, you create a much smaller hash table - much smaller than the max hash code size. For example, maybe it has 100 elements. The hash code no longer equals the index. It gets mapped to some ... (more)
