In which situation we should not use Hash table?
If you're doing something other than storing values at keys, a hash map is probably not right. You can find a better data structure suited to your task like a priority queue, heap, kd-tree... etc. If your keys are contiguous and you can just use an array, use an array. Don't store image pixels in a hash map! Hash maps can't perform certain operations efficiently like iterating through the keys in order. This also makes things like intersections and differences trickier. If you need a persistent data structure (ie an immutable map), you'll want to use a radix tree (trie) or search-tree based map instead. ... (more)
