What are the must know operations of hash table for every programmer?
As hash tables are an efficient way to implement a dictionary, I'd say that every programmer should know how to implement the dictionary operations using a hash table as the underlying representation: A dictionary is an abstract data type that permits access to data by content, not by index, so the common operations would be: Search(k): Searches the key k in the dictionary and returns its data element, if it exists. Insert(d): Inserts data element d in the dictionary. Delete(d): Deletes data element d from the dictionary. Additionally to that, in order to use a hash table implementation in any high level language I'd say it's important to know how to create a hash table with a given capacity (and optionally a load factor), and how to destroy a given hash table once it's not needed anymore. 1.7k Views Â· 5 Upvotes
