In which situation we should not use Hash table?
Here is an incomplete list: When the ability to look up any key is not required, another data structure is often more appropriate such as a linked list or a heap. Another option that is sometimes superior is to use a sorted array together with binary search. When the keys are integer in a small range, an array may be more efficient. Also when the values are booleans a bitvector is sometimes the right solution. If the hash table becomes full, it needs to be resized which uses temporary memory and a substantial amount of time. For real time applications, this can sometimes be resolved by hashes ... (more)
