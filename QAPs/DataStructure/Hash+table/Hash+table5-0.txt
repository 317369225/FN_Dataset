Are hash table caches optimized?
Hashing is one of the methods used in caching to locate pages in its vector table. Frequent entries, which are highly likely to be used in future, are hashed. To each data unit cached, there is an index associated with it. This index serves as a key, which is hashed in a hash table. Since the hash table is the most optimal method for searching, if space is not an issue, hashing is probably most efficient way to implement a cache. Cache is usually a small pool of memory, in MBs . Space is not usually the  bottleneck, because we are looking forward to hash only small amount of frequently used data, and fast to retrieve, rather than caching large amount of stale data, in which case it would be slower to search and retrieve. 509 Views · 3 Upvotes
