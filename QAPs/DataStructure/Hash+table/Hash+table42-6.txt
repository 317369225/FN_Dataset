Why doesn't C also provide default implementations for linked lists, trees, hash tables, sorting, etc. like Java does?
The C runtime model, ABI etc, make it extremely hard to build abstractions, and the first place you'll hit this is ownership of heap allocations. It becomes infinitely easier to design robust abstract data types when you have a real type system. Another answer mentioned generics—which are indispensable for any serious abstraction. Things get even simpler when you add garbage collection and lambdas. C just doesn't have the necessary equipment. 1.3k Views · 5 Upvotes
