What is the difference between HashSet, HashMap and hash table? How do they behave in a multi-threaded environment?
** Both HashTable and HashMap implements Map interface. Hashtable Hashtable is basically a data structure to retain values of key-value pair. It does not allow null for both key and value. It will throw NullPointerException. Hashtable does not maintain insertion order. The order is defined by the Hash function. So only use this if you do not need data in order. It is synchronized. It is slow. Only one thread can access in one time. HashTable rea thread safe. HashTable uses Enumerator to iterate through elements.... (more)
