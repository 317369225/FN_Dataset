In which situation we should not use Hash table?
I'll start out with when I use a Hash Table and then try to point out why I wouldn't use it as I go. My three main uses of a Hash Table are Dictionaries/Maps, Sets, and Switch-Statements. Some languages generate a hash table for a switch-statement and while others create a if...else...if chain. The strength of a Hash Table is that it cuts look-up times down to time complexity of O(1). This is great when dealing with a larger number of values. Dictionary/Map: Like I said, the O(1) time complexity is great for dealing with a large number of values. Yet, it's not as great when dealing with a sm... (more)
