Are all NoSQL databases based on a distributed hash table? If yes, then how do they handle range queries?
If you squint right most NoSQL dbs are basically key/value stores. The biggest difference is if the value is opaque (like Memcached, Riak) or structured (like MongoDB, HBase, Cassandra, Redis). However, just because they are key/value stores doesn't mean they cannot handle range queries. There are a number of ways this can be accomplished. Brute Force Riak, for instance, supports map reduce jobs over the entire database. If you wanted to query for all keys within a given range you could simply look at all the keys and check each one to see if it falls within that range. Range Partitioning... (more)
