How do hash tables store data?
I will assume that you know what an array is. But, if you don't, an array is a set of boxes that are numbered. I can put something in the boxes, then get it back by telling the program go get what is in box 5. This is known as direct addressing, and in the case of arrays, it takes a single operation due to the way RAM works. Problem: It is not always easy to know that we are looking for box 5, rather than box 50, because the way you decide which box to look into is not based on a number, but say on my name.    We can either (1) scan through all the boxes, looking for one labeled "Marcas Neal;" or (2) we can come up with some way to make them into tree searches.   Or, I can find some way to translate "Marcas Neal" into a number, then look up item in the box labeled with that number. This is called a hash table. 568 Views · 4 Upvotes
