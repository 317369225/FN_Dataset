How do you create a hash table of linked lists in C?
Least complex: The hash table is simply backed by an array of pointers. Instead of it containing values, each item is simply the head pointer to the first item in the list. So calculating the hash gives you an index into the array - which in turn gives you the head of the LL (i.e. the first item in each list). Each list is a normal LL, with each node being a record containing the key (and other values if such exists) as well as a next pointer to the following item in that list. So â€¦ add to table: (1) Allocate a new LL record and populate with the new values, set next field to null pointer. (2)... (more)
