How is the size of a hash table determined? How should optimization be done for it to be fast?
Speed is usually more important than memory. Empty cells in the hash table cost you only a little. Program with an average of 5 items per hash table cell will, on average, be about 3-4 times as slow as a program with just 1 item per cell, because of the additional comparisons it has to do. You want a hash table that is larger than the number of keys you are going to store, so that the expected number of items per cell is less than 1. The particular hash function does not matter much if the input is guaranteed to be English words -- many functions will behave nicely enough for those. That... (more)
