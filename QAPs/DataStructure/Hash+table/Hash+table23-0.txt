What are the benefits of Redis over a hash table?
Redis is not just an in-memory key/value (hash table) store rather it offers many other data types/structures to use. Apart from key/value you can store a List of strings, sorted by insertion order and can perform different list operations onto it. You can also use Sets as well as Sorted Sets, etc. Please see the full list of available data types here: Data types - Redis. If we assume that your only need is to keeping a hash table in-memory still the Redis does offer many other benefits; through Redis you can replicate the store as master/slave on different nodes that will help you in case horizontal scaling your servers. Redis data persistence feature performs point-in-time snapshot of your in-memory data at specified intervals on file, so in case of server crash you can restore the cache again in no time. 669 Views Â· 1 Upvote
