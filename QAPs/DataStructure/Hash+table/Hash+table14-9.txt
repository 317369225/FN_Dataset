Why do hash tables need to store the key of a record?
In the broadest sense, you don't.  And I bet that, if you look in a data structures textbook, their example is all about the hashing code and they only implement it as an array. However, that implementation is really only useful in specific cases.  Consider a spell-checker as an example.  I want to know if this word is valid, period.  If I can come up with a hashing function that has very few collisions, that's perfect. But the idea of an array indexed by arbitrary data instead of location (an associative array, in Perl's terms) means you might want something more flexible.  You might wan... (more)
