Are all NoSQL databases based on a distributed hash table? If yes, then how do they handle range queries?
From a DBMS implementation perspective, hashing functions at some level do map "keys" to "values" when interpreting a query from user-facing interface (whether it's coming in as text in a SQL shell REPL, "events" from an OS-native GUI or even a Web dashboard off a browser). Also, "graphs" are stored/read as sequential lines even if it's multiple (parallel) computing units reading along different paths of the data structure. The linearity of the underlying machine lends itself to memory indexing (listing) strategies like hashing where more humanly meaningful symbolic representation is interp... (more)
