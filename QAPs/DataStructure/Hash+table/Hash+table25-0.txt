What are the most common ways to measure hash table performance?
Hash tables exist to provide fast lookup speed of nearly O(1). There are several factors that determine performance; e.g., the speed of the hash calculation, the evenness of the output distribution of the hash function (minimizing the hash chain lengths), the size of the hash table (number of hash chains), and the type of chain lookup algorithm used. To evaluate the performance of a given implementation, populate the hash table with sample values, feed a large sample data set of input keys into the hash lookup, and benchmark the total lookup time. But prior to doing that, you may find it ... (more)
