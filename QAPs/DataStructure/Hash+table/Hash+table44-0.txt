Basically used for associate arrays key value pair, but with enhanced performance. Also used for indexing, cache. When you want quick response for retrieving the data from a list or a database or elsewhere in the memory hash tables are used. Basically faster retrieval O(1). Basically it is useful when database is large and you have to find the data quickly and in short time hash table are good for this kind of applications. And also if you want the unique keys to the data which has been index using a hash function. The efficiency is also depend on the hash function. it gives you the pinpoin... (more)
