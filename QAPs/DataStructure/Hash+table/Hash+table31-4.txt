What is the difference between HashSet, HashMap and hash table? How do they behave in a multi-threaded environment?
I think Answers already provided a very good overview But I would Refer three links here and those are must read when You wants a deeper look, What's the difference between ConcurrentHashMap and Collections.synchronizedMap(Map)? Hashtable Scalability Issue Performance Comparison Few points to remember, Hashset uses HashMap Internally, where Key for Hashmap is the Key you are providing but the Value will be a “Default new Object() instance”. Whenever using Collections.synchronized*() method Don’t forget to synchronize on Iterator by yourself. Hope it will give you an in-depth idea. Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.
