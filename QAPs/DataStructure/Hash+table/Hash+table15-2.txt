In which situation we should not use Hash table?
When you care about the order of the items. Specifically if you need to list the items in key order more than just one time when you are done with the key->value mapping you probably would be better off using a binary search tree to represent the mapping. When you would be better off just using an array i.e. your keys are densely packed integers or easy to convert into densely packed integers. When you don't actually need O(1) key look ups for anything. Operations on hashtables are efficient but they are not free. Don't use them for the hell of it because, say, your objects have an ID.
