What is a bucket in a hash table?
Thanks for A2A. I will try to answer this question with an analogy, sorry if it sounds too simplistic - Assume you have a housing colony in which there are lots of buildings or apartments and if asked the address of your house, you can answer that I live in XYZ building. So, a building or apartment is a bucket, housing colony is a hash table and your house is an entry. Technically, hashtable stores entries(key, value) pairs in buckets. HashTable uses key's hashcode to figure out the bucket. Ideally, the hash function is written in such a manner that each key is mapped to a unique bucket. Hope this helps. 1.1k Views Â· 1 Upvote
