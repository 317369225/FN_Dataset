What's the difference between a hash table and a dictionary?
A dictionary is a data structure supporting the operations: Search(x) – returning a pointer to the element with value x in the dictionary, if present. The time complexity of this operation depends on the implementation. Insert(x) – adding the element x to the dictionary. The time complexity of this operation depends on the implementation. Delete(x) – removing the element x from the dictionary. The time complexity of this operation depends on the implementation. A dictionary is kind of “an interface”, it can be implemented using a sorted array, an unsorted array, an hash table, etc. with differe... (more)
