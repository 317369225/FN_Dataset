What are common hash table questions asked in a technical interview?
I've been asked about hash tables precisely once in my life - and that was in college 15 years ago. You might find a question asked where responding with something like, "that use case seems like a good fit for a hash table - and here's why I say that ..." would be good or appropriate.
