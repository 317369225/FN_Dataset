What are some example recursive problems that use memoization with a hash table?
I'd assume the use of hash tables is probably more for convenience than out of sheer necessity.  If you write something that works with hash tables, you only have to code it up once, and you don't have to go through the effort of actually specifying all possible inputs. That said, one time you might really benefit from using a hash table would be a situation where the hash keys are themselves the result of calculations, and I believe that this kind of situation can indeed arise in programs like Mathematica that do fancy simplifications of algebraic expressions.  Indeed, googling memoizatio...
