How would you implement a hash table in C from scratch?
Creating hash table in C involves following steps 1) Create data structure to hold the table say array. 2) Need to write an algorithm to insert the item into an array. This is the most important step. This is nothing but creating an hash function. This function should return an index to insert an element into the array. 3) If duplicate index returned from hash function, then collision occurs. Need to apply some collision techniques like chaining by using some other data structures.
