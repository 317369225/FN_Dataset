What are some problems with hash tables?
Hash tables suck at writes. When you have too many writes, depending on the hash table design you either need to re-size (and rehash) your hash tables or get long lookup times. Specifically, for hash tables types like linear chaining or probing, you will have long chains or long runs (slow lookups). For the fancier ones like cuckoo hashing, that can bound the lookup time, you will hit the re-hash limit. If you have too many writes, it is better to use rb-trees or LSM trees or perhaps simply a B+tree. The best use of a hash table is for frequent reads and infrequent writes. Sparkey from s... (more)
