Are all NoSQL databases based on a distributed hash table? If yes, then how do they handle range queries?
In the case of Coherence, with a partitioned topology, the data is dynamically partitioned (and RAIDed for redundancy) across whatever server nodes are running. When a range query is executed, the query is sent in parallel to each of the server nodes, and local indexes are used on each server to handle the portion of the query that the node is responsible for. The partial results are sent back to the requester, and it combines them locally. A couple of points on this: Even if a node dies or some other rebalancing of partition occurs during the query, the result is still correct and stable ... (more)
