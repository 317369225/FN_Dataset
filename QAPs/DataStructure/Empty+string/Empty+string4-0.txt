In Emacs, how do I replace-string with the empty string '' instead of the default (last replacement) string?
Assuming you want to replace "My String" with "" (removing all or some occurrences of "My String"), you should just be able to M-x replace-string RET My String RET RET.  This is working for me on Emacs 23.2.1.  If that's too much typing, M-% is bound by default to M-x query-string, which is similar to M-x replace-string but interactively prompts you on each match.
