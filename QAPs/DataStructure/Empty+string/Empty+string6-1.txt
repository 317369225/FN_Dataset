Can something that doesn't exist, actually exist and if so, what is the difference between things like fields, dark energy, dark matter, god, buddhist emptiness, string theory, etc?
At first glance this question makes no sense, if I were to infer a sense unto it I'd say it's about what the difference in terms of not existing between metaphysical and physical concepts. My answer will assume this is what was asked. Fields are mathematical concepts and have been established to understand actual phenomenon. While we cannot show you a field and therefore cannot say that a field is actually a thing, we may as well say it's not existing in reality, instead it is merely a concept we use to describe reality. Dark energy is the same as it is a mathematical concept we utilize to model reality. Nobody can show you dark energy but without it, or fields, our physics would not match observations thus we assume both are real - which is not the same as "they exist". We don't "know" about their existence, we only know that their effects are real ( observable ). The very same is true for dark matter and strings in string theory and many other things we cannot "see". Now, looking at metaphysical concepts such as gods or spiritual planes above our own, we cannot observe them, therefore we cannot say anything about their existence and we cannot say they are real either. They are not observable. Thus, OBSERVABILITY is what sets them apart.
