How would I go about developing a context free grammar of non-empty binary strings that represent binary numbers that are powers of 4? In BNFI understand the pattern. Any binary number that is a power of 4 will be represented a 1 with an even number of 0s following it. Now, here's the question? To my understanding, this grammar should ONLY produce strings that are powers of 4 so if there will always only be one 1, thenÂ  I don't wan't the 1 to be able to come back up recursively. I am a little confused, any ideas?
Unless I'm missing something, you're over complicating the problem. Start by writing down binary numbers from 1 to 16 then see if there's a pattern to the ones that are powers of 4. It should be obvious.
