What is difference between EMPTY and NULL string in Java?
Copy-Paste and Run. Hopefully it will help :- String strNull = null; String InitializeStr = new String(); String strEmpty = ""; String StrEmpty2 = new String(""); System.out.println("I am NULL String It means I have not memory allocated, I have to Instantiated first :" + strNull); System.out.println("I am instancited String but not data: "+InitializeStr); System.out.println("I am just EMPTY String means data and instance both : "+strEmpty); System.out.println("I am just EMPTY String means data and instance both : "+StrEmpty2); output: I am NULL String It means I have not memory allocated, I have to Instantiated first :null I am instancited String but not data: I am just EMPTY String means data and instance both : I am just EMPTY String means data and instance both :
