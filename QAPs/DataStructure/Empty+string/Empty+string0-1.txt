How do I input an empty string in c++?
For an empty string, what you need is the Null character, or '\0' (zero, not the alphabet 'O'). It's a special reserved character that signifies end of a string. Like a string "hello" is in reality stored as "hello\0". This indicates where the string ends. So empty strings (initialized) would be given as "\0". Since actually entering "\0" through the terminal would form a string as str[0] = '\' str[1] = '0' you need another way to make it as a Null character. Thus the ability to type it (in case of unchecked user input) creates a vulnerability known as null byte injection and can lead to security exploits.Source: Wikipedia Null character Some keyboards do have that facility (ctrl + @), some don't. If not, you'll have to make up your own keyword to input, like "nullstr", then check if your input is the same, and then change the string to '\0' through your code. Update: Forgot we were in C++. Yes as pointed by Alok Mishra and Shivshankar Shejwal, getline will work. putting \0 in C++ will just result in the string being printed as "ello" for "\0ello\0" since string length is also stored.
