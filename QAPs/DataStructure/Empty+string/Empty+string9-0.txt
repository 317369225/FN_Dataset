What is difference between EMPTY and NULL string in Java?
Suppose you asked your friend to go to kitchen and check whether there are any chocolates inside the  Blue Snicker's box there. Your friend came back and may report one three results: 1) Yes there are few chocolates inside the box. 2) There are no chocolates in the box. 3) There is no Blue Snicker's box in the kitchen. Now let us consider the similarity between 2) and 3) case. Suppose you asked your friend to bring a chocolate, he'll fail in both cases. However you may note that in 2nd case, it was because the box was empty, but in 3rd case it was because there was NO BOX in kitchen. It might be the case (in 3rd scenario) that you left the full  box in bedroom( thus he could not find the box in kitchen). Now the difference, If you give him a chocolate and ask him to put it inside that box. He will be able to do it in 2nd case, but not in third as there is NO box. Also that in second case, that empty box takes up some space in your kitchen despite the fact that its empty. It also weighs something though not as much as a box filled with chocolates. Now coming back to JAVA, String is like that Blue Snicker's box, its content are like those chocolates and kitchen is your program( or its reference tree) in which you are searching for that string.
