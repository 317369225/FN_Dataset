If I had foo+"" are there any cases where the empty string is not optimized out?
Nothing is optimised on that piece of code. What are you trying to do? That will be translated into a String.valueOf(foo) (creates a new string object for all types except if foo is already a string), then creates yet another string concatenating the new one with the empty string. Or maybe not, the compiler may ignore that second step. Just do the String.valueOf(foo) yourself, or if you're sure foo is not null, foo.toString(). Or in certain calls like System.out or StringBuilder.append, let them figure out what foo is, as they may be faster using a number directly than converting into a string first.
