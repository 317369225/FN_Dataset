Why do kleene star accepts empty string?Kleene star's definition says it means "zero or more" Then ab* shouldn't be {ab, abbb, abaaa, abbababab.... etc etc} i.e, starting with ab and followed by zero or more characters? Why empty string (epsilon) is considered to be in this set? (I am taking a kleen star as * wildcard operator in linux file naming)
You didn't study Theory of computation in college, I know that because I am in your class, ab* will give you 'a' followed by any number of 'b' rather than 'ab' followed by something, what you wanted to ask was (ab)*, and that would mean zero or more 'ab' like {epsilon,ab, abab , ababab } and others. 0 or more numbers of ab's. I hope it solves your query, nhi to phone krle mujhe samjha dunga.
