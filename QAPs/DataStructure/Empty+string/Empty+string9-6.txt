What is difference between EMPTY and NULL string in Java?
when you declare ? 1 String s = "" ; you actually declare a new String Object, and it means the variable (in this case - s) has a String Object associated to it. you can call String methods on that object. it is like typing: ? String s = new String(); if you type: ? String s = ""; s.lentgh; // return 0 however, when you declare ? 1 .String s = null; null means that the variable (the reference pointer) is empty. it is not pointing to any Object at all. in that case if you type: ? String s = null; s.lentgh;//returns a null pointer exception hope it helps!
