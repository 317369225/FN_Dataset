Can something that doesn't exist, actually exist and if so, what is the difference between things like fields, dark energy, dark matter, god, buddhist emptiness, string theory, etc?
The similarity among things like fields, dark energy, dark matter, god, Buddhist emptiness, string theory, is they cannot be observed with our naked eyes. The difference among these things is where they are located in a human being. God for example, like faith and hope exists in the heart, Buddhist emptiness exists in one of the chakras or energy points, the rest in the mind and in our body's nervous, chemical, and electrical systems. You may argue that dark energy, fields, string theory, dark matter are concepts or exist in the universe and not in a human body. And I will argue back that each one of us, without exception have the same atoms in our bodies as the stars and all energy forces.Â  Not only are we part of the universe, but the universe is in us.
