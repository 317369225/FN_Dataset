Can something that doesn't exist, actually exist and if so, what is the difference between things like fields, dark energy, dark matter, god, buddhist emptiness, string theory, etc?
If this is a problem of categorisation: yes. Like a child toy box. You can certainly have two boxes and change things from one to the other even if it doesn't hold up. You decide what belongs to what but you can't be wrong or right as long as there's still space on the boxes to put in your new toys and nobody else is messing with them.
