In Emacs, how do I replace-string with the empty string '' instead of the default (last replacement) string?
For both `replace-string' and the more convenient M-% `query-replace', you are prompted for the search string and the replacement.Â  If you just hit return, you will get the last search and replace, otherwise you supply both strings.
