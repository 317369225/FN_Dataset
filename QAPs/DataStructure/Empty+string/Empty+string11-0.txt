How would I go about developing a context free grammar of non-empty binary strings that represent binary numbers that are powers of 4? In BNFI understand the pattern. Any binary number that is a power of 4 will be represented a 1 with an even number of 0s following it. Now, here's the question? To my understanding, this grammar should ONLY produce strings that are powers of 4 so if there will always only be one 1, thenÂ  I don't wan't the 1 to be able to come back up recursively. I am a little confused, any ideas?
It is super simple, so I'm not willing to answer this, you have to figure it out yourself. You don't seem to have a good grasp of CFGs so just write down some simple ones and see what strings they can produce! Hint, your problem can be done with three or fewer nonterminal symbols including the start symbol.
