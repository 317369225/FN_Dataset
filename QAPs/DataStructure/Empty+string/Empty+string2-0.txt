Java (programming language): What is the shortest, non-empty String whose hash code is 0?This question is for Java specifically, and for those who find this kind of thing a fun challenge. Since the hash function can change for different versions of Java, specify the version your answer is specifically for. Bonus points for providing the fastest algorithm to accommodate different Java versions.
According to the link provided by Gilad Tsur starting from Java 1.2 hashCode for String class computes by and therefore only empty String can have hashCode equals to zero. What was before Java 1.2 has only historical interest and question doesn't make too much sense. public class TestStringHashcode {   public static void main(String... args) { String s1 = null; // System.out.println(s1.hashCode()); //NullPointerException   String s2 = "";   System.out.println(s2.hashCode()); // output 0   String s3 = " ";   System.out.println(s3.hashCode()); // output 32   String s4 = "0";   System.out.println(s4.hashCode()); // output 48   String s5 = "\n";   System.out.println(s5.hashCode()); // output 10 }   }
