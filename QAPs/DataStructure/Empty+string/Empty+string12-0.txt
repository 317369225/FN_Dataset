Your friend has drawn the DFA below for the following language: non-empty binary strings whose first and last letters are the same. Which of the following inputs could be used to demonstrate that the above DFA is incorrect?(Select ALL correct answers) A. 0 B. 0100 C. 0001 D. 1101?
None of the above given options can be used to prove the DFA incorrect. a) 0 is the first and the last : so this will pass. b)0100 the first and last are 0: so this will pass too. c)0001 the first and last are not same as you see: so this will fail (clearly the DFA is correct) d)1101 the first and last digits are same: so it will pass.
