Are the ups and downs of stocks subject to dependent origination, if so,if a Buddhist trades stocks, will he make a lot of money?
Just looked up dependent origination... I can see where you might want to make that connection, but... No. A buddhist has exactly the same chances of making (and losing) as much money as anyone else.
