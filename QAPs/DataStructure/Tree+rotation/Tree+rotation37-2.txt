What are the most important data structures in a tech interview?
Most important data structure in a tech interview is Array. I have appeared for many interviews and seen that array questions are always asked. The interviewer will give you a very simple array question initially, for example - binary search in a sorted rotated array, just to check if you can handle all the edge cases, to see what is your coding style and basically, to check if you can actually write code so that the interview process can be carried forward further. The interviewer can increase the complexity by asking questions which are on arrays data structures and uses dynamic programming strategy for optimal solution. You can go through this playlist for questions on arrays: Arrays - YouTube Dynamic Programming Other than arrays, Trees and Hash Maps are also important data structures because in almost all your interviews, you will be asked questions that can be solved efficiently using trees or hash maps. Here is a playlist on trees: Trees - YouTube If you are looking for more topics on above, then you can check Array 1. Sorting Algorithm - Selection Sort 2. Sorting Algorithm - Insertion Sort 3.
