How can Data Structure and Algorithms be just studied in an easy way?
Data Structure:It is a way in which you store data in the system. Just Try to understand that there is nothing new that can tremble your thoughts. The only thing you are going to find by Studying DS is how to manipulate Data Types using Objective programming to handle intricate and dynamic data. Algorithms:Algorithms Provide a human readable solution for a problem. You can implement the solution in different programming language by using Algorithms. There is not a simple or straight way to study Algorithms. The only way i can suggest is reverse learning. First try to make a simple program and then turn your logic into an Algorithm. Write every step you take to solve the problem. Way of study Try to copy the work of someone and then understand the way it has been done. Yes, Cheating is also a way to learn something new. Make your own rules, Every person have a different way to analyze problems.You can just find a way that suits you well. Reverse learning is also a good way to learn something that is difficult to understand from start. Just like a maze puzzle, it become more easy when you try to solveÂ  it from the back instead of front. You can also study by doing first and studying later.Like i said before that Every person has a different way of understanding. So try to find out a way, In which you grasp the knowledge easily and how you can motivate your self for doing such things.
