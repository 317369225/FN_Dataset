Is it necessary for computer science majors to know how to code data structures or is understanding the concepts just enough?
I think the question comes down to whether you want to be a computer scientist or a software engineer.  As a computer scientist, I write very little code (and the code I do write tends towards bash and R).  The hard questions I need to answer are along the lines of:  here are thirty different dimensions describing a dozen benchmarks; how do I visualize this data in order to understand the bottlenecks we'll have in machine designs two generations out? Data structures don't help very much with those kinds of problems. As a software engineer, yes, absolutely, you should have a deep understanding of data structures, as those comprise the vocabulary with which you compose solutions.
