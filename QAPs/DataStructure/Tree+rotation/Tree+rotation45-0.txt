How should we plant trees on earth ideally?
As often as possible, they are desperately needed to help combat reduce carbon dioxide from fossil fuels. In my estimation we need to, in effect, double the size of all known forests and jungles. In Pre industrial times  there were 6 billion hectares We have 4 left  so we need to plant 2 to get back to pre industrial levels of co2  consumption then another 2 to correct the affects of fossil fuel burning and thus reverse the global warming. http://www.earth-policy.org/indi...
