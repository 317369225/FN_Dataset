How should we plant trees on earth ideally?
It depends on the tree, and where. It's probably a bad idea to introduce a species to an area it's not indigenous to, and some species aren't as suitable for the benefits of planting them. Many planted trees aren't simply planted from a seed into the location that they are going to go in. Instead they're grown from seeds into saplings, then transplanted to their intended home. Trees like Joshua Trees which are so fragile and picky that you can't easily do that. With a Joshua tree, the exact angle they started growing at has to be maintained. If the tree is rotated compared to the angle of the sun they initially grew in, then they will die. If you change their latitude too much from the latitude they initially grew in, they will die. Rain forests cannot be simply replanted, as they create their own climate. When the trees are cut down, the climate is gone. Replanting them does not recreate the climate, and they cannot grow in any climate other than the one they create for themselves. Basically they modify their environment to suit themselves the same as humans do, but at a much slower timescale than we do. If we want to expand the rain forests, we need to figure out how to encourage them to expand on their own.
