Is it necessary for computer science majors to know how to code data structures or is understanding the concepts just enough?
No.  You don't need to do anything like coding data structures to work in positions like "sales engineer," "technical writer," or "web designer." Building non-trivial products as a software engineer is a different story, but not all computer science graduates these days have the aptitude for that. Updated 46w ago • View Upvotes
