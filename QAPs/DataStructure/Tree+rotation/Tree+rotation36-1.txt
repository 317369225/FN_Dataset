What are some good blogs about algorithms and technical interviews?
http://blog.gainlo.co The blog contains many very practical tips and hacks to help you prepare your code interviews. Also it's updated frequently (at least weekly). In addition, many posts are directly from experienced interviewers first hand experiences, which gives you tips that are easy to act on and lists common pitfalls you'd better avoid. Another one I would recommend is http://codercareer.blogspot.com/, which contains a bunch of interview questions and detailed solution and analysis. So it's very helpful.
