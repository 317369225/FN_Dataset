Why is Accenture HR team so illiterate and selecting only underperforming candidates from campus interview?
I was working with Accenture earlier. Accenture is one of the company which has best HR practices. Honestly I don't believe in campus recruitment because it is too hard to judge the freshers. So it just hit or miss.
