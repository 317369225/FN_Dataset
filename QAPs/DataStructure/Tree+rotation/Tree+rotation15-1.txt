Why is Accenture HR team so illiterate and selecting only underperforming candidates from campus interview?
What's this mess about underperformance? :D It's an IT Services Company and they train you for the work you're supposed to do. (They actually train more than what's required for some Copy,Paste Work based DUs and Domains) I should probably state my experience with the recruitment process of Accenture. (This was 4 years ago. Ain't sure about the standards opted now!) Day 1 - Only 190 out of 1200 clears the written aptitude test. Day 2 190 sent for technical interviews Some are rejected at that phase Successful ones are sent for HR interviews Result : Only 72~80 selected from a total of 1200 who'd appeared for the aptitude test. However, I should probably state here that the consecutive batches don't seem to be subjected to such extreme filtering. My interviewer seemed too fascinated by the idea of data structures (specifically Trees) that I received a lot (Ya. That's right. A Lot.) of questions on them. I still remember a specific one. AVL - Tree Rotations! Even though it appeared to be normal at that time, once I joined the Company I used to think (ya the 'hefty' :D  work made me think) often,  "Why the heck did he ask me all those if this is what I'm supposed to do here?" (You know. MS Excel seldom cares about AVL Trees! :D )
