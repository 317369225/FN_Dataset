What is the best logo ever created?
Nike's "Swoosh" logo was designed* by graphic design student Carolyn Davidson in 1971. Davidson had been approached because she had done casual work with Nike's founders Phillip Knight and Bill Bowerman.  They needed a logo for a new line of running shoes to be named after the Greek goddess of victory. Although reminiscent* of a check mark, the "Swoosh" logo is intended to evoke the winged Nike's flight.[1] On seeing the logo, Knight said "I don't love it, but it will grow on me."  Davidson charged just $35 for her work.[2] (Adjusted for inflation, that would be ~$186 in 2010.)  In 1983, Knight further rewarded Davidson with an envelope filled with Nike stock. (Which could mean anything.) Creative Director of Interbrand, Andy Payne has said of the Swoosh: "Over time it has gained equity and confidence to set itself free from the word Nike, and that is a very brave step for a brand to take." * Quora user Felipe Barousse points out the stone carving of Nike found in Ephesus, Turkey shares Swoosh's curve. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/F... Less significant is a rotated Swoosh-like curve present in the wings of a 16cm tall bronze statue of the Greek goddess Nike dated 550 BC.
