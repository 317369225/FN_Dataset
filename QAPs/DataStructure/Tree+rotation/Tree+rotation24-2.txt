What are the algorithms required to solve all problems (using C++) in any competitive coding contest?
Before asking this question, you must understand this: In competitive programming, less than 10% of algorithms can be used to solve more than 90% of problems. If you are really good in basic algorithms (DP, graph, data structures (stack, queue, heap, segment tree, fenwick tree), basic math), you can make it to red on Codeforces/Topcoder. You should learn more only if you are really interested in algorithm, in which case I don't think you need to ask this question in the first place. Mastering each algorithm takes time. I'm in CP for around 8 years, red on Codeforces and still don't understand some algorithms / can not implement some. My advice is you don't need all those huge lists of algorithm. Just learn new things when you see them, or when you feel interested in some certain topics.
