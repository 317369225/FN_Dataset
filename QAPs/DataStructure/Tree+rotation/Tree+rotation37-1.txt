What are the most important data structures in a tech interview?
Arrays and strings are by far the most important data structures in technical interviews. Boring? Maybe. Important? Yes. The most important non-trivial data structure in technical interviews is the hash map because of its versatility and constant-time operations. If you don't know how to use a hash map, learn now. Next in line are linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees. You need to know these inside and out. In the next tier are graphs, priority queues, and heaps. You should still know these, but they appear more rarely. In the bottom tier are lesser known data structures like bit sets, tries, disjoint sets, specific cache implementations, etc. It doesn't hurt to prepare for some of these, although they appear most rarely.
