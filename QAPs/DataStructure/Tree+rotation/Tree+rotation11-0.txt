Thought Experiments: What are some interesting ways, not necessarily workable, of attacking the dynamic optimality conjecture?
For reference, the Dynamic Optimality Conjecture conjectures that the splay tree is dynamically optimal; that is, for any sequence of accesses, the splay tree performs to within a constant factor of optimal. Here, optimal is measured as the best that a binary search tree can do using tree rotations--even with knowing the access sequence in advance and magically knowing the right moves to do. More generally, we could ask to find some binary search tree (not necessarily a splay tree) which is dynamically optimal. Tango trees (as well as multi-splay trees, which are similar) are one such attempt. Tango trees are provably [math]O(\log \log n)[/math]-optimal. Note that dynamic optimality asks for [math]O(1)[/math]-optimality. However, splay trees (as well as most BSTs), by a naive analysis are only known to be [math]O(\log n)[/math]-optimal. So the Tango Tree is a pretty solid attempt. Updated 63w ago • View Upvotes
