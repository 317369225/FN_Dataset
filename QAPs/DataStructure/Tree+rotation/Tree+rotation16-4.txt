Is it necessary for computer science majors to know how to code data structures or is understanding the concepts just enough?
Answers below seem to indicate that as a computer science major, you would end up being a software engineer. If that is what you eventually want to be, then I cannot emphasize enough, that you need to learn to code; not just learn some coding, but code good. However, as a computer science major, you could do a lot of other things, which does not involve knowing how to code. One such direction is to do research in theoretical computer science. Even here, not all of them can get away without knowing to code, but a non-trivial fraction of the people do not necessarily know how to code. And a major fraction of those people actually are involved in designing new data structures and algorithms to solve a lot of problems. They set up the mathematical framework, prove the efficiency and correctness and use it in the specific problems they are trying to solve. In this case, they do not know how to "code" in a conventional programming language(since most of them may not have learnt a programming language), but can still go ahead and design such structures. Finally, if the only thing that is stopping you from not coding is the fact that you are lazy to code it up, then I would suggest you go ahead and code it. Irrespective of your background, coding it gives a different perspective which cannot be easily seen from a theoretical perspective.
