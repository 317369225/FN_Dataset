What are the best paintings you have painted?
I started charcoal sketching about 3-4 months back and here are few of my art works: 1. Why So Serious?  2. SHERLOCKED 3. The Serene Buddha 4. Captain Jack Sparrow 5. ACHILLES the greatest warrior ever 6. The Genius - My first charcoal sketch. 7. This one is my favourite as its the first decent sketch made by me 7 years back ie. when i was 12 years old. Thank you for having a look at my works, I hope you liked them ! Your comments/suggestions are most welcome. Couple of Graphite Sketches: Natalie Portman Angelina Jolie Updated 80w ago • View Upvotes
