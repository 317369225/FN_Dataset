Why is Accenture HR team so illiterate and selecting only underperforming candidates from campus interview?
What they need is candidates who will stay back there for long time. The bright candidates will quickly understand that they have much better opportunities and as soon as they finish training and the bond period, they'll switch to a better job. HR's have good understanding of the market and they know this fact very well. They can estimate the value of a candidate close to precise. Hence, why would they invest in a gem that will be lost for sure, just because it is available at low cost now, but will be difficult to protect in the future.
