Is it necessary for computer science majors to know how to code data structures or is understanding the concepts just enough?
That's a very difficult question to answer largely because it doesn't make sense. Let's suppose you had a computer science major who fit this description: knew the concepts of a linked list and binary search tree, but couldn't code it.Â  It's possible, I suppose. This indicates that the person would be unable to translate a relatively simple concept into code. Is that a problem? Absolutely. It's an enormous one. See, it's not that I "know" how to code a binary search tree. I haven't memorized the code anymore than I've memorized what 17 + 25 is. But because I know the concept, I can implement it. I can also "create" new data structures. For example, perhaps I want a Node data structure which has three pointers to other nodes: the previous node, the next node, and the "skip" next node (the next node's next node). I don't know why you'd want this data structure, but I could definitely code it. If you understand basic data structures but can't code them, then either you don't understand them or you struggle to translate an algorithm into code. Either one is a problem.
