What are the best paintings you have painted?
These are some of my favorites. Some were already sold. Some of these are available for purchase from my mom, brother and his kids. The paintings were moved from Seattle to Arizona.  I don't remember what is sold or not. There is a spreadsheet somewhere. Some paintings I don't even have a photo of. You can see some more here:  Paintings 1991-2004 The ones on canvas are often 4x4 feet. But they vary. Most are acrylic or a mix. Zen Tree. The photo does not do it justice. Complex and beautiful knarl with a little secret. I wish I lived in the painting... I kind of do. This one is about 5 feet tall. Bravery. El mantra: 4 x 6 feet. Cruel: Also not done justice by the photo. More perfect doodle: Prayer lotus: It would look good on your wall. 4x4 feet. Internal organs. The first painting I made as a adult that I liked: Holy fire. On the wall of a Seattle collector. 4x4 feet. Chalice: Another from the blobular series. Conversation: Owned by a dear friend. DeHarold: My alter ego. The Last bottle of 1997 Mead:  Voodoo dots: I believe in the power of lines. Vibrant Black: Well.... If you made it this far, you might as well watch a little video... Monkey Flip in progress. Owned by a Seattle collector. Updated 122w ago • View Upvotes
