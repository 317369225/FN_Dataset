What are the Applications of avl tree?
AVL tree (height-balanced tree) A binary search tree such that for each node the heights of the left and right subtrees differ by at most one. Thus the balance of each node is â€“1, 0, or +1. During insertion or deletion, a node in an AVL tree may become critical or unbalanced and then the tree has to be reorganized to maintain its balanced property. Applications of A VL Trees AVL trees are applied in th e following situations: There are few insertion and deletion operations Short search time is needed Input data is sorted or nearl y sorted AVL tree structures can be used in situations which require fast searching. But, the large cost of re balancing may limit the usefulness.
