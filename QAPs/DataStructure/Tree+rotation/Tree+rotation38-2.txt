Nature: What are some of the best rare natural phenomena that occur on Earth?
Got to know about many beautiful rare natural phenomena. Would like to add few more. Floating Lake (Loktak Lake, India)Loktak Lake located in the state of Manipur, India is the largest freshwater lake in northeast India. It is also called the only floating lake in the world due to the floating phumdis. Phumdis are a mass of vegetation, soil and other organic matter that accumulate over a period of time that resemble a landmass that float freely in the lake. The largest floating island covers an area of 40 sq. km. and constitutes the world’s largest floating park, Keibul Lamjao National Park Frozen Waves (Antarctica)These freezing blue towers were created when ice was compressed and the trapped air bubbles were squeezed out. During the summer the surface ice melts and new ice layers compress on top. The ice appears blue because when when light passes through thick ice, blue light is transmitted back out but red light is absorbed. Ice CirclesIce circles are thin, circular slabs of ice that rotate slowly in the water. It is believed that they form in eddy currents. However, they’re very rare, appearing only in slow moving waters from cold climates such as Northern Europe or America, but some have also been spotted in Britain, including a huge one bigger than 3 meters. Hailstorm Slush (Finland)An unusual natural phenomenon of what appeared to be strands of slush in the shape of spaghetti was sighted in Lake Suolijärvi, in the South Häme region. The discovery, disappeared overnight. http://yle.fi/uutiset/strange_sp...
