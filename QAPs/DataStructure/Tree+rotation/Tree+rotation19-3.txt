What is an AVL tree?
AVL tree is a self balanced tree. Why it is used? The primary problem of normal BST is that , there are cases, in which while insertion, the BST may turn out to be a Skewed tree( Like a Linked list). It is similar to a linked list. It has an additional property added to the structure itself, ie Balance Factor. And all the operations 1. Insertion 2.Deletion 3.Searching Takes O(h) time complexity, therefore if we can reduce the height of the tree, we will be able to speed  up the process of insertion, deletion and retrieval . Condition of Balanced Node: The difference between height of the left subtree and the right subtree of a node must be -1,0,1. I it becomes unbalanced Here, The Node -2 is the non balanced node, because, height of left subtree is 1 and height of right subtree is 3(count the edges) , so difference is greater than 1. So, while insertion , we need to take care of the balance factor. and adjust accordingly.Note that after proper Rotations, You'll have all nodes of balance factor 1, 0, -1. This is solely done, to reduce the height of the tree. Rotations   Rotations are used to keep the balance factor less than equal to abs(1); So, Left and Right rotations are made according to the given conditions. Given Above is Left Rotation. There are 4 types of Rotations. 1. Left Left 2.Left Right 3.Right left 4.Right right Insertion , Deletion takes O(logn).
