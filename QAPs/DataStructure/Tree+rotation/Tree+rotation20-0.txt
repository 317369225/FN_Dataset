Is it possible for a fresher to keep preparing for a big company by doing competitive coding while working in a service-based company like Sapient Nitro in India?
First of all, I want to appreciate the fact that you wish to be a competitive coder and don't want to be part of rut of disgusting service companies and aim real high. I have spent almost half a decade at Sapient Global markets, joining it from one of the excellent most product companies where I used to write real code.. I used to love Red Black Trees/Strongly connected Graphs and terms like Tree rotation, skew. But now I feel miserable, It gives me nervousness to think of cracking interview of big companies like Amazon, I would rather piss in my mind if someone asked me a a question about how to design a performance oriented system.. Only one reason.. I made myself part of this organization called Sapient and fell into trap of onsite travels/Money etc etc. My skills deteriorated, I could never had enough time from work to read or stay abreast with technology, there is no motivation to go to office and there are high chances I won't come back home early because I am in Sapient Because you are missing one big point.. One rotten apple will perish entire basket.. and if you join Sapient.. you might be the only unperished apple, and imagine living in a smelly mushy pie of rotten apples.. u can't save yourself. this company's policies, work culture, assoholism will ruin you.. They will make you do anything and everything their client will want and don't care a bit about what you want.. save yourself buddy.. Don't join Sapient, Consider this as a advice of Big Brother.. please
