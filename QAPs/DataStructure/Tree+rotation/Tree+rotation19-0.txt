What is an AVL tree?
An AVL tree is a binary tree data structure that balances itself out to make searching it faster. The best case scenario for searching a binary tree is O(log(n)).  This assumes that the tree is perfectly balanced -- that there are as many items on the right side as there are on the left. balanced tree: But if the tree isn't balanced, the worst case scenario for a search is O(n).  That's no better than searching through a completely unsorted list. unbalanced tree: An AVL tree balances itself, which increases the time complexity of an insertion operation but holds the searching time complexity at its minimum.
