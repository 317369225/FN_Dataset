What is the difference between 3D, 4D, 5D & 6D?
In mathematics dimensions refer to the number of variables in a system. So 3D have 3 variables, like x,y and z. So in 6D you will have 6 variables. Very often some of these variables are dependent. For example, y and z may depend on x, as in y(x) and z(x). In higher dimensional systems there is often time as a variable upon which the rest depends. For example x(t), y(t), z(t) etc. Mathematics isn't concerned by the physical meaning of these variables. So a system with 3 space dimensions, one time dimension with colour and sound is a 6D system. Nothing more, nothing less. Many people are interested in understanding 6 dimensions in space. Not a problem for mathematicians either. Here is a 6D rotation "I made earlier", as they say. It is a 6 dimensional tree of which 3 dimensions are visible and 3 are not. This tree is then rotated around its axis, surfaces and volumes and in this way, it exposes the "hidden" dimensions as it rotates. If you want to see 6D rotation in the real world, it will have to show weird behavior like this. I'm a little less ambitious myself and look for real 4D spatial objects although it is often hard to distinguish higher dimensions when you see them. Here is one natural higher dimensional 'object': starlings in murmuration. The movement is complex and involves more than higher dimensional rotations, but they are there. The giveaway of higher dimensional rotations is in rythmic deformations of the object. How can this be real? Well, starling flocks are made up of many individuals that appear to form a shape. That shape deforms and morphs as it rotates into higher dimensions. What is the hidden dimension here? Most likely in the momentum and relative speed of the individual starlings.
