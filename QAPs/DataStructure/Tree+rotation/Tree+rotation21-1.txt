How does join and split work in a Treap when adding or removing an element?
Pre-requisites: JOIN : Joining two subarrays together to create a new subarray. Lets say we have two arrays A[1...x] and B[x+1....y]. On merging, the final array will be C[1....y]. SPLIT : Spliting a subarray to create two subarrays. Lets say we have a subarray C[1....y] and we want to split at position x, then new subarrays will be A[1...x] and B[x+1...y]. Now, To add and Remove. ADD : Assume we have an array A[1...y] and we want to add an element at position x. Step 1 : Split the array A into B[1...x-1] and C[x...y]. Step 2 : Join subarray B[1...x] and new element to produce a new subarray B' [1....x]. Step 3 : Join subarrays B[1....x] and C[x....y] to produce the final array. REMOVE : Assume we have an array A[1...y] and we want to delete the element at position x. Step 1 : Split the array A at position x into B[1....x] and C[x+1...y]. Step 2 : Split the array B[1...x] into B1[1...x-1] and B2[x]. Step 3 : Join B1[1...x-1] and C[x+1....y] to produce the final array.
