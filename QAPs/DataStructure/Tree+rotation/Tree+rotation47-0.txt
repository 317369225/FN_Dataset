How can one learn more about systems theory or systems thinking?
What an excellent question! As a second generation systems analyst I can't tell you how happy just Information System analysis, communication sys makes me. Bertalanffy's book titled "General System theory: Foundations, Development, Applications" from 1968. A good start. If you'd rather wrestle dense theory: I strongly suggest a book called "A thousand plateaus." Deleuze and Guitari. Pattern recognition/set theory/outlier data algorithms and models of both time and interactive spatial development is critical for social media As Well As management practice or consulting.

(Self organizing map = a sneaker contains emergent information of movement patterns / time creates a topology or landscape of both itself and use.)
