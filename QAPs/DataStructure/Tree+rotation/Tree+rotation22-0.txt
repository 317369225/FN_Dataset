What is difference between self balanced binary search tree and AVL tree?
AVL tree is a type of Self Balancing binary search tree. These trees maintains their balance factor. It reduce the time complexity on searching as the height is only log(n) , where n is the no of elements.   The overhead is the rotations performed at each insertion or deletion. It is very strict self balancing tree so it require more rotations. All Self Balancing tree are base on different algorithm like Red-Black tree keep record of color of the node for balancing and require less rotations. Searching is slower in compare to AVL trees. B-tree are used when we are managing more than thousands of items and we are paging them from a disk or some slow storage medium. There are many more algorithm.
