What are some of the cleverest inventions and ideas ever?
I am not sure whether this invention is mentioned or not,I haven't been through all the answers. GRAVITY LIGHT :The Lamp Powered By Sand & Gravity. Two London designers have developed and designed a gravity-powered lamp for as little as £3, bringing light to remote regions in developing countries. GravityLight has been developed to provide clean, reliable and safe light, enabling people to break free from the economic, health and environmental hazards of kerosene lamps. So How Does It Work ? Developed by Martin Riddiford and Jim Reeves over the last four years, The gravity light consists of an LED bulb fixed to an adjustable lamp that can be hooked up on a wall or hung from a ceiling. It also comprises a pulley mechanism and a ballast bag hanging from the lamp. The ballast bag is filled with up to 9 kg of rock, sand or soil. The gravity light works on the principle similar to that of pendulum clocks that are operated with the help of weights. The potential energy is represented by the ballast material. When the ballast bag is suspended, the potential energy in the ballast is converted by gravity with a slow descent of the bag. The converted energy then generates light. The gravity light can be operated for 30 mins continuously before the ballast bag needs to be refilled. The strength of the light can be adjusted from strong lighting to long-lasting low-level lighting. The two terminals present at the front of the gravity light can be used as a generator. And What Are It's  Benefits ? It is inexpensive. It has no operating costs. It does not requires any batteries. It can power radios, reading lights and other small electrical devices. It can recharge batteries. GravityLight is currently being used in various parts of the world where there is not adequate supply of electricity and people are totally dependent on Kerosene Lamps.
