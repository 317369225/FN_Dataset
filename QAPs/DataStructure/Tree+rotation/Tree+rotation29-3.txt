What's the best bonsai for indoors?
The suggestions here are all excellent.  I wanted to add, that if you are planning on growing a bonsai indoors, be sure to select a spot that has lots of sunlight (which you can always shade the tree from).  And once your tree is placed, rotating it(.25 or .5 turn weekly) to provide optimal light exposures to all sides.
