What's the best bonsai for indoors?
As others suggested, Ficus trees make excellent bonsai. Other plants to consider are the Fukien Tea, Jade, Umbrella plant, and palm trees. I personally have a ficus, jade, umbrella plant and a chinese elm growing in my home. The ficus tree and Chinese Elm look more like trees than the others, but they're all perfect indoor plants.
