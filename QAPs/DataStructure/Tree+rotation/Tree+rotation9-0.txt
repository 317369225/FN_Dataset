What are the best paintings you have painted?
Although I am a realistic pencil artist (http://realisticartsachin.devian...), I did a few paintings when I was a teenager. I am going to display four of my favourite works here. I remember watching 'The Lion King' and totally falling in love with the characters. It motivated me to create this painting using poster colors on a A1 sheet. It came out so well that my parents got it framed and currently decorates our hall. There was a time when I was totally addicted to this game called 'Prototype' (Prototype (video game)). I loved the protagonist, Alex Mercer, and was totally involved in the story-line. And as usual, I decided to make a painting of him. It was done on an A4 sheet with poster colors as the medium. The background did not seem to come out that well as I spent most of my time getting the shades right on the main subject. I am an automobile freak and have been a part of a racing team myself. I just could not resist doing this painting of Bugatti Veyron after I watched it hit 408 km/h on Top Gear: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L.... It was the fastest car then. Finally, I would like to post about my most favorite work yet. It is a realistic pencil sketch of Sebastian Vettel in racing gear. I was able to capture all the intricate details required to make it look lively, and the winning spirit radiating through his eyes!
