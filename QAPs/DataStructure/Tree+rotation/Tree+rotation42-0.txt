Is monocropping responsible for soil erosion? If yes, then how?
First of all A big YESS for your question. Monocropping plz see the reference of effect of monocropping of maize Page on google.co.in Overcultivation and monocropping are usually associated with high levels of mechanisation which can compact the soil, leaving the land bare between harvest and planting, both of which increase the potential for erosion, and continuous loss of nutrients with application of large quantities of fertilisers. Monocropping deprives the soil of specific nutrients because the same crop is always planted. Traditional agricultural practices incorporated inter-cropping (planting e.g. yams and sweet potatoes between rows of cane or banana trees) and rotation cropping (e.g. growing a cycle of potatoes, peas, yams and tomatoes one after the other on the same plot of land). These help to secure the soil and prevent erosion, and ensure nutrients are not depleted because different crops have varying nutrient requirements for growth. Legumes in particular are usually planted in rotations because they fix nitrogen in the soil, a nutrient which is usually very limited. Fallow or “rest” periods were also used in the past. Once every few years nothing was planted to allow the soil to recuperate so that organic matter and nutrients re-accumulate and soil structure rebuilds.
