What is the best logo ever created?
"The most successful logo in human history is not the Nike swoosh or any other corporate design. Instead, it’s probably one designed by anti-slavery activists in Britain way back in 1787, and it became a mainstay of the abolitionist movement — a way to spread the word and build solidarity."       Nicholas Kristof http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com...
