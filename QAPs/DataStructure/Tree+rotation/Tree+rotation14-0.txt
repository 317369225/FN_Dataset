What is the best thing that you created in college/school for which you have been awarded?
This is the one I made in my second year of Studying Economics. (2012) Theme: PAINT YOUR IMAGINATION We were given the time of an hour.... and I just bagged the FIRST prize. size: 30x40 cm OIL MEDIUM It was too difficult for me to complete canvas in 1 hr since it takes me months to complete one. But then, challenges are meant to be cracked !! INTERPRETATION: The Canvas Board as a whole is symbolic of LIFE !! The strength lies in color combinations and various textures. The tree rotated at 90 degree and the leaves spread far away actually makes us think that evrything need not be at the right place and with the right person too !! See the scratches, the random strokes... describing struggles in human life.. though the HUED PATH is still visible behind all of these !! Here lies the moral.. that whatever be the circumstances.. I BELIEVE, we have to continue on our DESTINED PATH !!! __________________________________________________________ This is another one themed: SIGNIFICANT EVENTS  IN GANDHI JI's LIFE It was organised by GANDHI BHAWAN, University of Delhi Here too, I got FIRST PRIZE. Answer also included under What are some truly good sketches or paintings portraying Gandhi Ji made by you?
