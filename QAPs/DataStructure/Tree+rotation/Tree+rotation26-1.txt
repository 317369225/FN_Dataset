Mind-Blowing Facts:  What are some interesting facts which are not commonly known?
From 1912 to 1948, in the Summer Olympics there were gold, silver, and bronze medals awarded not only in sports, but in Architecture, Literature, Music, Art, and Sculpture. In the 1948 Summer Olympics, Alex Diggelmann of Switzerland won both the silver and bronze medals for the same event.  That is an achievement that will probably never be duplicated. For reference, see Art competitions at the 1948 Summer Olympics.
