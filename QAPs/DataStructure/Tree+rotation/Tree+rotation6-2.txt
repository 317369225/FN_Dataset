Why aren't skip lists used more often instead of balanced trees?
So these were the only reasons I could come up with.  Skip lists, it seems to me, are just an alternative way of representing a search tree. 1)  Worst case logarithmic running time.  Hands down the most obvious reason.  Why open yourself up to DOS attacks when the worst case solution is readily available and works well? 2)  If you don't care about 1, then why not just use splay trees?  Splay trees are simple to implement, automatically adapt to your query distribution, and are perhaps one of the most malleable data structures imaginable (for example, implementing Euler tour trees on top of them is a snap).  Plus you'll make Danny Sleator happy.
