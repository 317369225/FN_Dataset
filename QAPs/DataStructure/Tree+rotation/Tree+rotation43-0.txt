What are the best sites available on the internet to learn dynamic programming, algorithms, and data structures?
Here is a website and a Youtube channel to learn dynamic programming, algorithms and data structures: Website: IDeserve Youtube channel: IDeserve Here are some good features I found on this: 1. Many problems are explained with the help of videos which makes it very easy to understand the problem within minutes. 2.  The Algorithm Visualization on the page is a great feature provided for  visualizing how an algorithm works at runtime for a given example.  Normally it takes careful observation to dry run a code, but through the  algorithm visualization given here, it becomes easier to understand. For example, check out the visualization given here: Create a balanced Binary Search Tree from a sorted array Here are videos on various topics: Programming Interview Questions Arrays - YouTube Strings - YouTube Trees - YouTube Linked Lists - YouTube Dynamic Programming Graph - YouTube Here are some of the good problems: Linked Lists and Stack Problems: Merge two sorted linked lists Reverse a Linked List - Recursive Reverse a Linked List - Iterative Reverse every alternate k nodes of a Linked List Find nth Node from the end of a Linked List Sum of Two Linked Lists using Stacks Sum of Two Linked Lists using Recursion | Set 1 LRU Cache Implementation Detect a loop in a linked list and find the node where the loop starts.
