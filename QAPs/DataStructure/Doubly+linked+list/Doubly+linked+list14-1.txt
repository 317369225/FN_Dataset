How should one go about implementing a thread-safe doubly linked-list without locking the entire list in C?
Be on a VAX, and use asm() to get to the insque and remque instructions. If you're not on a VAX with those instructions, and don't want to lock the list, then lock/mutex all THREE elements in one order (front to back, or back to front), and release the locks in the same order.   Special cases needed when there aren't yet two elements in the list. Given the amount of code and cycles it takes to do this properly, you are often better off locking the whole list for the time it takes to do the operation.   I've hardly ever seen code that puts locks in each element.
