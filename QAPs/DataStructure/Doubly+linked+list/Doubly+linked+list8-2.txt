What is the advantage of converting a given binary tree to a doubly-linked list?
Most binary trees are useful when they are also search trees. Assuming that you are folding a BST into a Linked List, you have a sorted list. If for some reason you have an algorithm which works best with a sorted list, then this would be useful.
