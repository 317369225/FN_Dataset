Why is doubly linked list used in LRU(Least Recently Used) implementation as in this link (Implement LRU Cache - GeeksforGeeks)?
The algorithm needs to store the pages in order from most recent to least recent. There are several datastructures that can be used to represent this. A linked list (either singly linked or doubly linked), or an array are the most obvious choices. This algorithm specifically needs to be able to remove items from the middle of the list and move them to the end. So for that reason arrays are not ideal: removing an element from the middle would require a lot of shifting. Singly linked lists could have worked, but are harder to implement correctly, because if you want to remove an item from the list you have to know its predecessor. So the doubly linked list was probably the easiestÂ  efficient solution that meets all the requirements.
