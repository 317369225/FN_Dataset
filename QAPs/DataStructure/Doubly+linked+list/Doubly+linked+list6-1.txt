How do I convert a binary tree to doubly linked list in Java?
The value of head remains null because it is never assigned any other value other than null. When you call the convert function the value of the actual argument(head) does not change, rather the formal argument(head) that receives the null is reassigned all of which is lost once the function terminates execution. It might sound confusing and even contradictory to the concept of call by reference but it is not. Call by reference states that the formal arguments receive the same reference rather than the value as that of actual arguments. Hence the changes in formal arguments are reflected in the actual arguments. When the formal argument is reassigned to a new reference, the effect is not reflected in the actual argument.
