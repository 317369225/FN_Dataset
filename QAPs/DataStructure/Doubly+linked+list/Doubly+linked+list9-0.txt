What is the difference between a deque and a doubly linked list?
A deque is an abstract data structure. It can be implemented either using a linked list or an array. It is a just concept, and the implementation depends upon the programmer. Think of it as a special type of queue which can accept elements both at the head and the tail. On the other hand, a doubly linked list is a concrete data structure, i.e. its implementation would be same for every programmer. It is a way for storing data. Just as arrays. Let me give an analogy. You have mud, bricks, stones, concrete, etc. All of these can be used to build structures like houses. Now a house is an abstract concept. It is just mud or bricks arranged in a specific way. If you change the arrangement, you would get, say, a bridge. Now, you can use either mud or bricks to build houses. Both have their pros and cons. While in cities it is better to build houses with bricks, in villages you would find houses of mud. Now compare these materials to arrays, linked lists, doubly linked lists, etc. All these are the building blocks. When used together or in isolation they help us create large structures such as queues, stacks, binary trees, etc. all of which are nothing but abstract concepts. You change the linked lists, you get a stack. You change it again you get a queue.
