Are tech companies demanding too much from software engineers these days?
It probably depends on what you are doing. Most of the things you described are for web (web applications, whatever you call them) developers. I don't know much about LAMP, I don't even know what MEAN stands for, I don't know anything about SQL or NoSQL, and I don't know Hadoop, Map Reduce, or AWS to any significant level. I also have no trouble getting jobs. I do know quite a bit about low level programming, high performance computing, concurrent programming, and machine learning however. Being able to solve new problems quickly on a whiteboard is not a specific technical skill. It's something all competent engineers have to do all the time, and have to be good at. So no, I don't think companies are asking too much. If you are marketing yourself as a web developer, you should probably know those things you listed, since they are the core technologies making up the modern internet. I don't think you really need to know much machine learning for those jobs. Also, if you are a junior developer, you can probably get a job only knowing half of those things. And then you can build up your portfolio as you get more experience on the job. It shouldn't take more than a few years, which is how long most people take to go from junior to senior. I would expect doctors to know just as many topics well. Or electrical engineers. Etc. No profession is "easy".
