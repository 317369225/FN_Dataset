What does it mean if a future programmer sucks or hates learning algorithms and data structures?
I find learning a skill in order to complete a task is more effective in acquiring the skill than studying aimlessly. My advice is that you focus on mastering the tools you need for the work you want to be done. If certain topics are important then they will eventually pop up and you'll be required to study them to achieve. It's also helpful to broaden your reading to all topics. Start with reading detailed overviews of the related CS topics and tackle them whenever needed. Just keep on practicing!
