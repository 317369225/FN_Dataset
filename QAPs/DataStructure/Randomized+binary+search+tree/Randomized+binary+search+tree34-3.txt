Are tech companies demanding too much from software engineers these days?
I think Ash Moorthy made a very good point. You need to read between the lines on these job descriptions. If you are very strong on computer science fundamentals and have an attractive track record in the specialization you are aiming for (web in this case) you should be alright. Specific languages and technologies make your CV stronger for specific roles, but at the end of the day you want to be a well rounded engineer who can adapt to a bunch of different roles. The software engineering market is changing so quickly that some of the things you mentioned might not be relevant in 6 months+. For instance, how cool was map reduce a few years ago? Â  So, if we go by this approach, I don't think companies are asking for too much. Having a deep understanding of CS fundamentals and some experience is not unreasonable at all.
