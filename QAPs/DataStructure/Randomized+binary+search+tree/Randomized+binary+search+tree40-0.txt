What does it mean if a future programmer sucks or hates learning algorithms and data structures?
A good developer knows his data structures and algorithms especially the basic ones. You might still be able to cobble together some code using several available tools but it will be hard to debug leaky abstractions[1] and keep growing by building on solid fundamentals. It's hard for most people to learn the basics for the first time. But spending the effort now will help you a lot in the long run. [1] http://www.joelonsoftware.com/ar...
