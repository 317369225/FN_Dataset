How do you write search algorithms?
An algorithm is just a step of steps that get you a result. So...how do you search for something? If the items are randomly placed in an array, you just look through all the items. (If there are lots of items in the list, this could take a while. If you expect to have lots of items and to be searching quite a bit, you probably don't want the items placed randomly in an array.) If the items are in an array in order, you can do a lot better (especially if the number of items is large). Think about what you'd do if someone said "I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 1,000,000" and asked you to guess it, and they'd tell you "higher" or "lower" after each wrong guess. You'd start with 500,000. Then, if it was "higher," 750,000. And so on, going halfway between the lowest number left and the highest number left every time. That's a common search algorithm (binary search). There may be different ways to search depending on how your data is stored. Check out trees (including binary search trees, which will have a search method that looks pretty familiar) and graphs.
