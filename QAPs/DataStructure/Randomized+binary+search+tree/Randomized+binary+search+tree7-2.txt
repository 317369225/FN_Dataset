What is the best approach to become better at C++?
Well, the answer really depends on what you already know of programming. I'm assuming you know nothing about programming, and want to start writing C++ programs. In that case, you should FIRST consider establishing a development environment. This means clearly you need to get a C++ compiler, i.e. a separate program that converts your C++ code to a separate runnable application. Now here too, there is a divergence based on your current platform. This may be either Windows, MAC, or Linux. On Windows, you could use Visual Studio Express. This is free to use, here's a link: Visual Studio Express Once you have this installed, you are ready to go. However, you still have some learning to do. You should read some of the excellent tutorials. Here's one: C++ Language - C++ Tutorials And then just take it from there, one step at a time... Happy coding! And keep looking up!
