What do students of Computer Science really learn?
I believe that the point of a CS degree is to teach how to create & understand formal models that take account of the medium of representation and the needs of their anticipated users. The creation of formal models is the domain of mathematicians but mathematicians do not worry about what medium their models are represented on. In computer science the limitation and situation of the medium is essential. Computers are good at processing and storage, they are very bad at combination and synthesis. This imposes a requirement of computational tractability on the models that computer scientists develop (programming, formal methods, software engineering, AI and theory of programming languages). Additionally computer systems are not isolated; they interact with all sorts of other systems and those interactions have to be accounted for (hci, networking and security) In addition computer scientists are required to deal with the fact that their executable models are expensive to implement, and therefore are required to develop cheaper models which approximate the system that they are seeking to implement but can then be interpreted by other computer scientists. Sometimes these are called designs, sometimes they are called documentation.
