Can an advanced high school student read and understand CLRS "Introduction to Algorithms"?
Yes, anyone can learn anything. It just might take more time than usual. Personally, I'll advice you to read a lighter but no less useful book like Introduction to Algorithms: A Creative Approach by Udi Manber. This is a really fascinating book! Take a look at the reviews on amazon to see what I mean. Rather than giving you a list of algorithms and proof of correctness as CLRS does, it teaches you how to think about algorithms by relying on parallels between designing algorithms and inductive proofs. The author also provides intuitive proofs and walks you through the steps required to come up with an algorithm rather than just giving you the algorithm. He also often presents wrong approaches and explains why they fail and shows how to strengthen the induction hypothesis to make it work. I think this is an excellent book for a high school student! Even someone who has read CLRS will still find the authors approach enlightening since it presents an intuitive way to think about algorithms which is different from the approach taken by CLRS. The only prerequisite for the book is to be comfortable with proofs by induction, but there is also a chapter on this topic in the book. Also, don't forget to solve the exercises in the book. The harder the exercises you solve, the more you'll get out of your learning. This advice is also true even if you end up reading CLRS. Solving the exercises is very important. EDIT - You will almost certainly need some background in discrete math (if you don't already) and you may find these MIT lectures very helpful, both for your study of algorithms and for learning some discrete math: 6.042  Mathematics For Computer Science 6.006: Introduction to Algorithms Updated 11w ago • View Upvotes
