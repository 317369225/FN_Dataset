Are tech companies demanding too much from software engineers these days?
Tech companies are demanding too little from software engineers these days. Between 25% and 50% of software engineers are best to be let go on the spot based on every randomly chosen month or even week of their work. Unfortunately, if we are talking about the US, we a) have an issue with labor law (sometimes an obviously right decision for product/business is not the best legal route), and b) have hard time hiring, and even finding engineers who are good enough. Thus, in this weird status quo, the best thing tech companies can do is to start demanding a bit more than they used to. It's still not enough, but that's our best shot. Some people might complain; we are aware of it and consider it a healthy state of the art. I feel obliged to add that my personal philosophy is to stick with the people who already are part of the team, keep investing into their training and into their career, overpay them, etc. Not only because it's the best choice in the long run -- although it almost certainly is --Â  but because most engineers with the right mindset can make it to be superstars, and observing and playing a role in this process is a worthwhile experience. With that in mind, I do think that software companies do ask for too little these days. After hiring engineers in San Francisco, I have to confess: myself included. True, we do look for proficiency in a couple languages, stacks and computer science topics; at the same time we happily make offers to candidates who are reasonably proficient in 0.75 stacks, have the right intuition, and keep their mind open to grow their skills with us, while making sure the company is moving forward altogether.
