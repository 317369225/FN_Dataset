What should a non CSIS guy prepare from the scratch to land in a decent IT profile job during placements?
Abhinav's answer is good, but it is a bit too extra for non-CSIS people and for people beginning from scratch. I appeared for Placements this semester and got offer from a good dream company (IT). So, I think I can be of slight help :D I am not a very brilliant coder or 9-10 pointer. I am an average 8 point someone with some taste for programming and solving problems. So, I focused more on preparation for Placements and did't do any internship during summer. You don't have to be a genius to get into companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Adobe etc. All you need is the right preparation. You have to cross to hurdles : Aptitude test and Interview                            Apttude test : These are very crucial to prepare for. Junta often doesn't focus much on aptitude test and thus fail to qualify for the technical interview rounds. The competition is tough remember. Main threats are the level 1 guys and the people who furiously prepare for CAT / GRE etc. There are many such people in BITS Pilani :D. Aptitude questions are very vast and it is not necessary to prepare everything. There are two categories of questions here: a. Quantitative aptitude and logical reasoning, and b. Technical Aptitude I did a lot of research on this and after giving the tests myself, I am listing some important topics for you: Quantitative : Percentages, profit and loss, ratio and proportion, averages, allegations, time and speed, time and work, , simple and compound interest, probability, permutations and combinations, number system and progressions. That's it. Do these from the book - quantitative aptitude by RS Aggarwal (That book is easy but sufficient for IT aptitude tests, seriously!! You may also try Quant for CAT by Arun Sharma if you like it) Logical Reasoning : Number and letter series, analogies, odd man out bla ba bla. For all of them, just do the 2 Reasoning booklets given in the TIME material for CAT. They are super cool, and won't take much time to complete. I did in 1 week only. Just get some basic skills. Thats it. Technical Aptitude : >> For C questions, do "Test your C skills" by Yashvant Kanetkar. Enough. >> Re-read the basics of  C language (seriously do it) >> Revise your DSA completely. Do basic questions also, not just the hi-fi ones. >> Read the Cormen book : Intro to algorithms. >> Do all the questions (they are not much) on Home - GeeksQuiz. It will help a lot. >> Do basics of C++ and object oriented programming. >> Java is also asked by some companies. So, better do the basics. >> That is it. Don't indulge in OS, DBSA, Networks. You don't have that time. But among these, if you want to do some, take OS only. Basics from OS are asked : processes, caches, etc etc.                             --------------------------------------------------- Interview questions: >> Read Data structures first. I did the basic book : "Data structures through C by Yashvant Kanetkar" and "Data Structures through C and C++" first. >> Read Cormen book on algorithms. Cover all important topics first. Leave graphs for later if you want. Don't do NP-hard problems etc. >> Once you cover the basics, do topic-specific questions from GeeksforGeeks - A computer science portal for geeks . >> Practice doing algorithm questions on Codechef and HackerRank (Many companies use Interviewstreet for the test, hackerrank is by same people) >> Do company specific questions on geeksfogeeks and Programming Interview Questions | CareerCup. >> Do design problems .Design means object oriented design mostly. They are available on the same websites.                             ---------------------------------------------------------- Discuss problems with your friends and talk out loud when doing them. At the end of the day, you need to show the person your knowledge and skills or deceive him if you don't have much skills :D . So, learn how to talk to people and be smart, not a nerd. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
