Can an advanced high school student read and understand CLRS "Introduction to Algorithms"?
I first got the CLR (there was no S in early editions) book in eighth grade because a used copy was sold -- almost given away -- along with a bunch of other older technical books at the local public library.  I read it then over three months and understood about half of it (I knew basic pre-calculus math and was studying calculus at the time).  By early tenth grade, having also gone to USACO camp once, I understood all of CLR and was asking my parents to order additional algorithms books from Amazon.
