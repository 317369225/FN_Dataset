Can an advanced high school student read and understand CLRS "Introduction to Algorithms"?
Definitely. Books are suppose to be read random access, and there are certainly parts of CLRS that are accessible to high schoolers. The entire book is honking huge, so a good approach is to start by searching for things you've heard about before, and partially understand (for me those were string searching and binary search trees). The presentation will have parts that look foreign to you, so you'll still learn plenty by 'reviewing' things that you already know. The new parts will in turn help you for the other chapters.
