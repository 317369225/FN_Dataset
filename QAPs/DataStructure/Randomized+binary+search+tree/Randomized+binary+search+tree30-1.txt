What do students of Computer Science really learn?
The stanfords SICP course has an awesome introductory video that really explains what actually computer science is. SICP Lecture 1A: - Computer Science is a misnomer. This is not a science and definitely not just restricted to just computations or even a computer. According to me[what I have understood in the last ten years] computer science that we do today is just another advanced engineering branch where you engineer different "how to solve problems". You either solve problems by either engineering new machines [like say new best hardware/chip] or by either engineering new constructs[languages/abstractions] to communicate with the machines efficiently and productively. As a student today in CS you are supposed to become an expert in one of the constructs while understand the scope and functioning of this whole system [machines and abstractions]
