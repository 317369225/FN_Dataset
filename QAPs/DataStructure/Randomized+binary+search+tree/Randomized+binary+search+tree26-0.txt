Which are the 10 algorithms every computer science student must implement at least once in life?
Note: nobody is holding any students down and forcing them to implement any algorithms, but if somebody was, I'd imagine it should be these. Note: some of these are more useful than others, and some I included because they make you learn so many more algorithms In place merge sort & heap sort with linear time heap building. Breadth first traversals of graphs & trees.  Dijkstra's algorithm w/ fibonacci heap Kruskal's algorithm w/ union find by rank deterministic quick select polymorphic type inference 2D voronoi diagram generation 2D convex hull generation Knapsack & related DP problems Ford–Fulkerson algorithm for max flow.
