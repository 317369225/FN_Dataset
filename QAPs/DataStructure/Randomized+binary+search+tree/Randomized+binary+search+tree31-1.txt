Randomness (statistics):Â Why does picking data samples or pivots randomly reduce the odds of poor performance or worst case, in some cases?
I'll try answering this for Quick Sort. Suppose you choose a pivot randomly, and suppose you get a good pivot 1 out of 10 times you randomly choose a pivot, you're in good shape to complete the sort in O(n log n) time. Let's see why. Since 1 out of 10 choices is a good choice (i.e. it splits the array into a constant fraction), 9 out of 10 pivots are bad pivots, and hence you are paying the cost of scanning the array 9 times in vain. However, the 10th time, you get lucky and reduce the height of the recursion tree so that the total height is O(log n). The constant is directly proportional to the number of bad pivot choices (9 in this case) that you've made.
