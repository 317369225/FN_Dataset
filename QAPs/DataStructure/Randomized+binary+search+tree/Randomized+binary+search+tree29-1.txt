What should I know from CLRS 3rd edition book if my aim is to get into Google?
Honestly, CLRS is great for theoretical study but it's far beyond what you need for interviews. It wouldn't be efficient for you to jump back and forth through the book, trying to pick out certain subjects. Also, the problems in coding interviews are designed to be solved in 30 minutes or less. The problems in CLRS are, generally speaking, much more difficult. Just buy yourself a copy of Cracking the Coding Interview (or something similar), which is specifically designed with your goal in mind, and study directly from there. If you feel like there is a section in Cracking the Coding Interview about which you would like to learn more or in which you might need more practice, then you can use CLRS as a reference. And perhaps most importantly, apply to a lot of companies that interest you and do interviews with them. You will gain confidence and get better at explaining your thinking, which is an incredibly important aspect of the interview. Much of the time, you don't even need to get the answer totally right to pass; you just have to show the interviewer(s) that you are a good thinker!
