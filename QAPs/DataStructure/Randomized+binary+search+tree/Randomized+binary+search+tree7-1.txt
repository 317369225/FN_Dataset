What is the best approach to become better at C++?
This answer is going to sound strange but this is the truth. To excel in any programming any language you should master "Programming" and not learn the language. We can consider c++, Pythion, Java etc to be like a normal language ie: English, Chinese, Italian. The real spice in any of these is in literature, good writers with good skill write good literature, and bad writers often kill the language. The idea is to belong to that small circle of people who actually know actual programming and create amazing products out of the language. For someone who want to do this can very easily do so by learning the real logics and idea in play and what it takes to making a great program. Learn Programming, not Programming language first. UPDATE : I am sorry that I forgot to add any kind of guidelines on how to get this done. The following was my response to a comment fromm a friend who asked how. First have a basic idea of what programming is all about : Computer programming Many of the online courses in programming by Coursera, edX  and Udacity all give greate concentration on programming ideologies than the language I would recommend :  Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup Once you have read that you should be clear about the thinking that goes behind a program. Then read. The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S. Skiena Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein
