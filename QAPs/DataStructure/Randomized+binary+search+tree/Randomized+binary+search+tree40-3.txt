What does it mean if a future programmer sucks or hates learning algorithms and data structures?
I don't see it as a big deal. If you focus only on web development, you wouldn't probably ever need to know what data structures or algorithms are there or how they work. In the other hand, it helps to think about things correctly. Actually, graphs and trees are one of the most useful things one can know. Understanding those two, allows you to understand complexity analysis, databases, artificial intelligence and essentially any area in computer science. But computer science is more theoretical than programming, and as a programmer you don't need to understand or be familiar with those. Most of the programmer's don't understand those either and still they can program. I was once given a task to implement singly linked list in a job interview in PHP. That was funny since you'd never except encounter that kind of task in PHP world. My interviewee said that all candidates failed terribly (except me) and he wondered if anyone can still program. I wrote an employment contract 15 minutes later. So, understanding different subjects always helps and you never know what is coming on your way. Go, learn and practice if you have the interest and don't worry, you'll get it eventually!
