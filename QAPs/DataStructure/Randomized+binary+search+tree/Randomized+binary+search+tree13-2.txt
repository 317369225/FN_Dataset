Can an advanced high school student read and understand CLRS "Introduction to Algorithms"?
Yes. CLRS doesn't assume knowledge of any particular programming language or paradigm (though knowing programming fundamentals is obviously helpful for understanding pseudocode). In addition, the book requires little mathematical knowledge beyond single-variable calculus (which is only necessary for perhaps 2% of the material), though exposure to proofs through a rigorous high school math curriculum and/or contest math is helpful for understanding why the algorithms in CLRS work. However, if you're still in high school, a better resource for getting started with algorithms might be the USACO training portal (http://train.usaco.org), which contains concise and informative texts for various algorithmic topics, along with complementing sets of exercises. Reading CLRS alone won't really help you if you never get to use the algorithms you're reading about, and the USACO training material includes some great problems to practice implementing them. As a bonus, you'll learn how to do well on contests, which can win you a free trip to South Carolina.
