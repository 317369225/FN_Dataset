What should one do to crack the interview at Tower Research Capital?
I was selected for the position of "Strategist" at Tower research in Dec'12. This position has a significant skillset requirement overlap with the developer position that you mentioned. Following are the areas one should focus on during preparation, will highlight which one is more important : Master C++: Learn about the object oriented programming, STL, implement standard algorithms in C++, use C++ for hobby projects wherever applicable, and so on. Basic Mathematics: Methods of proof, recurrence relations, pigeon hole principle, groups, probability, combinatorics, distributions, random variables, basic number theory, etc. Algorithms/Problem solving: sorting algorithms, algorithm design techniques: dynamic programming, greedy, divide & conquer, data structures: hash tables, binary search trees, heaps, etc. Systems: (this is not very important for the position of strategist but only for developer) operating systems, concurrency control, unix system calls, computer networks, routing, etc. For specific resources you can refer to Chinmay Chauhan's answer.
