What is the most unusual data structure mashup you have used or heard about?
I nominate the Treap. A treap is simultaneously a binary search tree and a heap. When a key is inserted into a treap, it is randomly assigned a "priority". Nodes of the tree are ordered in binary search tree-order according to the key (for a given node v, all descendants of its left child have key smaller than v, and all descendants of its right children have key larger than v) and order by heap-order according to priority (every descendent of a node v has lower priority than v). One can show that, for randomly assigned priorities, the tree will have logarithmic height with high probability, as you would expect for a good binary search tree.
