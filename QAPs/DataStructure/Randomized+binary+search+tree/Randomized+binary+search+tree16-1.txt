What is a possible implementation for std::deque?
@Victor Z. Peng, you only need O(ln N) if you want to be right 100% of the time. In practice, so much infrastructure in the world depends on SHA256 hashes being unique that you should think of it like a lighting strike or a lottery win; so hilariously implausible as to warrant restarting any software that may have crashed. :) So if you just use a HashMap instead of a TreeMap, there are your constant time inserts. Each value in the (key, value) map is a node that contains the data blob as well as pointers to the next and previous. Thus, a doubly linked list is stored as metadata, allowing the constant-time erase, append, etc. tl;dr: HashMap + Luck + Doubly-Linked-List == constant time heaven
