What is the best approach to become better at C++?
I’ve answered this way for a few programming questions so far but I think it still holds true: Pick a problem that you'll find interesting and try to solve it with [your language here]. For instance, create your own string class, trying to use templates, abstract classes, polymorphism and inheritance (in sensible ways) in your design. Don’t take shortcuts. Build it like you intend this code to go into production. Build a set of unit tests for your class and debug all those scenarios. You’ll now have a basic but practical understanding of how all these language features hang together and their implications when it comes to debugging, etc. and you can move on to a more complex project where you can start to think about design patterns, program structure, etc.
