How do you write search algorithms?
You are at the base of a Mt. Everest with me. "See that mountain top?" I ask. "That's where we're going." "How are we going to get there?" you ask. Do you want to find the optimal path to the top, any path to the top, or just a good path to the top? How much knowledge of the terrain do you have? Do you need to do a brute force search through all possible paths? Armed with an understanding of algorithms and order of complexity analysis, go google for search algorithms and find the one that meets your needs. Is the data on disk? In Memory? Distributed? How high is that peak?
