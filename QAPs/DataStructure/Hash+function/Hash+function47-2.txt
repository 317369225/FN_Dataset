How do I determine the number of hash functions needed while doing LSH?
The theoretical numbers can be found by checking the original theoretic papers on the LSH function you are using. For minhashing, c.f., Mario's link. In practice, you may want to tune down the numbers, as the numbers given above are designed for the worst case and allowing for loose inequality bounds used in the proof (e.g., union bound). For example, while you need to use many hash tables to solve the approximate nearest neighbor query within a range of [r, r*c) using p-stable random projections, Indyk showed that only one hash table is needed if the data has constant "intrinsic dimensionality" (see the appendix in the SoCG04 paper).
