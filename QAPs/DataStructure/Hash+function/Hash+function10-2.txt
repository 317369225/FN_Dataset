What are some nontrivial weaknesses in hash functions?For instance with SHA-1, the wikipedia article quotes "Roughly, we exploit the following two weaknesses: One is that the file preprocessing step is not complicated enough; another is that certain math operations in the first 20 rounds have unexpected security problems."  What sort of security problems are they?  Other examples would be appreciated as well.
