Why do some hash functions use a prime number as base?In cryptography or in String matching(say Rabin Karp), some hash functions use a prime number as radix for calculating the modulo. What is the significance of using a prime number. Is it to assign uniqueness and minimize collision of hash values?
For non-primes with a small factor, there is erasure of the past. For example, if you hash with an even number, 2 is a factor, so you end up just shifting the bits left every step, and after 32 steps, the first bit you hash is lost entirely, so you lose the early information. For a number divisible by 3, same thing in base three, and so on, so a prime keeps you safe.
