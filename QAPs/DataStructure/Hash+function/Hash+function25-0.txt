Is Ethernet CRC the best "default" hash function to use?Or is modulo a product of larger primes a better default?  By "best" I mean good randomness / low collisions, without concern for cryptographic issues.
Choosing a "best" hash function depends on your application.  The goal of the ethernet CRC is to reliably detect multiple bit errors with a low probability that a corrupted message will have the same result as the genuine message.  The use case was natural bit errors, not intentional attacks with substituted messages with identical hashes. CRC is readily implemented in hardware, which makes it ideal for on-the-fly marking and verification of stream data. CRC is excellent for error detection, but an attacker can readily alter both the data and the CRC, so CRC is only a useful defense against natural errors. You can also look at The Limitations of the Ethernet CRC and TCP/IP checksums for error detection for more discussion.
