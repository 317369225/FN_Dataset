How do I determine the number of hash functions needed while doing LSH?
This depends on how sensitive to false positives and false negatives you need to be. To increase the F1 score you will have to increase the number of hash functions. Now, given a fixed number of such functions, one can show that using the banding technique and composing AND and OR constructions allows one to drastically reduce the number of false positives and false negatives. Take a look here:Â  3.4.2 Analysis of the Banding Technique and 3.6.3 Amplifying a Locality-Sensitive Family from Mining of Massive Datasets.
