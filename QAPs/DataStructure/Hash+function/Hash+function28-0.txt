What is an intuitive explanation of the Davies-Meyer hash function?
Davies-Meyer is a compression function that can be used to create cyptographic hash functions, a simple example would be a Merkle-Damgard chain of Davies-Meyer constructions. The basic idea of the D-M construction is that you compress a block of text into "n" bits using an encryption algorithm putting an "n" bit random initial value as message and using your block of text as the key. Thus the result after encryption is an n-bit block. It is very important to then XOR the result of the encryption with the initial value, otherwise it is very easy to create a collision and that's a big no-no for a cryptographic hash function. For example let's say you don't XOR, you only encrypt the IV with the block of text you are hashing. Let's call the result h. h=E(IV,text) We can now create a random block of the same size as the IV and decrypt. text2 = D(IV2,h) And now we know that: E(IV2,text2) = h Then E(IV,text) = E(IV2,text2) And we have created a collision. I will leave as an excercise to show why xoring the result with the initial plaintext avoids these easy collisions. DM constructions can be chained, you can feed the result of DM as the plaintext of the next DM using the next block of text as the key, etc. If I remember correctly SHA256 is a combination of Davies-Meyer compression functions using Merkle-Damgard and SHACAL-2 as its encryption algorithm.
