For a simple hash function h(k) = k mod M, why should M be a prime number?
Originally Answered: Cryptography: What is the advantage of taking a prime modulo when calculating hash functions?Let's consider the function f a (x)=(ax)  mod  p  .  If p is a prime then the domain and range of f a   is Z p   as long as a≢0  (mod p  ).  The reason for this is trivial because we can invert the function by multiplying by the inverse of a and therefore it's a bijection. And that is the main reason that using a prime modulus might be preferable to a composite one.  It eliminates a lot of bad choices for a (or b) and avoids allowing divisibility (aside from divisibility by p itself) to propagate to the result of the hash function.  I'm not aware of any stronger properties a prime modulus might offer.
