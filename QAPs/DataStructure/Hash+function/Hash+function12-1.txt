Hash Functions: What is an intuitive explanation of the HMAC algorithm?
I have made this Video hope it will help you to understand what HMAC do.. HMAC(keyed-hash message authentication code ) is a computed "Signature" often sent along with some data.The HMAC is used to verify(authenticate)that the data has not been altered or replaced.Here is a metaphor video explanation!!! You are going to mail a package to Here's what you can do: Before you send her the package, place another copy of the photograph inside a small locked box. Keep the key. Place the small locked box inside the package along with the original photograph you are The beauty here is that you don't need to "remember" anything about what you originally sent her; everything you need to ensure legitimacy of the photo comes back inside the package. In the example above, the small locked box represents an HMAC. Your key is the HMAC's key. The photograph is the data you are applying the HMAC to. The Sharp Turtles Updated 8 Apr â€¢ View Upvotes
