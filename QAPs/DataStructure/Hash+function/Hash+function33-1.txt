How do I choose the right hashing function for a hashtable implementation?I am working on a project in C++ where I will have to store hundreds of thousands of String keys & pointer values in a hashtable. There are plenty of good Hashtable implementations but I'm not sure how to choose the right hashing function. Any advice?
First I'd try using whatever function comes as a built-in default for your hashtable implementation. If it works, use it. Otherwise, I like FNV-1a, which seems to perform well and is easy to implement. However, I came across this comparison paper http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/fi... which seems to favor BOB and OAAT, documented here http://www.burtleburtle.net/bob/...
