Is the hash function H  defined below resistant to collisions?
A hash function is collision resistant if it is hard to find two inputs that hash to the same output; that is, two inputs a and b such that H(a) = H(b), and a ≠ b. Per this definition, it is quite easy to see the collision problem in the given construction using AES (or whatever block cipher): -- if H_K(a,a) = H_K(b,b) = 0, while a ≠ b -- if H_K(a,b) = H_K(b,a), while a ≠ b To determine whether the construction of a hash function is good is non-trivial. Expertise in this area is expected. A good start is wiki and some crypto courses (e.g., https://www.coursera.org/course/...)
