Why can't hash functions be reversed?
The simple answer is that there is information lost during the execution of the one-way hash function. This unlike encryption that is reversible. In the case of the modulo operation you mentioned, 1%13 yields 1 but also 14%13 yields 1 and 27 yields 1. Many possible values of x yield 1. So given 1 do you return 1 or 14 or 27 or â€¦ In your example as well, your reversed formula will only return one possible value of x and will never yield x=1. If x were the key which value of x do you return? If you were doing a brute force then there is potentially quite a substantial amount of x you need to try to obtain the right key. Just as a note, using simply modulo isn't good enough for a cryptograhic/secure hash function. But, it does serve as a demonstration of irreversibility.
