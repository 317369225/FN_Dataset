Where can I find effective hash functions for strings?I'm looking for quick and effective hash function samples preferably with O(1) time.
Assuming you have your data available ahead of time, see Minimal Perfect Hashing ( Like Jillis' answer, again on Bob's site: http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash... )
