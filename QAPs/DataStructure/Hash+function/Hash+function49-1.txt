Why is hashing function used in asymmetric cryptography?
There are various objective of having those ways in cryptography. Not having hash wih message can expose you to message integrity risk. In order to achieve confidentiality, integrity and authenticity you need to have digitally signed hash value. the hashing function ensures the integrity of message and signing of this hash value provides authentication and nonrepudiation. Coming to your thought process. you are providing confidentiality by encrypting it and as you are signing it with your private key authenticity is also achieved. What you are not providing is integrity. What stops me from decrypting your message with your pulic key and modify the message calculate hash and sent it to target. Envelope is encrypted using receivers public key this means only receiver can decrypt is using his private key no one else can see it. Confidentiality achieved. Hash value is encrypted using sender's private key, this tells us sender has sent it(non repudiation achieved) and it confirms that it has come from valid originator.
