What should every programmer know about hash tables and hash functions?
To elaborate on the excellent answer Xanda gave: "Hash table" is a fairly general term, not a one-size-fits-all thing. You can implement one in a number of different ways, optimized to the characteristics of your data set. For example, if inserts are going to be infrequent but lookups frequent, you can pick an implementation that is highly optimized for lookups while making inserts expensive. Or if you know that you will never delete items, you can choose implementations that are appropriate only in that situation. Or if your initial data set is small but you know that it will grow by two orders of magnitude through continuous use over the next ten years, you can pick a scheme that will accommodate that. So what should you know?Â  Before you start designing a hash table implementation, make sure you really understand the characteristics of your data set -- both today and in the future. And document those characteristics well along with the design documents and code!!! Because one day someone will want to change those assumptions and she/he will need to know if the hash table needs to be changed or re-implemented accordingly.
