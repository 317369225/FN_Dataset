What is the hash function used in unordered_map STL?
When you use unordered_map, you need to provide it with a hash function to use. The third type parameter of unordered_map is supposed to be a function object type which satisfies the hash function type requirements (basically, it represents a function that takes the key type and returns a value of size_t). If you do not explicitly provide a third type parameter for unordered_map, it defaults to std::hash<KeyType>. Specializations of std::hash are already provided in the standard library for many basic types. You can provide a particular value of the hash function type in the constructor to use for this particular map. If you do not provide it, it defaults to the default-constructed value of the hash function type.
