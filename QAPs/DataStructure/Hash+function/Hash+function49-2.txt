Why is hashing function used in asymmetric cryptography?
Hashing can boil down an arbitrary file size into a small string. It is far more efficient to encrypt a little string of characters than it is to encrypt a very large file. Sometimes, you care about integrity more than you care about confidentiality. For instance when releasing an operating system image file, most Linux distributions will also provide a hash for comparison after a user downloads the file. They don't care about encrypting the contents of the OS image - there are no secrets there. They simply want users to have assurance that the file is identical before and after the download.
