What is meant by 'random hash function'?What is difference between a hash function and a random hash function?
It could mean one of two kinds of hashing methods: a) uniform hashing; or b) universal hashing: the hash function itself is chosen randomly from a set possible hash functions. Uniform Hashing Good hash functions are those where the slots that keys hash to are independent of the slots other keys have hashed to. So, even if there are patterns in the list of keys, the hash values generated by the hash function, must be independent of such patterns. One typical approach is to calculate the hash value as the remainder when the (integer) key is divided by a specific prime number (the prime number must not be related to any patterns in the distribution of the keys). Universal Hashing Here, the hash function itself is chosen randomly from a set of possible hash functions, independently from the keys that will be stored in the hash table. This is typically employed to subvert an adversary that is trying to cause all keys to the same slot, which, if it were to happen, degrade retrieval performance of the hash table significantly: Î˜(n) instead of O(1). Because the hash function is chosen at random when the hash table is first used/instantiated, we know that no single input will always cause worst-case performance.
