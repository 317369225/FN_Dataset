How does the hash function work in hashing?
Wikipedia says that "A hash function is any function that can be used to map digital data of arbitrary size to digital data of fixed size, with slightÂ  differences in input data producing very big differences in output data." What it says essentially is this: Many-a-times, a corporation or an organization have to store huge amounts of data. This could be anything - the manufactured products or the employees working etc. Bigger the organization, greater will be the size of information. An easy way to store this information is in the form of Tables. But, these tables can grow huge. Now, to save searching time and to organize the data in a better way, these entries are hashed. Now, we come to the hash function. To hash an entry, its ID is used. It can be hashed in many ways. If the ID is just a number, it can be divided by some other number N and remainder becomes hash value. Entries with same hash value are grouped together. Any structure comprising of such groups can be searched very efficiently. For string IDs, their length or ASCII(or Unicode) values can be used in a similar fashion. Special care is taken to decide the value of N so that the function returns optimal distributions.
