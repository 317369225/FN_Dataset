What is the best article on hashing/hash functions?Apart from the one from wikipedia.
They may not be the best articles, but I have published a few freely available research papers you may want to look at: Daniel Lemire, The universality of iterated hashing over variable-length  strings, Discrete Applied Mathematics  160 (4-5), 2012. http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1715 Daniel Lemire and Owen Kaser, Recursive n-gram hashing is pairwise  independent, at best, Computer Speech & Language 24 (4), pages  698-710, 2010. http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.4676 Owen Kaser and Daniel Lemire, Strongly universal string hashing is fast http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4961
