What are some fast H3 (universal) hash function implementations for C or C++?I have found and optimized this class https://github.com/bro/bro/blob/... to my data size of 4 bytes, but wonder if anything faster exists, perhaps exploiting SSE instructions?
We recently tried to use recent SSE instructions to construct an efficient strongly universal hash function. The results were a bit disappointing. However, we found that a simple multilinear hash family could get you strong universality and it costs only 0.2 CPU cycle per byte.
