What are "preimages" in the context of cryptographic hash functions?This is a follow-up question to How secure is MD5?.
Suppose y = MD5(x). A "preimage attack" on MD5 says "given y, find some x' such that MD5(x') = y." The value x' is called a "preimage." Note that x' may be different than x. In fact, because MD5 maps an arbitrary length input to a finite length output, there exist infinitely many input values that map to a particular output. It's just difficult to find such preimages from the output alone. A "second preimage attack" is an attack where the adversary is given both x and y = MD5(x), then the adversary is challenged to come up with an x' such that MD5(x') = MD5(x) = y, and x' != x. This gives more power to the adversary because it is allowed to see one preimage of the desired target value before the adversary is challenged to come up with another preimage.
