Why do some hash functions use a prime number as base?In cryptography or in String matching(say Rabin Karp), some hash functions use a prime number as radix for calculating the modulo. What is the significance of using a prime number. Is it to assign uniqueness and minimize collision of hash values?
You are right this is what my instructor had told me on being asked the same.. but I had taken a small course on programming just check out what others say.Since more less the collisions more effective is the use of linked list.
