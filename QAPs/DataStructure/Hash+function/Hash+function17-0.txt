What is the state of the art in constructing perfect hash functions?A follow up question : In layman's terms, how does "compress, hash and displace (CHD)" perfect hashing algorithm work?
CMPH - C Minimal Perfect Hashing Library shows the complete progression towards the state of the art which is the Compress, hash and Displace(CHD) Algorithm. One recent publication confirms this : ...The state-ofthe-art construction [5] takes linear time; the representa tion size can be as low as 0.67 bits per key for m = 2n. The evaluation time is O(1)... Femi G. Olumofin, et al. Privacy-Preserving Queries over Relational Databases PS : Follow up question for a Layman description ofÂ  this algorithm and what it achieves. In layman's terms, how does "compress, hash and displace (CHD)" perfect hashing algorithm work?
