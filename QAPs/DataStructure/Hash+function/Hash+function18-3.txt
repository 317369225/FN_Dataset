Where can I find effective hash functions for strings?I'm looking for quick and effective hash function samples preferably with O(1) time.
Well, the hashing algorithm's effiectivenss depends on your sample input. For simple input I personally prefer the Bernstein Hash. In case you're using Java, use hashCode() to get the hash value. If you want to have a good insight into the thing, I recommend you to have a look at http://eternallyconfuzzled.com/t...
