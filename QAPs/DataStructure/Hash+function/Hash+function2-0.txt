What is meant by 'random hash function'?What is difference between a hash function and a random hash function?
I slightly disagree with Joubert Nel's answer. Random hashing simply means that you pick the hash function randomly from a set of possible hash functions. It does not imply that the hashing is either universal or uniform. Both Ruby and Perl use random hashing, for details see Use random hashing if you care about security?  http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2... For a quick mathematical overview, see the first few pages of the following paper: Daniel Lemire, The universality of iterated hashing over variable-length strings, to appear in Discrete Applied Mathematics, Discrete Applied Mathematics 160 (4-5), 604--617 (2012) http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1715 Updated 26 Jan 2012 • View Upvotes
