How do I choose the right hashing function for a hashtable implementation?I am working on a project in C++ where I will have to store hundreds of thousands of String keys & pointer values in a hashtable. There are plenty of good Hashtable implementations but I'm not sure how to choose the right hashing function. Any advice?
MurmurHash3 (http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/) is uniform and fast. I believe it's meant for non-cryptographic uses. It's also the default choice for the fastutil package (Java).
