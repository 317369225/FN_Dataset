What is a hash function?
A hash function is one that produces a unique identifier for data. Its often used to see if data has been changed. Common hash functions used are MD5 and SHA 256. The other explanations are sufficient for in depth information, but ill give you another example: Hash function is -> John -> 123456 John2 -> 347886 John! -> 488897 Johnny Mnemonic -> 266789 Southwestern Omelette -> 123456 In the hash functions Im familiar with it outputs the same number of characters. In this example there are six. Notice that the first and the last examples have the same output. Its possible that two completely different inputs can have the same output. That's why its called a hash function.Â  Hope that helps.
