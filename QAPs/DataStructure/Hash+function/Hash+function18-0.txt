Where can I find effective hash functions for strings?I'm looking for quick and effective hash function samples preferably with O(1) time.
I can point you to the FNV hash function. It has nice properties for strings such as: simple, high dispersion of bits (so for similar strings it returns very different results) and good hashing for small strings. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fow... More info (and another widely used hash function) can be found on Bob Jenkins' site: http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash...
