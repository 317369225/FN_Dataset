What is the fastest secure hash function recommended for general purpose use on x86?Needs to be both collision and preimage resistant. This is a follow-up question to How secure is MD5?.
Do you need collision resistance and preimage resistance? Then look at SHA2-256 or the candidates for the SHA-3 competition that have advanced to the second round. http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/h... "Fastest" depends on your harware and use case; that link has sample implementations for the SHA-3 canddiates that have been optimized by the teams proposing them for purposes of engaging in the competition. So that should be a good place to start for benchmarking. If you need something off the shelf in Javascript, there is a SHA-2 256 implementation in JavaScript here http://anmar.eu.org/projects/jss... As to why these recommendations, SHA-2 256 has no known attacks yet, but it was designed before the recent wave of attacks on hash functions. Therefore the National Institute of Science and Technology is running a competition to select a new "SHA-3" algorithm. Can you say more about how you will use this hash function? That might help figure out if you need one of these hash functions or if there are simpler alternatives. Edit to respond to comment: OK, in that case start with SHA-2 256. There's an optimized implementation in openSSL; Berk D. Demir's benchmarks are a great start. Should just work, except that the output of the function is 256 bits now. If that causes performance problems either edit this question or raise a followup.
