What is the longest time an astronaut can spend in space before it is too hard to re-acclimatize to Earth?
Being in that we are still in the infancy of prolonged human space missions this is a tough question to know for sure.  According to certain people such as Robert Zubrin, who is a outspoken proponent of a mission to Mars, he has said that somebody who spends years on the red planet may face untoward effects upon returning.  Gravity acts on all our organs.  Once you start living on a planet with 1/3 the gravity of earth, the organs in our body would start to atrophy and diminish.  Our blood may flow differently without as much gravity, our bones wouldn't be subject to the same stress, etc.  Under zero gravity, the effects are even more pronounced.  There are interesting studies for this type of muscle and bone atrophy on earth.  NASA and other organizations will conduct studies where volunteers/patients will be limited to laying in bed for months at a time.  Virtually every movement is monitored by the researchers and patients may spend entire days in bed without standing as too intentionally atrophy muscles.  Some of these patients affectionally refer to themselves as "terranauts".  Mary Roach chronicles these unheralded heroes in her book "Packing for Mars".
