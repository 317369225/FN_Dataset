How should I choose whether I should use Student's t-test, Mann–Whitney U-test or ANOVA?
The test depends on the type of data you have and also on what you want to test. Below is the summary of all the tests. 1. T test: Comparing the mean of 1. One sample set with a constant with unknown variance. 2. two sample sets with unknown variances. The sample sizes of the sample sets need not be same.  [math]H_0[/math] = Sample means are equal.  [math]H_a[/math] = Sample mean are different. Test Statistic One sample t test [math]t = \frac{\bar{x}- \mu}{s/\sqrt{n})} [/math] Two sample t test with equal variance(still unknown!) equal sample size. [math]t = \frac{\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2} }{s_{x_1x_2}/\sqrt{n})}[/math] where [math]s_{x_1x_2} = \sqrt{\frac{s_{x_1}^2+s_{x_2}^2}{2}}[/math] Two sample t test with equal variance and unequal sample size. [math]t = \frac{\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2} }{s_{x_1x_2}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}})}[/math] where [math]s_{x_1x_2} = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_{x_1}^2+(n_2-1))s_{x_2}^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}[/math] Two sample t test with unequal variance and unequal sample size. [math]t = \frac{\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2} }{s_{x_1x_2}}[/math] where [math]s_{x_1x_2} = \sqrt{\frac{s_{x_1}^2}{n1}+\frac{s_{x_2}^2}{n_2}}[/math] Critical Values are can be found in Student's t-distribution table. Accept or Reject the Null hypothesis depending on the test statistic and the critical value(Accept null if the absolute value of the test statistic is less than the critical value). 2. ANOVA(ANalysis Of VAriance) ANOVA is used to test the means of more than two sample tests. [math]H_0 : \mu_1 = \mu_2 ... = \mu_n[/math]  [math]H_a: [/math]Atleast 2 means are different Test procedure. OLS(Ordinary Least Square) Regression is performed on the data set. Procedure. 1.All the data from all the sample sets is put under a column. 2. We then define n-1(n being the number of sample sets and not the sample size) dummy variables where the ith dummy takes a value 1 if that sample is from set i else it takes a value 0. 3. Perform Linear Regression. 4. Perform a F test on the regression model. 5. If the model is significant, then reject the Null Hypothesis else accept the Null. 3. Mann- Whitney U test Mann- Whitney U test is performed when we want to test if the 2 sample sets differ greatly or not. The data should be an ordinal data. [math]H_0[/math] = Samples don't differ greatly [math]H_a[/math] = Sample differ greatly. Procedure. 1.Rank all the data according to their values. 2. If a sample from one set in this ranked data is higher than 'k' samples of the other set, then assign a value 'k' for that sample. 3. Repeat step two for each of the samples. 4. Sum all the values for each of the sets. 5. Take the minimum of the two values. Let's call it U. The test statistic is [math]Z = \frac{U-\frac{n_An_B}{2}}{\sqrt{\frac{n_An_B(n_A+n_B+1)}{12}}}[/math]  The test statistic follows Normal Distribution. Using the Standard normal table Accept or Reject the Null hypothesis.
