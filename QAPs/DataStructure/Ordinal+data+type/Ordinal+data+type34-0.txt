What if large amount of oil was found under the Empire State Building?
No one is going to tear down the Empire State Building for any amount of oil. It's a historical building, and New York real estate ain't cheap. There's also no reason to tear it down. It's quite easy to directionally drill from a site up to several miles away and still hit a reservoir target. Of course, in NY, "several miles away" still puts you in a pretty urban area. A small amount of oil wouldn't be worth developing, given how difficult and expensive it will be to acquire drilling rights, land, and permits. But if the oil reservoir is truly large, someone could find an old building to tear down to make a drill site. Then they could build something like the camouflaged drilling rigs routinely used for drilling in Los Angeles: http://www.cracked.com/article_1... The hardest part of getting oil from beneath New York City would definitely be acquiring mineral rights. There would be hundreds of different owners above the reservoir who may attempt to stop the project. There would also need to be extensive geological investigation to ensure that no ground subsidence would occur. Uneven subsidence could obliterate the underground infrastructure that keeps New York running -- water mains, electricity lines, steam pipes, subways, and data trunks. Subsidence is rare, particularly for deep reservoirs, but there would need to be absolute confidence that the rock strata were fully compacted prior to oil drilling. Environmental reviews, city ordinances for noise, construction code, and many other issues could potentially halt oil drilling. It's difficult to do any kind of major infrastructure development in New York, and oil drilling is not yet an ordinary activity in the US Northeast. With all that, I would bet against any oil reservoir under the Empire State Building being economical to develop.
