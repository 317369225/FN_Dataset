What are the implications of Russia's announcement that it will begin long-range bomber patrols over the Gulf of Mexico?
I think Igor Markov and Dennis Ferguson have it. The higher operational tempo of the Russian armed forces are an attempt to regain some of the respect that the former Soviet military earned prior to the collapse. They've been taking flights near and into other nations' airspace, having the same effect as the Led Zeppelin cow bellâ€”making noise, but not adding any real meaning to the album. Now, probing into one of the major test ranges used by the US Air Force is another way they're looking to transmogrify annoyance into might.
