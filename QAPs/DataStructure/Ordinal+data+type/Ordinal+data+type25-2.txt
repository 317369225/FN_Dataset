Statistics (academic discipline):Â If I'm trying to find the relationship between two categorical variables, with possible values 0 (didn't happen), 1, 2 and 3 (happened a lot), is calculating the correlation coefficient the best I can do?
If these variables have the same level of categories, which mean the same (eg. Dependent with multiple categories and its prediction will have same number of levels and rach level will mean the same), it can be useful to use kappa statistic/test. This simply tells us the rate of agreement between the levels of 2 variables. If this scenario is not right, you can do a chi square test. Lower the p value, higher the correlation. In general, refer below. Questions searching for direct methods from the stats library are usually found here. http://stats.stackexchange.com/q...
