Can you explain to a beginner what object-oriented programming is?
Let's take a simple blogging application. What it has? Blog posts, authors who publish blog posts, and users who view and comment on blog posto. Now you can see the objects. A blog post is an object. An author is an object. A user is also an object. What are the properties of a blog post. A blog post has a title, description, published date and an author. Those are the properties of blog post object. What actions can be performed on a blog post? A blog post can be added, edited, viewed and deleted. Let's take the author object. What properties an author has? A name, gender, birthdate, country etc. What tasks can be performed by an author? Can login, logout, add/edit/delete blog posts by interacting with the blog post objects. What are the properties of a user? Name, email address, country, gender, avatar etc. A user can register, login, logout, change avatar,Â  and by interacting with blog posts he can view and comment on blog posts as well. As you can see now it's a logical way of organizing our code. The point is to identify objects and their properties and behaviors and then encaplate those properties and behaviors inside an entities which belongs to them and finally getting those objects to communicate between each other to perform tasks based on our requirements. Once you identifed objects in your problem domain you can make use of a programming languages to implement those objects and get them to communicate with each other.
