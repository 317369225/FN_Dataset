Which online Python course is the best?
I want to add a note to these excellent answers: First, are you trying to learn programming using python as your first language? Or are you a programmer trying learn python as an additional language? dive into python, http://www.diveintopython.net/ , is a wonder book for a programmer to learn python, but it will not teach you programming. On the other hand, Learn python the hard way, while another great resource, teaches you to use python as your first programming language, but will not teach you how to program. A byte of python, http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/P... , I think is a better intro to python and programming book because it at least highlight some programming concepts and organize the book into chapters that following the concepts.
