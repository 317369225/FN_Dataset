Is [math] \infty +1 = \infty -1 [/math]?
This question seems meaningless to me, since infinity by definition, includes every number, positive and negative, no matter how small or great, that can be added too or subtracted from.  If you can add to infinity then the number you added it too was not infinity if you can subtract from infinity,then the number you subtracted it from was not infinity. The concept of infinity to me seems to be one outside of mathematics,  It cannot be expressed in a number, it seems to be only a concept to describe something we can not grasp.  Of course I am probably wrong.  It would be interesting to hear from some of the real math nerds particularly the phds on how infinity is used in mathematics. Infinity may not even exist.  A scary thought.  It would be interesting to hear from physicists on whether 1) they have discovered the edge of the universe or are still seeking one 2) whether there exists a physical space so small that nothing smaller exists. If both exist then it would seem to indicate that everything is finite, beyond which 0 or nothing exists.  You could even make an argument that everything that exists and nothingness is the ultimate binary code.  The universe could be described as neither infinite or complete nothingness but divided between all things that exist or 1 and nothingness or 0. I wonder if that is why there people much smarter than me claiming that 1/0 = infinity.   If the universe is infinite then this big and small picture duality does not exist. In its place is the concept of infinity, merely a name for something we cannot grasp.
