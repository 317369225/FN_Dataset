What do linguists think are the main causes of language evolution?
I am not a linguist, but I have absorbed enough knowledge in language creation. A layman's answer would be: because people do not pronounce words with perfect fidelity. And because when communities are isolated from one another, there will be some degree of sound change. An example can be found in comparing Afrikaans to Dutch. Here are a few changes in Afrikaans, on the lines of: in general, if Dutch has X, then Afrikaans will have Y instead. Dutch Z >>> Afrikaans S Dutch SCH >>> Afrikaans SK DUTCH -EN >>> Afrikaans -E And the G (the sound of Kh, actually) is common in Dutch, but in Afrikaans, G's are dropped out from the middle of words. I do not know why. These are examples of how sound change happens in just one language. Also, according to linguists more expert than I, sound change is unstoppable. A linguist would tell you about the Welsh language, and how Welsh has undergone similar changes over time. I don't know any concrete examples myself, though, so you would have to ask a linguist about Welsh lentition and how Welsh sounds different today than it was spoken in the Middle Ages. But it comes down to the fact that nobody speaks any language perfectly. Over time, these imperfections add up and sound change will occur. My last word is the Welsh song "Dacw'Nghariad."
