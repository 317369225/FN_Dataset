How can I process images using big data through an HIPI API? What is the MR code?
I have not worked on images over Hadoop. But a quick glance of HIPI, and its clear to me that its just a image processing interface. Its salient functions are ability to directly download images from a web source in a parallel, distributed fashion, efficiently storing images, a culling function that filters out images based on certain criteria. After that, however, you have to mining on these sets of images. Which is like how you do in any image-mining method. Extract features and their value based on the image data for those features, discretize it and decide the data type (nominal, ordinal, continuous) and then run your parallel MR algorithm on each image which is now a bag of features.
