What are the steps taken when designing a relational database or JSON objects? Besides ID, primary key, and timestamps, are there any other must have fields?
Having an 'id' field in every table, especially an auto-increment, is an anti-pattern.  There are plenty of use-cases for using natural keys instead of surrogate keys.  JSON is not related to a relational database at all.  JSON is a flat file that contains arbitrary data without a schema.  You don't need to have a timestamp in every database table either.  Unless you are developing an audit log system that uses triggers or trawls the binary log, you don't need a timestamp in every table. Basically there are no 'must have' fields in any table.  The fields in your table depend on the data you are putting into it, and how you use it.
