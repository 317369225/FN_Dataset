How would you design the "perfect" course on data analysis?
The ideal course on Data Analysis should tackle the "Real Issues" faced in an actual data analysis roles. I have looked at many courses and found that they do cover statistical tools (like R, SAS) very nicely. If we look at any analytics job, 60% of the time is spent in data collection, cleaning and hypothesis building. I would say an ideal course should: Help me understand the types of Data Items (Numerical, Categorical, Ordinal) and the impact of choosing data type on Analysis and Results Data Collection methodologies Data cleaning methodologies (Typically with a good flavor of Excel, which is the most used tool) Primer of Stats and Probability (for those who do not come from that background) Primer of the tool (SAS, R, whatever) Building the Hypothesis Proving/ Disproving the hypothesis (Statistical Methods) and their implementation in the tool
