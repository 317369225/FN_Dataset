If dependent and independent variables are only ordinal data which regression model is perfect?
I don't know about perfect but the place to start is probably ordinal logistic regression, which deals pretty well with ordinal dependent variables, provided the proportional odds assumption is met. If it is not met, there are variations such as partial proportional odds. If even those don't work, there is multinomial logistic regression. Ordinal independent variables are not well dealt with in any traditional model that I know of; however, I have recently been reading a little about optimal scoring, which seems promising (but I am not expert about it). Another possible choice is a regression tree or one of the variations of trees (e.g. forests).
