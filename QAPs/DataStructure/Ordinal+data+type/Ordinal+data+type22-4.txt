How do we solve Bengaluru's traffic issues?
Mass Transportation system and disciplined riding attitude is the only way out. 1. Metro: Metro will play a major role in reducing traffic only when its  completed. Bits and pieces will not do much. Once all the phases 1, 2, 3 and 4 are complete. A lot cross city travelers will be benefited. The only hurdle is time taken to implement. (Bangalore Metro :: Network) 2. Commuter Rail Service: Commuter rail will prove to be the cheapest means of transport and also investment. Once completed it will connect the neighboring district and towns from Bangalore Central district unclogging the highways leading out of Bangalore.(Bangalore Commuter Rail) 3. Using Buses:  A lot of premium buses are introduced and have to be embraced more by the Bangalore population. Infact JNNURM has allocated highest number of buses for Bangalore city(#City Challenges: 8.) The solution is not in just introducing, the public also should try them. Every 4th day of the month is Bus Day, how many of use really use one ? 4. Road discipline. Do NOT over speed even if the road is empty. Do NOT see a 2 feet width between two cars as a highway. Do NOT use High beam all the time. Do NOT encourage road rage. Road rages are just a momentary, dont take them personally. Do NOT over step on zebra crossing. Treat Signals Red as Red and Amber as Amber. Stop taking revenge on roads, its not a competition. 5. Participate and post issues on BTP FB Page whenever you think something is inappropriate.(Bangalore Traffic Police) Updated 99w ago • View Upvotes
