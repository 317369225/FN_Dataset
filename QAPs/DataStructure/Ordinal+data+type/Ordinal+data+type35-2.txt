What are the implications of Russia's announcement that it will begin long-range bomber patrols over the Gulf of Mexico?
Update: Russia has no strategic stealth bombers. Much faster wearout of Russian military hardware (than for the intercepting force). A great possibility for NATO countries to study radar signatures and performance characteristics of Russian bombers in various natural conditions (position relative to the radar, weather, time of the day, time of the year, etc). An increased draw on Russian military's financial resources - long-range patrols are very expensive (more so than sending an empty airliner back and forth). Increased defense funding in the budgets of nearby countries. Better monitoring of airspace. Additional incentives for developing countermeasures and means of airspace denial, such as powerful EM and thermal jamming as well as emission of massive fog and dust particle clouds. Russia has about a dozen combat-ready Tu-160 bombers and even fewer refueling airplanes. For such a limited force, regular patrols can reduce the overall capability over long time, unless new planes are built, which takes time. Older bombers are not as capable.
