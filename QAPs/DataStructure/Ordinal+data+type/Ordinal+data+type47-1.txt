What types of jobs can you get with a bachelor's degree in communication?
Communication studies open to many areas. Tara already listed many of them. It also really depends on the focus of the degree. For instance, mine was in the political science department so our focus was sociology, anthropology, political science, economy and technology. I know that other institutes focus on technology and coding while others on graphic and multimedia production. In my case I could easily work in marketing, journalism, pr, social media, design. I picked the way of Human Computer Interaction (but I also picked a master degree in communication + a taught master in Interaction Design). Communication studies (as long as I know from my perspective of social scientist) help to understand the society on the whole picture and to design effective communication solutions accordingly. Those solutions can be applied to the marketing area (strategy, analysis and so on) as well as to the social media content management (strategy, planning, content production) and to the end-user product (design of applications, service design and so on).
