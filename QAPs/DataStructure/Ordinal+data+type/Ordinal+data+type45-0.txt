What topics (DP, number theory, graph theory, data structure etc.) are given higher priority in Bangladeshi programming contests?
Understanding the process of problem selection for a contest will help you. When a university (or in very rare case any organization aside of ACM) wants to arrange a national *CPC type contest, a judging director or co-ordinator is appointed. In ACM ICPC and large contests, we're lucky to have Shahriar Manzoor sir as judging director and in contests where he is not, in most of the cases he appoints someone or redirects it to some one else. Now as the judging director is set, s/he sends invitation to problem authors ( or traditionally called Judges in Bangladesh ) to submit problem for the contest, typically without any guideline for problem type (DP or Graph or math) to authors. Authors send problems of various difficulties and various flavors. Judging co-ordinator, sometimes with help from reviewers, sometimes discussing with problem author panel; remove duplicate type of problems from the list and a fresh set of problems gets ready. Now the question is, how we get different type of problems without any before hand guidelines or instruction? It's mostly because authors have different tastes and most of the authors are able to set problems of wide variation. And in some cases, when a set doesn't look very balanced, director/co-ordinator would ask specific author to add a problem of a specific type or with specific difficulty. So what is the type of problem BD problem setters focus more? I think different problem setters focus in individual areas but as a whole we focus on a balanced set. That's why you won't see 4 counting problems or 5 DP problems in a simple set. 2-3 problems of same classification is OK in a set given that they have different difficulties IMO. So, to sum this up, I don't think there's any particular point to focus in BD programming contests.
