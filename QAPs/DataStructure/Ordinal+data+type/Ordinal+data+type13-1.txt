In Oracle database, while creating a table keeping the columns those are having varchar2, as the end columns, in anyway will it increase the performance or reduce the memory size of the table?
I'm going to give you an unfair answer: you should test this out yourself rather than asking. It is a good habit to make -- even if you get an answer from someone it could be only correct for their situation. You can down vote this if you like, but that is my recommendation.
