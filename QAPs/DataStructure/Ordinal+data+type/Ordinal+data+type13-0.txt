In Oracle database, while creating a table keeping the columns those are having varchar2, as the end columns, in anyway will it increase the performance or reduce the memory size of the table?
A long time ago in a galaxy a lot like ours, it was advisable to put variable length columns at the end of an Oracle table.  It would save time and memory when non-variable length columns were accessed, as Oracle could simply skip into the row a fixed offset to find a certain column.  When variable length columns are used, it is not possible to just jump to the fixed offset and instead the varchar(s) must be decoded so the proper length can be skipped to find the column value requested. On modern hardware I hardly think it matters, but you could test it easily enough to see if you think you would benefit from it.
