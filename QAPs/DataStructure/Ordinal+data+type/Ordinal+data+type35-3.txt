What are the implications of Russia's announcement that it will begin long-range bomber patrols over the Gulf of Mexico?
Putin needs to show himself bad enough and crazy enough for US to back off and let him play his game. I predicted several month ago that he would want to increase a risk of non-sanctioned nuclear launch - he has no cards left other than the nukes, yet direct nuclear ultimatum will make him persona non-grata immediately and irreversibly. I believe the bombers are considered a second-strike capability, meaning the pilots should have all the keys necessary to arm their missiles. The pilots are two Russians who are likely very receptive to Russian propaganda of US destroying Russia all the way from 1989. That makes a chance of launch on a technical malfunction, ala Crimson Tide, quite real even if microscopic. The "Bears" look pre-historic with their propellers, however they are only marginally slower than B-52s, and they carry cruise missiles that can strike from significant range, possibly outside of the range of interception. However Putin's plan has one major flaw. It is all about public perception, and public perception of the Tu-95 Bears is of something from WW2: Just like B-17: If Putin could afford to send Tu-160s on such patrols, the visual impact would be much stronger, even if the same militarily: However he does not have enough of those.
