How would you design the "perfect" course on data analysis?
An introductory course on data analysis should on day 1 teach how to use basic functions for plotting and summarizing data in a program like R; have some toy data sets to work with and slice and dice the heck out of them; never finish by saying that "this analysis is the final word", but instead try to ask students if they can think of other ways we could analyze the data (maybe as homework); demonstrate that in the real world data is almost never clean and considerable time is spent on thinking about how the data was collected, why some values are missing and if the data makes sense.Â  If you fail to do so, don't be surprised if your analysis makes little sense. showcase some data-mining tools like decision trees or clustering that make your life easier.
