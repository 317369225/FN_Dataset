Layman's Explanations:Â What is a payments API?
A web API (which is probably what you are asking for) is a set of URLs that applications can call in order to perform money transaction operations. The advantage is that applications using a payment API do not worry about saving sensible data of their users such as credit cards numbers, debit card numbers and so on. In fact depending on the country an application is operating it must follow laws that impose directives on how to manage these kind of information. Some API offers also more than the only money transaction feature, like customers management or different payments methods. An example of payment API is the one offered by the site www.paymill.com that has support for several languages. Of course it is not the only solution and choosing the appropriate API in function of what are the application purposes is not so easy and it is very important, but this is another story!
