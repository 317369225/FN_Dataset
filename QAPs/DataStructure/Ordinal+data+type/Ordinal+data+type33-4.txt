What do linguists think are the main causes of language evolution?
Due to my understanding of language evolution, it is not much about pragmatic change. Instead, language evolution is much more about semantics, i.e. how words change in appearance. The latter is more frequent, and easier to study. Anyhow. Usually, a word doesn't change its meaning. Instead, new homonyms of a word appear, i.e. it gets more than one meaning. What might happen in some cases, is that a word gets a new meaning, and thereafter the old meaning stops getting used and disappears. Still, it is hard to say that the words morphs in meaning in this case. When there is a true change in the meaning of a word (if there ever is), then this occurs because there is a true change in the real world. Let me give a (bad) example: In the beginning of writing, to write meant the action of putting ink to a paper (actually there were probably other methods used, but I'm sure you get the idea). Later on, we got typewriters, which lead to a shift in meaning to include these machines as well. Finally, we have to take commensurability in consideration. The act of transferring concepts rather than terms in communication. For example, I may think of a dog, and I say the word dog. Then you hear me saying "dog". If the commensurability is 100% between us, then we think of the exactly same concept, which the term dog points at, in our minds. Commensurability is never 100%. So, when we communicate, the meaning I wish to transfer to you is never the exactly same meaning as you figure out in your head when you take part of my communication. Therefore, there is a shift in meaning for every time a new person learns a word. Old meanings die when users of that meaning die. Hence, meanings shift when the population shift.
