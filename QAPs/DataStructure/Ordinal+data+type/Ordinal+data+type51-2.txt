What is the longest time an astronaut can spend in space before it is too hard to re-acclimatize to Earth?
Theoretically, with proper precautions an astronaut could spend their entire life in space and still be able to re-acclimatize to Earth. While Astronauts are on the International Space Station they exercise two and a half hours a day to keep their bone and muscle mass from degenerating. The astronauts also have a special diet that helps protect their body strength. On the flip side of the coin, muscles atrophy incredibly quickly when not used. NASA research indicates that with in 11 days the muscles can lose 20% of their capacity. This is particularly evident in the muscles that work against gravity every moment of the day. The muscles start up in the neck, and run down your spine to your upper legs and calves. It is unlikely that an astronaut could let themselves go while on a long duration spaceflight and return to Earth without first building muscle mass in low gravity and eating a calcium and other mineral rich diet. What humans have yet to learn is what is the effect of growing up in a micro-gravity environment. Children on-board space stations or low gravity colonies may not be able to live on Earth because their structure never developed to handle Earth's gravity. On the other hand they may be able to exercise and eat healthily and be just fine. Luckily, this will not be a problem for much longer. Many designs have been proposed for large diameter centrifuges in space that will allow future inhabitants to have a significant amount of gravity during the majority or entirety of the time. I find it slightly ironic that humans spent so long trying to break the hold of gravity, only to turn around and try to bring it with us.
