When there are variables which belong to ranges, what type of variables they are (nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio)?
They are usually coarsened versions of interval, ratio, or absolute variables. How you want to treat them for analytic purposes depends on context and the use of the variable. For instance, consider age. That's clearly a ratio variable as it has a meaningful 0. However, age bands often represent qualitatively different parts of a person's life. For instance, under 18 a person is not a legal adult and less than 65 is ineligible for Medicare. (This example assumes a US context but most other countries have similar benchmarks.)
