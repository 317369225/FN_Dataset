What if large amount of oil was found under the Empire State Building?
With directional drilling, we can tear down another building and use that as a drill site and bend the well towards the actual reservoir. Besides, a significant reservoir of oil would not be localized under a single building and is at such depth that it can be approached at an angle without touching the building.
