What is Bhutan's concept of Gross National Happiness? How is it calculated?
Along with the answer already given, Bhutan gives more weight-age to its senior citizens while calculating GNH. The rationale behind this is that senior citizens form a vulnerable section (i.e no job, may or may not have children support, etc); and if that section is happy/secure even under trying situations then perhaps it can be safely concluded that the country is doing well.
