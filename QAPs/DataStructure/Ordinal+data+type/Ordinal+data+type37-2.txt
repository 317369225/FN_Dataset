What kind of job does a girl have to do in L&T Construction? I am selected as GET 2015.
Especially for girls it's usually at cluster preparing various site reports or at site in the planning department. The job at cluster is much more relaxed and time schedule is very manageable. However from learning point of view you should prefer site as basics are essential for proper report compilation. The downside of site job is the veryÂ  hectic schedule and tremendous work pressure but you get to learn a lot and get the necessary exposure. Your work is noted and appreciated while at cluster you get lost in the crowd of already so many workers. Join only if you are ready to work hard.
