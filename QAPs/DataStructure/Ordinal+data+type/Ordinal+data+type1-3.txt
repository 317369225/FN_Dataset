How often do data scientists deal with categorical data?
Even though the original data set doesn't contain any categorical variables, data scientists create some to make their analysis much easier and more meaningful in terms of business actions. One good example that I can think of is in survey analysis. Survey makers always ask (or usually) respondents' age. During the analysis, analysts can use age as a numerical variable when conducting regression analysis. However, sometimes, for example, if a product has a concave-down sales curve with respect to age, and business people want to know "who are the people that purchase a lot of our product"? Then analyst will need to think about aggregate age information into groups like <20, 21-30, 31-40, etc. to answer this question. If the analyst answers that question with "People who are 35 years old purchased the most", then business people will need to ask all the people their ages in order to sell their products, which does not make any sense.
