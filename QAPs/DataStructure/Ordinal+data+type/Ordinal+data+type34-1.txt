What if large amount of oil was found under the Empire State Building?
A "large" amount of oil as defined in an oil reservoir would cover a much larger area than the area covered by the empire state building. This being accessible by straight vertical drilling nearby. Furthermore, oil drilling has progressed so that they can accurately drill offset wells to hit spots under locations that would be otherwise undrillable, like expensive large historical properties in urban areas as well as rural areas to drill under natural obstructions such as rivers and hills and large outcroppings. An offset well is one in which the target is hundreds or thousands of feet horizontally away from the surface location.
