What are interesting and unsolved research questions in data visualization?
There is much work to be done in the psychophysics and neurophysiology of vision that pertains to seeing patterns graphically, and interpreting the data that drives the patterns.  Some researchers in the 80s began inquiry into the pre-attentive component of visual interpretation.  This perceptual but non-cognitive phase of seeing is very discriminating when it comes to edge detection and figure ground relationships, among other aspects of feature extraction.  We don't know how to exploit it to maximize the density of information that can be extracted from a display by the average viewer, and we don't have a scale, corresponding to, say, I.Q. that would distinguish innate ability among a group of viewers. Artists have considerable skill in seeing qualitative aspects of images that scientists have not yet begun to categorize, measure or exploit in visualization. There is much to be done in the field of multivariate visualization that maximizes feature extraction and relationship estimation.  The pace of change in this field has been hampered by a few conventional ideas of what is difficult and what requires special training to use.  The current generation of visualization designers should be able to leapfrog the prejudices of the generation brought up with standard statistical displays, and incorporate richer, more inventive and robust methods of providing specific and general information in visual data displays.
