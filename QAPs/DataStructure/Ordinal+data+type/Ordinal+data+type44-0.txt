Does the pullback in category theory generalize the pullback found in other areas of mathematics?
The answer is a resounding sort of. Let's start by describing the pullback of vector bundles. Here are two equivalent ways to say what this means. On the one hand, let [math]f : X \to Y[/math] be a map of spaces and let [math]\pi : V \to Y[/math] be an [math]n[/math]-dimensional real vector bundle on [math]Y[/math]. Then the pullback [math]f^{\ast}(V)[/math] of [math]V[/math] to a vector bundle on [math]X[/math] is literally the pullback-in-the-sense-of-limits given by the limit of the diagram [math]X \xrightarrow{f} Y \xleftarrow{\pi} V.[/math] On the other hand, it is also the pullback-in-the-sense-of-precomposition of the classifying map to the Classifying space [math]Y \to BO(n)[/math]Â  of real [math]n[/math]-dimensional vector bundles. Okay, but pullback has a more general meaning than this in topology and geometry. I can also pull back differential forms, cohomology classes, sheaves, and so forth. In the case of sheaves one can pass to the etale space and get a connection with the categorical pullback, but in the case of differential forms and cohomology classes it's not clear what's going on. I think historically what happened is just that the term "pullback" has acquired extra meanings by generalizing from situations where people were used to using it, and not all of those generalizations are compatible. (This is similar to how the word "number" has acquired a lot of extra meanings by generalizing from more familiar situations - e.g. real numbers, complex numbers, but also cardinal numbers, ordinal numbers - and not all of those generalizations are compatible. That's just how things happen.) A very general modern meaning of "pullback" is just that it is part of the data of an assignment to any space of some sort [math]X[/math] some collection [math]F(X)[/math] of objects "living over" [math]X[/math] (e.g. vector bundles, differential forms, cohomology classes, sheaves) and an assignment to any map [math]f : X \to Y[/math] a map [math]f^{\ast} : F(Y) \to F(X)[/math] satisfying suitable axioms. There are various ways to formalize this situation depending on how complicated [math]F(X)[/math] is (sometimes it's a set or abelian group, but sometimes it's a category); see, for example, the notion of a fibered category (Grothendieck fibration in nLab). The pullback-in-the-sense-of-limits appears as a special case of this construction: you take [math]F(X)[/math] to be the slice category / overcategory of objects equipped with maps to [math]X[/math] and you define a pushforward [math]f_{\ast} : F(X) \to F(Y)[/math] to be composition with [math]f[/math]. Then you can take [math]f^{\ast} : F(Y) \to F(X)[/math] to be the right adjoint of [math]f_{\ast}[/math], which turns out to be taking the pullback. The pullback-in-the-sense-of-precomposition appears as another special case of this construction: now you take [math]F(X)[/math] to be the set (or whatever) of morphisms from [math]X[/math] to a fixed object, which is the "classifying space" of whatever kind of objects you're trying to describe. In this situation there is no obvious notion of pushforward in general, but sometimes (e.g. in the case of cohomology) you can define a pushforward given extra conditions and data.
