How do you best represent ordered lists in a relational database, allowing for easy and efficient updates (insertion/deletion of list elements)?
Extending Bill's answer a bit, we used to maintain this (rather.. tried to do this) using a step-incremented sequence number. If the first line induced has a number 10, then the second would have a number 200. If you are inserting a new line between the two, you'd take 101 for the first one. 102 for the second and so on (Or 110, 120 and so on for further flexibility). The gap really depends upon the probability you'd associate with the middle insertions.
