Is infinity +1 more than infinity?
It depends. What do you mean by infinity? There are multiple kinds. Cardinal Infinities The set [math]\{1, 2, 3\}[/math] has size [math]3[/math]. The set [math]\N[/math] has size of ... infinity? Yes, but more exact is [math]\aleph_0[/math], aleph zero. Every set of infinite size, that is countable, has the size of [math]\aleph_0[/math]. We can easily count them: [math]0, 1, 2, 3, ...[/math] The size of [math]\Z[/math] is not twice as big. We can count them too: [math]0, -1, 1, -2, 2, -3, 3, ...[/math]. The number of elements in [math]\Z[/math] is the number of elements in [math]\N[/math]. We can count fractions too! [math]\#\N = \#\Z = \#\Q = \aleph_0[/math]. This may sound weird, how can you count, list, all the fractions? Here you see how: The real numbers, [math]\R[/math], are uncountable. We think this is is the 'next' cardinal infinity: [math]\aleph_1[/math], but we're not sure. Maybe there is another infinity in between. Anyway, [math]\aleph_1 > \aleph_0[/math] Aleph three, four, ... does also exist. Aleph number | Wikiwand With sizes of sets, we say that: [math]\aleph_n + 1 = \aleph_n[/math] Ordinal numbers are a different story. These infinities are not the size of a set, but describe the order of things. In the English language, we too have ordinals, namely first, second, third, ... Alon Amit's answer to How do you show that addition is not commutative amongst infinite ordinals? Here, addition is not commutative. From Alon Amit's answer: These are not the same. We say that: [math]\omega + 1 > \omega[/math] [math]1 + \omega = \omega[/math] What about the 'normal' [math]\infty[/math]? When you write [math]\infty[/math]. We almost always mean the limit of a function. For example [math]\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} x^2 = \infty[/math] When [math]x[/math] 'gets very big', [math]x^2[/math] 'gets very big too'. This is of course very informal language. We say that: [math]\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} x = \infty[/math] But this also tends to [math]\infty[/math]. The [math]1[/math] is nothing in comparison to the 'very large' [math]x[/math], so the total expression also goes to [math]\infty[/math]. [math]\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} x + 1 = \infty[/math] To proof formally that limits tend to [math]\infty[/math], see Epsilon Delta Limit Proofs at and going to infinity.
