What kind of job does a girl have to do in L&T Construction? I am selected as GET 2015.
If you are posted at site,you will be given most probably Planning department. Now,what happens at planning :   Contract review and preparation of MSP schedules and draft ACE.      Plan for resources, with inputs from site team leader. Co-ordinate with Cluster/ HQ for arranging resources Synchronize the activities of all teams to achieve the schedule. Monitor the progress, financial performance and resource usage. Preparation of JCR, MIS & MPR. Ensure timely updating of data in EIP. Variation analysis and corrective action. Update the resources schedules and look ahead progress. Arranging required information to Customers as per contract. Working hours at site is minimum 12 hours.You might be given some relaxations if project manager permits. Facilities given for site staff are awesome but schedule is hectic. My personal advice : join this company only if you are very hardworking type person(Gadha Mazdoori).otherwise prepare for higher studies or public/government sector.
