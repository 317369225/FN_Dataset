Layman's Explanations:Â What is a payments API?
An API (Application of Programming Interface) is a type of technical communication between servers, and a payment API refers to technical calls that enable the processing of a transaction. To accept payments, retailers must integrate a set of payment calls (for capturing, authorizing, settling payments, etc.) that, all together, enable users to complete a transaction. To include payments in your commerce you can either use API from some provider or use a URL redirect offsite gateway where all payment interface is done on some 3rd party service provider
