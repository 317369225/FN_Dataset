If dependent and independent variables are only ordinal data which regression model is perfect?
Ordinal logistic for the dependent variable as the starting point, definitely. Â Ordinal independent variables pose no special problems if you are willing to treat them as nominal. However, nominal coding does not respect the ordering of the categories and isn't parsimonious at all. The most simple method is to use orthogonal polynomials and check to see that the first and maybe third orthopoly are the important ones. This isn't perfect, but it's reasonable. It's possible to impose some other constraint on the coding but this can be tricker as it requires inequality constrained inference. For instance, you could define the coding for a three point ordinal variable: [math]\beta_1 = 0[/math] (lowest category) [math]\beta_2 = 0 + \gamma_{12}[/math] (next category up) [math]\beta_3 = 0 + \gamma_{12} + \gamma_{23}[/math] (next category up) The gamma terms are the increment gained by moving up to the next category. The predicted value is just gotten by cumulating them. Then constrain [math]\gamma_{12}, \gamma_{23} > 0[/math]. This imposes ordinality. You still have two parameters, but they are dependent in a complicated way, so the effective number of parameters will be more like 1.5, rather than 2. In a Bayesian context you could fit this model fairly easily by imposing non-negativity priors. Well as easily as any Bayesian model can be fit! It could also be fit using nonlinear regression if you are clever about reparameterizing the model. I could think of other ways if all you have is a two-way table. In that case, hands down the easiest thing to do is to use correspondence analysis to check whether the ordinal pattern even seems reasonable. I suggest taking a look at Alan Agresti's work, such as: Amazon.com: Analysis of Ordinal Categorical Data (9780470082898): Alan Agresti: Books
