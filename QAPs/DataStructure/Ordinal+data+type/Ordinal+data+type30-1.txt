Which two branches of mathematics are not related in any known way?
There are probably none. For instance, even a quick glance at the trigonometry article on wikipedia is enough to find the relation between trigonometry and statistics being mentioned: "Fields that use trigonometry or trigonometric functions include [..] probability theory, statistics[..]" A concrete example from the same website[2]: Intelligence quotients are sometimes held to be distributed according to the bell-shaped curve. About 40% of the area under the curve is in the interval from 100 to 120; correspondingly, about 40% of the population scores between 100 and 120 on IQ tests. Nearly 9% of the area under the curve is in the interval from 120 to 140; correspondingly, about 9% of the population scores between 120 and 140 on IQ tests, etc. Similarly many other things are distributed according to the "bell-shaped curve", including measurement errors in many physical measurements. Why the ubiquity of the "bell-shaped curve"? There is a theoretical reason for this, and it involves Fourier transforms and hence trigonometric functions. That is one of a variety of applications of Fourier transforms to statistics. Trigonometric functions are also applied when statisticians study seasonal periodicities, which are often represented by Fourier series.         [1] Trigonometry [2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use...
