I am currently developing a social media strategy for my company. Are there any factors I should take in to consideration while devising a strategy?
Outline objectives - what are your goals? What is your key audience? Who are they? Listen - where are you customers really? Where do they engage with each other? Who are their "influencers"? If your first answer: they are all on Facebook, then you may be surprised. Focus - where do you want to participate You can't do everything under the sun, so focus on the most important forums/platforms/discussions. Listening will help you prioritize. Audit of the current brand presence - do an audit/analysis of your current presence. Don't think you got one? Do an audit - I bet you will find some brand Facebook pages or Twitter handles. What is your story (or/and voice)? Integrate with your other online presence (website, social networks, blogs, etc), don't work in silos. Make sure you have contingency/risk plan in place. How will you measure success? Get key stakeholder on board, you will make your life easier (HR, PR, privacy, security, web, legal, etc) Don't get distracted by the next shiny object! Keep the course!
