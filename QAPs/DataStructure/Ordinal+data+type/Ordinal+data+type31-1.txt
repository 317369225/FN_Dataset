As a starting Python programmer I see a lot of praise for the Python language (and so far I can only agree). Isn't there anything bad to say about it? What is a real con?
Python's a solid enough language. But here are typical criticisms. I'm trying to keep non-religious here, because this way lies flame wars. As an interpreted, dynamic language, Python is slower and more memory hungry than compiled languages. Indentation-based syntax is annoying. And the fact that you need to care about what version your end users are running causes real problems with reliably distributing software. It also has poor support for concurrency (but many languages are as bad or worse). There's no very good mobile support. And... it doesn't run in the browser or on all platforms. And, more matters of taste: - it's a dynamic language - It's not strongly/weakly enough typed (python's somewhere in the middle, but everyone has a favorite place along the scale) -lack of, or inferior support for (insert critic's preferred favorite framework here) But no langauge will satisfy everyone, or all purposes, you should learn several over your career. As a minimum, you'll probably need to learn Javascript if you're doing web stuff,Â  C/C++ for system programming and maybe Swift or Java for mobile.
