What is Bhutan's concept of Gross National Happiness? How is it calculated?
The Gross National Happiness (GNH) index was proposed by Bhutan in 1971 to champion a novel approach to measure prosperity by measuring spiritual, physical, social and environmental well-being of its citizens and environment. The four pillars of GNH are Sustainable and equitable socio-economic development, conservation of the environment, preservation and promotion of culture, and good governance.   The Centre for Bhutan Studies identifies nine indicators which were used in the survey: (1) Standard of Living, (2) Health of the population, (3) Education, (4) Ecosystem vitality and diversity, (5) Cultural vitality and diversity, (6) Time use and balance, (7) Good governance, (8) Community vitality, and (9) Emotional well-being. There has been much criticism of this approach due to difficulty of measuring GNH in quantitative terms.   Calculation of the GNH is explained in this paper by Centre for Bhutan Studies - Page on Grossnationalhappiness
