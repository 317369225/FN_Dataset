I am currently developing a social media strategy for my company. Are there any factors I should take in to consideration while devising a strategy?
Wow, you've already received some amazing advice!  Though I'm not a social media consultant like some of the others who commented, I started my company with literally only $50 and a Twitter account.  Then - and still today (1.5 yrs later) - we convert 40% of our customers through social media.  Twitter is our main medium of focus.  In addition to the thoughts above, here are a couple more nuggets to mull over: Define Your "Beat."  Technically, much of social media is micro-blogging.  Just like a journalist has a beat or a blog has a theme, your avatar needs a goal and harmonious topics.  For example, if you follow @eFlirtExpert on Twitter, you'll notice that the majority of my content to be dating related, but that I've also broadened my beat to include entrepreneurship, technology trends, the goings on in Boston and NYC (where we have offices) and even personal bits about my relationship and life.  All of these topics combined create an interactive branding campaign, keeping different audiences of interest engaged on varying levels. Getting Offline.  Though you're engaging people online every day, getting offline once in a while is important building block in your relationship.  Just like any business deal or flirting situation, you can only do so much in the cloud.  The level of commitment changes when you engage offline and it often interests a different audience. So, if you can host an event or give an in-store promotion, do it!
