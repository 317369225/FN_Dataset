What do linguists think are the main causes of language evolution?
I don’t know what linguists think. But I have my own thoughts about the evolution of language. I think that language evolved out of mutual and similar experiences. Prelinguistic man must have understood the necessity of community. People who live together come to understand each other by virtue both by mutual and similar experiences and by the need to live communal lives. Before they had verbal language there must have been some understanding that derived from body language (or more broadly from kinesics). People had to know who was boss, or how other people felt that day, or a myriad of other understandings that were communicated by demeanor or a particular look of the eye. We speak now of understanding each other by virtue of body language; how about understanding each other by virtue of body language alone, without the use of verbal language. I think we can do that and I think prelinguistic man could also. What I am getting at is that the gestures of body language could morph into symbols. A particular gesture could come to have the same meaning no matter who used it. That would be the beginning of language. Language did not need to be a set of words; a set of symbols would do just as well. We have such languages today, sign language for the deaf, brail for the blind. There is also body language that we use with our vocal symbols, or body language that we use without speaking: a shrug of the shoulders, a leaning of the head, a motion that says ‘I’m waiting for you to stop talking.” The point is that a very rich language could have developed in pre-verbal-linguistic man. I find this hypothesis very plausible because so many of us still speak with our hands our eyes and with our demeanor—so much body language remains after eons of human development. This is what I see as the evolution of language.
