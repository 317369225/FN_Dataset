What is the longest time an astronaut can spend in space before it is too hard to re-acclimatize to Earth?
We don't know. Nobody has spent a very long time in space, and all our data are for relatively short durations in microgravity. I suspect it would take a very long time for irreversible changes to occur, provided astronauts took precautions -- proper exercise, at the very least. But -- that's purely speculation on my part.
