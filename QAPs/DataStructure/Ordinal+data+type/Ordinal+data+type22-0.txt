How do we solve Bengaluru's traffic issues?
Answering from the perspective of an architect: 1. Introduction of a congestion zone charge like the London congestion charge, at Bangalore's city center, as well as Whitefield and ITPL. In London, you have to pay an £11.50 daily charge if you drive between 07:00 and 18:00, Monday to Friday in the Congestion Charge zone. This discourages people from using private vehicles in these congested areas, as well raises money for infrastructure (which ideally is to be used for better roads). Discounts in charge can be provided for annual or bi-annual payers who have green vehicles, or have done regular emission checks on vehicles, or carpool.   2. Protected bicycle and pedestrian paths need to be created, unlike the painted lines in Jayanagar that just become parking space for vehicles. 3. Pedestrianisation of major public areas like Brigade Road, VV Puram food street, roads passing through Cubbon Park etc. That means no vehicles can pass through these roads at all or certain times of the day. If this can be done in Times Square, New York City, we can definitely do it too. Pondicherry has a no-vehicles rule along the Promenade road after 6pm on all days as well, which means something like Marine Drive in Mumbai is completely pedestrianised. These are just 3 out of many solutions, which may solve Bangalore's traffic issues.
