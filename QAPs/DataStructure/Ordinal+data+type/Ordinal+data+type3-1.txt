What is the difference between histograms and bar charts?
Both charts display a summary value of a continuous variable that has been split into groups. In bar charts, the groups are typically categorical variables. In histograms the groups are typically intervals of another continuous variable. # of people enrolled in each department of a college would suit a bar chart # of people in each income quintile in your city would suit a histogram One implication of this difference is that a natural order exists on the grouping axis of a histogram, but not a bar chart. In other words, it usually makes sense to sort a bar chart by value of the bar but a histogram should almost always remain sorted by the order of the groups. Using the examples above: It would make sense to order the college departments from highest to lowest enrollment. It wouldn't make as much sense to order the income quintiles by most to least people, you would end up with a counter-intuitive graph.Â  Bar charts usually have a space between the bars, histograms usually don't - reflecting the subtle differences in the relationships between adjacent groups. There's no real hard line, the underlying representational metaphor is the same - numerical value encoded as length on one axis and binned into groups on the other. The Level of measurement of the grouping axis is the source of the difference, but it isn't black and white and there are no definitive rules separating the two chart types.
