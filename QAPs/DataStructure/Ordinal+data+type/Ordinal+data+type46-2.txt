Is infinity +1 more than infinity?
That really depends on what you mean by infinity. Infinity is a general concept. It's not a specific number. First, there are two main things we can describe using infinity: cardinality (how many) and ordinality (order in which things come: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc...) Take the set of natural numbers. There are infinitely many elements of that set. I can add another element to that set, and it would still be the exact same size. Why? Because just shift every element over one, and put that single element in there. So when we're talking about infinite cardinality, adding one changes nothing. But what about ordinality? Suppose I have the following: [math]1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, ...[/math] In terms of cardinality, there are infinitely many elements in that sequence. Now let's take that sequence, and add something to it. [math]1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, ..., 2[/math] That sequence is not the same. I cannot make it the same just by shifting some things around. Start at any point. How many elements do I have to go through to get to 2? It's infinitely many. So in this case, infinity + 1 is very different than infinity. Wikipedia articles on Cardinal numbers Ordinal numbers
