Layman's Explanations: What is a payments API?
An API is an Application Programming Interface.  A server program gets requests from a client program (the application) and takes actions based on those requests.  The server program's authors provide an API to the client program's authors.  The API tells the application programmer, in effect, "if you want the server to do X, here's how you ask, and here's how to interpret the server's responses." A payments API describes how the buyer's computer and seller's computer can communicate with a banking service to make a payment, refund a sale, look up details of a transaction, set up a billing plan, store a customer's credit card information securely, and so on.  For an example, Paypal's REST API Reference tells the applications programmer the protocols (rules) for sending requests over the Internet, and how to interpret the server's responses.  I'm sorry to say, but you really need to be a programmer to understand the REST API Reference.
