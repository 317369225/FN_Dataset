When there are variables which belong to ranges, what type of variables they are (nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio)?
Most likely ordinal, though I'd prefer to see how the ranges are constructed. I'd imagine that a set of ranges is formed by collecting interval-level data into range-categories, the way we conventionally talk about age. E.g. someone is 25 years old for an entire year (a year-range); we rarely talk about someone being (say) 25 years, 4 months, 6 days, 3 hours, 17 minutes and 23 seconds old (an interval data point). The generic breakdown is as follows: Nominal (categorical). Things are lumped into categories without any particular ordering or relationship: e.g. the kind of pet a person owns (cat, dog, bird, other, none) Ordinal (ordered categories). Things that are lumped into categories with a distinct order: e.g. soda bottle sizes (12 oz, 16 oz, 20 oz, 24 oz, 1 liter, etc). Interval (non-categorical measurements). Anything that's measured on a smooth, continuous scale rather than being lumped into categories: e.g. temperature or IQ scores. Ratio (fixed-zero measurements). Any interval data where the zero point is non-arbitrary (it means a complete absence of the thing in question). E.g. height or weight. Note that there are blurred lines. For instance, colors can be treated as nominal data (lumped into mere categories, like with paint swabs), or as ordinal or interval data if you order them by frequency of light (as in a spectrum). IQ is actually ordinal data - one's IQ can only fall into integer values given the kinds of test we use, and thus are ordered categories rather than proper measurements - but because there are a lot of categories and there are no discontinuities (that we are aware of) we usually treat IQ as interval.
