What is the difference between histograms and bar charts?
A bar chart is used in summarizing categorical data. It uses a number of rectangles, of (arbitrary) equal width, corresponding to each category and have heightsÂ  equal to number of cases in each category. Bar charts can be drawn horizontally or vertically, usually with gaps between rectangles. While a histogram is used when data are measured in intervals; discrete or continuous. It illustrates the distribution of the data in a convenient form. Usually convenient if number of observations is very large, ( >~ 100). Here width of rectangle is decided by the range of data values and can be varied, (but fixed in a plot) and are usually drawn without gaps. Therefore the area of the rectangle is key factor in histograms. Histograms are appropriate for numerical variables only and are helpful in identifying gaps in observations.
