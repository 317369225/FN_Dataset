I am currently developing a social media strategy for my company. Are there any factors I should take in to consideration while devising a strategy?
The factors you should take in to consideration while devising a strategy depend on the type of product or service that should be advertised. These factors in question are: a) Is it a low-touch product that you are selling (technical boring stuff like PC hardware, batteries, light bulbs) b) Is it a a search purchase, are people trying to find a product or service that matches certain exact criteria that can be pre-defined and searched in words (like insurances) c) Is it a emotional product/service that can't be easily described and searched with words, like a movie, music, art. d) Is it a experience purchase, do you have to experience it, taste it, touch it, feel and see it directly (e.g. food, drinks, hamburger, wine, cake) If the answer is a) or b) you are better off with spending the money on SEO and search related social media strategies. Maybe more Google+, where the social network is related to SEO. Or Twitter, where the information is as almost always public with metadata like hashtags. If the answer is c) or d) you are better off with spending the money on viral and visual oriented social media networks, like Youtube and Instagram.
