What types of statistical tests are appropriate for a usability test of a prototype system that does not use a control case?
While you cannot compare a novel interface against anything in a well-formed experiment, that doesn't mean you can't gather usability feedback in a statistically rigorous manner. You can, for instance, measure metrics such as the time it takes to complete an action, time it takes to find a certain part of the interface, the percentage of subjects that manage to do what you want on the first shot, or the percentage of subjects that try certain incorrect actions. Frequently, these metrics become your baseline for future work. Also, don't shy away from qualitative metrics. Questions that ask about whether subjects found something useful, for instance, can be very useful immediate feedback. Be careful to avoid follies such as analyzing ordinal data as if it were continuous data with these questions. Often, the most useful feedback you can get is gathered in the first couple of subjects. This is one reason that testing frequently and with minimal scientific rigor can be a far more useful tool when designing something novel than a proper usability study. Statistical validity is not always the most useful outcome.
