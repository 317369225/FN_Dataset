Why is anemia a common problem among Indian women?
anaemia in women is not a problem confined to indian population but is a problem prevelent among women of developing countries and third world countries. among the various causes of anemia iron and folic acid deficiency is the leading cause for anaenia among women. women have relatively higher requirement for iron and folic acid as compared to their male counterparts due to few reasons. first reason is women menstruate and loose around 30 to 60 ml of blood in each cycle. second reason a lot of women suffer from menstrual disorders like menorrhagia or dysfuctional uterine bleeding where women loose excess of blood during menstruation. third reason is women get pregnent. fetus is like a parasite and consume a big chunk of mother's nutritive store for his own development. in developed countries where people are rich and there is no shortage of food women usually do not land in a state of amenia due to iron deficiency and folic acid. on the other hand in a country like india where 30% of the population is below poverty line women don't consume balanced diet and become iron and folic acid deficient leading to anaemia.
