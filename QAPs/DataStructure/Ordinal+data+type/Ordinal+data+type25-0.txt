Statistics (academic discipline): If I'm trying to find the relationship between two categorical variables, with possible values 0 (didn't happen), 1, 2 and 3 (happened a lot), is calculating the correlation coefficient the best I can do?
Both your variables are ordinal.  There are methods for such variables. If one variable can be looked on as a dependent or outcome variable then there is ordinal logistic regression, possibly with optimal scoring for the independent variable. If that is not the case, then one test of association is the Jonkheere Terpstra test. It is also possible that, as Jay Verkuilen suggested, loglinear analysis may be best. And there are other models, as well.  One very good reference on these types of variables is Alan Agresti's book Analysis of Ordinal Categorical Data
