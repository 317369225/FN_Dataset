Is [math] \infty +1 = \infty -1 [/math]?
Infinity is never to be perceived as a discrete integer. When we have a very large number, so large that its exact value becomes trivial, we simply call it infinity. Now infinity is something vague. We really don't know what number it is but we know one thing for sure that it's bloody large. So infinity plus or minus 1 will not make sense because what is 1 when we're talking about a number so large we can't make shit out of it. So infinity plus 1, minus 1, times 1,2,3... would still be a very large number and we'd still call that number infinity.
