I am working on a predictive data analytics project where I need to predict the number of kilometers after which a vehicle will require maintenance. What possible attributes should I use? What should be their data types?
A Few Possible Features you could consider: Numeric: Nominal: Vehicle Age, Date of Recent Servicing,Â  No. of Idle Days/Month, Avg No. of Miles/Month, Instances of Service History (Can be bucketed into various categories: Engine, Gearbox & Chassis Damage, Wheel & Tire Damage , Electronic Failure, HVAC & Transmission Issues, Interior Wear & Tear), No. of Major Accidents in the previous year Interval: No. of days since recent servicing. Categorical: Ordinal: No. of Operators/Drivers (Single, Double, Multiple) Nominal: Usage (Personal,Commercial), Service Centre Location (Would matter if there is an Internal Bias - i.e., Quality of Service in one Location is better than another), Off Roading Use (Yes/No), Third Party Servicing (Yes/No)
