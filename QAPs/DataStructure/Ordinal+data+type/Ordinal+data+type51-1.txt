What is the longest time an astronaut can spend in space before it is too hard to re-acclimatize to Earth?
The truth is we don't know. The record for time in space is just over 14 months set by Cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov on board Mir during the mid 1990s. Polyakov volunteered for his 437 day flight to learn how the human body would respond to the micro-gravity environment on long-duration missions to Mars. Although he had weakness and mood problems for more than a year after returning to Earth, researchers determined that humans can remain  physically and mentally healthy during long-duration spaceflight. No American has spent more than a year in space.  Identical twin astronauts Scott and Mark Kelly are participating in an ambitious controlled experiment to measure differences between one twin spending a year in space (Scott) and one remaining on Earth (Mark). Even after this mission ends in March next year, there won't be enough data to know what the limits of safety are, or whether they translate to long term safety far from the Earth's magnetosphere. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/V... http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/S... http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M... https://www.nasa.gov/content/ast...
