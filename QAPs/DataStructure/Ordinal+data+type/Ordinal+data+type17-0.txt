Why did it take petabytes of data for the black hole scene in the movie Interstellar?
Ultimately, even images and videos are actually some form of data that occupy matrix like data. I assume that the simulation produces a matrix like data set which has x, y, z co-ordinates and a final 4th co-ordinate for time. Â Suppose you have a 100x100x100x100 matrix, then you will have 10^8 elements. Suppose each element is a data point having a floating point number of double precession, then it will occupy 8 bytes of memory. So, this matrix will be 800 MB in size! If this is the case of a matrix like this, for producing such high definition animation, they need to simulate data with very very close distance points. That means the size of the matrix is very large. For thought, let us say, that the matrix is 1000x1000x1000x1000, then with the same 8 byte floating number data type, the matrix will be 8x1o^12 bytes or 8 TB! I leave the reader to think about the memory size requirement!
