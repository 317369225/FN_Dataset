Is infinity +1 more than infinity?
Sometimes. It depends on which infinity you choose. Cardinals Cardinal numbers are associated with the "size" of unordered sets. For transfinite cardinals "infinity" plus one is equal to infinity. In particular for the smallest transfinite cardinal, [math]\aleph_0[/math], that of the set of natural numbers, we have:      [math]\aleph_0+1=1+\aleph_0=\aleph_0[/math] Ordinals Ordinal numbers are associated with the "size" of ordered sets. For transfinite ordinals adding elements at the end of the ordered set is distinct from adding elements at the beginning. As a result addition is not commutative. In particular for the smallest transfinite ordinal, [math]\omega[/math], associated with the ordered set of natural numbers, we have:      [math]\omega+1\neq\omega=1+\omega[/math] Surreals Arithmetic on the class of Surreal numbers is, well, surreal. In some ways surreals are like ordinals in that [math]\omega+1[/math] is distinct from [math]\omega[/math], but surreal addition is commutative so:      [math]\omega+1=1+\omega\neq\omega[/math] Not only that, but surreal subtraction also works so there is a transfinite number [math]\omega-1[/math] smaller than [math]\omega[/math]. In fact the surreals include such numbers as half of "infinity", [math]\frac{\omega}{2}[/math], and the square root of "infinity", [math]\sqrt\omega[/math]. As I said at the beginning, you need to be careful which infinity you are talking about and, as always, apply Bustany's Rule of Infinity: Infinity and Intuition do not mix.
