Is [math] \infty +1 = \infty -1 [/math]?
There are several different uses of infinity in mathematics.  For some, infinity is distinct from infinity plus or minus 1, for others it's the same, and for others, there is no infinity minus 1. It depends on what you mean by infinity. Some various meanings of infinity used in math. In calculus One kind of infinity, usually denoted  [math]\infty,[/math] is when you're talking about real numbers. It's used when the real numbers you're discussing are growing without bound.  For example, if you let  [math]x[/math] approach 2, then  [math]\dfrac{1}{(x-2)^2}[/math] will grow without bound, that is diverge to  [math]\infty.[/math]  Symbolically,  [math]\displaystyle\lim_{x\to2}\frac{1}{(x-2)^2}=\infty.[/math] For this kind of infinity, it's appropriate to say  [math]\infty-1=\infty.[/math]  It would be interpreted as saying that if  [math]x[/math]  approaches infinity, then  [math]x-1[/math]  also approaches infinity.  Likewise, [math]\infty+1=\infty.[/math] Cantor's ordinal numbers A second kind of infinity occurs in Cantor's theory of ordinal numbers.  An ordinal number is represented by a well-ordered set. A well-ordered set is a set that has an ordering  [math]\leq[/math]  on it where the ordering is antisymmetric (two different elements can't be less than or equal to each other), transitive (if one is ≤ a second and the second is ≤ a third, then the first is ≤ the third), total (for any two elements, one of them is ≤ the other), and finally, for any subset of the set, there's a smallest element. For example, if you have a set  [math]\{a,b,c\}[/math]  with an ordering where  [math]a \lt b \lt c[/math] then that set represents the ordinal number 3.  Following Von Neumann, we'll choose the ordinal numbers starting with 0 and less than 3 to represent 3.  Thus, [math]3=\{0,1,2\}.[/math]  Note that 0 is represented by the empty set. He used [math]\omega[/math]  for the simplest infinity, what's also called the first limit ordinal.  It's defined as the set of all finite numbers with the usual ordering                              [math]\omega=\{0,1,2,...\}[/math] After each ordinal, there's an immediate next ordinal.  The one after  [math]\omega[/math]  is                          [math]\omega+1=\{0,1,2,...;\omega\}[/math] and after that                       [math]\omega+2=\{0,1,2,...;\omega,\omega+1\}[/math] and after that eventually comes the second limit ordinal                  [math]2\omega=\{0,1,2,...;\omega,\omega+1,\omega+2,\ldots\}[/math] and it never stops. For this kind of infinity, [math]\omega\neq\omega+1.[/math]  Also, there is no  [math]\omega-1.[/math] There's a nice pictorial representation of the first few ordinal numbers at the Wiki article on ordinal numbers Cantor's cardinal numbers While ordinal numbers are used for counting, cardinal numbers are used for quantity.  If you have two sets of things, [math]S[/math]  and  [math]T,[/math] they have the same number of elements, that is, they have the same cardinality, if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their elements. That's often denoted  [math]|S|=|T|.[/math] Also, [math]S[/math]  has less than or equal to the number of elements of  [math]T,[/math] denoted  [math]|S|\leq|T|,[/math]  if there is a one-to-one function  [math]f:S\to T.[/math]  That means if [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] are distinct elements of [math]S,[/math] then  [math]f(a)[/math]  and  [math]f(b)[/math]  are distance elements of  [math]T.[/math]  For a one-to-one function it is not required that every element in  [math]T[/math]  be in the image of  [math]f.[/math] Cardinal numbers are the cardinalities of sets.  The cardinalities of finite sets are just the natural numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. The set of natural numbers is often denoted  [math]\mathbf N.[/math]  Infinite sets also have cardinalities, the infinite cardinal numbers. For the infinite sets, you can add or remove an element from a set and it doesn't change the cardinality of the set. Cantor showed that there are many different infinite cardinal numbers.  There is a smallest one, denoted [math]\aleph_0,[/math]  which is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers.  [math]\aleph_0=|\mathbf N|.[/math]  Assuming the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis, the next infinite cardinal number is  [math]\aleph_1=|\mathbf R|,[/math] the cardinality of the set of real numbers. That's the same cardinal number as the cardinality of the power set of  [math]\mathbf N.[/math] After that  [math]\aleph_2[/math]  is the cardinality of the set of functions  [math]\mathbf R\to\mathbf R[/math] or the power set of  [math]\mathbf R.[/math] Cantor also showed that the infinite cardinal numbers can be well-ordered so that they can be subscripted by ordinal numbers:  [math]\aleph_0,\aleph_1,\ldots,\aleph_\omega,\aleph_{\omega+1},\ldots[/math] Conway's surreal numbers In his study of perfect information games, Conway discovered an application of another kind of number that extends Cantor's ordinal numbers.  Knuth wrote a book on them in 1974, Surreal Numbers: How Two Ex-Students Turned on to Pure Mathematics and Found Total Happiness. Besides all the ordinals mentioned above, there are also surreal numbers  [math]\omega-1, \sqrt{\omega},[/math]  and all sorts of other numbers. For this kind of infinity, [math]\omega-1[/math] does exist, and it does not equal  [math]\omega.[/math] Updated 1w ago • View Upvotes
