What are interesting and unsolved research questions in data visualization?
Not too many answers so far! Which is probably some sort of answer by itself. A few random thoughts from my side: Evaluation: When is one visualization better than another? How can we measure it? Can we? What are the metrics, the parameters, and the contextual factors to put into the equation? Vis and Persuasion: Does visualization have an impact on persuading people (over or in addition to other means)? Can it deceive? Encoding Theory: What's the most effective way to encode data with multiple visual variables? We know how length, size, orientation, color, etc. work in isolation but what happens when we mix them? Visualizing a Trillion: How do you visualize a trillion objects? And does it even make sense? Vis for Non-Programmers: How do you build tools that help people build sophisticated and accurate visualizations without programming? Teaching Visualization: What's the most effective way to teach visualization? ... ok that was my take at it, hoping his will spur more ideas!
