Which online Python course is the best?
As nobody yet said anything about it, I will mention The Python Challenge . This is not exactly a tutorial, but an online game of progressive difficulty. Each level is a riddle given through an URL. You need to write some python program to find the URL for the next riddle, and to write that program you often have to read python manuals. As programs are getting harder you learn python. Probably not for everyone, but if you need to be challenged to learn new tricks, you can give it a try. Some people describe this as the "best way to learn python". It is probably exagerated, but I learnt many usefull things going through it (not the least, the wealth of available python modules).
