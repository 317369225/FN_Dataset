What are interesting and unsolved research questions in data visualization?
One topic that I think still needs more work is interaction with data visualizations. Being interactive is one of the main attributes that separates infographics and data visualizations and still there is only a (comparably) small amount of research available on that. It's not only about which interactions we can come up with, but also how to evaluate interaction and decipher the connection between the visuals, the way we manipulate them and how we gain insights through this process. The question becomes even more relevant now, as we're moving towards more natural interaction in our interfaces, with touch-enabled tables, tablets and phones and even free-form whole body interaction through technologies like Microsoft's Kinect. Having a deeper understanding of how to best do interaction in vis would make it much easier for us to port existing visualization techniques to these new devices. And these new forms of interaction can in turn make our data visualizations more powerful and more expressive.
