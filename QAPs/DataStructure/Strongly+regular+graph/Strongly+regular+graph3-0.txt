What are the uses of linear algebra in theoretical computer science?
Cryptography, coding theory, graph theory and theory of expanders are some areas where linear algebra over finite fields (or projective geometry over finite fields) plays an important role. As mentioned in Babis Tsourakakis' answer spectral graph theory relies heavily on linear algebra over [math]\mathbb{C}[/math]. For example, here is a recent paper by a famous theoretical computer scientist/mathematician on automorphism groups of strongly regular graphs (an important object in the field of spectral graph theory) which discusses an important problem in theoretical computer science, the graph isomorphism problem. A related question: How important is linear algebra in computer science?, has more on this.
