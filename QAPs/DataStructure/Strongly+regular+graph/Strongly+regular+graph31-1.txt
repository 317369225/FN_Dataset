How difficult is it to adapt to the conditions of earth after a space travel? What are the difficulties faced during this process?
Robert Frost has already given a pretty comprehensive answer so I'll just add a quick anecdote. My father was an astronaut in the 90s and, as Robert mentioned, astronauts gain some height while in a zero-gravity environment and then lose it when they're back on Earth. On the return of his second trip, when my father's height contracted, two bones, somewhere in his back or shoulders, pinched a nerve. Or at least, that's how it was described to me; so either that or something to that effect. It was evidently fairly painful and it never really went away, though he died only a few years later in unrelated circumstances so who knows if it would have been resolved somehow. I suppose that falls under ERS - orthostatic intolerance in Robert's list.
