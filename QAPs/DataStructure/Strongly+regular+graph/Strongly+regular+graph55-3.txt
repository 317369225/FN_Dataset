Is two months enough to get well-versed in competitive programming?
If you're going to start competitive coding with the goal of "becoming well versed", you're most probably going to get bored. Do competitive programming for the fun of it. If you become well versed, all the better. If not, you still had hours of fun. Also, its impossible to predict how fast you can learn. Only you or your teachers can know that.
