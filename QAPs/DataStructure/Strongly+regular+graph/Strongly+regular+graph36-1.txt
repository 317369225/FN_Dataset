What algorithms do data scientists actually use at work?
There's no need to be disappointed. There is no right answer for which machine learning algorithm to use. Where classification and clustering is used, so can Neural Networks. It depends on what you're building, and what you as the data expert are comfortable with. People don't like Neural Networks because the model cannot tell you what variables are significant. You'll hear people talk about Neural Networks as a "black box". You put data in, something magical happens, and data comes out. Neural Networks are used heavily in speech recognition and digit recognizers (handwriting recognition for example) -- places where answering the question of "why" is not really needed. I've been a Data Scientist for 4 years and am now working with a Data Science consulting firm. It's interesting, because there are some really amazing algorithms out there (like Bayesian techniques), but they are not always practical for the company. Some of the algorithms I've used the most: Linear/Logistic Regression models, Time Series models, Survival Analysis/Failure rates, Statistical Process Control, Clustering and Classification. That said, I have colleagues who have sworn by some algorithms I've used little of, like Mixed Models, Neural Networks, and Bayesian models. In a nutshell, the algorithms used depends on the Analyst, the company's needs, and the team the Analyst works with. As long as you can explain your model and use your model to meet objectives, it doesn't matter which one you use. In the end, any manipulation/tweak to an algorithm will only provide incremental improvements, whereas better data (in quality and relevance) can provide large improvements.
