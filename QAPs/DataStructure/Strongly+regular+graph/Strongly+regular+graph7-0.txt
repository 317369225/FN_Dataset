What is the interpretation of generalized eigenvalue/vectors in spectral graph theory?
There are all kinds of things you can say regarding spectral characteristics of graphs via eigenvectors but they are almost all specific to types of graphs. See the last theorem below first as I think it sheds the most light on your question. Some of the more general things one might say includes: Theorem.  If two graphs are y-cospectral for two distinct values of y, then they are  y-cospectral for all values of y, even irrational values of y. Theorem. Let G be strongly regular with vertex set X of size n, and let E be an eigenvalue other than the valency  k. Let y = ( k - E ) / n.  Then for each subset S of X, the spectrum of G and the y-spectrum of the graph induced on S determines the y-spectrum of the graph induced on X \ S. Theorem. Let G be a finite graph, and A a group of automorphisms. If H1 and H2 are subgroups of A such that G is a cover of G / Hi ( i = 1, 2 ) and such that each conjugacy class of G meets H1 and H2 in the same number of elements, then the quotients G / Hi ( i = 1, 2 ) have the same spectrum  and the same Laplace spectrum. Theorem.  The number of non-DS graphs on n vertices with respect to the Laplace matrix is at least          r n (n)^(1/2) Gn-1 Theorem.  For the adjacency matrix, the Laplace matrix, and the signless Laplace matrix of a graph G, the following can be deduced from the spectrum: (a) the number of vertices (b) the number of edges (c) whether G is regular (d) whether G is regular with any fixed girth and form the spectrum of the  adjacency matrix one gets: (e) the number of closed walks of any fixed length (f) whether G is bipartite and lastly, form the spectrum of the Laplace matrix : (g) the number of components (h) the number of spanning trees
