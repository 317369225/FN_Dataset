Are humans really causing global warming?
A key piece of data is that carbon in fossil fuels differs from carbon that is regularly part of the carbon cycle.  Some fraction of atmospheric carbon is struck by cosmic rays into a radioactive form, 14C.  Buried 14C undergoes radioactive decay, becoming nitrogen, at a predictable rate.  After a few thousand years, the 14C is all gone, and the sample will be almost pure 12C.  When you burn a fossil fuel, it puts more 12C into the air.  By measuring the isotope ratio, you can effectively "carbon date" the air, and see if the increase in carbon is due to "old" carbon or "new" carbon.  "Old" carbon would most likely come from fossil fuels, because other processes that produce it (volcanoes, for example) happen at a relatively constant rate.  There's no evidence of a sudden surge in volcanic activity in the past few hundred years. There are various ways to get data on past carbon isotope ratios.  Carbon is sequestered in trees and corals, which get it from the atmosphere.  By comparing the isotope ratios in pre-Industrial Revolution coral to the current atmosphere, we can see whether the burning of fossil fuels has significantly increased atmospheric 12C. The data show just that: an increase in 12C concentration since the Industrial Revolution: That's just one graph that happened to be convenient for me to pick up.  There are numerous other studies that show it.  A link containing citations: http://www.realclimate.org/index... What this shows is not just that CO2 is increasing, but that it's increasing due to "old" carbon.  The most likely source of this is the burning of fossil fuels, which are rich in old carbon.  The degree to which the increased 12C tracks the increase in total CO2, and the directness of the mechanism connecting the two, is extremely suggestive of a causal relationship.
