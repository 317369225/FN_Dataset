Gas prices in the USA averaged $3.90 a gallon in August - how much is this damaging the economy?
First, it's important that oil is now the de facto medium of exchange.  Since the world went off the gold standard in the 70's, energy has become the world's currency. Second, though everybody wants energy (and oil is the most widely acceptable form), not everybody has it, or enough of it, or in the form they prefer.  So international trade in energy is a widely accepted medium of exchange.  And demand for it is relatively inelastic (relatively impervious to large responses to changes in its price).  It take a relatively large increase in energy prices to cause a relatively small decline in demand. Third. it is a key determinant of the worth of production.  Apart from intellectual production, such as writing books, practicing law or medicine, it is difficult to think of many jobs which ACTUALLY produce a product that do not involve the consumption of energy. Finally, the cost of energy behaves like a tax.  Just as when the government raises taxes (yes - even on the rich) it results in a decline in production because it decreases the profit from enterprises, and decreases the amount of money available to consumers.  And, just like taxes, the more the cost of energy that we import increases, the less disposable income will be available for spending and investment.
