Gas prices in the USA averaged $3.90 a gallon in August - how much is this damaging the economy?
Gail Tverbergs (ourfiniteworld.com/ ) calculations shows a correlation @0.959 between population growth + energy and GDP (BNP) growth. Peak oil exports (goods on the market) occurred 2005ish which has led to a phase shift in prices, since the price is now non-elastic (demand and supply not in phase) So access to (cheap) energy (oil) is strongly correlating to growth. But do we need growth? That is a different question, some say US have not had any growth since 2001: pics from http://cornucopia.cornubot.se/
