Why doesn't Quora have a larger community yet?
Do you really want all your FACEBOOK friends to come on QUORA? I don't. Not everybody in the world is exactly thirsting for knowledge. At the risk of sounding elitist, I have to say that most of the people on social networking sites crave appreciation for all the wrong reasons(photos, status updates et al). Here you will find that  "smart, intelligent answer" is a better compliment than "LUKIN SEXY BABY". Unfortunately a majority of the people in the world prefer the latter. But yes, I would love to have more people join, it will help build up on the vast reservoir of knowledge that Quora already is. Updated 141w ago • View Upvotes
