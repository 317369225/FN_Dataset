What is the best design for a popsicle stick bridge?
The three main failure modes of popsicle stick structures are uneven load spreading, glue joint separation, and buckling of compression members. You can fix all of these by building a simple truss structure using multiple sticks per truss element, rather than a complex single-stick-thick structure as most people do. Thoroughy glue the sticks together in a bundle to form laminated composite beams for your primary structural elements. Then make a simple truss out of those composite beams. Make sure you overlap the stick ends to form continuous laminated beams spanning the entire bridge length, with the stick ends staggered to eliminate weak points.
