How do I overcome hard times in life?
Swami Vivekanand has said: If life is going too easy, that means something is wrong. So Congo.. you are going through hard times, that means you are moving in the right direction. :) Now whatever comes your way you have to deal with all your strength, Stay positive even if you lose. Be happy, because if you will project gloom, the world will reflect doom. Don't think about results, because if you will work hard you will be paid. Universe always conspires in our favour, sometimes we are not able to understand how. All the Best. Be brave. :)
