What are the best Data Science Masters Programs in the US?
I would argue that if you already have an engineering degree and working full time in the business intelligence space, getting another a degree will do little for you.  I would spend time learning the tools and techniques of data scientists.  A small part of my answer How do I learn about big data analysis implementation? touches on data science a bit.  I think you would get far more value in a far shorter amount of time getting hands on experience over spending money to go to school for 2-3 years.  And depending on the company you work for, they may be willing to spend some money on you for professional training in this space.
