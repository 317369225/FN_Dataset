What are the best Data Science Masters Programs in the US?
Here is some research I had recently done for a friend. The thing is, Universities that are among  the first to start a specialized Masters on Analytics/ Big data are not necessarily in the Top 10 so its much harder to tell the rankings apart. On the question of fit, these programs tend to be either statistics heavy or computer science/distributed systems heavy. Choose keeping in mind what truly your passion is. 15 Data Science/Analytics courses:   Stanford: Stanford Computer Science offers a concentration in Analytics and Info management Berkley offers a concentration in ‘Data Science and Systems’: EECS at UC Berkeley USC: USC - Department of Computer Science - Viterbi School of Engineering - Data Science NYU: Master of Science in Data Science - Center for Data Science NYU another one: Master of Science in Business Analytics Columbia: Masters in Data Science Cornell: Master of Engineering in OR with a concentration in either Data Analytics or Information Technology CMU: Very Large Information Systems - Carnegie Mellon University Harvard take on Analytics/Data Science(Not sure how relevant but this is to the industry): Master of Science in CSE UW has great faculty doing work in data science for their computer science Masters: Professional Master's Program,  and offer concentration in ML and Big data: Computer Science & Engineering NCSU: Master of Science in Analytics • Institute for Advanced Analytics • North Carolina State University Northwestern: Master of Science in Analytics Rutgers: Analytics UIUC: Masters in Statistics with Concentration in Analytics: Department of Statistics, University of Illinois: MS in Analytics Stevens : Master of Science - Business Intelligence & Analytics Lewis University: Masters in Data Science Updated 50w ago • View Upvotes
