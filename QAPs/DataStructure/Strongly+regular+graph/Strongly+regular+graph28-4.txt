Why does Israel have such a strong military compared to other middle eastern countries?
When comparing with other ME countries, I've seen this theory somewhere on Quora: In most of the ME countries, the government is afraid of the military, and therefor limit its funding, size, and training. That's because these governments are not representative of their people, and soldiers (In a professional military) will always be of the more dis-enfranchised parts of a given society; If too many of them would somehow realize they can win in a coup, thus making their own (And their families') lives much better, there's very little the current ruler can do. Israel is a representative democracy, and these not to be worried about military coups, so the military can be big. This obviously doesn't explain everything, and not 100% true for all ME countries, but it's an interesting theory, and has at least some relevance to some countries (pre-2003 Iraq and Assad's Syria are good examples where this might hold).
