Why are software development task estimations regularly off by a factor of 2-3?
It's because software developers don't know the trick to great estimates. The only way to get to the real estimate is - look into the crystall ball below. In the crystall ball, you'll discover the following Requirements What your estimated on is different from what management has in mind Additional changes that'll show up later; expect them all the way to the ship date You will need to go back to ask for clarifications on requirements as it lacks the needed clarity when you actually get to that particular part of the work Design Your design didn't account for all the scenarios - you might have to redesign Your design couldn't account for the changes in the requirements - you might have to redesign You thought the work was similar to what you have done before - but once you get into it you finally realize how different it actually was Development Try as you might - writing perfect code is only achievable by God The 3rd party code you are depending on also have bugs Combinatorial explosion of bugs in each layers makes the actual behavior unpredictable QA and Deployment QA cannot provide 100% coverage; 100% coverage doesn't prove absence of bugs Working backwards from the behavior of bugs to the actual code is a nonlinear exercise Environment differences matter - and often are being account for way too late in the cycle Management The amount of meetings you have to sit through, and how all the disruptions render you unproductive for the rest of the day People get sick on projects. The larger the project the more people get sick Overtime makes you tired and slows down your synapses TL;DR Nobody can actually look into the crystal ball, not just the developers Very few of the above are within the control of the developers Unknown unknowns are the norm to software projects rather than the exception
