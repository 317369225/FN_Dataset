How did you prepare for IIT-JEE?
All the teachers, like V.K.Bansal, Anand Kumar, MVR, etc and toppers I interviewed while writing The Topper Prepares have given their own perspectives, which I ended up covering in the book. Here's what came forth as top points: 1. Inspiration: inspiration leads to motivation, and motivation leads to action. Inspire yourself regularly by following role models. 2. Avoidance of distraction: smartphones, social media, and relationships - these are the three biggest distractions at this phase. Avoid all three as much as you can. 3. Focus: learn how to stay focussed for long. There are many focussing techniques (like meditation), which help bring laser sharp focus to your brain. 4. Eliminate learning gaps: while the full concept is too much to explain here, the gist is: make sure your foundations are solid, so you are able to build up knowledge on top of it. For eg. if you are weak in algebra or trigonometry, its going to hurt you in more advanced topics that build up on that. 5. Flow state: once again, a longer concept to talk about, but in short --- when you begin studying, don't break that flow until the end of that phase of study. Constant breakage is massive waste of time. 6. Scheduling: you need to create a very tight schedule that makes sure that all weaknesses are fully covered. 7. Increasing challenge: keep challenging yourself regularly with solving increasingly difficult problems. If you aim for Everest, you will definitely manage to climb the mountains of Shimla. ;) Try to simulate test situations as frequently as you can. I could go on and on --- but other answers to this question cover the other points already.
