How does it feel to travel alone?
It is one of the best thing that can happen  in life. I believe everyone has to travel alone atleast once in their life. As for some it can a life changing moment. it gives an opportunity to learn and discover about ourselves. And to see the world with a different perspective where you I keep on travelling a lot alone and i never felt alone because i am with ME all the time :) #. Decide your next destination: You can go wherever, whenever you want. There is no one interfering in your plans. If you like something and wants to enjoy more, then there is no one to stop you. #. Spend time with yourself: This is the most important thing which happens to you. You get ot know more and more better about your self. And gives a break from the busy life. "Sometimes you find yourself in the middle of nowhere and sometimes in the middle of nowhere you find yourself." #. Meet new people : By traveling solo, you’ll likely meet many more people along the way than if you were traveling with a friend. #. Do anything you want without being judged: No one is there is judge you. Do what ever you like and enjoy. #. Gain Confidence: You gets a different perspective of life. Get to see the world with a different angle. You starts believning more and more on yourself. Some of the photographs which i took on my solo trip to Norway last week :) Took 2 hiking trips in the Western Norway. I am sure it won't be easy to convince people/friends to go such places. Its a hike of 22 Kms in the snow convered mountains, but the beauty is worth it :) Trolltunga: One of the toughest hike i ever took. Another hiking trip to Pulpit Rock: Beauty of small towns :- I just believe in this one line:- Sair kar duniya ki gafil Zindgani phir kahan.. Zindgani gar rahi to Naujawani phir kahan. Hope these may inspire you a bit to travel solo sometime :)
