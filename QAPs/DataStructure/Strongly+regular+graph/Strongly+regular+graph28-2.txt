Why does Israel have such a strong military compared to other middle eastern countries?
Two main reasons. They need it. They can afford it. On the first one. It is no secret that Israel is surrounded by countries that have been hostile toward them since their inception. I will not dwell into why, and who's fault that is. The second one, Israel themselves have a pretty good economy.Israel ranks 19th among 187 nations on the UN's Human Development Index, which places it in the category of "Very Highly Developed". According to Wikipedia Israel ranks 13th. Above Iraq with 5 BUSD, but waaaaay below Saudi Arabia in military spending. Turkey is probably not way of. USA provides many countries in the world with financial aid. Israel gets the biggest part among those countries. That number has been 3.1 BUSD for the last two years. Egypt gets half of that.
