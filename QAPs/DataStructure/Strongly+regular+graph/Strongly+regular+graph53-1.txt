What are some strong case studies and how-to's for user growth and retention re: attached diagram? http://t.co/acP8jTNpi6
I don't have the numbers but one Indian/Asian app which makes a good case study for both initial growth and retention is NewsHunt. The app is a news aggregator, fetching news from most of the popular Indian news papers. Â Its support for more than 10 regional languages and making the application available on a wide spectrum of phones broadened their target market. While there are many such apps now, what stands out about NewsHunt is their retention or recall strategy. Whenever they have a very important news alert they send a push notification to the user. At most times since the information is important and read worthy, the is more than likely to click it and start the application. Not sure if they have an algorithm to rank news items or do it manually but must say that they clearly understand the difference between notify and annoy.
