What was Silicon Valley like after the bubble burst in the early 2000s?
Oh man, it was brutal.  As a youngish startup guy, everyone I knew was affected.  Most everyone I knew lost their jobs.  Soon after, most everyone I knew moved away. We were the epicenter of the financial collapse.  There weren't enough eyeballs on the web to support all of our ecommerce related businesses, and when we all scrambled to go b2b, the phantom contracts we all signed with each other dissolved into dust. The contrast between the bubble years was epic.  Gone were the open bar events and fabulous launch parties.  Gone were the jobs and companies.  And soon after, gone were most of the entrepreneurs without a safety net - many back to live with their families to regroup. When a promised term sheet didn't arrive, my co-founders and I laid everyone in our startup off, shut our office on 14th and Valencia, and moved in together to try and keep the boat afloat.   I worked for a year without seeing a dime.  My monthly budget was $2100 including rent.  Not easy to do in SF.   My low point came when out in North Beach when I thought I had $100 in my checking account, but then was denied by the ATM increasingly smaller deductions all the way down to $20.  I went home and the next day cashed in my 401K.  Then I took a real job for 18 horrible months and banked enough to go independent again. Those years left a permanent impression on me.  Not big on excess these days, because you never know macro conditions are going to lay the hammer down.
