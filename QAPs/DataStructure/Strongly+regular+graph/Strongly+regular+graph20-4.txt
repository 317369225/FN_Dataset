How do you become strong as a person?
In addition to following all of the great advice listed to date, I'm going to add a slightly different approach to combatting your current feelings and fears: be mindful. I know this is more easily said than done. Don't give up: Every moment when you are aware of fear increasing, breathe out your fear, breathe in peace -- and be as aware of what you are feeling in every moment. That is, check in with your Self often. Depending on what you're going through, it can be as often as every two minutes. Some people live harrowing lives. You can set an alarm and check in automatically, or train yourself to do it regularly or whenever something 'triggers' feelings you do not want. Using the hack for Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), chart your feelings every morning and every night whenever you are feeling distress. You can get a Skills Training Workbook -- the best in the market, in my opinion. Here is the link: http://www.amazon.com/Training-T... and, even though author Dr. Marsha Linehan formulated this workbook for women with borderline personality disorder, the workbook is suitable for anyone going through a difficult time needing CBT and provides those who implement its systems with more cognitive awareness, hacks and memes to create the change they wish to have in their lives. You will see that your feelings change over time because you will have graphs, reminders and all kinds of help in this workbook. Self-help and using such a workbook can be less expensive and at times more helpful than face to face therapy when there is a mismatch of therapist to client/patient (although finding the right match is very necessary and even critical at times, too. Don't ever give up finding the right therapist. Interview at least five before settling on one). You will find the right balance of self-help and therapy that works for you. Good luck!
