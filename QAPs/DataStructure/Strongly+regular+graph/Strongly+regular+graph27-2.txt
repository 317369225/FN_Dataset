History of Europe:Â Why did Germany fare so much better than Great Britain economically in the past 50 years?
I'm going to make some very broad statements here, but please bear with me: 1. Germany's economic success, relative to other European countries, comes from their strong exports compared to imports. It is possibly the only EU country to achieve a trade surplus on a regular basis. Germany's export economy is has helped sustain a. their manufacturing sector b. their mid-sized, family-owned businesses. Intuitively, this can be understood to benefit people from ranging from the working-class to the upper middle-class. (Of course, in recent years, the middle-class has taken a hit as in every country in Western Europe.) 2. The UK's economic success, relative to other European countries, comes from the strong growth of the financial sector. London is the financial hub of Europe, attracting both brains and money in vast amounts. This has resulted in a tremendous growth in wealth for people in the financial sector and people at the top of the income ladder. It has been difficult for this wealth to trickle down into other social strata. Money shifted massively from the industrial / manufacturing sectors (in regions such as Birmingham, Liverpool...) to the financial sector (in London), leading to higher social inequalities. These are some of the factors that lead into Mr. Poirier's previous answer. As for the graph provided by Anon User, the data is correct, but GDP per capita is a measure that does not take inequality into account. I am not saying that the UK has immensely high inequality (it is way lower than in the US, for instance), but it is higher than Germany.
