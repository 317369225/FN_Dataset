Why is it harder to stand still than to walk?
I'm going to toss this out there since it seems like people are ignoring the physiological (not psychological) mental part: the brain's gating mechanism. As anyone who has fallen and suffered multiple cuts/bruises knows, the worst cut always hurts the most. How is that relevant here? Well, if you're simply standing still, say bagging groceries, then a lot of your attention is on simply standing around. You may, from time to time, change your focus to bagging, but the majority of the time is spent standing around, bored. In this case, there is little incentive for your body to ignore the signals coming from your legs telling you they're tired and/or hurting. As a result, you pay attention to that, and it seems your legs hurt faster. Compare that to if you are running/jogging. Consciously, you have to account for cracks in the road, obstacles, cars, a plethora of visual stimuli. You have to take into account what you're hearing (unless you're drowning everything out with movement). You use the feedback from your feet, mostly unconsciously, to fix minor problems with each stride. This all takes your mind away from the fact that from the beginning, you are actively hurting your legs. Your legs will really only start to feel like they're hurting once they are hurt bad enough to overcome your brain's instructions to survey the surroundings, which can take a lot of time, given your instincts for self-preservation (not landing on a crack or getting run over, let's say) Also, once you start a run, you start releasing adrenaline, which simultaneously provides more oxygen and nutrient support to the legs and attenuates the pain signal(s). The effects of adrenaline are not to be underestimated. I would also agree with everyone else that when moving, the vasodilation in your skeletal muscles causes quicker removal of lactic acid, helping delay the buildup that causes the burning feeling.
