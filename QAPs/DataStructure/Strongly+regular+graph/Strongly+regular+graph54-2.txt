What are the best ways to prepare for interviews with top-tier management consulting firms?
Get in the know. Stay focused and save time while you prepare by going straight to the source: the firms themselves and the people who worked there. Take time to actually read the material on the recruiting website. McKinsey, BCG and Bain have invested a lot of resources in their recruiting websites to tell you in the most succinct and clear way exactly what they are looking for in candidates. Once you start working at one of these firms, you'll be surprised at how their recruiting criteria are actually laid bare on the website. Talk to someone who's worked there. Add texture and context to what's presented in the firm's recruiting materials by talking to someone you know who's worked at the firm you are interviewing with. This will give you a sense of the culture of the firm and what kind of a fit you'd be. Have them help you prepare. Ask people who've worked at these firms to give you mock interviews and give you tailored feedback. There really is no better way to prepare efficiently. Remember that practice makes permanent, not perfect. Don't spend all your time practicing with people who have never actually worked for the type of firm you want to work for and therefore don't have a very firm basis on which to give you feedback. Lastly, I realize that not everybody has contacts who've worked at BCG, Bain or McKinsey and even those who do, can't rely on these contacts to be on-demand interview coaches. We created www.evisors.com to solve precisely that problem. Here you can find 100's of former employees at McKinsey, BCG, Bain and more who've signed up to help you out.
