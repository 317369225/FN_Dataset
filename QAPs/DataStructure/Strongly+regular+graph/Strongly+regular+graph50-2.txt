How do I motivate myself to exercise?
I recently read an interesting article - Pricing and the Psychology of Consumption - published by Harvard Business Review. What interested me was a section that talked about how consumption of a service is affected by the timing of the payments. My previous gym subscription was the first thing that came to my mind! Remember how when we buy a service like a gym membership, we have multiple packages to choose from based on the duration of membership? Image represents a typical gym membership pricing scheme.

(In the above example, prices per month are - Monthly = $110, Quarterly = $105.3, Half Yearly = $100 and Annual = $92.5) Though you may be tempted by the smaller prices for the bigger commitments (half yearly/annual packages), the smart thing to do is to buy the monthly or quarterly packages. Here's why - Image Source The above graphs are fairly intuitive. We feel compelled to use products when we’ve paid for them, to avoid feeling that we’ve wasted our money. Hence, customers who opt for monthly or quarterly payment plans are more likely to continue going to the gym to avoid that feeling that comes more often to them, compared to semi-annual or annual buyers. So, go ahead. Trick your brain into going to the gym to exercise :D
