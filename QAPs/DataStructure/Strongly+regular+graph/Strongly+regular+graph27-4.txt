History of Europe: Why did Germany fare so much better than Great Britain economically in the past 50 years?
A few points have been missed in the other answers, which I will add to give context. Firstly, World War 2 was the big start of the German growth. It had been very successful in the early part of the century, but was totally destroyed by WW2. It was left in a position where all its factories had to be rebuilt, and tht meant new machinery. Ironically, a lot of this rebuild was done by the British, while British factories carried on using pre war equipment. Secondly, the unification of Germany in 1989-1990 helped change the whole dynamic of Germany. Its suddenly became much bigger, and statistically poorer. This let it pay less towards the costs of building the EU while it still worked closely to ensure EU legistation worked in its favour. By today, the one thing that is saving the UK is that London is the financial centre of Europe, and getting a big slice of the commission of the world's money being traded there.  The UK still has a great engineering tradition, but focuses on niche high tech areas such as Formula 1, Military Technology and telecommunications.
