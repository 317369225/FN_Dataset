Why specifically did MySpace fall so fast and so far?
As a complement to Yishan Wong's answer, I'm going to assume that their infrastructure and operational issues were not the cause of their decline and focus on the product.  There are three big things that held them back.  The site is unusable.  People will not put up with a bad product forever no matter how strong the network effects.  The most blatant example is its layout.  There is no logic to MySpace's core navigation.  There are links everywhere, and the design lends no clues as to what I should be doing.  Each page lets every element fend for itself, competing for attention and clicks.  The core navigation changes from page to page.  Go to 50 Cent's page ( http://myspace.com/50cent ); good luck getting back to the home page.  They love advertisers more than they love users.  They overoptimize for the advertiser's experience to the point where it's just embarrassing.  Even if you're logged in, going to myspace.com takes you to the splash page with the big ad of the day (one time, they sold an Incredible Hulk ad where the Hulk jumped out at you -- no joke).  When viewing a profile, the advertisements are more prominent than the person's picture.  There are at least 3 big visual ads on every page.  Why fix it if it's making money?  I'm pretty sure their focus on advertisers has gotten in the way of innovation and staying relevant.  For example, I can't imagine them forcing a consistent navigation on every page to make a better user experience.  What would 50 Cent's label say?  So now MySpace is stuck as a company that hosts custom landing pages until the ad dollars demand something new.
