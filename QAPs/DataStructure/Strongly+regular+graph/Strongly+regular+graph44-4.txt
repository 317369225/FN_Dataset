Why doesn't Quora have a larger community yet?
Uniqueness of quora is in the fact that," Here you are appreciated for your intellect, your matter, your subject knowledge, your perspectives" You dont get upvote just because you are beautiful and you have uploaded a sexy pic. I have seen anonymous answers getting more response as compared to the known ones. So the fact that friend's do upvote is gone One more thing is Quora, twitter, Instagram, pinterest- these are not made for all. They all have specific interests whereas Facebook and Google are generalise concept of Socialism like Myspace. Community doesn't matter to me untill and unless I am appreciated for my thoughts and not my pics
