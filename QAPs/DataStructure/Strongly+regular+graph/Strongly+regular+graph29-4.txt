Why specifically did MySpace fall so fast and so far?
In addition to Yishan Wong and Peter Deng's great answers, I would add that MySpace focused very heavily on a specific demographic (young, alternative music-lovers) that influenced the design of their property in a direction away from the mass-market.  MySpace's user pages tend to be very chaotic and edgy, very unlike the order that Facebook brings to their user's profiles.  By successfully focusing on their early adopter demographics their user experience left the rest of the market.  This may be a function of being in Los Angeles and being focused on music and entertainment, but it's clear they missed a much larger community opportunity.
