What are some must-watch Bollywood movies which did not do well at the box office?
A lot of great movies are listed here which were not appreciated on Box Office but loved by audience. I wonder how Quoran forget this awesome movie ? Pyaar Ka Punchnama (2011) : A Story With Punch About the movie :It's very rare to see an Indian film show this side of the modern woman and more importantly, this aspect of the modern man. The image of the macho hero is broken and shattered to bits, thanks to Pyar Ka Punchnama for heart-warming bittersweet tale of buddies, bonding and girl trouble. The story of not just one but three seemingly different men in three different kinds of relationships with a purposeful sense of capturing the larger truth about women and relationships. Suggestion :Guys, if you will watch only one movie about so called "Love-Relationship based movie", this is it. Girls, if you have ever wondered what goes on in the mind of every guy, this is it. After Movie :Sometimes, the baby. Sometimes, the substitute and sometimes, the dog. Such is the life of man.
