I am unable to study properly. What should I do?
Most Engineering students might face this issue due to college and living circumstances. Don't just read for getting grades, try to understand the practical applications and that will automatically make you strong in the subjects and will fetch you good grades as well :) Always try to correlate with real things which you cant understand in your subject. If possible get help from college staffs who are good at the subject for better understanding. Interact with as many people as u can to get more exposure and confidence in whatever you do.
