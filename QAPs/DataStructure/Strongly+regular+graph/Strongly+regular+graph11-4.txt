Why is it harder to stand still than to walk?
I just want to add to one of Ti's answers regarding blood flow and circulation. You can actually die from this effect if you are unconscious and unable to move your legs while in an upright position, as is what happens when rescuing unconscious patients in harnesses in a condition known as Suspension Trauma.
