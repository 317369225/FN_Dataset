Does academic scientific research really add to industry?
I can tell you that as a practicing engineer I don't regularly apply research, but whenever I have to do something new, the journals -- much of which is a product of academic research -- are one of the first places to look. Many things I ended up designing are in fact based on academic research. Why 2/3 of all engineering software I've used were initially created within academia, and virtually all heat transfer correlations were also developed within academia. Usually, if it's not academic research but corporate research, the fruits tend not to be published. Just look at the big players like Airbus and Boeing, they could each flood the journals with their research projects, but it's a trade secret, so it's just not published, even if the research was done by a graduate student. So yeah, we need you folks to make the next discovery and keep pushing the limits.
