What was Silicon Valley like after the bubble burst in the early 2000s?
It was awesome. I came out here in summer 1999 to do an internship (when things were insanely hot), returned to school and then graduated in May of 2001 (when things were dying).  I got a job with one of the only two Valley companies that were hiring - PayPal (the other one was Google).  If you were a person with a job moving into the Valley while all the rest of the web wannabes were moving out, it was absolutely incredible.  I bought all of my furniture barely-secondhand at steeply discounted prices from proto-hipsters, got a great financing deal on my first car (all-time low borrowing rates, with a new grad discount on top of that!), and apartment prices were the lowest they would ever be (which is to say appalling high). A few months later, 9/11 happened and apartment prices dropped even more, and we moved from our 1BR apartment into a 2BR apartment in a better location for less.  We stayed there for about 2 or 3 years while PayPal went through an IPO and an acquisition, all the while having our pick of top-tier engineering talent, where I met some great people who would later form the nucleus of an incredible startup network. So yeah, it was an awesome time.  I don't know what everyone else here is complaining about.  I mean, we are all innovative contrarians who go against the flow, right? Updated 91w ago • View Upvotes
