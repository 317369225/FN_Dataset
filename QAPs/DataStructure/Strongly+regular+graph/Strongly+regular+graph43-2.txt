What tools do associates at venture capital firms use for their daily activities?
Here's what I have open at this very moment: Gmail Slack Excel Powerpoint MS Paint (the easiest way I've found to clip screenshots to drop into Powerpoint/email) Evernote Quora Crunchbase Ghostery Google Calendar I also use Twitter, Google Trends, G2Crowd, TrustRadius, AngelList, WordPress, Box, MS Word, Google Adwords, Google Forms, and Glassdoor in various times and situations. And Spotify/SoundCloud are playing music almost every day. I'd appreciate any suggestions for other tools I should be using. [Edit: Forgot about LinkedIn. That too.] Updated 37w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Tom Jones
