Music Theory:Â I see other musicians namely jazz pianists, using chords in between chords specified in the progression. I've heard talk of something called 'routes' and a ii - V - I but I can't make sense of applying it for myself. Could someone explain this to me or show me where I can read up on it?
A valuable search term for this stuff (maybe more so in classical than in jazz) is 'linear harmony'.
