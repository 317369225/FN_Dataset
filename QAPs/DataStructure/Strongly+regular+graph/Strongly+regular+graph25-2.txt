Music Theory: I see other musicians namely jazz pianists, using chords in between chords specified in the progression. I've heard talk of something called 'routes' and a ii - V - I but I can't make sense of applying it for myself. Could someone explain this to me or show me where I can read up on it?
Great answers here. I just want to tease apart some related ideas:   reharmonization - changing the chord below a melody note to one that also supports the note, using different harmonies. (example: replacing the Dm ii chord in the key of Cmaj with F13 or FM9)   chord substitution - replacing a chord in a progression with an alternate chord that serves the same purpose (example: replacing the FMaj IV chord in the key of CMaj with F13 or FMaj9)   passing chords - briefly using chromatic chords that may not be in key, to connect chords that are in key. (example: using Em7 add 6, enroute to the F IV chord, in C)   At least that is how I think about them - subtle differences, but it presents different strategies, if you are thinking about meolody, chord progression or linear movement.
