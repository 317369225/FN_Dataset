Why are software development task estimations regularly off by a factor of 2-3?
Generally it is all of the reasons given in the question.  Some expansion on what I see are the core reasons: Developers can make poor estimates - Making good estimates requires experience, directed practice, and knowledge of the existing system and task at hand.  There are also psychological factors at play, in that many developers (people) desire to deliver optimistic news or be overly confident in their own abilities. This is especially true for new developers or in companies where the culture highly prioritizes timeliness over robustness. In general, I tell new developers to under-promise and over-deliver. Bugs and blocks happen - Software development is often described as "just in time."  Or the notion that you are always learning something new to tackle your next task.  So for even the best and most experienced developers unforseen hurdles and bugs will occur.  Proper estimation should take into account some buffer for these things, but particularly nasty or hairy bugs can bloat development time. External factors exist - Design/product specifications can change during the project due to a variety of external factors.  This can come from simply management changing its mind to forces in the market driving requirement changes.  Also when working with other teams or partners, communication and coordination can delay work.
