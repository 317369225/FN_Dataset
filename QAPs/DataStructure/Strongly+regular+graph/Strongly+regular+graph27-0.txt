History of Europe: Why did Germany fare so much better than Great Britain economically in the past 50 years?
I don't think its a fair statement to say that Germany has fared much better than the UK over the past 50 years. The graph below goes back 40 years for Germany, using GDP per capita data from the World Bank. As you can see, Germany and the UK have been roughly on par with each other. You can pick individual data points (like 1995 or 2009) that suggest wide disparities, but the overall performance has been quite similar.   (I suspect that if you go 10-20 years further back you'll see Germany having stronger growth pre 1970, but that can be explained by the fact that they were in a recovery state after the destruction of WWII, so they were simply climbing back to their country's normal level of economic productivity.)
