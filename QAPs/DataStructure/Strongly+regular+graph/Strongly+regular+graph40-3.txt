What are the advantages of hiring someone who has been in the US military?
It's hard to add much more to this subject. But I will anyway ;) One trait that I know is expected from military members that seems to be completely unexpected from corporate america is this: In the military "I've never done that before" (or heck even "I've never heard of that before")Â  is NO EXCUSE for failure. This is important to understand if you've got veterans working for you. On the positive side, they are willing and eager to take on any task. They will succeed. And the more impossible everyone thinks it is, the more gleefully they will pursue it. On the negative side, understand when you ask a vet "can you do this?" The answer is yes. The answer is "YES. I can do it -- I don't know how, but I will by the time I am done." You may mean to ask "have you done this before?" or "are you experienced with this?" or "are you qualified to do this?" But when you ask "can you..." remember you are asking someone who believes to his soul that "too hard" is a despicable excuse. I still remember my commander handing me a 250 page technical manual on a SINCGARS radio and telling me to give a class to the company tomorrow. I had never even seen a SINCGARS radio until that day. And weirder, I didn't even think that was an unreasonable request. I read the manual that afternoon, played with the radio a little bit and gave a 2 hour class on it the next day, and had all 112 people successfully using the radio that afternoon. Oh and we were out in the wilderness - no power point, no visual aids. It's a little bit like driving a very high-powered car, you've got to be careful about how casual you are with the gas pedal.
