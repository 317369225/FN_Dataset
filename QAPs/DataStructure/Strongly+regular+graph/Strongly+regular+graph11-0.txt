Why is it harder to stand still than to walk?
It's not psychological, although it is one of those paradoxes of life. Standing seems to involve not much activity, after all, you're not doing anything, and yet it is more tiring than walking. Indiana Public Media has a section on this and called the phenomenon "Gallery Feet", in reference to why walking around galleries / museums is more tiring than just regular walking. There are a few factors that go into play, and they are all somewhat related to each other. Some of them have been mentioned in  previous answers. 1. Standing is not resting: when standing "still" you're actually swaying back and forth, using your ankle as the pivot point. Your muscles are therefore continually making adjustments (albeit small ones) in order to keep you in that upright position.  If your muscles relaxed and these movements were to stop, you would pretty much just topple over. The graph below shows the change in center of mass and center of pressure for a person "standing still" over the course of 7 seconds. Notice how much it fluctuates in that short period of time, and imagine this going on for an hour. Every small shift in COM is a (series of) movement(s) that your muscles have to make. 2. Demand over a long period of time on just a few muscles: When standing, you're basically forcing the same few muscles (mostly in your calves) to keep working for a prolonged length of time, thus tiring them out. As mentioned in one of the previous answers, walking engages a lot more muscles, thus spreading out the fatigue. 3. Rest between strides: when walking, you're on one foot at a time. During this, the other foot and all the muscles there are basically taking a break and resting. The amount of time that each leg gets resting seems insignificant (though on average, you're effectively spending half of your time resting), but can really make a difference over time. 4. Blood flow (as mentioned by some previous answers): when standing, the heart is not strong enough to pump blood from the ankles / feet / calves back up, so there is a pool of stale blood that accumulates. Without that fresh blood to deliver oxygen, nutrients, and remove toxins, your muscles will feel uncomfortable.  Also from #1, you are forcing your muscles to do a lot of work, while simultaneously not giving them what they need.  Overworked + underfed = unhappy muscles.  When you walk, the increased activity of your muscles keep the blood flowing up to your heart and back, giving the muscles in your extremeties fresh blood, and keeping them happier.
