How can a medical doctor justify doing an MBA?
Justify to whom? I think if he or she can justify it to themselves, it should be enough. They don't owe anyone an explanation. That said, the healthcare sector needs good managers who understand the medical profession from inside and outside. The doctor-MBAs can fill in the gap. Doctors are generally poor at finances, entrepreneurship and in generally understanding how a business works. This is because the medical training is more intensive on gaining clinical skills than on learning how to convert clinical skills into profit/value. Running a hospital is not in an average doctor's repertoire of skills. I would also like to add that in the Indian scenario, many doctors go into management because medical doctors are highly underpaid across all sectors in clinical medicine. To move up the ladder you need to specialize and sub-specialize and that is highly competitive[1]. It is probably easier/affordable to get into an MBA program than to get into residency.
