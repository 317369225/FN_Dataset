Why is it harder to stand still than to walk?
Most of the stress from standing for long periods has to do with the point-loads on the bottoms of the feet. Walking and running produce a huge range of different point-load locations and load levels and each only for a brief instant.  Standing produces a pattern of point loading under the heels and the balls of the feet that is much more constant in both location and duration. To relieve the repetitive stress on the bottoms of the feet at those high-load areas, and the pain that results, the body shifts the weight, while standing, from one foot to the other and tilts or squirms the feet from side to side and front to back. This tactic works for an hour or so, but then the muscles and connective tissues in the feet and lower legs also get tired and start to hurt.  In all this, our addiction to wearing shoes may be the main source of difficulty for people who have to stand for extended periods. Most shoes present a more or less unchanging environment to the bottoms of the feet that actually works against the body's effort to relieve underfoot point-loads. Many shoes have slightly lumpy insoles, and this may further aggravate the problem.  If we have to or chose to wear shoes, the best solutions seem to be cushioning insoles that spread the underfoot loads, contoured footbeds shaped so as to spread the loads and minimal shoes that allow a larger range of random underfoot point loads.  The best solution may be going barefoot, which seems to strengthen the feet, make them more "intellegent" and more sensitive as well as thickening and toughening the padding on the soles. Barefoot standing also assures that the underfoot surfaces are much more varied in subtle and gross ways than can be achieved with any shoes.  This is probably the underfoot environment in which the feet evolved to work best.
