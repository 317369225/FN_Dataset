What are the best Data Science Masters Programs in the US?
It will be difficult to find programs with full scholarships for international students, but many have at least partial tuition scholarships for top applicants. I'd definitely recommend considering Illinois Institute of Technology's Master of Data Science (http://science.iit.edu/programs/...). In my entirely unbiased opinion :-) the program provides a very strong technical education in the field, while also teaching communication, management, and teamwork skills that are essential for real-world work in the field. Chicago is also a great city to live in while you are working on your degree. Some of the other top programs include NYU's (http://cds.nyu.edu/academics/ms-...), Columbia's (http://idse.columbia.edu/masters), and Berkeley's online program (http://datascience.berkeley.edu/). You should look carefully at the curriculum of any program you are considering, though, since master's programs in data science differ greatly in what they cover and focus on.
