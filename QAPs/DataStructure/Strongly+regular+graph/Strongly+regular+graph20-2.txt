How do you become strong as a person?
If you do nothing else, please go and see your family Dr and show him (her) what you have written here. I have heard stories similar to your own many, many times over the past few years. I am fairly sure you are suffering from depression. The good news is that there are people who can help you. You may need medication and if you came to our department, we would ask you to speak to our department of psychological medicine with a view to accessing psychiatric help. The help you are getting at the moment is NOT enough. In England there is a telephone service called 'the Samaritans', there may be a similar service where you are living. This may tide you over until you can get professional help. Please do not use 'substances' they will ultimately not help and may make the problem worse. You say you have suicidal feelings, please DO NOT act on these. Your feelings are a symptom of a clinical disorder, people like myself can help you. Please get help now.
