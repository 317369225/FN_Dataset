Gas prices in the USA averaged $3.90 a gallon in August - how much is this damaging the economy?
The big question we need to ask is: What will happen when there is real competition at the pump from alternative fuels with costs lower than that of conventional petroleum products? When America achieves a stable flow of $2 per gallon domestic transportation fuel (with localized production) everything changes.Â  Don't laugh. :) It might not be that far off ...
