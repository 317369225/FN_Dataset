How do I start competitive programming?
You step into competitive programming qith two approaches I'll/I've to win this competition. I know i can't win but by participating i can surely learn something new. Try to adopt second approach. As you have basic knowledge of C++, i can assume you know how to handle classes and basic concepts of OOP. It is not mandatory to know OOP, as i recall i started competing with knowledge of C only. Join anyone or following : www.codechef.com www.hackerearth.com www.hackerrank.com www.topcoder.com Try competing in live content or try to solve previous problems. Be regular, as practice makes a man perfect. And explore new ways to solve one problem, you never know you may stumble upon gold. Best of luck.
