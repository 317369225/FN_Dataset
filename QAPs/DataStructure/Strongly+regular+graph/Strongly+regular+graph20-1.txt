How do you become strong as a person?
By not focusing on building personality and working on building character instead. If you want to be a generally more interesting person, intentionally put yourself through more experiences. Challenge yourself. Travel. Get out in the world and off of Quora. The more personal experiences you have had the more you will be able to connect with people about when you hear that they have done similar things. Live a big life, push your comfort zone wider, and then be more of a listener than a talker. Give other people the stage and they will use it.
