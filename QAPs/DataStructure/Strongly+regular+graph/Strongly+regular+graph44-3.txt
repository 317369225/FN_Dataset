Why doesn't Quora have a larger community yet?
I see the fact that quora doesn't have a large community as compared to facebook or twitter. There may be several reasons like, 1.Â  it is not a good platform to flaunt yourself. 2. nobody is interested here to know other's achievement (I am considering buying a camera/doing shopping with girlfriend as achievements ) 3. nobody cares about hashtag 4. less people having the passion to acquire knowledge 5. people here can down vote you :D :D
