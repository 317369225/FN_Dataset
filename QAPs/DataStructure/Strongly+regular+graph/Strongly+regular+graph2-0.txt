How much abstract algebra background is needed before delving into algebraic combinatorics?
At the bare minimum you would need to know basic linear algebra. There are many problems in combinatorics that you can solve by just using the concept of the dimension of a vector space. Some examples, The maximum number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., n} that pairwise share the same number of elements is n. The edges of the complete graph cannot be partitioned into fewer than n−1 complete bipartite graphs. Then you could refresh your knowledge of eigenvalues from linear algebra and delve into the area of Spectral graph theory. You could see how certain important classes of graphs like strongly regular graphs can be studied using the eigenvalues of their adjacency matrices. If you want to stretch that further then you could study Association schemes. Though, some knowledge of group theory is highly recommended for that. Or perhaps, you could look into the theory of expander graphs. For getting deeper into this area you'd need to understand the basics of group theory, field theory, ring theory, polynomials, etc. This is ideally covered in a standard introduction to algebra course. After that you could easily study topics like matroid theory, coding theory,  finite geometries and algebraic combinatorial geometry,  Some representation theory would also come in handy to study things like Young tableau. In summary, depending on what you want to study in algebraic combinatorics, you'll need to know the basics of group theory, field theory, representation theory and commutative algebra. An undergraduate course in these topics should suffice. Here are some references: Algebraic Combinatorics by Chris Godsil Linear Algebra Methods in Combinatorics by Laszlo Babai and Peter Frankl.
