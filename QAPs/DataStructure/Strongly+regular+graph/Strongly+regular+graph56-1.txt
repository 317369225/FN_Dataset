How do I overcome hard times in life?
Thanks for the A2A. I have been facing some hard times myself during the last few weeks. So I can tell you what I have tried to do and what is working for me. Things that didn't work out The easiest way which we think of is to run away from the situation or just turn our back to it. But it never works. It comes back haunting you. I tried drinking, smoking up etc but at the end of the day the problem was there and i can't help thinking about it. Then i thought of doing things which other people have done to overcome similar situations but to no effect. Then i realized facing the truth or the problem is the best possible way out. Those hard times gave me time to think what i really wanted out of my life and what's the best possible solution. I started involving myself in things which i always wanted to do but never got a chance or ignored. went to a trip(a trek in my case) alone. It helped to ease my mind and i got enough time to think how to start fresh. Trying to develop a running habit. A jog every morning makes my day awesome and helps me focus on the present and not ponder over past. Figuring myself out. I understood one thing that no one else can help me during hard times except me. I starting working on my weaknesses and keeping myself cautious enough so that i never have to face the same situation ever again.Lastly, every hard time we face teaches us a valuable lesson at zero cost which stays with us for the whole life and makes us more smart than we were before. :D P.S.: My answer is a bit biased to start new since the hard time i faced was because of emotional problems and i had no other solution.
