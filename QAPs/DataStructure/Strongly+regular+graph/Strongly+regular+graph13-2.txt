How can a medical doctor justify doing an MBA?
I agree with Balaji Viswanathan on this. Its nobody's business which career I choose. There may be so many reasons: Your interests are changed, your current career is less rewarding, you need multi-disciplinary degrees (knowledge) to advance your career. But I have a concern that is very prevalent in developing countries like us. Although market does not cater to the interests of the individuals but a prospering country is one,  where students choose their career as per their interests. I believe children should have a sense of their passions from very beginning of their life i.e. incorporating skills from a very young age. This may include providing more practical experience to children in terms of small projects in various fields. Children should have a feel, what is actually done in different professions. This means lesser change of professions overall, and much better quality output in all professions. This way we will save a lot of resources. But in the end, it is individual's choice, what next he wants to do. Whether he wants to become a Businessman, consultant, researcher, actor, or an activist, or a politician whatever drives him: There are many famous examples of such career change: Dr Aman Naik, MBBS, MBA, Headed many Hospitals Dr Harsha Vardhan: MBBS> MD> Politics Rowan Atkinson: MS in electrical Eng> Mr Bean Arunabh Kumar: IIT Eng> Founder TVF Rahul Ram:MSc in chemistry > Singer & Bass Guitarist Sushant Rajput: DCE Mechanical Engineer> Actor Chetan Bhagat: IIT Eng>IIM>Investment Banker> Writer ( I know some of you don't like him :P) Gaurav Agarwal: IIT Eng> IIM> Investment Banker> IAS Topper Sundar Pichai: IIT Eng> Stanford MS> Wharton MBA> Mckinsey> Google My personal favourite is: Arvind Kejriwal: He interest in activism led him to his current profession: He Went from IIT Mechanical Engineering graduate> Worked for TATA group>Civil Services> Higher studies>Activism> Politician Updated 56w ago • View Upvotes
