Why are the stars in the Sagittarius A* region presumed to orbit a supermassive black hole and not just the barycentre of the galaxy?
The orbits nearer the center are tighter than those further out.  If it was simply the center of mass of the galaxy, each inner shell of matter would cancel out the gravitational attraction and the pattern of orbits would be different.  Therefore there is an enormous mass concentrated in or around Saggitarius A*.  Further evidence is the resolved radius of the attactor and the mass of the attractor would indicate that the attractor is a black hole. Other galaxies also have massive, compact attractors at their centers.  In some cases these are active black holes.  Ours is in a passive mode just now. Furthermore, models of galaxy formation indicate that a supermassive black hole is some sort of seed to the process of making a galaxy.
