How do I motivate myself to exercise?
A) You have to find a sport you enjoy so much that you want to make it a hobby. Do you know any fat regular kiteboarders, snowboarders, tri-atheletes, mountain bikers, whitewater kayakers ? The reason a sport is helpful is because: It'll be a challenge that you'll have to overcome. Thats something you can always keep with you and help motivate you when feeling bad ... about anything. You'll make friends who do the same thing and they will call your whiny ass out if you make excuses about not being able to go to the next session. It'll make, and more importantly keep, you fit for the rest of your life.Mine is kiteboarding.                                OR, B) Performance oriented powerlifting/weightlifting training regimen. If you're always looking to better yourself then one sure shot way to get motivated is to start a training regimen that is performance oriented. What that means is that your focus at each stage of training (a pseudonym for "working out") is on some performance metric - e.g., your vertical jump, your 1 rep max deadlift or broadjump. There is nothing quite like seeing the weights increasing every week and the performance numbers increasing every 2 weeks. The regimen I would recommend is Maximum Strength by Eric Cressey. It whipped me into the best shape of my life and all I was looking for was a better vertical for beach volley. Great book I highly recommend it. However you must have done some weightlifting before starting it. Updated 183w ago • View Upvotes
