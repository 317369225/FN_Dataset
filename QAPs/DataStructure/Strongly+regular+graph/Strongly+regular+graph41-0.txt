What are the best Data Science Masters Programs in the US?
There are many US universities that offer Analytics/Data Mining/Data Science degrees - I have a large list at Education in Data Mining, Analytics, .  including top-ranked universities like Rutgers, NYU, Columbia, Berkeley, CMU, U, Texas, Northwestern, DePaul, Stanford and others.  There is a lot of demand for Data Scientists, so such a degree, assuming that you learn all the popular tools and participate in some Kaggle competitions, will make you very much in demand.
