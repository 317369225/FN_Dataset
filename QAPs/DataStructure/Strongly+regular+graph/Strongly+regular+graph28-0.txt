Why does Israel have such a strong military compared to other middle eastern countries?
Well, in the beginning of 20th century the Great Britain Navy was built on the assumption it should be able to fight against any two biggest Navies of the time. So it was roughly twice big than any other Navy. Israel ArmyÂ  (Israel Defense Forces) is planned according to assumption it should fight against all neighbors and their friends simultaneously (the Independence War was just that, and all following wars didn't become better). Israel is very small country with almost no resources. IDF can't fight for years or months, it has to win and to win quickly. At least it has to prevent the other side from winning - and do it quickly as well, so the war will stop - else it will run out of ammo, fuel and men. So it has enough of well trained and equipped forces to be able to overcome "all neighbors and their friends simultaneously" and quickly. O, at least they think they are able to do so. And I hope they are right.
