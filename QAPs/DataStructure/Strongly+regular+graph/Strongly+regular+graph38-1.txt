I am unable to study properly. What should I do?
Failures are the pillars of success.Â  So, study less, you will fail, and hence you will succeed. Do not study, if you do not like to. Because, if you overdo something which you intrinsically do not like, you will regret it later, at some point of time. The time which you lost, thus, will never come back. It is only worthwhile to engage in something which you like from inside, because life is essentially very short. However, you can practise pranayama, yoga and exercise to increase your mental stamina and focus, which will help you to study or do anything else, with similar rigour and effectiveness. Thanks for the A2A.
