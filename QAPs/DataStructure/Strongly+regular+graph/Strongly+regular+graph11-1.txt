Why is it harder to stand still than to walk?
My understanding is that when standing the heart is not strong enough to pump all the blood in you legs and feet back up. You've probably noticed times at the end of the day when your feet are a little swollen or shoes feel tighter, which can be in part because of this. To address this some veins/vessels going back to the heart in your legs have a series of one way valves preventing backward blood flow. When you walk, the contraction muscles squeezes the vessels forcing blood above the valves. Edit: Here's a nice video illustrating it.
