If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
I frequently use advanced algorithms, and frankly, if you are not solid on graph theory and automata theory, then I donâ€™t want to work with you. Too much time is wasted explaining simple things. Too many elegant solutions get passed over for cargo-cult sludge.
