What are the most important concepts in C and C++ that should be learnt and understood before a programming interview?I don't have much time left for my interviews. So please suggest to me the concepts I must know before going for the interview.
C: Everything on Pointers, function pointers variadic macros, variadic functions Algorithms Data Structures in detail - Link List, Tree etc C++: Polymorphism - name mangling, vtable etc Exception handling - stake unwinding etc (how things happen internally) Threads (+mutex) IPCs - TCP/IP Sockets Data structures - STL Try to have the basic concept all clear - like what is volatile variable? Diff between new() and malloc() or how they both work? Pointer vs reference? etc etc. The interviews normally do not proceed further if you stuck on simple/basic stuffs. Learn some design patterns - of course something more than Singleton. Creational design patterns are easier to start with. (Youtube got very good tutorials on DP).
