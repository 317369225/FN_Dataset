What are some uses of hashing algorithms?
Some distributed hash storage systems use hashes to enforce an (arbitrary) routing path: every node in a network will hash its own node ID, and when an object is searched for or stored, each step in the routing path is determined by the finding the node known to the searching node whose node ID hashes closest to the hash of the desired object (falling back to the second-nearest, and so on, until some failure point). As the network becomes more connected, the number of hops approaches one, but as the network becomes more sparse, the number of hops grows closer to linearly -- all without actual routing tables or metadata or indexes or anything. That's the coolest and strangest use of hashes I've seen.
