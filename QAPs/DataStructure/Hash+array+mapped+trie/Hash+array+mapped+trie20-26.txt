How can I get a job at Facebook or Google in 6 months?How should I be going? I need a concise work-plan to build a good enough skill set. Should I join some other start-up? Should I build my own projects or start-up? Should I just focus on practicing up on Data Structures and Algorithms ?

Steve has another great article about phone screens http://sites.google.com/site/ste... My advice to undergrads is that you need to have very good background in computer science. This usually means doing an algorithms course and knowing most of CLRS really well. Then you need to be able to code somewhat fast under interview pressure. This means having a rating of at least 1500 on topcoder.com/tc algorithm contests. If you get your rating that high send me your CV.
