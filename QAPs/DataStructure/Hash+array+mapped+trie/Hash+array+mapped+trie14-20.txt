If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
Others have done a very good job explaining that most of the algorithms focused on in Algorithms courses were extremely important in modern technology and shaping the information age we know now.  So I'll put my attention on another matter: expectations.   I'm pretty sure you're talking about a Computer Science program (clarify this if I'm off)?  What gave you the impression that a computer science program should appeal to industry in the first place?  Computer Science is a scientific field.  You'll often find a program will mix practice with the scientific discipline to make it appealing to students and do so depending on their specialty.  Those expectations are weird when you put them under the lens of other fields.  The types of algorithmic problems out there are immense.  You could spend a whole career just studying one type of problem.  If I got a Biology degree, and expected every single thing that I learned to help me get a job or do my job, you'd look at me like I was very naive as in that field you could be doing anything from sequencing DNA to surveying populations.  Biology is a pretty broad field, and some would argue due to the interdisciplinary nature of CS, it is even more broad.  I hope this makes it even more obvious on how diverse industry or even working scientifically in a field could be.  For instance, I find a way to use most of what I learnt in algorithms courses because I work directly in that area in CS.  Some will need certain algorithms for what they're doing.  Sometimes it can get very specific and fairly complicated depending on the application.
