What are the minimum set of required computer science skills for a web developer who does not have a CS degree to be a good programmer?For example, some people say a programmer should know about binary tree structure and algorithms. Could you make a brief list? Details would be appreciated and I would be glad if you mention how to get those skills without attending a college? (Online resources, programs etc.)
As a graphic designer that became programmer I believe can tell you some ideas. I now work at a very cool company with a lot of responsibilities. Â To be a good programmer start by learning stuff constantly, also, chose something and become really good at it. For example, for a while I was paid very good for taking psds and designs and turning them into HTML/CSS really fast, I learned a lot of the quirks of CSS and how to make HTML more readable and cleaner. Find and learn to use tools that make your development faster, like Grunt, SASS, Rails, etc. Never lie about what you can and cannot do, people can tell.
