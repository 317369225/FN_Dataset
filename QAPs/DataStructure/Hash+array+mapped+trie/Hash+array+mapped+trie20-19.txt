How can I get a job at Facebook or Google in 6 months?How should I be going? I need a concise work-plan to build a good enough skill set. Should I join some other start-up? Should I build my own projects or start-up? Should I just focus on practicing up on Data Structures and Algorithms ?
Apply to google/FB now. Apply other places too. Get a job somewhere; possibly at a startup; possibly at your startup. If it's not at Google or FB, apply again in a year if you really want to. You can get yourself a DS and algorithms baseline by blitzing through an interview questions book or website in no more than 2 weeks, if you have exposure to these subject before (which you should since you have a CS degree). Emphasize your background, your strengths, and your portfolio. Don't stay free for 6 months unless you know you'll produce some really good projects to add to your portfolio, or unless you have some other reason not to get a job during that time. If you go the startup route, be aware it doesn't have to be "real". Many multi-million-dollar exits are for startups whose main product gets canned the instant its acquired; In retrospect these are all just glorified portfolio projects. Don't be afraid to call your own glorified portfolio project a startup. (I'm probably sounding cynical; I don't mean too, nor am I dismissing the very real talent of acqui-hired startups.).
