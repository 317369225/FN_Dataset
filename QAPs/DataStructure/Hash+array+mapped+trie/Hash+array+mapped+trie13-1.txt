Suggest a data structure for storing million trillion numbers efficiently in very less space?Minimize space complexity...
For what purpose are you storing the numbers?  At that scale you will almost certainly need to store the data in a distributed system.  If you only need to know if you have seen a particular number before than you can use bloom filters for set detection.  If you are interested in estimating the cardinality of the elements in the set than there are a number of probabilistic counters that you may find helpful.  For example a HyperLogLog data structure can estimate the cardinality of 10^9 elements using just 1.5 kilobytes of space of space.  This is a blog post I wrote on the subject:  http://highscalability.com/blog/...
