What are the most important concepts in C and C++ that should be learnt and understood before a programming interview?I don't have much time left for my interviews. So please suggest to me the concepts I must know before going for the interview.
In programming interview understanding of various programming languages will help you to excel in your interview. I have attended 5 companies during my campus placements. Among these 5 companies, I have reached to  final round in 3 companies. In my 3rd attempt, I got placed in TCS. In Interview they asked about my favorite programming language and asked questions from that programming language. So always choose  a language which you are comfortable with. The important concepts in C language is thorough understanding of pointer concepts,Strings and Arrays. In C++ language important concept u should know is OOPS concepts, Strings,STL etc..So choose a language you are comfortable with and go through the important concepts in that language just like mentioned above. You will get repeated interview questions if you google it.....So ALL THE BEST .. :)
