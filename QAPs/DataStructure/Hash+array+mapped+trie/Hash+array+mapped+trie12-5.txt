What are some concepts/algorithms/data structures that every computer science student should know?I can think of some of the top of my head (hashing/hash tables, quicksort, database normalization, recursion, binary search trees) but I was hoping for a more exhaustive list.
There is absolutely no question that every CS student "should" know. This is why CS has so little innovation and all the answers below seem to encourage that. If you learnt only what you wanted to learn, in an area you felt YOU could make an impact, and focused on everything within that, you would be a smarter and more productive computer scientist. There is nothing you need to learn. You should never learn things just because they must be learnt. Learn things because it applies to what you want to build, what you wish to learn, what you wish to show.
