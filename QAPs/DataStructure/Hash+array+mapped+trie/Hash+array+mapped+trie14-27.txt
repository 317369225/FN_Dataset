If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
Then you and your friends are writing either very high level or very crap code.  If you have ever written a Class you have *created* a data structure as all a data structure is is an organization of data and a well defined set of functions to act on that data. Now why study fundamental data structures and their properties?  Because you are using them all the time. Can you say you never used a List<> or HashMap<>. in java?  Never used a Dictionary<> in C#?  Never shifted an argument queue in Javascript? These are ALL uses of fudnemental data structures.   And in order to write code that performs well you *must* understand their performance characteristics.  Anybody who has to write code that in any way will have to scale needs to know these things. Data Structures may well be the single most important class you can take in college, and it sounds like I wouldn't hire either you or your friends for any position I have ever hired for.
