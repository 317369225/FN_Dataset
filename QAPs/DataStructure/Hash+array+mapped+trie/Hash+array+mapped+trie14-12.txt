If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
Google use advanced data structures. Twitter too. Facebook too, they really have some advanced data structures and algorithms for graph theory that are kept secret. Even if you don't use them at your job is a totally lie to say that "advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry". Search about your questions on google and you will understand that out there is a big world who need efficient algorithms and advanced data structures.
