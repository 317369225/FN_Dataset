What are the minimum set of required computer science skills for a web developer who does not have a CS degree to be a good programmer?For example, some people say a programmer should know about binary tree structure and algorithms. Could you make a brief list? Details would be appreciated and I would be glad if you mention how to get those skills without attending a college? (Online resources, programs etc.)
Good math knowledge always needed for a good programmer. Logical thinking helps at times. If you are good at both, then you can attend online programs and sharp your skills by practicing which most of the newbies failed to do so. Practicing gives you befit in what you are upto. Think of your own program and start coding, in your way from what you learnt.
