Why is data structure useful for a computer engineer to learn?
Each discipline has its own way of challenging an individual and test his/her knowledge in that domain. For computer science, it is done through data structures. To judge the clarity of concepts and thinking ability of a CS engineer, he/she is often put through the test of data structures, this tells the examiner/interviewer the logical reasoning and technical ability of the person simultaneously. A good knowledge of data structures is not only essential in getting a job, but also helps in solving complex problems in a simplified manner.
