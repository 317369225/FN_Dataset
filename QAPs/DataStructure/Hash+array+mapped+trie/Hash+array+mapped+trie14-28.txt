If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
You are wrong, my friend. Let's do an exercise. Pick an industry. Any, in fact. Look at the traditional big players, and I will give you an example of what that company is doing on the advanced algorithm front. And, where there is no such example, I'll give you an example of how a startup used algorithms to disrupt it. Just to get you started: Local transport: Taxis- Uber. Geo-mapping, entity scoring, and fuzzy-matching to start the list. F&B: Zomato/Foodpanda- geo-fencing & vls-collaborative filtering. Ecommerce: Amazon/Flipkart(India) etc- very large scale recommendation engines, supply chain optimization (LP) etc. Telecom: AT&T Labs: One of the world's biggest data lakes- multiple SQL/noSQL databases with query-optimized data structures Retail: Walmart- building smart stores with real-time product on-shelf availability optimization, video checkout lane optimization etc. The thing is, the number of people who are working on solving these kind of problems are very small compared to the rest of the workforce- hence the exposure might not be there. Also, you will find that people who do these jobs tend to be relatively highly paid as opposed to other areas of work. That ought to be motivation enough!
