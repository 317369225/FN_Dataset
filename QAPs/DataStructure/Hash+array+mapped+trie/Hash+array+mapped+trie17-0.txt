Is it a good idea to use JavaScript (programming language) for solving algorithmic problems?
For competitive programming, I would say avoid JavaScript.  JS doesn't provide you any helpful data structures other than arrays/vectors and hash maps. However, outside of the world of competitive programming, it makes sense to use JavaScript if the domain of your algorithm requires JavaScript.  For example, maybe you're writing a plugin to handle keyboard shortcuts.  Keyboard presses get sent to the client only, so using JavaScript to develop algorithms related to keyboard shortcuts is the only realistic option.  For example, maybe you implement a recursive descent parser for interpreting the shortcuts, and maybe you use a trie for handling chords.
