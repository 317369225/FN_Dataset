How can I get a job at Facebook or Google in 6 months?How should I be going? I need a concise work-plan to build a good enough skill set. Should I join some other start-up? Should I build my own projects or start-up? Should I just focus on practicing up on Data Structures and Algorithms ?
Originally Answered: Which programming languages should I know to get an internship or job at a top-notch company like Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.?No specific language is really required to get an Internship.  Knowing data structures and algorithms will help you a lot more. On the other hand, once you get an internship and want to do well in it (in order to get a full time offer), knowing a language well will definitely help you. For Google, that means you should know either Java or C++ well (for backend work), or Javascript (for FE work).  For Facebook and other companies it might vary a little bit (Facebook uses PHP, MS uses C#, Apple uses ObjectiveC, etc) What will really help you is having some real experience working on bigger projects.  Try either contributing to open source, creating your own side project, or helping out on something that's going on in your school.
