If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
You want your knowledge of techniques to be second nature, so that when you come up against a problem where a basic technique is applicable you don't find your self saying "I have no idea what to do here, better go surf the Web for an answer." Suppose I were to buy one of these bad boys. I might use 10 or 15 of the tools in here regularly, maybe another 10 or 15 occasionally, and the other 120 or so not at all. I don't think I've ever used a 1/16 inch Allen wrench. But if I were given one of these, without the tools that come with it or the link I just provided, and I needed to figure out how to install it, I might easily be going "huh? and then heading to Lowe's or Home Depot and trying to find someone on the floor who could tell me what the heck I needed to do. If you want to be an expert, you need to know how to use the tools in your arsenal, and when you need to use them. You might not ever need to use a particular specialized tool, but should you come across a situation where you do you'll be glad you have it.
