What are some concepts/algorithms/data structures that every computer science student should know?I can think of some of the top of my head (hashing/hash tables, quicksort, database normalization, recursion, binary search trees) but I was hoping for a more exhaustive list.
You can refer Compile, run, curse… Recompile, rerun, recurse… for a brief idea over the important algorithms and data structures.
