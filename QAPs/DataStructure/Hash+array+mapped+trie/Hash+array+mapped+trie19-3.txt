What are the most important concepts in C and C++ that should be learnt and understood before a programming interview?I don't have much time left for my interviews. So please suggest to me the concepts I must know before going for the interview.
For C, pointer, macro and basic data structure and algorithm implementation. For C++, you will never understand it over 70%. C++ is over-designed. OO concept, STL, design patterns are more important than understand C++ itself. Otherwise, C and C++ are totally different language, they look similar but really different. It had better learn C++ as a new language, not a "C plus".
