If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
In most of the industrial work, there's no actual implementation of the algorithms you learnt, why? Cause you're already using ready-made stuff which has been built with the same algorithms that you've learnt. As a student who has a small experience in web-development, everything that I run into, I think about the actual algorithm behind it, the database you're using with your work has complex and amazing algorithms to make it work in an accepted time. And if you're looking to advance in your career and actually work on the basics, you NEED those algorithms, let's say you wanna work with Google on their search engine, not knowing the advanced string manipulation algorithms will get you into huge trouble, let's say you're working in the compilers back-end field, not knowing NP-complete problems and how to come up with a great heuristic to solve that NP-complete problem is a huge deal. In the end it actually depends on your line of work, if it's a simple web-development or Android application building then you mostly won't need any complex algorithms, in Google maps API for example, Google already developed those Algorithms and gave you the functions that you'll use.
