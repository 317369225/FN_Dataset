If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
For the same reason  , why one goes to the gym. In real life , you will never get to lift the dumbbell shaped objects, neither will you get an opportunity to do pull ups on a horizontal bar . In real life you will get heavy bags , cooking cylinders to lift, (or even cute girls to lift ;)). The point of going  gym is to prepare yourself for real world by developing your physical strength . Similarly , In programming world , you might not always get a chance to implement an AVL tree to index your DB columns. But ,Learning advanced data structures/algos will enhance your mental strength  and prepare you for your daily jobs  and it will come to you very easily.
