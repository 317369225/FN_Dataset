What data structures are used in codechef questions?Codechef long contest questions are sometimes very difficult just because they were using a completely different data structure altogether!for example... fenwick trees.Â  What other data structures are used in codechef problems that I must study? Also please tell from where I shall study those data structures.
Most common data structures you might get across in some difficult problems are Range minimum queries, Suffix trees, Suffix arrays, Binary index trees, Heaps and union find. Remaining are very easy and you can learn to implement them in no time. Course on algorithms : Coursera Range minimum query : Algorithm Tutorials Suffix tree : Suffix Trees Suffix array : Brief Introduction to Suffix Array Also you can find implementations of all good algorithms in Stanford's website.
