What are the 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm problems?
Algorithms used to solve Constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) are good to know. Some of the widely known CSP problems are N-queens problem, complex scheduling problems, Map coloring and problems like Zebra Puzzle. BacktrackingSearch (which is a kind of DFS with single variable assignment) is the basic algorithm for solving CSP. Some other technique to solve CSP are constraint propagation and local search.
