How can I get a job at Facebook or Google in 6 months?How should I be going? I need a concise work-plan to build a good enough skill set. Should I join some other start-up? Should I build my own projects or start-up? Should I just focus on practicing up on Data Structures and Algorithms ?
(Thanks for A2A, Praveen Gowda) There are some really really good answers here. Great read. I've answered a similar question elsewhere, which may give you some good food for thought: Soham Mehta's answer to I am planning to quit my job and study algorithms full-time for one year. Can anyone give me some advice? While many interviewers at Google do care about the language you pick to program (Python, C++ or Java), that is not what they care about the most. They care about CS fundamentals, and more importantly, your fluency in those fundamentals. Whichever plan you make and follow, the most important thing, IMHO, is to do your preparation in "breadth-first" order and continually measure yourself after each round. That will help you know when to stop, and expose your strengths and weaknesses more quickly. Good luck.
