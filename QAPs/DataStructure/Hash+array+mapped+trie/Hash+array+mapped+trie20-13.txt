How can I get a job at Facebook or Google in 6 months?How should I be going? I need a concise work-plan to build a good enough skill set. Should I join some other start-up? Should I build my own projects or start-up? Should I just focus on practicing up on Data Structures and Algorithms ?

You should look over the advanced undergrad data structures and algorithms textbook. Last I checked C++ and Python were popular at Google, but Javascript (AngularJS) and Go are also used. Don't worry about being an expert in all of these languages, but make sure you're very strong in at least one of them. Talk to your friends and colleagues about what you'd like to work on in the future, so that you are comfortable talking about your future. And remember to have a lot of fun! Work on fun little projects. There's nothing like an excited engineer and you can only be excited if you sound like you're having fun! Good luck.
