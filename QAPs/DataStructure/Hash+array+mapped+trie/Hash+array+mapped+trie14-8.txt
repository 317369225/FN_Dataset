If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
Modern programming languages and frameworks give you most of the algorithms out of the box. However learning algorithms or at-least being aware of them has personally helped a lot in several ways: 1. When a user says - this feels slow. This knowledge helps me understand the bottlenecks in the code and come up with a solution. 2. When stuck with a problem, it gives me the confidence to read and understand another developer's code (maybe an open source third party library) and understand whats going wrong. 3. When thinking about solving a problem, I have several more perspectives to evaluate and come to the most optimal solution.
