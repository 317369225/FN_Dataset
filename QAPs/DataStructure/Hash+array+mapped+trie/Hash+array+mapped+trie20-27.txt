How can I get a job at Facebook or Google in 6 months?How should I be going? I need a concise work-plan to build a good enough skill set. Should I join some other start-up? Should I build my own projects or start-up? Should I just focus on practicing up on Data Structures and Algorithms ?
Originally Answered: Which programming languages should I know to get an internship or job at a top-notch company like Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.?I think all good companies focus on hiring "Programmers" and not people with expertise in some A,B or C language.  It is your ability to solve problems and think rationally and logically to the problem at hand(even if you can't find a solution.) that gets counted more than  your expertise in some specific technology.
