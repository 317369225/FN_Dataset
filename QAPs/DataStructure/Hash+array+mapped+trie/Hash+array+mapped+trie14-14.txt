If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
Your premise is wrong: advanced data structures and algorithms are used all the time in industry; they are often just hidden with a little bit of abstraction. If you don't understand that, then you are probably using the wrong structures and algorithms for a given problem. More than once I have seen developers use an array for membership testing and wonder why their code runs slowly. In my mind, this is completely asinine because the answer is blatantly obvious; they should have just used a set. Instead they do completely backwards things like add in the complexity of threading to try to solve a something that was totally a non-issue to start with. Knowing data structures makes you write better code. Even though you will probably never need to implement a structure or a complex algorithm from scratch, knowing how they are implemented should fundamentally change the way you approach problems.
