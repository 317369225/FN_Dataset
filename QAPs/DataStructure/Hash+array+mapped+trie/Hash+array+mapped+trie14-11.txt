If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
Most of the time, the question "When am I going to use this in the real world?" is the wrong question to ask.  Most of the things we learn end up as only small parts of our whole body of expertise.  Usually it's better to ask "Does this solve a problem worth solving?". Start at the very beginning: have you ever been asked to use a crayon to color within the lines of a picture at your job?  Have you ever been asked to tie your shoes?  If not, what was the point of all that stuff you learned in kindergarten? The point is that they helped you to master other tasks, and those helped with other things, and pretty soon you're a useful human being. Finally, if you're a programmer that never uses interesting algorithms you might want to think about finding work somewhere else that lets you do interesting stuff.
