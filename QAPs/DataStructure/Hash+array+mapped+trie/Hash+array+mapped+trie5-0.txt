What are common hash table questions asked in a technical interview?
Common is hard to know. I've never been asked a question about hash tables, except once the difference between a HashMap and a TreeMap in Java. Review both how to write a hash table, and something more exotic like Hash Array Map Trie (HAMT). Hash array mapped trie Hash tables are a common answer in a technical interview however. So its most important to know how to use them.
