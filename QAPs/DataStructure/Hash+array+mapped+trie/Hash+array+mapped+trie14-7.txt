If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
I've been in the industry for far fewer than 20 years, and I've already used plenty of nutty ones. The difference could very well be that I see possibilities that you don't. What if I told you that I always drive my car in 1st gear, and that that works perfectly fine for me? I don't need to learn all this "gear shifting" nonsense. I still make money as a taxi driver, because no one *needs* to go more than 15 miles per hour, so long as they get where they're trying to go. I have no idea what I'm missing, right? I bet you're hemorrhaging opportunities to improve the products you work on: there is probably plenty you could be doing faster, with less memory, and with more readable code. But because you've found *an* approach that works and you can't think of a better way to do it, you've concluded that's all there is to the problem. This is very often untrue.
