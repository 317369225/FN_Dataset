What are the minimum set of required computer science skills for a web developer who does not have a CS degree to be a good programmer?For example, some people say a programmer should know about binary tree structure and algorithms. Could you make a brief list? Details would be appreciated and I would be glad if you mention how to get those skills without attending a college? (Online resources, programs etc.)
It depends also on where you want to work... If you want to work for the big guys etc then you need to learn about network architectures, computer architectures, may be work with assembly languages at some point... It all depends on what you want to achieve.
