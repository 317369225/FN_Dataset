If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
"Industry" is not a monolithic entity. There are industries that produce state-of-the-art software, and then there are industry that use software to provide low-end tech support. Industries that embark into creating disruptive technologies and markets require advanced algorithms, advanced strategy and advanced everything. But even if one is content with doing documentation or providing tech support, learning advanced algorithms trains one's mind to think about what is happening inside the black box, suggest enhancements and be better at the tech support as well.
