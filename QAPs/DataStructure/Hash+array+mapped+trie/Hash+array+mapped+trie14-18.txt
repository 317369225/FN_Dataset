If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
For practitioner, almost any algorithm takes a day to find and a week to adopt at least as an experiment. If not hours. How to deal with the information snowball of the unknown quality - that is the main task. When I was attending interviews, almost every interviewer considered as his sacred duty to make me solve some graphs/trees/hanoi-towers/etc with coding on paper. After an interview or two I just began to stand up and leave, reasoning that I'll be not comfortable with having to work in the place where all the interview survivors were optimised for solving riddles, and a didn't want to become one either. And BTW I have never had an office job since then, only remote contracts. Remote clients were always asking different, more practical questions. As a rule, I have always stayed to work with people who were interested to ask me about mine and theirs unknowns, rather than what I know. (Maybe due to the fact they have little chance to test my hanoi towers on paper via Skype, who knows? ;) )
