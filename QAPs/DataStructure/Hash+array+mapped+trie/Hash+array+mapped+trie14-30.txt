If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
Because often in industry you have to re-implement everything. Industry (e.g., non-tech, non-startup) often won't allow external (open source) code to be used unless it is on a license that lets you do pretty much whatever you want, including to not distribute any changes you make. That takes a lot of popular and useful open source libraries out of the mix. You want to do something cool and new at your company? Prepare to build a lot of things that maybe another organization has done before, and don't you dare copy the code--that could get your employer sued! Knowing algorithms and data structures is suddenly necessary, as well as knowing how to hit the books and journals. One would be surprised how many seemingly old and crusty industry giants have woken up to the power of technology, and now suddenly they need a lot of programmers good enough to do cool and new things that are only slightly past the edge of what places like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. are doing.
