If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
I asked a similar question in my Amazon interview. The interviewer took sometime to give an answer to my question and this is what he had to tell me : "Take the case of a carpenter. Initially, he picks up his saw and cuts the wood all by himself. This work can be done using a machine too. When hiring people to work with these machines, only carpenters are chosen. Why? Because he knows the methods, ways, their advantages and disadvantages. Similar is the case with Software Industry. A person who works with a software must have experience in Algos and Data Structures, in order to understand the job he is doing to the core, and be able to able to recognize and rectify any bugs, if any".
