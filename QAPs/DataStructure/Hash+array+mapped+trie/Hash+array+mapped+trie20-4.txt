How can I get a job at Facebook or Google in 6 months?How should I be going? I need a concise work-plan to build a good enough skill set. Should I join some other start-up? Should I build my own projects or start-up? Should I just focus on practicing up on Data Structures and Algorithms ?
Originally Answered: Which programming languages should I know to get an internship or job at a top-notch company like Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.?There's a few parts to this answer.  I can only speak to my experience at Facebook, though I doubt the other companies are very different.  - Is there some criteria for a minimum number or particular set of languages to know?  Definitely not. What matters is your ability to solve problems, and to demonstrate expertise with some language.  - However, the work you do in your internship may have no relation to what you've done in past.  You might be asked to pickup an unfamiliar language, and that will be easier if you already have a few under your belt. - The only reason it might be valuable to learn a new language outside of pure necessity is if it teaches you something conceptually new.  On that basis, there's zero reason to learn both Python and Ruby, or java and C#, etc.  They are just too similar.  If you show up with experience in C++, JavaScript and Haskell that's way more interesting to me than Java, C++ and C#. - Focus on doing interesting, challenging projects.  If those happen to involve new languages, all the better. - The more specific the thing you want to work on, the more important specific languages will be.  If you want to do work on iOS apps at Apple I imagine knowing Objective C is helpful.
