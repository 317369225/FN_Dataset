What are the minimum set of required computer science skills for a web developer who does not have a CS degree to be a good programmer?For example, some people say a programmer should know about binary tree structure and algorithms. Could you make a brief list? Details would be appreciated and I would be glad if you mention how to get those skills without attending a college? (Online resources, programs etc.)
To be a good programmer, you just really need to understand what good code looks like and concepts like object oriented programming.  No need to worry about fancy data structures because they are almost never used. Basic data structs to know would be what Edgar listed in his reply, minus trie's and graphs.  I also would say dynamic programming isn't a basic algorithm and also something you don't have to know.  Clean code > Efficient code.  It's very important to know the tradeoffs when saying that your code will be cleaner at the sacrifice of efficiency and whether it is worth it or not.  In many cases it is.  Knowing these decisions come with experience. Lastly, just keep coding.  You can read 10,000 books on programming, but you won't even be better than someone who's been programming for a month.  The best way to be a good programmer is to keep doing it.
