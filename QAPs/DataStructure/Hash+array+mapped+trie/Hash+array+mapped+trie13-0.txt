Suggest a data structure for storing million trillion numbers efficiently in very less space?Minimize space complexity...
It depends a lot on the details of your problem. How does your data look like: -- Is it distributed over several machines -- Are your numbers integers, are they doubles? -- If they are integers are they 32 bit, 64 bit? -- How dense are they? -- Are they unique? What type of queries do you need to run over the data structure: -- Search for numbers fast? -- Iterate through all the numbers? -- Add, remove numbers. You could use a bit array. Or a hash map that keeps frequencies. If the numbers have a lot of common prefixes you may do better if you use a trie. You can run a compression algorithm on top of your chosen data structure.
