If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
Advanced algorithms and data structures ARE used in industry, where ever did you get the idea that they are not?  The important thing to remember is that your job in the real world is not always to design the perfect algorithm for the job.  There are other considerations, including your time, other people's time, and the maintenance overhead of unnecessarily sophisticated code.  Software isn't only a language for communicating with the hardware, it's also a language for communicating with other developers in the future.  What you write is often the only thing they have to go on about the scope and complexity of the problem you are solving.  If you write something extremely complex, they will do a double-take and try to understand why the situation warranted such expertise.  If, on the other hand, the problem could have been adequately solved with an off-the-shelf map, you've just wasted their time (in the future) and they'll think you're an arrogant prick. The more data structures and algorithms you know, the more tools you have to choose from when picking the right tool for the job.  That doesn't mean that every problem will need a complex tool to solve it.
