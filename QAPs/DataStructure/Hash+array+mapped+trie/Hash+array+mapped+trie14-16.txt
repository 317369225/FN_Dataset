If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
Can you give an example of an algorithm that somebody forced you to learn that is "never used" in industry? The reason why it's important to understand a hash table, a tree, a graph, or a simple sorting method: Is because it underpins the tools you use every day. If you don't understand what they are for, roughly how they work, and what their performance characteristics are, you will do poor work. Interviews don't ask about "stuff never used" in industry. I can tell you this with confidence after many interviews with companies from Google level all the way down. The analogy is more to a driving test. They don't ask you about Formula 1 rules, but you do need to know when to use your indicators and when to give way.
