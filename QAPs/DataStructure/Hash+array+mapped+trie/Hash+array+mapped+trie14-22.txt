If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
Your statement is far from the truth. Even more so if you are building systems used by large numbers of people and the code needs to run on your servers. For example, we speed up seemingly simple tasks like string matching, checking for existence, optimizing over a set of options to display using fairly complex algorithms. Often these optimizations give us capabilities that completely do not exist otherwise, both from a technology and business point of view. These optimizations will not come to you in the spec that you follow and you will continue to think "advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry". You will just continue to add large costs in terms of more and more servers and continue to miss significant opportunities. Additionally it helps in a big way to understand optimizations and algorithms used by tools you use when your system runs at large scales. Often that understanding is the difference between choosing the perfect tool and choosing something that will badly fail you very quickly. Advanced algorithms may not be used on a regular basis in a lot of software dev jobs, but there are many others including mine where they do.
