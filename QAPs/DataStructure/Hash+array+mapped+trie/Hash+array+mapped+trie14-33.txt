If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?I and people I know have never used any advanced algorithms or data structures in industry and some of us have 20 years of experience in industry. How do you motivate yourself to learn advanced algorithms and data structures or, for that matter, go for Programming contests etc..
When I was an undergrad, I coursed a two semester class on operating systems, which was half theory and half practice. The practice part was based on Andrew S. Tanenbaum's MINIX OS and book. The final exam was to make a useful, interesting, original change in the MINIX kernel. MINIX at the time had a modular RAM file system and memory management system, which had an in-memory filesystem image and a memory heap, respectively, which were statically defined at boot time. My project was to change the memory manager and file system to have them share the same memory space and cooperate when allocationg and deallocating blocks. It was a very interesting problem with a lot of data structure and interprocess communication work. Even if I never programmed an operating system in the 25 years since I graduated, that work has helped me: - Understand how to manage diverse server environments when I was a sysadmin - Understand how race conditions and parallel programming work, useful for very real-world OLTP system design and programming and other non-trivial design and programming. I can pick out several other examples from other seemingly overly academic algorithms. They allow you to understand, at a deep level, how to apply certain problem-solving patterns to the problems you have to solve.
