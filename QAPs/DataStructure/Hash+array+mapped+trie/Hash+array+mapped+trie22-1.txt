In Google recruitment, if a person is familiar with Java, is it sufficient that he must know to solve the problem with it or he must know the working of the internal data structures like how Collision is resolved in a Hash Map, what Sorting algorithm is used in the Arrays.sort() method?
I was interviewed with Google long time back. But I do not think that they have change the base process for the selection. Interviewer provided me a question which was easily available on various sites. I answered the question without any problem. But he hinted me that the answer can be improved. I think through that and I was amazed that there was a better answer for the question. First interviewer left and another came and he continued with the same questions. He tweaked it a little and asked me to solve it. I did, but still I was asked to improve the performance of the solution. He hinted me, but I was not able to provide a better implementation of the question. Interviewer changed but the question remained the same with some more tweaks. Google does not select the person based on his abilities to solve the question, but it looks at your attitude and approach to solve the problem in Hand. Interviewer will assist you if you are pointing to a right direction but you are stuck. Interviewer will surely look at the DS aspects of your solution, and ask you to describe your solution in length. In summary, they would not test your theory instead they will insist you to apply your mind to find out of the box solutions which are better and efficient.
