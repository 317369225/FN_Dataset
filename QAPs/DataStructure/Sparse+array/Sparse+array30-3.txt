What are some tricks and tips that every beginner Android Developer should be aware about?
1) Don't do Fragment Transactions in onResume() , instead use onPostResume()/onResumeFragments() , so that fragments are prepared before you do any transaction , and IllegalStateException won't come. 2) To exchange data/communicate between 2 fragments use interface. 3) Test your app on as many possible Android versions because a piece of code may work fine on one version but crash on other. 4) Remember using permissions may crash on Marshmallow if not handled at runtime. 5) If your application is killed in background, it would resume its state only if u check for (bundle == null) in onCreate to do rendering.If activity was killed , bundle object has the state saved by OS. 6) Creating layouts is much easy on Android Studio than on Eclipse. 7) Get familiar with android design support lib for material design implementation without hassles. 8) Read the book : Android Programming, The Big Nerd Ranch Guide.pdf 9) Use setRetainInstance(true) to avoid fragment recreation on Activity recreation such as changing orientation.
