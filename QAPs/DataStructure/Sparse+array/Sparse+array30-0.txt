What are some tricks and tips that every beginner Android Developer should be aware about?
Do not create any Static class to share data across activities. Instead try to use Singletons. Use Fragments instead of activities. Keep the number of activities minimum. Creating and destroying activities are slow and takes a lot of memory. If you have a rooted device, you can deploy your app wirelessly without any USB cable. Try Wifi ADB or any other Wireless ADB app. Use dimens first to support multiple screens, instead of duplicating code in two different XML layouts. Using RelativeLayout is far more performance savvy than using LinearLayout. It's tough to create a Good Looking UI with just RelativeLayout. So just think if design is your priority or the performance. If you want to become a good developer, learn to ask question on StackOverflow. Also learn to Google things. Do not use Eclipse. Trust Android Studio. Learn to use layout_weight, layout_gravity and gravity. This is a must to create any kind of good UI. Learn to use Adapters. Try to do everything in the XML first. Doing UI manipulation in Code should be the last resort. Always prefer doing things in an Object Oriented way. Always keep your IDE and SDK updated. Always trust the stable version of Android Studio. The Canary Version is not for you. The best way to learn about any new feature is to implement it in your app. Happy Coding! Liked my answer?
