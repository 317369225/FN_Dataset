What do you use: BSD queue.h, Linux list.h or SGLIB?
As with everything, the selection of the tool depends on the task at hand and how pervasive the need.  If I'm just hacking together a list in C (or ObjC or C++)  I'll probably just carry the freight myself, particularly if I've got nodes that are simultaneously threaded onto different lists or if I need to manage locking.  If I'm using a variety of abstractions -- say lists, hashes and sparse arrays -- I'd consider using something like the level-one interface to Sglib.  If I don't have a strong reason to use C I'll just use Scala or Clojure and call it good :)
