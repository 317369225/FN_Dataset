What are some basic programming questions asked in IT interviews? What are some questions from C, C++, Java, and data structures (top 50 questions)?
I will mention few of them. C: What are void pointers and why are they used? Extern storage class. How do you make a generic dynamic array or list in c (through void pointers) Difference between calloc and malloc Function pointers Difference between structure and unions. Bit fields. Pointers. Command line argument. Variadic functions. C++: Virtual destructors. Virtual functions. Copy constructors. Assignment operators. Deep copy vs shallow copy. Inheritance and composition. Mutable. Const function and objects. Casting in c++ Function objects. Static functions. New and malloc difference. Order of call of constructors and destructors in inheritance. Up casting and down casting Dynamic binding. Operator overloading. Exception handling. Java: Why are strings immuatbkeimmuatble. How do I make a user defined class object as key to hashmap Equals and hashcode contract. How is hashmap implemented. Garbage collection Finally block Finalize function Multi threading String pooling Boxing and unboxing When to use which collection. When java flags unreachable code error. Wrapper classes Reflection api Static inner classes. Anonymous inner class. Runnable and thread class. Serializable. Data structure: Link list Stack Map Reversing link list Finding a loop in singly list Finding nth element from the end Deleting every nth element from the list. Sorting and Searching algorithm Knapsack Longest common subsequence Edit distance. Palindrome. Longest palindromic subsequence. Anagrams. These are some that I could think of now. I hope it helps.
