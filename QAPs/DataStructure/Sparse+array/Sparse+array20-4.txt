Which software company designed their electronic medical record system to have a 1000-character limit?
The software in question is Epic. It is used by Kaiser Permanente and U.T. Southwestern, among many other major medical facilities. The data store behind Epic is Microsoft SQL Server, which can easily handle fields containing more than 1,000 characters, so the limit is completely arbitrary. As a side note, I am so glad someone else (the New York Times author and the creator of this thread) found this particular limitation as unbelievably ridiculous as I did when I first encountered it. The sheer stupidity required to make such a design decision is truly mind-boggling and the fact that it has not been fixed yet makes me want to punch someone at Epic, only to have the exact description of their symptoms following the impact of my fist require at least 1,001 characters. (This is roughly 800 characters.) Updated 253w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
