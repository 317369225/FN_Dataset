What are some important tips and information that one should know when transitioning from jQuery to native JS (DOM manipulation)?
Unfortunately you just have to suck it up. Lets take for instance: [code] $('#foo').css(); [/code] Thats super easy right? Using jQuery. Its whole purpose is to not make Javascript so cumbersome. Same example in pure JS: [code] document.getElementById('foo').style(); [/code] Way longer. Its good to understand how the native JS works as you may want to venture into Angular or Node.js and jQuery wont help you then.
