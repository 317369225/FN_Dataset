Which software company designed their electronic medical record system to have a 1000-character limit?
After some research, the author Danielle Ofri, MD is an attending physician at Bellevue Hospital which is part of HHC (New York City Health and Hospital Corporation).  HHC currently does NOT use Epic.  They use a homegrown system: One-on One with NYCHHC President and CEO Alan Aviles Last year HHC agreed to contract Epic: HHC SIGNS CONTRACT FOR NEW ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD SYSTEM TO SPAN CITY'S ENTIRE PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEM The article implies that the physician is writing an Op Note with the following statement: "After our physical exam, I sit down to write a detailed evaluation, because I want the surgeons and anesthesiologists to fully understand the complexity of his situation."  Based on the context, Dr. Ofri would not face a 1000-character limitation in writing a Surgery Note in Epic.  In Epic, there are no character limitations on Clinical Notes that a provider would encounter. So contrary to Aaron Greenspan's answer, perhaps by installing Epic, they will resolve their character limit Danielle Ofri encountered.
