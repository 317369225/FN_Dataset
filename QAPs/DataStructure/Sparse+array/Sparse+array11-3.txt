In what way is W3Schools.com a good resource for learning HTML/CSS and other languages?
Not sure what planet some folk are on here! W3School is a great introduction to anyone wanting to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript. Even the PHP and Jquery tutorials are pretty good. The interactive lessons allow students to make changes to their code and see the results on refresh - a great way to take abstract concepts and showcase how they actually translate on the web page. Seriously too many sourpuss perfectionists and pedants on here LOL. There are excellent books too if you want to learn offline and the Missing Manual series is excellent. There are many online academies being established with monthly and annual membership fees, so i can understand why there is a covert campaign to smear W3Schools Online Web Tutorials. The fact that people do so, is a sure sign it's possibly draining their cashcow. Of courses, once you know the basics you move on to more intermediate material, and that's when it's a good idea to visit the more established sites teaching Javascript etc. But guys, don't forget that once upon a time, you didn't know what a doctype meant or how to style a H1 tag.
