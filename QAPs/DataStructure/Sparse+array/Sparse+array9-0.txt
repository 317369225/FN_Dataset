What is the simplest way to store 3 dimensional arrays in a SQL database?
Like Joachim Pense said, a definition like array_tab (x, y, z, val, primary key (x, y, z)) is a good way, particularly with MySQL, where "throwaway" auto-increment primary keys are disfavored over natural primary keys in InnoDB, which uses an "index organized" structure for the primary key. You could then use select y, z, val from array_tab; where x = <num>;  to pull up a two-d sub-array, etc. This approach will work well for fully-populated arrays as well as Sparse array datasets. If you have fixed-sized arrays, you could turn the (x,y,z) into a single-number representation using some simple math.  This would save space if the arrays are huge.
