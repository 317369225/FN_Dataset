What are some differences between arrays and objects in Javascript?
As others have answered, arrays are best when you have data that you want to loop through and transform in a regular way. You can use functional libraries like Underscore.js to do interesting transformations on data stored in arrays. Arrays are often a good choice for lists that grow and shrink frequently. Data stored in simple objects, by contrast, is accessed by key, which you can think of as a name. For storing configuration information, a library, entity data, or other types information that you will access individually, and by name, objects are the better choice. Also, for large collections, a key lookup can be faster than an array loop, so objects might be the right choice in those cases. (Though if you are keeping your data sorted and doing a binary search, that is a moot point.) Truth be told, both can almost always be used interchangeably, but the way you store and access your data, and what class of data it is, will generally dictate which one you choose. For lists, and for sets for which you want to perform the same operation on all entries, go for an array. For entity-like and uniquely-keyed data, and data that you want to access sporadically or on an individual basis, go for an object.
