What are the biggest differences between programming for scientific purposes (e.g., for models in physics or economics) and programming for the web?
Programming for the web is mostly about user experience.  If you create a successful website, you'll have millions of people using your service.  It will need to be responsive, scale well, easy to understand and to navigate, even for a new user. When programming for scientific purposes, the focus is on the data, and the results of the calculations.  Your output might be raw text to a terminal, or data in a database.  You will likely have very few users of the system, and those users will have a lot of specialized knowledge.  So the focus will more likely be on modeling and manipulating data.  There will likely be more advanced math involved, and specialized algorithms. If you're doing scientific programming, you're probably more likely to be in an academic or research environment, rather than a start-up or consumer-focused company.  So the environment that you're doing programming in could likely be different too.
