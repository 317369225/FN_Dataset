Electroencephalography: What can dense array EEG detect that sparser EEG arrays cannot detect?
As a method for studying brain function, scalp EEG has excellent temporal resolution but poor spatial resolution. The spatial resolution (x-axis), temporal resolution (y-axis), and the importance of immobility required during data acquisition (z-axis) of various functional neuroimaging modalities.

Dense array EEG is recorded with more scalp electrodes to improve spatial resolution. Typically, 64, 128, or 256 electrodes are spread evenly over the scalp using a head net.   Because of its higher spatial resolution, dense array EEG can give a more accurate map of scalp voltage distribution than conventional EEG.

Note the dark red and dark blue spots on the right that are absent on the left. Let's say, the redder the color the more negative the voltage and the bluer the color the more positive the voltage. It becomes immediately obvious how the sparse EEG array (21 electrodes) can miss some scalp potentials which the dense array EEG (64 electrodes) can "see". This is the answer to your question! The higher spatial resolution of dense array EEG allows it to "see more". Since it can see more, it can localize the source of an EEG signal or the structure generating an EEG signal more accurately than conventional EEG. This is true for both normal EEG signals (e.g. cortical area activated during a task) and abnormal EEG signals (e.g. interictal epileptic activity or focal seizures). In most clinical situations, we simply assume that the cortex directly beneath the maximum scalp voltage is the generator. But if a high degree of accuracy is required (e.g. planned surgical resection of an epileptogenic focus) then EEG data obtained by dense array recording must be quantitatively processed (EEG source imaging) and correlated with fMRI data. Dense array EEG is widely used in brain research alone or in combination with other functional neuroimaging techniques. See: Doing Research with Dense Array EEG. On the other hand, current clinical utility of dense array EEG is limited. Conventional EEG is still the routine method of choice in the clinical setting. For accurate localization of the epileptogenic focus in patients who are candidates for epilepsy surgery, invasive intracranial EEG recording is still the gold standard. There is however increasing evidence in favor of dense array EEG source imaging with or without fMRI correlation for localizing the epileptogenic focus. If it ever becomes a practice standard, it will obviate the need for surgical implantation of EEG electrodes.  Some useful articles: The combination of EEG Source Imaging and EEG-correlated functional MRI to map epileptic networks.
