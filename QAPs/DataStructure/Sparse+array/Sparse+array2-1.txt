What is the most efficient way of representing a sparse binary array?
It depends on how few there are. If there are 8 or less then you can represent them with 8 sets of 6 bits where each set represents the index of the bit turned on (that sounds funny). Another option is to start with the set of size 6 to define the position of the first bit on (imagine going from left to right and you find the first non zero bit on the right). If this bit is on index lets say 22, you can see that the capacity on the right will now be 50 - 22 = 28. To get the number up to 28 you don't need 6 bits... 5 bits is enough. You can now solve the same problem only on a smaller size, the only thing you need to do is to add to that next bit on the right, the sum of indices of 1s that you already visited on the left. So for example if you had the next one on position 9, his actual position would be 22 + 9 = 31. These methods don't guarantee you that you will be able to describe it will less bits. If the 1s in your array are leaned on either left or right side, this could be useful though.
