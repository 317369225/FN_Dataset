What are fundamentals you should know before a technical interview?
Technical Interviews are generally random, no set pattern is really formed. The questioning varies depending on your skill set, your background, your years of experience.   What is most important though is that you should be able to justify your CV. The first thing an interviewer does is go through your CV, and pick up on technologies mentioned there.  Most technical interviewers do give a leeway, when they ask you to rate yourself on technologies. Give a rating that is realistic, do not give a rating just to impress the interviewer.   I am not sure of the questions in other technologies, but for a candidate claiming experience in Java-J2EE with a frameworks background( Struts/Spring), the following are some questions likely to be asked.   Java   Basic concepts of OOPS-Primarily encapsulation, inheritance. Difference between Set, List, Map. Why do we use Array List over Vector? HashMap over HashSet? Interface vs Abstract classes. Multithreading. String manipulation techniques. For more experienced professionals in Java, questions can be varied, but expect a lot of questions on Java Virtual Machine concepts.   Servlets/JSP/Struts Life cycle of servlet/JSP Difference between Forward/Redirect Custom tags EJB   Transaction management, handling. Stateless vs Stateful. If design is one of your areas, you could be asked questions on  Singleton, J2EE patterns, Interceptor.   More often than not expect  in depth questioning on your projects mentioned, especially on the architecture, security management.
