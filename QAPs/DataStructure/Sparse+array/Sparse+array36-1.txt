What are the biggest differences between programming for scientific purposes (e.g., for models in physics or economics) and programming for the web?
Scientific programming is commonly cited has having a great reliance on floating-point (word-oriented in the architectural sense) operations whereas other business, web and other computation involves more character-oriented operations for comparison, string concatination, etc. Some overlap happens with distributed and loosely- and tightly-coupled parallel computation takes place. You are expected to look at math more in scientific computation. Arrays are the most common scientific data structure. Sometimes other kinds of data structures dominate in business and web computing (lists, trees, etc.). Sure both might have similar sparse array issues. High array dimensions take yet longer to compute (optimization and saving common subexpression intermediate results helps), this tends to get ignored a little. The economic stakes in science tend to be longer-term.
