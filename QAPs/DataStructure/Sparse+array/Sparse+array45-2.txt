What are the world's largest engineering projects?
I will answer this question from a different view point of "largest engineering projects". From 1863 to May 10th 1869 primarily Chinese and Irish immigrants worked in less than ideal conditions (slavery) to complete a 1776 mile long railroad track. This track made the journey from the east cost to the west coast faster and safer. 20 years or so later, the transcontinental railroad looked like this. You can really see how well this impacted trade in a new and bountiful land. My second answer would be The Great Wall of China It is said that it is the longest grave in the world, and 1,000,000 died building it over multiple Chinese dynasties. A common misconception about the wall is that it was all build at one time, and that the walls link, this is not true. However, it is still a remarkable feat of human ingenuity and what we are capable of when working together. The wheelbarrow was invented and widely used when building the great wall. The exact length of the walls collectively is hard to determine, but most sources agree that it is at least 5,500 miles long or 8851 km. Both of these answers represent a significant moment in human history, and are amazing when looked at the grander scale of things and what we were able to accomplish as a result of these projects.
