A large, sparsely populated array contains numbers chosen from a large data set. The position of a given number in the array is random, and every number but one has a duplicate in the array. How would you determine which number is unique?
bitwise xor all the numbers in the matrix together (no need to upvote, ancient programming puzzle, much older than me).
