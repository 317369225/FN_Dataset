What are some differences between arrays and objects in Javascript?
Arrays are just a special type of object. If you try: typeof new Array(); // returns// "object"typeof new Object(); // returns// "object" Suppose you have:   var o = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};var a = [1, 2, 3]; The difference between object o object a is in the keys, and the length property. o has the keys: a, b and c while a has the keys: 1, 2, 3 and an extra property named length. Actually underneath the surface when an array tries to get an index does the exactly same thing as an object. It takes the index, hashes it and retrieves the value. You should use an array when you have values you want to access in a specific order, are closely related or you want to use them in bulk. Also if you don't care about the key name, an array is better.  Keep in mind that there is the Object.keys() method which returns an array of a given object's own enumerable properties. This highlights the fact that arrays are much more  intuitive and easy to use when you want to enumerate things.
