In what way is W3Schools.com a good resource for learning HTML/CSS and other languages?
w3schools is not a good resource for learning. It should be avoided like the plague. The information is regularly dated or wrong. The Mozilla Developer Network is a far more relevant and comprehensive source of information. Please don't post any more links to that website, it does not need any more SEO help. By posting links that are even critical of it you're helping boost its SEO. But for example, check their 'tutorial' on the Array object – doesn't list much useful information, yet is sure to show beginners bad practices including setting array indices directly (risking creation of sparse arrays) and polluting the global Array prototype with their own methods… without a hint of the caution required to do prototype extension. Their "complete reference" for Arrays doesn't include a single ES5 method while ES5 has been out for near on 5 years. Compare this with MDN's Array introduction as well as MDN' comprehensive list of Array.prototype methods to see w3schools for the trash it is. MDN is also a wiki and thus can be rapidly updated as new information and best practices are revealed.
