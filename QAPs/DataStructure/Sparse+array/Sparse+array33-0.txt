How can a list of strings be stored within a 2D array?
Depends greatly on the language you're using: Some languages require you to allocate and/or initialize your space up front. See Anirban's answer for an example. Some languages do the allocation for you. All you need to do in those cases is populate the arrays. The big question is why you're wanting to store a list (read a single, possibly sparse, array) of strings into a 2D array? How many elements are in that 2nd dimension? You're basically creating an array of arrays, but you haven't defined the content of those other arrays or their use. It's kinda hard to tell you how to populate such a structure without that info. Think about it: a Dictionary can be created using 2D array with each Dictionary element being a 2 element array. Populating this is a little different than populating a Table.
