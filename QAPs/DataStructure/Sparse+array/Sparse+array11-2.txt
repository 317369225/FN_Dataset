In what way is W3Schools.com a good resource for learning HTML/CSS and other languages?
/sigh A lot of front-end developers seem to talk about w3schools like it's the antichrist. They almost invariably point you to w3fools and then talk about how w3schools is TERRIBLE and will teach you ALL THE WRONG THINGS and quite possibly BURN DOWN YOUR HOUSE in the process. Honestly, it's not that bad. Yes, it's outdated. Yes, it's incorrect on some very specific details. But frankly, if you're just looking for a quick syntax check or want to try out some basic stuff in their sandbox, w3schools is absolutely fine in like 99% of cases. I've been doing front-end work for quite a few years now. I consider myself somewhat of an expert. And I still end up on w3schools every once and a while to check something. So sue me. I honestly cannot recall a single instance where it has so grievously misled me that I've vowed to avoid it forever. That being said, there are better alternatives. MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) is a great reference and probably the most "definitive" thing you're going to find. If you're making a conscious decision about where to go, pick MDN over w3schools. But if you're just quickly Googling the syntax to something, it's honestly just fine. You don't have to go back and find an MDN link immediately or install an extension which removes it from your search results (which apparently exists). Use it with a grain of salt and you'll be fine.
