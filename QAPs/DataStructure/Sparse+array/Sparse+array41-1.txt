ConcurrentHashMap locks only a part of Map. What does it mean?
A ConcurrentHashMap in Java is composed of several segment arrays. Locking only a part means acquiring the lock associated with only one of the segment arrays. You might think what did we achieve by using several segment arrays instead of simple array backed implementation ofÂ  a HashMap? Well, the answer to this is better parallelism. One of the threads may be writing to one of the segments (having acquired its lock) while other thread may be writing to another segment. (acquiring the other lock) Each write thread need only acquire the lock of the segment to which it's writing its data. Hope it helps !!
