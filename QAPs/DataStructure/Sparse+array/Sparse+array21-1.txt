What do you use: BSD queue.h, Linux list.h or SGLIB?
Nabarun's answer is pretty accurate and informative -in technical terms, I totally agree with him. I would just add a suggestion relying on good coding practices to expand your decision-making skills. In this case, with Nabarun's suggestion, you are taking care of your starting point (i.e. what am I using it for?),Â  then I'd also keep in mind that any code you develop should be robust, scalable and easy-to-maintain, as much as possible, due to its conditions and intentions. So, that being said, you should pick a library that won't only satisfy your technical requirements but also, in the short or long term, would be easy for you or other programmer to refactor, change, optimize or reuse your code. For instance, you could have two libraries that provide you with the exact same technical solution but one of them might have more documentation, more support, more reliability, more open forums to discuss and, furthermore, is more likely to be maintained. I know that I sort of deviate from the original question but I want to recommend and suggest you to build this kind of mindset while making your code decisions on a regular basis. In that way, you will not only be a programmer, you will be a professional programmer. Regards!
