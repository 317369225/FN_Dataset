Why does the healthcare industry use M/MUMPS instead of a more modern or more widely used programming language?
To a programmer frequently using M (InterSystems Cach√© or FIS GT.M), C and Java may look old-fashioned compared to M. To explore the question, please note the philosophy of M with regard to persistent vs. transient data, the use of high-level indirection, etc., the significance of sparse array mapping, etc. Once I presented a lecture on M to a mixed group of computer scientists and mathematicians. The mathematicians understood what M was about before the computer scientists did. In my research I have found that SQL coders tend to make certain mistakes in the design of exclusionary queries, as I reported of a decade ago at AMIA. I suspect that the relational model is not as intuitive for database design as the M model. One one occasion (1988 in Japan) I characterized the M database model as a non-1NF relational model.
