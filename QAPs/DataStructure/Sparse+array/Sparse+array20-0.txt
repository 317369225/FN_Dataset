Which software company designed their electronic medical record system to have a 1000-character limit?
Respectfully, if Epic has a 1000-character limitation, then the most likely culprit is the MUMPS programming language that I understand Epic was developed with. It has nothing to do with the RDBMS backend. A little history: MUMPS was developed during the mid-1960s as an interpreted, multi-tasking, multi-user health care programming language with an embedded hierarchical database that stored its data in persistent sparse arrays -- an elegant solution to the limitations of machine architectures of that era. MUMPS became the defacto development language for health care applications of the 1960s and 1970s, just as COBOL, which was developed in the late 1950s, became the defacto business programming language of that era. Quite a few health care information systems in use today are built on MUMPS: the VistA EMR deployed by the Veterans Administration, the DoD's Composite Health Care System (CHCS) designed by SAIC at a cost of over $2 billion, and the SunQuest LIS (clinical lab information system) used by many of the clinical reference labs in the country, including Stanford, TriCore, PAML and Quest. I was the director of business intelligence for a regional clinical reference lab that uses SunQuest, and my biggest challenge was working around and compensating for the limitations of the MUMPs internals of the SunQuest LIS. The 1,000 character limit is not the only brick wall that software engineers have hit with MUMPS -- the hierarchical database structure used by MUMPS presents significant problems in information storage and retrieval, and data warehousing and clinical analytics -- that were addressed back in 1970 when E.F. Codd published his seminal paper describing the relational model. Updated 211w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
