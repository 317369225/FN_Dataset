What are some interesting problems that one must solve in codechef?
Here are some of my favourites: L3 - This was the first problem I solved in a live contest in codechef. It has a randomized solution which exploits the high density of primes. MX - A challenge problem - my first one. While it is a standard problem (sorting devices) I had lots of fun optimizing it. PPTREE - First time I solved all 5 problems in a cookoff. This was the hardest one and was a mix of concepts I liked (which was why I could solve it :P) - tree, xor, tries etc. SEQTOWER - A recent one. I could not solve this during the contest due to missing a case. Needs a simple insight into the nature of the Euler's totient function. QSTRING - Again a mix of concepts that I like - suffix array, sparse table etc.
