What is the maximum possible size of an array in C++?
You cannot statically allocate more memory than the limit on a process's data segment set by your operating system. On posix systems, you can use malloc to theoretically allocate as much memory as the size_t type will allow. malloc will typically call sbrk to increase the amount of memory allocated to your process in order to allocate the large chunk you demanded. For e.g. the following code sets c to a non-null value, indicating allocation worked: #include <cstdio>int main() {  char *c = new char[2000000000];  printf("%u\n", c);}
