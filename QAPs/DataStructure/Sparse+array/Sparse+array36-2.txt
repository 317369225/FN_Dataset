What are the biggest differences between programming for scientific purposes (e.g., for models in physics or economics) and programming for the web?
I was for while developer for web and now I working for data mining company. When you programming for the web you and people around you usually make focus on development process, quality of code, some strict organization etc. You feel yourself as part of organized team which know exactly how, what and when thinks should be done and only problem is customer which don't know what he want. When you are scientific programmer, you began realize that team organization, code quality, strict product architecture or even costumer view is almost useless, because you don't know where you will come after another heuristic, algorithm or model used. You mind is focused on data and how it might be organized rather then how should be organized your code.
