How are spreadsheet apps, like Excel, built under the hood in terms of software design, data representation, and persistence?
I'm going to give you a serious answer, which is the best possible answer for you: Try building one. It can be pretty simple, at first. Maybe limited in size, and with only a few simple formulas. Apply what you have learned in school, and build it from scratch. Put maybe 50 or 100 hours into it. No cheating with open source, either. Then sit back and ask yourself "given what I now know, how would I have done that differently". Now do that about 20 times, and you'll end up with Excel. It'll take more than 50 or 100 hours, though :-)
