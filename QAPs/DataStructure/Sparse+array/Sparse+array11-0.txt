In what way is W3Schools.com a good resource for learning HTML/CSS and other languages?
w3schools is a good place to learn how to do it on the WRONG way. A lot of info on the website is wrong and most of the examples are full of bad practices. The content was probably good 5-7 years ago but the development practices taught by the website are really outdated. check w3fools for an extensive list of wrong info: http://w3fools.com/ - and start using the suggested resources instead: http://w3fools.com/#what-should-... PS: note that w3fools list is extensive but doesn't cover the whole website, I'm sure there are more stuff hidden there. Updated 263w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
