How are spreadsheet apps, like Excel, built under the hood in terms of software design, data representation, and persistence?
My two cents, not sure it will help. In the 80's I worked on a student project involving writing a simple spreadsheet. It was pretty straightforward and I imagine that internal Excel representation is likely no very different (while probably a bit more complex). All was done by in memory data structures, nothing fancy like a database. Cells were kept in sparse arrays (empty rows and columns taking virtually no space) but many other similar representations may have been possible. Internally cells were holding both a value and a formula (precompiled to some intermediate representation) and we had direct links going from a formula to it's users. Any change in a cell started a topological sort of the subgraph of all the cells depending, that was necessary both to detect dependency cycles on and to propagate the change. Something very simple really.
