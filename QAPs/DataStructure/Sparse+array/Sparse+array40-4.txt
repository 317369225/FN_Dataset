What are fundamentals you should know before a technical interview?
I'm going to assume this is your first interview for a programming position, as your experience with prior interview(s) and/or prior work experience would have delivered the information you are seeking. Previous answers provide the stock questions you might get, if that is all you care about. *** You should always learn something about the company you are applying to, their mission, their history, staff, products, questioning whether or not you would be able to contribute usefully, respect their mission, give of yourself without begrudging the transference of your knowledge. That is only respectful, and a good interview is one where the company is asking the same questions you are. You are likely young. What's important now is that you learn what you truly know, and what you truly don't. Simply go to the interview and do your best, and either get the job or fail to get the job. Nobody wants to fail, but this is the best time to get those experiences out of the way (or not...). This is also a great time for developers/programmers, as such talents are in high demand. The cost of failure is slight. I'd even argue it provides a net benefit. You will then have your answer.
