JavaScript (programming language):Â Are Javascript functions like map(), reduce() and filter() already optimized for traversing array?
The Array.prototype.map(), Array.prototype.reduce() and Array.prototype.filter() functions have to work with anything that might be given to them, so they aren't always the best when it comes to raw performance. Individual JavaScript engines might optimise them so they run faster than if you wrote a similar function yourself, but your mileage may vary. The main benefit of the .map(), .reduce() and .filter() functions is that they are often a lot more readable than a for loop and therefore means code using them will often be more readable. Additionally, the functions also force immutability to an extent, which can help reduce some kinds of bugs. Using a for loop or a while will be much faster if performance is your goal, but rarely will one of the .map(), .reduce() or .filter() functions be the bottleneck in your code. Wait until you've run your code before worrying about optimising things like this, and optimisations may end up making your code much less readable and maintainable.
