Data Structures: What is an intuitive explanation of red-black trees?Red-Black Trees are a binary tree data structure with auto balancing. Auto balancing binary trees guarantee algorithmic efficiency independent of the characteristics of how data is added and removed. Try inserting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 in order into a red-black tree (Try it here: http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/...). Watch how the auto balancing works. Then try inserting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 in order into a normal binary tree (try it here: http://visualgo.net/bst.html). Notice the long child-node-chain? Note: AVL trees (Also testable here: http://visualgo.net/bst.html) are another form of auto balancing binary trees.
