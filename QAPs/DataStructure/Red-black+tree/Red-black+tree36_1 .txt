Why height of the red black tree is calculated from leaf up to the root whereas height of other trees are calculated form the root down to leafs?Root of the binary tree is at height zero. But root of the red black tree has height atleast h/2. Why such notion?First of all we don't calculate the height of red black tree like other trees The height of the RB tree is the no of BLACK nodes from root to any leaf. Which should be same for all leaves.
