Where can I find large examples of red-black trees, directed trees, etc. so that I can test my algorithm?For real and fully functional red-black trees, the linux kernel is a great place to look. Two places where the red-black tree is employed are: A) the completely fair scheduler, the preferred scheduler of the Linux kernel since the 2.6.23 release, and B) the virtual memory map of a process.
