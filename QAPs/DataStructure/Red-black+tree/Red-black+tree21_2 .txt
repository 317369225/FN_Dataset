What is the point of the NIL leaves of a Red-Black tree?Could you just do away with the rule that every leaf must be black and convert the rule "Both children of every red node are black" to "Both children of every red non-leaf node are black"? Would this indeed be equivalent or am I missing something? Thanks.No purpose. They can be dispensed with However you will need explicit NULL checks when you code, and the rules for RB Tree change somewhat You can have a look at --> Khalil Sawant's answer to Why are Red Black Tree's leaf nodes represented as black?
