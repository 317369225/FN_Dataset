Why are Red-Black trees used more often in industry than AVL trees?AVL trees appear to be simpler (ie. fewer cases to handle) and have shorter heights, yet Red-Black trees appear more predominate (ie. used in Java and in functional language implementations).Because AVL tree is such a delicate structure that a single deletion may result in O(h) rotations whereas its O(1) rotations for Red-Black trees so this causes a tremendous overhead where deletion is necessary.
