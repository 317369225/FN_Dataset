Are there any concrete examples where 2-4 trees or Red Black trees turn out to be much better than AVL or general binary search trees in application?I have been learning about 2-4 trees and red black trees but I can't particularly picture when will they turn out to be significantly more useful than the other generic trees.the C++ Standard Template Library ( STL ) uses a Red- Black tree for implementation of it's Set type. RB-trees are new, easier to implement than an AVL tree where you have to take care of a lot of cases. Both guarantee an O(logN) time for insert,search and deletes. Using RB trees is just more convenient than the ol' AVL tree.
