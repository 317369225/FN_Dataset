What are some intuitive ways to learn about deletion in Red Black Trees?该网页不存在附加信息...If you want to learn a balanced binary search tree, treaps or splay trees are much easier to learn. AVLs or Red Black trees are very useful when teaching because the proofs for worst case behavior are somewhat easy. Treaps are randomized, and the proofs are a bit harder but if you understand how to implement a binary search tree and a heap you'll be able to code the treap operations on the spot.
