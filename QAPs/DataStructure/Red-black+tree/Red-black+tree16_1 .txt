How can I draw a red-black tree that is not an AVL tree structure wise?Consider the following tree whose left sub-tree is a complete binary tree with depth d, in which every node is black right sub-tree is a complete binary tree with depth 2d, in which every node @odd depth is red and @even depth is black b  / \  b r  \  b  \  r The above is a valid red-black tree but not an AVL tree (since the difference between heights of left and right sub-trees is more than one) External link:- Not all Red-Black trees are balanced?
