Is there a Java library which implements or uses red black tree?i was going through red black tree. got curious as per what wiki says about its implementation. i think there should be one implementation in java library as well. can anyone point me to it. thanksTreeMap internally uses Red-black tree. All standard operations on an RB tree can be done on a TreeMap with the same guarantees. You can check the source code [1] if you wanted to know how it is implemented.
