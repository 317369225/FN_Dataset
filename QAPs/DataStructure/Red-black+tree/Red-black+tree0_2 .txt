What is a red-black tree?Could someone please explain the concept behind a red black tree to me? I'm a Comp Sci grad student and I'm quite ashamed to admit that I havent grasped its significance completely.A red black tree is a self balancing binary search tree with an extra attribute, which is that each node is either red or black. It has some following properties: The root is always black. Every leaf(NULL) is also black. A red note can't have a red child. The black height(no of black nodes from root to leaf) is same irrespective of the traversal of tree.
