How important are red black trees for interviews for freshers?I cannot speak for the interviewing rigor of top end technology companies, specifically for opening based in USA (or Europe) But for bottom 90% of the software technology companies, either Indian or multinational, I do not think one would be asked "red-black trees" in interviews. They are just too complicated, to for the interview to judge anything by asking them. Also it is very unlikely that any real work at the company would involve the same level of complicatedness as to implement a "red-black trees" from scratch.
