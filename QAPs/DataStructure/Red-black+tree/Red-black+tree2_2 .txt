What are some real-world applications of Red-Black trees today?Can anyone point to real-world applications and places where red-black trees are used today?The process scheduler in Linux uses Red Black Trees. The red black trees are a replacement for run queues which had priorities for processes on the queue for the scheduler to pick up from. The Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) is the name of a process scheduler which was merged into the 2.6.23 release of the Linux kernel.
