Why are Red-Black trees used more often in industry than AVL trees?AVL trees appear to be simpler (ie. fewer cases to handle) and have shorter heights, yet Red-Black trees appear more predominate (ie. used in Java and in functional language implementations).Short answer: RBs handle all operations better on average (insertion, retrieval, deletes), whilst AVLs are good for frequent retrievals, but infrequent insertions and deletes. That being said, RBs are suitable for more situations than AVLs.
