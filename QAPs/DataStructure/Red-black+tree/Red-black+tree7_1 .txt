Red-Black Tree: Why is the root in a red-black tree always black?I can use rule 3: Parent of red node is black, but it's not enough.The root of a red-black tree is always black, because if it is red, it would be impossible to construct a legitimate(satisfying all conditions of red-black tree s) red-black tree in certain cases Consider an empty red-black tree, and one adds the first node, which will be root node. As per requirement of the question, this rot node would be red. Its two children, which are "nill" sentinel nodes would be black. Now if one adds the second node , it will be child of root(for sake of argument say left child), and it would be black, because a red node(root) cannot have red children. But this breaks the rule that number-of-black-nodes-from-root-to-all-leaves should be same. Two blacks on left child side and one black on right child side. The only way to fix this is to swap the color of the two nodes But then the root will not be red, thus breaking what the question asked for Written 27 Feb. 54 views.
