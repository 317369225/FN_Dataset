What are some tips, tricks and gotchas when using a red-black tree search algorithm?I think the search algorithm would be the same as the general one for binary search trees. The red/black node marking is used during insertion and deletion to avoid worst-case tree depth and search time. To me, the big apparent gotcha with red-black trees is, why bother with them when AVL trees provide much better balance?
