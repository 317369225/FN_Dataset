Why are Red Black Tree'sÂ  leaf nodes represented as black?The definition of red-black tree states that all the leaf nodes are to be black. But when we have red leaf node, then we can still assume that they are pointed to by *nil* children which are black. Then why have this rule creation of the red-black tree itself? I can safely say that leaf nodes can be any color, is'nt it?I think it is actually not necessary to have black NIL sentinel nodes I tried to implement, from scratch, Red Black Trees for practice. I made it a point to not use sentinel black NIL nodes. In that way I ensured I am using my brains and not just coding the algorithm given in the book I was successfully able to do so So the condition of all leaves to be black is strictly not necessary It however changes the other rules for RB Trees somewhat. Rule : Children of Red Node are both black becomes Rule : Children of Red Node are either both black or both NIL Rule : Number of black nodes, from any node, downstream towards any leaf-node below it, is same becomes Rule : Number of black nodes, from any node, downstream towards any "node with 0 or 1 kids" below it, is same You will also have to take explicit care of NIL checks when coding
