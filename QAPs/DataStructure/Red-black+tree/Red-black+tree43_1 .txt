Why can't a red node have null inner child in a red black tree in the delete case when the sibling of the deleted black node is a red?该网页不存在附加信息...You just removed a black node, lets call it node X. Let us call parent of X as node P. Let us call the sibling of X as node S Before removing the node, the tree was satisfying the red-black property So the count of black nodes on path from P down to all leaves was same. Let us call this count as h Lowest value of h is 2, that is node X has two nil sentinel children The value is same down the node S side of node P Since node S is red, the value of h is same downward from S, as it from X If children of S are nill sentinel, the value h down from S will be 1 which is not possible
