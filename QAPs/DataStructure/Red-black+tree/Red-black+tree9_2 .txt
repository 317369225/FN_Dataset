Why are Red Black Tree'sÂ  leaf nodes represented as black?The definition of red-black tree states that all the leaf nodes are to be black. But when we have red leaf node, then we can still assume that they are pointed to by *nil* children which are black. Then why have this rule creation of the red-black tree itself? I can safely say that leaf nodes can be any color, is'nt it?I think it will answer your question. Red-Black Tree must satisfy the following properties: Black condition - every path from the root to a leaf node has the same number of black links/nodes (Every simple path from a given node to any of its descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes.) Red condition - no path from the root a leaf node has two or more consecutive red links/nodes (ie. every red node will have a black parent) The root is always black(This rule is sometimes omitted. Since the root can always be changed from red to black, but not necessarily vice-versa, this rule has little effect on analysis) Both children of every red node are black.
