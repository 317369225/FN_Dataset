What is a Fibonacci Heap?
Its a Data Structure. Like Binomial heap, Fibonacci heap is a collection of min-heap-ordered tree, with following characteristics: The trees are not necessarily Binomial trees. Sibling are bi-directionally linked and hence it is implemented using doubly linked list. There is a pointer min[H] to the root with the minimum key. The root degrees are not unique. A special attribute n[H] maintains the total no. of nodes. It can perform the operation in amortized O(1) time except delete and delete-min operation. ... (more)
