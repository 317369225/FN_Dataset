What is the threshold of queue size at which a Fibonacci Heap becomes a good priority queue?
My impression is that Pairing heaps are often used in situations with way more decrease-keys than deletes. They have slightly worse asymptotic behavior, but makes up for it with simplicity (loglogn  log⁡log⁡n is basically 6, exploglogn − − − − − − −  √   exp⁡log⁡log⁡n ... use your imagination I guess). 1.1k Views · 5 Upvotes
