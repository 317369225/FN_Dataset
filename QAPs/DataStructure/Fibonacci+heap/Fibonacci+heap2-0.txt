Why are Fibonacci heaps called Fibonacci heaps?
The term Fibonacci heap most likely came from the proof of the Fib heap's O(logn)  O(log⁡n) runtime. The way that the Fib heap's delete-min works is that it looks at its minimum root. Then, it deletes that root and makes all of that node's children roots. However, in order for delete-min to operate in O(logn)  O(log⁡n) time, the number of children of the root node must be O(logn)  O(log⁡n) . In other words, we need to show that the degree of each node is O(logn)  O(log⁡n) . To ensure this bound, it turns out that all you need to show is that a node of degree k  k has ≥c k   ≥ck descendants for some constant c  c .
