Why is there no Fibonacci heap implementation in the Standard Java API?
Fibonacci heaps are asymptotically faster than binary and binomial heaps, but this does not necessarily mean they are faster in practice. The additional complexity of Fibonacci heaps will likely make them slower for operations on smaller heaps. Additionally, the delete operation has worse worst case complexity. Many applications simply don't need the additional benefit of a Fibonacci heap and adding it bloats the size of the Java standard library for everyone. If your application really does need one, there are non-standard library implementations. People working on the standard library have... (more)
