What is a Fibonacci Heap?
I want to complement Adam D'Angelo's answer a little. A Fibonacci heap is a type of heap that supports merging, insertion, decrease-key* and find-min in O(1)  O(1) amortized time, and delete and delete-min in O(logn)  O(log⁡n) amortized time. There are actually 3 improvements here over a binary heap: 1. A fast merge operation, which a binary heap cannot support in less than Θ(n)  Θ(n) time. 2. An insert operation that takes O(1)  O(1) amortized time, rather than O(logn)  O(log⁡n) time as with a binary heap. 3. A decrease-key operation that takes O(1)  O(1) amortized time, rather than O(logn)  O(log⁡n) time as with a binary heap. ... (more)
