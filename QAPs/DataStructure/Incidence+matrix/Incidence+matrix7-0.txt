Is there any other usage of matrices beyond representing linear transformations?
Yes and no.  No. Any use of matrices can be recast as a usage of linear transformations, and when recast, the statement looks pretty much the same. Yes. You don't have to know about linear transformations for some of the applications of matrices.  They can be used to solve a system of simultaneous linear equations.  For example, given the equations                           3x+2y=5                            7x−4y=3  you can write it as a matrix equation                           [34 2−4 ][xy ]=[53 ]  and use row reduction on the augmented matrix                           [34 2−4 53 ]  as was done first in ancient China two thousand years ago.  The ancient Chinese didn't know about linear transformations. That system of equations can also be cast as a question of linear transformations. You're looking for the inverse image of   [53 ]    under the linear transformation  T    named by the matrix  [34 2−4 ].
