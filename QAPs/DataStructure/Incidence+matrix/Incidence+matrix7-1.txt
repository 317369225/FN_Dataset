Is there any other usage of matrices beyond representing linear transformations?
I've already written something on this subject. If you care, you can read it: Gram Zeppi's answer to Does a matrix only represent a linear transformation? What is the connection between using matrices to solve a system of linear equations and using them as linear transformations? Are the definitions of the operations made deliberately as such, or is the usage of a matrix a consequence of its definition? Even in linear algebra matrices are used to represent bilinear forms as well which are not linear transformations. You can e.g. represent graphs with matrices and that in many ways ! For example, the entry a ij   of an adjacency matrix shows whether there is an edge starting at the vertex i  and ending at the vertex j  , i.e. the connections. ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 0000 1010 1001 0010 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟   The rows of an incidence matrix represent vertices and its columns edges. The entry b i,j =±1  means that the edge j  ends resp. starts at the vertex i  , it shows the flows. ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ −1100 −1010 01−10 00−11 001−1 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟   Likewise, you can represent with matrices many interesting objects, think about the board games for example.
