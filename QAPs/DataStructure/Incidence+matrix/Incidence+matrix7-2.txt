Is there any other usage of matrices beyond representing linear transformations?
Yes! In fact, the first "conceptually autonomous and logically consistent formulation of quantum mechanics" was Heisenberg's matrix mechanics, which describes the observables of physical particles as being represented matrices that undergo evolution through time. Matrix multiplication, which is non-commutative, was precisely the mechanism which Heisenberg needed. He presented his new theory to Max Born who, having studied mathematics before he changed fields to physics, immediately realized that Heisenberg was just describing matrix multiplication. For more detail, see Max Born and the quantum theory. In the matrix mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues of each matrix represent all of the possible values which the associated observable can have, which are all real because every such matrix is Hermitian (i.e., self-adjoint). Two observables with matrices that have the same eigenvectors can be simultaneously diagonalized, and in that basis they commute, i.e. AB−BA=0  . However, this is not always the case. In the language of matrix mechanics, we can write the Heisenberg uncertainty principle as ∑ k (X nk P km −P nk X km )=iℏδ nm ,  which is a consequence of the fact that the matrices corresponding to the position and momentum observables do not commute.
