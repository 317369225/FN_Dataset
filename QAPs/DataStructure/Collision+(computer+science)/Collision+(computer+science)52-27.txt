Psychology of Everyday Life: What are some of the greatest examples of presence of mind?
This is a story of one of the greatest freedom fighters in India, Rajaji. Once he was traveling in train with his family and friends. One of his friends, started swinging his hand out of the window in order to get the feel of the wind. Suddenly his diamond ring slipped out of his finger. "My ring" "My ring", he exclaimed hysterically and started running around the cabin. "Where did it fall", "how could you be so negligent" , "Stop the train", "Pull the damn chain", "oh no"  the cabin soon turned into pandemonium. During this tumult, Rajaji remained calmly on his seat and kept staring out of his window. His wife jolted him and asked him to do something for his friend, he continued to ignore them.  Upon reaching the next station, they made a complaint with the head master. The headmaster said that the previous station was 50 km behind and that searching for the ring would be like searching for a needle in a stack of hay! Upon everyone's surprise, Rajaji responded, " There were 36 telegraph poles from the point where the ring fell to this station". So this is what he was doing when he was quietly staring out of the window. His counting was right, and they soon found the diamond ring. Rajaji kept his cool in the state of unrest; hence, he was able to take the most effective action!! Source- http://www.speakingtee.in
