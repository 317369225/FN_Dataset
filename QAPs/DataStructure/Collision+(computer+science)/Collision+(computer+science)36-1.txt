Which computer science concepts would be most useful for a self-taught web developer to know?In other words, what do they teach in CS programs that I missed out on, or that would seriously improve my web programming skills?
People will always say algorithms and data structures, but the truth is, that will almost never come in in practical web development. The highest value you will get from a CS degree as it pertains to web development might be program architecture and software design, however both of these things can be picked up much more effectively by participating in open source projects or reading/modifying open source code, or simply writing many of your own programs and learning best practices on your own (this is a longer and less effective way to learn software development than reading/modifying existing code bases). Programming in any realm is almost entirely a self taught endeavor, the degree basically makes sure you're learning on your own on the right path is all. I'd say as long as you make sure you're getting programming experience in general, all of the fundamentals will come naturally Note: I have B.S. and M.S. in CS and I wish I'd bypassed much more of my formal education in favor of gaining more practical experience during that time.
