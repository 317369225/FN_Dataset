What are the advantages of hiring someone who has been in the US military?For a non-military job.
As a 25-year vet, I want to add one point to all of the other great points, though in a much different vein. Most veterans will be great hires, because if they took their service seriously, they will embody everything the rest of these comments discuss.   But then there is a other group of "veterans". The ones who spent their initial enlistment fighting the system and ignoring those values the rest of us hold dear. Those guys will be trouble no matter where they go, and there's no fixing them. Watch out for them. If you're interviewing them, discuss why they only served one enlistment. Some people will say that they enjoyed their time, and were ready for a new opportunity. Some other people will starting finger-pointing and blaming the system for their failures.   Now to change direction, there is another issue with hiring veterans.   The reason that main reason that veterans can be great hires is that we understand a chain-of-command, we follow orders, we are willing to place blind trust in the system, we are faithful, we are committed.   But what happens when the chain-of-command doesn't understand itself? When the bureaucracy is stupider than the people. When the employer doesn't care about values like Honor, Trust and Faith, and is willing to exploit its employees for pure monetary gain.  When the issues like harassment and verbal abuse are ignored or even rewarded.     Veterans don’t respond well to that kind of bullshit.  We don’t want to lower our standards and our work ethic to accommodate the whims of the dumb.  So pay attention to the work environment into which you are bringing these talented, dedicated, and excellent candidates.  A good environment will foster more dedication, and you'll have a long-time advocate of your company.  A bad environment, and you'll lose them and the other losers will still be there.
