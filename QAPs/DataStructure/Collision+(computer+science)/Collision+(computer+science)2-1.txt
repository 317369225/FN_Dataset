What was it like to be at the University of Maryland, College Park with Sergey Brin?
I found him reasonably intelligent, inquisitive, and mildly annoying.  The fact that I found him mildly annoying was probably more about me than it was about Sergey.  We were both in a 400 level Computer Architecture class together where the prof was pretty much phoning it it (I understand that professor later left UMD to play sax full-time ).  I was more than happy to glide by with an easy A in the class since the rest of my course load was pretty difficult.  But Sergey wanted to challenge and maybe even embarrass this prof.   You might say he was the "you forgot to give us homework" student sitting in the back of the room. One funny side story:  When google became a big deal it took me a while to realize I knew the brain child behind it.   People kept asking me if I knew him, so I would pull up a photo of him but his press photo (clear skin, nice haircut, straight teeth etc) looked nothing like he looked at UMD. Finally I stumbled upon his crappy Stanford personal webpage with a photo of a kid with a bad haircut.  "I KNOW THAT GUY!"
