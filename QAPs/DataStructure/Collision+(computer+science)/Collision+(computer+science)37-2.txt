I am studying for a BS in Computer Science. What are some suggestions and ideas for my Final Year Project? I am interested in game development.Should I make a game? I have been working with Unity 3d for two years. Which platform should I target? What type of game should it be?
If you're going for a full- fledged game, go PC for now, and (this is just an idea btw) make it an open-world sandbox type game. This allows for many hurdles while debugging and might even turn into something that can be distributed thru steam and turn a bit of profit your way. You could also try to make a compiler. It's a lot more complicated and you would have to dip your toes into something other than unity, but a smooth (maybe even multi-language) efficient compiler will make any prof swoon.
