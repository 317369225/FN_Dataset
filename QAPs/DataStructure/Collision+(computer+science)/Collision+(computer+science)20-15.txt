How do I prepare for a software engineering job interview?This is a follow-up question to What's the best way to prepare for job interviews?
Code! Preparing specifically for interviews is superfluous if you spend time coding daily. You'll likely be comfortable in a few languages (Python and C are good) and have no problem quickly designing algorithms and systems. In the interview, follow edw519's style (http://edweissman.com/53640595) and break down the problem mentally before coding anything. Maybe sketch psuedo code. This will help the interviewer understand how you think. My only preparation suggestion would be to do coding problems on a white board if you haven't before. This is very different from typing code and will throw you off if you don't practice in front of people. Possibly find a job teaching at your school or start your own class to build your verbal communication skills (http://cs198.stanford.edu and http://cs1u.stanford.edu). Finally, have fun! Don't stress about interviews. Be yourself and enjoy talking to your interviewers! .
