What are some interesting careers like those of Jim Moriarty and Sherlock?I am greatly influenced by the Sherlock series and wish to live an exciting life like them. What are some careers or occupations in physics/ mathematics/ computer science that are as interesting,as challenging and require as much brain work as Sherlock Holmes?
Designing. You can combine Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science and a number of other disciplines too and arrive at this exciting profession. The essence to what Sherlock Holmes does is observation. Keen, impartial all-encompassing observation. The next is knowledge. For instance Sherlock uses his knowledge of crime, forensic procedures, cultures etc. These two combine to generate insight, which we all love so much. Designing a product or a service for consumption takes almost superhuman observation, amalgamated with basic knowledge to reveal simple but amazing insights. Where the mentioned disciplines and designing marry, is something I can't comment on with exaction, but know this : sitting down and observing people at work, or insects in motion, or interstellar collision or mathematical simulations needs nothing less than Sherlock-like skill applied to those disciplines. And the reason I chose designing is because, you ultimately get to interact with humans there, and in turn you get to observe and create insights, like Sherlock does. The entire process following which you arrive at your design insights is very intense, many a times non-linear and all the more exciting. Assume nothing, observe everything and allow for all possibilities and a life of excitement working as a Designer shall be made!
