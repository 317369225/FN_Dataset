What are the advantages of hiring someone who has been in the US military?For a non-military job.
The very best thing about the 2 ex-military guys I work with? They show up to meetings on time. All the time. If the meeting is at 10am, they are ready to go at 9:58. Don't think this is a big deal? I'm frequently corralling 10 people for a scrum to set the priorities each day. I have 2o minutes. I do not have time to waste because you cannot get yourself organized. I will not waste 9 other people's time because you were 5 minutes late. When you are 5 minutes late, you have wasted 45 minutes of time. Seriously. There's lots of great things about these 2, but that's the best. They understand punctuality underscores reliability.
