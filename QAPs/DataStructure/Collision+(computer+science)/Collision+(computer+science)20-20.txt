Originally Answered: How can one prepare for a computer science job interview?From what I've read/experienced, the majority of programming interviews have to do with data structures and algorithms. So you'll probably learn a fair amount of those in your CS class, but there is also a lot of stuff online that you can use to review if you want. This could be helpful: Coding for Interviews As could this online course on algorithms if you feel like you aren't getting enough at college: Final suggestion (and it sounds like you've already been doing this), is that if you are a little nervous about coding interviews, one of the best ways to deal with that is having strong open-source programming projects that show what you're interested in, and also give your interviewer a better look at your actual code writing ability. Hope that helps - good luck!
