How do I become a game programmer or developer by doing computer science and engineering at an average college of India with self-effort, as there is no typical college in India for gaming?
Programming for gaming covers a lot of varied aspects such as the look and feel, less buggy code and the idea for your game. For instance the User Interface of Temple Run OZ beats everything else, contrarily Quiz Up is too buggy. So work as a team, I am sure you can find guys with similar interests and choose the right ones. Start with smaller ideas, feel confident that you can do this. Create yourself opportunities to brainstorm gaming ideas and start coding, such as for your college events. Internet is your best source and attend workshops on such if you think they're worth it. You will have a course on Computer Graphics, but what's taught is not enough; you have to explore. May be this would help : Articles & tutorials - Java-Gaming.org
