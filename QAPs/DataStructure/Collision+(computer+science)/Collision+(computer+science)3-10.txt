What are some good computer science final year project ideas?
Originally Answered: What are some project topics for my final year project in computer science?There are a lot of topics to choose from, and you have provided nothing to indicate what you might be good at. So I'm going to hazard a few guesses. If you're good at the low level side of things - try building a Linux distro from scratch which focuses on whatever you might like it to. (LFS - Welcome to Linux From Scratch! might help a lot). If not on the lower side, then I think you should try the network side of things. How about your own file transfer system which integrates in most systems and works seamlessly, for free? (believe me, decent ones are rare). Whatever you do, do something where there is no clear leadership or it is easy to get a cutting edge for you.
