Psychology of Everyday Life: What are some of the greatest examples of presence of mind?
It was during my 12th grade English class. We were supposed to make a speech on any topic of our own in front of around 250 students. It was an afternoon English class and my friend's turn came. My nervous friend came forward and started "Good morning friends!" The students started laughing at him. He continued " well... on a tiring, sunny noon, your faces look incredibly fresh. So I wished you a good morning :p"
