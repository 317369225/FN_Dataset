What are some of the best books on Discrete Math for Computer Science?I am looking for an undergraduate beginners guide to discrete mathematics. Recurrence relations and Graph theory are important for the course at college. (We are following the book by Mott, Kandel & Baker. Any suggestions to make the best use of this as are also welcome)
Discrete Mathematical structures for Computer Science  by Dr.Trembley and Dr.Manohar.     The book is one of the best for reference towards groups, latttices and graph theory.but this book follows Kenneth Rosen.Kenneth Rosen is best in its way for presentation and content
