What is the importance of prime numbers in computer science?
One rather important area is in encryption algorithms. Here the key is that it's very inefficient to find the prime factors of a number but very easy to multiply two primes. Have a look at the RSA algorithm for more. One cool trick you can do is called Diffie Hellman key exchange, where two people holding each their own prime number can exchange a message secretly, even if other people are watching.
