What are the most fascinating things researchers and scientists are working on?Circa October 2011.
Vikas Solanki has covered three of the biggest research programs and/or directions that society is currently pursuing. Here are some others that I find interesting: Adiabatic Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Quantum computers can provide significant algorithmic speedups; for instance, Grover's algorithm [1] gives a way to sort a size n  list in O(n  √ )  time. The fundamental 'unit' of a quantum computer is the qubit, which stands for quantum bits. The poor mans version of why a qubit can do more computations than a single bit is because a bit b∈{0,1}  whereas a qubit q∈{(a,b)∈C 2 :|a| 2 +|b| 2 =1}≅S 3   , which implies that a qubit can store the data of multiple bits. Due to physical limitations (for instance, the fractional quantum hall effect plays a large role in topological quantum computing), one cannot actually get a state that is an arbitrary point in S 3   . The difference between a classical bit and a qubit is due to a physical phenomena known as entanglement. Adiabatic Quantum Computers are a form of quantum computer that takes advantage of the adiabatic theorem [2] to take a non-interacting state (e.g. a qubit that is 'like' a classical bit) and perturb it into an interacting state (a qubit which is distinct from a classical bit). This method of generating qubits is more practical and has the potential to scale well. Since the 2000 Farhi-Sipser paper, [3] the allure of adiabatic quantum computers as SAT solvers has been in the minds of quantum information theorists across the world. In May 2011, a Canadian company called D-Wave created what they claimed was a working 8-qubit Adiabatic quantum computer: They have sold a copy of this computer to Lockheed Martin [4] and have published a Nature paper [5] that describes their method. Most of us in the computational physics realm tend to think that they don't really have a quantum computer yet because they have not proved entanglement. Also, Google has apparently been enamored enough with D-Wave to develop algorithms for this computer [6]. However, this is quite promising and hopefully we will see advancements in the future! In terms of quantum information, there are a lot of exciting experiments going on in the fields of quantum optics and nanophotonics. Personally (due to my background in String Theory, Algebraic Geometry) I am quite enamored by the work on Topological Quantum Computing at Microsoft Station Q [7]. They have Michael Freedman [8] and Sankar Das Sharma [9] who are influential researchers in the field. Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe  (WMAP) and the Planck Satellite One of the greatest astrophysics discoveries of the last fifty years is the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The CMB is one of the tools that we can use to infer the extremely early structure of the universe. Of crucial importance is the phenomenon of inflation. Roughly speaking, inflation is the exponential (or possibly superexponential) increase in the volume of the universe during a very short (≈10 −34 −10 −32   seconds after the Big Bang) time period. As the following beautiful schematic illustrates, this inflationary regime is dominated by quantum effects which WMAP aims to probe [10]: As we have vague, hard-to-validate frameworks for understanding quantum gravity, inflation is a fairly difficult phenomena to explain quantitatively. Alan Guth made an important breakthrough in this field in the 80s. In a nutshell, Guth's landmark 1981 [11] paper roughly makes the following claim: If the universe contains a scalar field ϕ  and if the energy density of this field, ρ ϕ   is approximately the energy density of the universe ρ total   , then we have cosmic acceleration (w ϕ =−1  ) This landmark result provides a potential way for us to verify the existence of inflation and studying the CMB will help us determine if our universe satisfies the hypotheses of the above statement. As Jay Wacker noted in Will Alan Guth win the Nobel Prize in Physics?, this will be a monumental accomplishment in cosmology. Edit: I stupidly forgot to mention the Planck Satellite which is effectively the successor to WMAP. By 2013, it will give us a better look at the CMB and hopefully we should be able to infer some facts about the geometry of the early universe. This data will hopefully bring some validity to various theories, such as String Theory. It is also interesting to note that String Theory has played a big role in the theories of inflation [12]. There is speculation that one can use string theoretic methods to solve some big problems that are still open in this area. For instance, there is something known as the η  -problem or in colloquial language, "Why is the inflaton so light?" There are a few papers that attempt to show that String Theory can more accurately predict inflation and a few more boisterous members of the community have claimed that it is feasible to 'validate' the theory in this regard. Some important people in inflationary String Theory include Shamit Kachru and Juan Maldacena. Just a note: My interest in this topic is inherited from my undergrad thesis advisor who works on String Theoretic inflation models. I am by no means an expert, but I have read a few papers on the subject. I've found Daniel Baumann's lectures/slides [13] to be an excellent short introduction to inflation (for those with some QFT). Protein Folding and Drug Discovery Note: This is what I currently work on. Drug discovery is an extremely difficult problem that has perplexed biologists, chemists and to some extent physicists for many years. Even today, a large portion of our prescription and non-prescription drugs are inspired by nature. However, we would like more control over the drug discovery process, because at some point we will have exhausted the natural sources for drug design inspiration. After drug development's early successes in this century, practitioners truly began to believe that rational drug design would overtake the field; that is, chemical research would contribute more drugs than discovering an amazing compound in nature. So what are the problems with rational drug design? (These reflect my opinion/biases, of course, to some extent) People don't respond to drugs the way that chemists predict. It is really unfortunate when you are forced to can a 'miracle drug' because some obscure adrenal protein is destroyed by one's drug There are too many possible drugs. I have heard varied numbers on this, but there are somewhere between 10 30   and 10 100   possible drugs (given current drug design 'knowledge'; quantifying this is what gives different predictions). There is not enough science in the study for one to expect good predictions. A lot of the research is for things like QSAR that are at best bootstrapping measures that use heuristics like Lipinski's Rule of Five. Bioinformatics, for the most part, focuses on drug design as a 'one-dimensional problem'. A lot of the non-chemistry research in the field focuses on treating the drug-protein interaction in a one-dimensional fashion (e.g. compare the linear amino acid sequence to the drug structure). This is unlikely to make significant impacts to drug design. So what can we do? We can study the physics involved. A fair number of computational physicists and condensed-matter theorists have in fact spent the better portion of the last 30 years looking for ways to describe the physics of proteins. This is crucial because the interaction between proteins and drugs is decided by conformation or folded structure of the protein. Here is the unfolding-folding process of Villin [14]: The way a protein folds is a physical problem. A remarkable thing that we have discovered over the last 10-15 years (thanks to the large increase in computational power) is that for a large number of proteins one doesn't need much more than classical mechanics. If we treat a protein, which is made up of many tens of thousands of atoms, as an n  -body system, then the physical problem is the following: What are the forces that are necessary and sufficient to describe the dynamics of a protein? Moreover, what role does the solvent play in the folding of the protein? Do we need to simulate the solvent as well? Such large n  -body simulations are called Molecular Dynamics, because we are solving for the dynamics of systems up to atomic resolution. For the most part, the forces that are simulated in MD simulations consist of the following: Harmonic Oscillators for Covalent Bonds: Yes, we physicists love our springs, from basic classical mechanics all the way up to Quantum Field Theory. These forces control both rotation (dihedral term), F rot ∼k(θ−θ 0 )  and atom translation F trans ∼k(r−r 0 )  Torsional Force: The torsional force associated to a molecule is best described by pictures: van der Waals Force: This is usually described by something like the Lennard-Jones potential, U LJ ∼r −12 −r −6   Great, so the problem is solved right? Nope! It turns out that such problems are extremely computationally intensive. To put this into perspective, IBM built BlueGene as the world's 'fastest' (by FLOPS) supercomputer to solve this problem [15]. However in 2004 the longest time that we had ever simulated was a 10 microsecond simulation by the first-rate group of Klaus Schulten at the University of Illinois. This simulation took three months and required implicit solvent (which is a relatively big deal). In the past decade, we have seen a 10 2 −10 3   increase in the time we can simulate. In roughly three months, D. E. Shaw Research's Anton can simulate 2-5 millisecond simulations [16]. And we feel like we've only found the tip of the iceberg when it comes to drug-protein interaction. For reference, I refer you to the group's papers [17]. Also, check out David's Stanford video lectures on MD/protein folding [18,19]. Specialized Computation Hardware I will add more on this later, but for now here is the specialized computer I am most fond of: International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) This is a very long term (at least 20 year) project that attempts to make Nuclear Fusion viable in the future. For more information see: What is the current state of nuclear fusion research? When is it likely that breakeven fusion will occur in a lab, and then in a commercial context? Heavy-Ion Collision Experiments When most people hear about particle accelerators and 'atom smashing' experiments, they think immediately of protons, electrons or neutrons smashing into each other at something like 99.99999% of the speed of light. However, what happens when we smash much bigger particles into each other at near-luminal speeds? It turns out that we get an interesting phase of matter known as the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). What does this mean? Well recall that protons and neutrons are made up of even smaller particles called quarks whose stability/interaction is mediated by a particle called a gluon. An immediate question that one might ask is, "Why do protons and neutrons stay together in coherent packets in most experiments?" A coarse way to describe why this happens is that gluons 'glue' the three quarks of protons and neutrons (or other Baryons) together so that they cannot fly far off from each other. The force associated to this gluing is known as the Strong Force. Please note that this is of course a simplification and one needs to look at the mathematics to see the difference between a gluon-mediated interaction (the concept of a vector or gauge boson is important here) and a photon-mediated interaction (e.g. e − ,e +   annihilation). The basic idea of a heavy ion experiment is that if one smashes heavy-ions (e.g. particles with lots of protons and neutrons, such as metals) into each other at near-luminal speeds, then one can disturb the stabilizing force of the gluons significantly. Instead of having a small, compact region of spacetime that supports a proton or neutron, a smashed proton/neutron will smear the different conserved charges (known as colors) of the constituent quarks throughout a larger region of spacetime. Here is a picture: The purple is the QGP that forms after smashing the black-lines (which one can think of as columns of protons/neutrons). After forming a plasma, condensation occurs, before we are left with sphere made up of separated elementary particles (e.g. quarks/gluons). This image is from the initial Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) experiment [20]. Here is another simpler picture: In some ways, this is process has analogies to plasmas and liquids, giving high-energy physicists a new way to study the strong force. One of the most important questions that one can ask is, What is the viscosity of the Quark-Gluon Plasma? This is important for a few reasons. Firstly, in the study of liquids one has the Stokes-Einstein relation which says that the diffusion constant D  is proportional to the inverse viscosity η −1   , D∝Tη   This relation is known to breakdown (very slightly) in some plasmas as in liquid crystals and glasses. Since diffusion processes are well-understood, viscosity plays an important role in understanding the continuous-time diffusive processes that occur during particle experiments. Also, Viscosity is necessary to define the Navier-Stokes equation and it might be interesting to see how well this obviously quantum phase of matter is approximated by Navier-Stokes. We have made experimental steps in the study of QGPs. The experiment at RHIC was the first to demonstrate the effect. However, their computation of viscosity using Quantum Chromodynamics turns out to be horrifically wrong relative to the experiment. More recent experiments at ALICE (part of CERN)  have given scientists a significant amount of data to study [21,22]. Oddly enough, String Theorists and condensed-matter theorists teamed up and found a way to use the AdS/CFT correspondance to give a lower-bound on the viscosity that was far more accurate than the Quantum Chromodynamics estimate [23].  It will be interesting to see how theoretical physics is able to explain in phenomena in the future and if it will provide a very fruitful interaction between mathematical techniques developed in String Theory and the real-world. I will leave you with a snapshot picture of the RHIC experiment to give on an idea of how much data is collected: Disclaimer: I worked on some of the more theoretical aspects of the QGP computations in my honors thesis and this might be why I am quite interested in this application :) Footnotes: [1] Grover's Algorithm: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gro...
