How do I prepare for a software engineering job interview?This is a follow-up question to What's the best way to prepare for job interviews?
Not sure how much time you've got before your next interview. This is a rather important detail. So, here is my rather broad answer. :) In general, tech interviews in many top software companies have their specific format and one needs to prepare for it. Even if you are technically strong, you may need a bit of getting used to the format. In many cases you need to write code on a whiteboard. Time is limited, like 30-40 minutes to solve and code a problem. It may be even less sometimes. If you need to learn some theory, like algorithms and system design - go ahead and either get some of the popular books on the matter: "Cracking the Coding Interview", "Programming Interviews Exposed". You could also look at a few Quora questions where I've given some tips and lists of things that need to be covered: * How should I prepare system design questions for Google/Facebook Interview? * How much time did you spend preparing for Google's interviews? It's important to use a resource, which will give you a plan of action. Otherwise you can quickly get lost in the tons of materials available. At http://www.hiredintech.com/app, we've built a free preparation course for tech interviews, which will give you a very good idea of what topics are important. It contains some theory, practice problems and preparation plans. Check it out and let us know what you think. Most importantly, practice a lot. Solve problems in a setting similar to the one at interviews. Use a whiteboard or paper, limit your time. Another great thing to do is find another person who is qualified to do a mock interview with you. Make sure it's someone knowledgeable and who will not spare you any criticism. :) Doing mock interviews will prepare you best for what to expect at the real thing. Good luck with the interviews!
