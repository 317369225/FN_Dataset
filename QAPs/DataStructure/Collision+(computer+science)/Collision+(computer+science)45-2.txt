Why do we have the hierarchical principle in adding interactions to a model? What is the significance of it?This is specific to modelling. And in general linear regression models. Textbook says that even if the main effect is insignificant, one should add it if there is an interaction term with that. Why?
Thanks for the A2A. I am an engineer so I have a crude understanding of statistics so this may not be the only reason. I think the hierarchical structure ensures that it controls for the covariance of the individual independent variables. This way the interaction term is not super-inflated, another way to interpret this is as a boundary condition value to estimate say the value at X1 = 0. Does this help?
