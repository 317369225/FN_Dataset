Psychology of Everyday Life: What are some of the greatest examples of presence of mind?
Richard Branson. His plane to Puerto Rico was cancelled, and he was stranded in the airport.  He says, ‘Well I had a pretty girl waiting for me…, and so (I) was pretty adamant to get there that night.’ Obviously he was annoyed. Desperate to get there on time, he started calling around about chartering a plane. He didn't really have the money to charter a plane at that point, but he went ahead and ordered it. He (then) went over, picked up a small blackboard and went over to all the people who had had their flight cancelled with him, on the previous flight. And he just wrote on (the blackboard), Virgin Airlines, $29 and sold off  the rest of the seats on this chartered plane and used their money to buy the chartered plane. They all went there that night.” That was the start of Virgin Atlantic, now ranked 34 of the world's top 100 airlines.
