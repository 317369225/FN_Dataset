Why is it unlikely that any two non-identical files, in the real world, will not have the same md5 hash?Or is it?
I'm not a cryptography expert but the following facts will help you to understand better the problem linked to your question. 1)The problem for a hash function to give the same output for two inputs is called collision (see Collision (computer science)) 2) It's linked to the birthday paradox in probability (see Birthday problem) To be short; the probability, given a set of n people, to have (at least) two of them sharing the same birthday date. The formula is : p(n, d) = [(d-1) ^ (n*(n-1)/2) ]/2 (Regarding the birthday problem, n is the number of people and d = 365) In our context; d is the amount of different md5 hashes. For md5 hash that are x bits long;  the probability, for two random files,  to have the same md5 hash would be p(2, 2^x). 3) It would be true if md5's hash function was consistent (regarding the spread of the hashes). Sadly it's not, so the probabilities are even higher. Md5 vulnerabilities are quite well explained here MD5. I'll advice you to look more how those md5 flaws impact the collision probability.
