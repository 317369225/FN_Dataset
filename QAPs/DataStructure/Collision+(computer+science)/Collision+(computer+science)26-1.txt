How can I correlate my math and physics topics with computer science?
I don't know which grade are you in but Computer science has all developed due to Maths and Physics ( Electronis). One can say that computers were conceived by mathematicians and realised by physicists   . So if you are studying electronics ,microprocessors ,transistors etc.  in Physics then you are studying the basics and start of technological aspects of computer science. And if you are studying mathematics then you are studying the basics of programming in computers and all the theory of computer science. So if you are interested in making of computers be good in physics(electronics) and if you are interested in programming then be good at maths ,logic etc. I think you are in high school you will see the connection more clearly in your graduation.
