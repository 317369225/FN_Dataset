What are some good computer science final year project ideas?
Originally Answered: I am a final-year computer science student. What are some ideas for a final-year project?That's not an answer anyone can suggest.  What are you interested in? Computer science is such massive field and most areas have exicting research/projects you can do.  However, I suggest asking yourself what area of computer science are you interested in? Once you figure this out look at open source projects in the field and think of a way you can contribute and figure out a project from there.  Or look up open source projects like apache spark, Hadoop and ... And look into how you can contribute. Hope this helps and good luck.
