What are some uses of hashing algorithms?
Hashing has following uses: 1. In Hash Tables 2. To build caches 3. In cryptography 4. In Rabin-Karp algorithm to search substrings 5. In computer graphics etc. Out of these, Hash tables are very commonly used to implement different types of in-memory tables and associative arrays in languages like Perl and PHP. Languages like Python, JS, and Ruby etc use hash tables to implement objects. In such a representation, the name of variables and functions become the ‘key’ while the pointer to them in memory gets stored as value. Another use is in the form of hash consing in Lisp. Similarly, modern cryptography techniques use secure hashing.
