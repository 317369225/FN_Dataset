Psychology of Everyday Life: What are some of the greatest examples of presence of mind?
​ ​ In the movie "Pursuit of Happyness" Will Smith after getting released from Jail only about 30 minutes before his interview,sprints  and arrives just in time, but is embarrassed because he has to go to it  wearing ratty clothes ,shirtless and flecked with dry paint. One of the men asks him - "What would you say if I told you we once hired a man who came in without a shirt on?" Chris pauses then wittily replies- "Those must have been some really nice pants." everyone in the room laughs and he gets the internship.. PS.
