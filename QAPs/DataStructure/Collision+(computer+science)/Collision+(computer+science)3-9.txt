What are some good computer science final year project ideas?
Originally Answered: What are some good final year projects for computer science students?I suggest you don't work in a silo. You are in a University setting after all. So find an adviser or lab to work with. This allows you to take advantage of resources locally available and focuses the research more. No man is an island.
