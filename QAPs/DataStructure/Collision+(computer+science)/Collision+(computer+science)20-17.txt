How do I prepare for a software engineering job interview?This is a follow-up question to What's the best way to prepare for job interviews?
Hello. Besides from what other users have said, there are two excellent tools that I've found to be really good for practicing: The first one is called InterviewBit (Programming Interview Preparations Made Easy), it is an online tool that lets you practice for the technical parts of the interviews. It's divided by problem types, depending on difficulty, say you learn first about time complexity, then arrays and strings, heaps, queues, and so on. Supposedly they also help you to get jobs at top tech companies, if you are good and rank on the top users. The website is new so there is not much competition at the moment and it is a good moment to start. The second tool that I've used and I know that is pretty good is the book called Cracking the Coding Interview (Book). There's a non technical part that teaches you how interviews work and how to do well at the personality interview. They also have a big component of technical topics where they explain superficially each topic and then they show you a series of interview questions. The book contains the answers of them all. I hope it helps, I'm currently running a Tech Interviews Club at my university (Universidad de los Andes) and I'm developing it. So if you need any other help just tell me. I'm learning too, so we can learn all together.
