How do I start game development in C/C++?
In order to start developing a game using C++, you will need following Moderate knowledge of C++ features ( Inheritance, Polymorphism and virtual functions, operator overloading, Function pointers) Any basic book like A Tour of C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup) or Accelerated C++ (Andrew Koenig and Barbara Moo) will help. Use of a 3rd party game library ( multimedia/graphics/sound api) like Simple DirectMedia Layer - Homepage . There are many other libraries for 2-D and 3-D games. Refer gaming forum mentioned below for choosing which one suits you best. Moderate knowledge of Design patterns. Patterns like Singleton and factory etc will be used extensively in your project. Creativity and patience. Refer GameDev.net Game Development CommunityÂ  for beginner projects. Look in forums for some really good examples. This was my game development class project developed in C++ with SDL. You can refer code here- mandliya/theElecticNemo
