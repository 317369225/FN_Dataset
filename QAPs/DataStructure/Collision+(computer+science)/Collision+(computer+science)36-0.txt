Which computer science concepts would be most useful for a self-taught web developer to know?In other words, what do they teach in CS programs that I missed out on, or that would seriously improve my web programming skills?
You won't find all the answers but a good place to start understanding some of the questions is CS50 2013. If you would rather just piece together some of the skills you may need, HTML and CSS should be first on the list so you can render your content. They give you better control than a design package alone (Dreamweaver type apps that allow you to use WYSISYG in place of markup are constraining). Javascript for client side scripting (or server side with tools like Node.js). PHP, Ruby and perl are all useful tools. SQL or NoSQL, whatever resonates with you as you learn to organize your data. Try working anonymously, at least early on, it helps when you feel free to take some chances and produce more interesting work. This is all simple stuff to learn, but very difficult to master. Web Development isn’t Computer Science, It’s really more of an art form. You are pursuing perfection in a space where perfection is impossible to define. If it keeps you up at night and drives you half nuts, then you know you’re on to something.
