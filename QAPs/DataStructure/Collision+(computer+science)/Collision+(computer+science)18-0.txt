Is reality a database?
I don't think so. That is, given my meager understanding of Physics and Computer Science, I'm skeptical that "database" is a good description or metaphor for any currently-accepted model of the Universe. There is a branch of Physics called Digital Physics, which sees reality as information and the Universe as a kind of computer—or something like a computer. "Information" is anything that a system can take as an input which, based on the that input's specific configuration, changes the system it enters. So the marks in a book are information, because you parse them, and that changes you (in the sense that it alters neural connections in your brain). DNA is information, because it's parsed by biological processes—causing cells to be copied; atoms that "bump into each other" are information, because those collisions have effects on universal computation. Perhaps a good metaphor (or description) of the Universe is a computer with data moving around inside of it, causing various programs to run, stop running, change, etc. But a database isn't the same thing as a computer. A database is just one thing a computer does, and not the most interesting thing. da·ta·base noun 1. a structured set of data held in a computer, esp. one that is accessible in various ways It's the "held" part that doesn't sound right to me. Databases are fairly static. They just store information until it's needed. As such, though they may be part of reality, they aren't the whole story. Reality is way more dynamic than that. But I am dancing beyond the edge of my understanding. Hopefully, someone more knowledgable will show up and write something better. UPDATE: to be a bit more specific, though each piece of data fed into a database does alter the database, the alterations aren't specific to the data's form. A database will store "cat" and "dog" without caring about the difference between them, whereas you (an information processor) do care about the difference.
