Which computer science concepts would be most useful for a self-taught web developer to know?In other words, what do they teach in CS programs that I missed out on, or that would seriously improve my web programming skills?
As someone else mentioned, the short answer is algorithms and data structures. To elaborate, in any CS program the overarching focus should be to expose students to a wide set of problems and through solving them guide students into developing an effective, problem-solving mindset. In this regard, computer science is very much the same as math. However, whereas the toolset for solving math problems consists of logic and mountains of abstract notation, the toolset for solving computer science problems often involves algorithms and data structures (with a fair amount of logic and abstract notation, let's be honest). So, at a very high level, a CS program... Expands your toolset Broadens your experience (to things like functional programming languages, etc.) Hones your problem-solving capabilities. Â Do you need a CS degree to be a competent web developer? Obviously not. But it's good for any dev to be constantly working on those three high-level areas mentioned above - web devs included.
