How do I start game development in C/C++?
Before learing game programming, we need to know something called event driven programming. Event driven programming refers to that style of programming wherein the user of the application is free to choose from several options rather than be confined to a predetermined sequence of interactions with the program. Game programming is one common example of event driven programming. A game is a closed, i.e., complete and self sufficient formal system that represents a subset of reality. A game is a perfect combination of actions-reactions or event-responses where every response is based on the most-recently occurred event. Elements of Game Programming In general, a computer game has five elements: Graphics Sound Interface Gameplay Story Game Design Sequence Since game design requires one to explore one's artistic abilities, it cannot be formulated in a step by step process. However, there are certain technical steps that one needs to follow in one way or another. These are: Determining Initial requirements. Develop Interface. Develop Logic of Gameplay. Develop Logic for Scoring points.
