Psychology of Everyday Life: What are some of the greatest examples of presence of mind?
Once more than two years back, I along with a friend, was travelling in a public bus in Delhi. It was DTC's route number 419 and the bus a little crowded. We were two 17 year olds having a normal conversation about random stuff perhaps about exams or cricket or popular news. Somewhere around ITO, my friend asked me, 'have you ever been pickpocketed in a bus?'. I answered that fortunately I have not had the experience. I asked him whether he had that experience and he simply shook his head negatively. Just as the next bus stop was about to come, we heard a man next to us talking on phone. He was very angry over the person he was talking to and I smirked at the choicest cuss words he used to decorate his conversation. He got off on the next stop and I joked to my friend how we might have a learnt a few interesting words. My friend told me that when he asked me that question about getting pickpocketed, that man(who got off at the stop) was actually reaching into his pocket and upon hearing that question he quickly moved out his hand and distanced himself. I was stunned by my friend's presence of mind which saved his pockets and avoided an ugly confrontation. Updated 13 Mar â€¢ View Upvotes
