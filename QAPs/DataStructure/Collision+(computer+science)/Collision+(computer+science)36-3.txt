Which computer science concepts would be most useful for a self-taught web developer to know?In other words, what do they teach in CS programs that I missed out on, or that would seriously improve my web programming skills?
I did my CS degree after 5 years of programming (my boss at the time insisted I needed it and wouldn't promote me until I had one). While it did expose me to a wider variety of programming languages (COBOL, Smalltalk etc), it was a serious distraction from my career. I wanted to learn more about emerging web technologies and couldn't spend the time I needed to pick up skills in that area while I was studying. It took me a year after I graduated to get back up to speed. I would have been much better off learning on the job. Back then (in the 90's) there wasn't a whole lot of choice for training. These days it's much easier to find a course that aligns with your career goals - there are a ton of MOOC offerings in Computer Science - browse a couple and you'll quickly spot any gaps you have in your knowledge.
