What do trigonometry and physics have to do with IT or Computer Science in general?
Well firstly, trigonometry is used very frequently in physics. Unless you want to be writing a game engine, you shouldn't need much trig, or physics anywhere in the field of IT. As a programmer, if you are making games, it is good to know at least the basics of trigonometry (circular functions, their meanings, and how to use them), so you can deal with basic things like rotation or collisions. For example, the following matrix would rotate a 2D vector (a,b)  about the point (0,0)  , by and angle of θ  : ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ cosθsinθ −sinθcosθ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥
