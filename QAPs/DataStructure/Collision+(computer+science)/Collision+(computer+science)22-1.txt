I am a computer scince student in 3rd year but i dont want to leave other topics of science like physics. Now where to start?In school time I had interest in whole science not only in computers. But I chose cse as my stream.I am in third year. Now I realize that only computers was never an option for me. So now I want to continue with physics(acc to me what actually completes my choice of science) . So basically my question is where to start.
Well you can still contribute to the physics field with the help of computer science. like simulation or collision detectionÂ  . there is a book on scientific programming. you can start on that.
