What are the most essential topics a developer needs to know in order to ace a technical interview occurring in a few days?
The answer truly depends for the kind of developer position. I'm not sure if there is a one-fit answer for every developer position. Thus, if you are interviewing for Web Developer position then you must know server side programming model, to write code with good separation of concerns, object relational mapping, access to database, some sort of caching techniques and healthy exposure to some good javascript framework like jQuery. On top of that, one must have good knowledge of data structures like Hashtables, Binary Trees etc and algorithms like traversal of trees, handling of collisions in Hashtables etc. The subject area is vast and we are always looking for someone who can think logically and clearly about such concepts. We always take candidates through 4 rounds of interview with varying degree of complexity. At least, 2 rounds are hardcore programming fundamentals rounds where we not only ask the candidate theoretical questions about the framework and computer science related stuff but also ask them to write code. Lots of it. I would be more than happy to share some more insights if you could give me more clarity regarding the type of the interview. And, good luck for your interview.
