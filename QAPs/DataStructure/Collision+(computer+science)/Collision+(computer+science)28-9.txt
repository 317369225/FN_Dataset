What are the advantages of hiring someone who has been in the US military?For a non-military job.
25 years after I'd left active duty in the Marine Corps , I was employed by a plumbing company in So. Cal. Plumbing is a very technical field , but like any job you are handed a problem and told to fix it . My employer had inherited the shop from his father in law after spending 25 years with the Telephone Co. He knew nothing at all about plumbing . He told me once that in 25 years with the phone company , he'd worked with 4 other Marines ...then me . He said the one thing we all had in common was a ' can do ' attitude . He said that most people , when faced with a difficult problem , start coming up with excuses about why it's going to be so hard to fix...or reasons why it cant be done at all . Marines he said , go directly to solving the problem handed to them . No talk , no excuses , no reasons why it cant be done , just accepting what it is and getting it done . I guess it's called being ' mission oriented ' . If you cannot accept failure ...it isnt going to be one of your options . Eliminating that option first thing ...makes the rest easier . 0311 Squad Leader at 19 ...in 1968 .
