I am studying for a BS in Computer Science. What are some suggestions and ideas for my Final Year Project? I am interested in game development.Should I make a game? I have been working with Unity 3d for two years. Which platform should I target? What type of game should it be?
well since you are a programmer and want to develop the game as a school project so i guess you will be focusing on programming content rather than the design and art portion. Therefore you can choose from a variety of game genres : Basic platformer games like super meat boy etc. Infinite runners like temple run etc. Top down view games based on adventure, puzzle or exploration etc. And of course you can make a game for your Final Year Project.
