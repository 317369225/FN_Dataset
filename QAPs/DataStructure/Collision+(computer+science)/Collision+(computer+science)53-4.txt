Is computer science without computers just maths?
It is not fair to reduce CS to maths. It may employ mathematical arguments, constructs, or borrow expressions from maths works adjacent to very real implementations. These tie in closely with computers. It has heavy relationships with the sciences as: statistics or applied maths, engineering as: electrical engineering or computer engineering via computers of any sort. It covers: computation, formal languages, software systems, hardware systems, networking, artificial intelligence, and many additional investigations. It also conducts theoretical interests as: programming languages, automata, complexity, information, or additional directions that extend practice to new paradigms. If we were to take away the machine, it would still be concerned with these topics. However, the real-world simulation and computing power would be lost. It would be difficult to verify repetitive steps, that only the processor can complete quickly. I cannot lay claim to what computer scientists would have done without machinery, yet you should understand computer scientists, if forcibly reduced, to be closer to mathematical scientists.
