How do atheists explain how the world was created?answering that it came from something before is not an answer
Atheists are people who don't believe in gods. Some have explanations of how the world was created; some don't. Some of them have silly explanations; some of them have well-reasoned ones. If someone believes the world was created by a dead fish but doesn't in gods, he's an atheist, because not-believing-in-gods is the only requirement for being an atheist. Some atheists (and some theists) accept the findings of Science. Here is the current scientific understanding of how the world was created: Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago by accretion from the solar nebula. Volcanic outgassing likely created the primordial atmosphere, but it contained almost no oxygen and would have been toxic to humans and most modern life. Much of the Earth was molten because of extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies. One very large collision is thought to have been responsible for tilting the Earth at an angle and forming the Moon. Over time, such cosmic bombardments ceased, allowing the planet to cool and form a solid crust. Water that was brought here by comets and asteroids condensed into clouds and the oceans took shape. Earth was finally hospitable to life, and the earliest forms that arose enriched the atmosphere with oxygen. Life on Earth remained small and microscopic for at least one billion years. About 580 million years ago, complex multicellular life arose, and during the Cambrian period it experienced a rapid diversification into most major phyla. Around six million years ago, the primate lineage that would lead to chimpanzees (our closest living relatives) diverged from the lineage that would lead to modern humans. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His...
