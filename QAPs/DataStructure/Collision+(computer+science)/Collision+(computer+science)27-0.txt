What are some computer science/engineering jobs or fields which saves lives everyday?
All of them.  Let me say it again. ALL of them. Several years ago I burned the midnight oil one Friday night making sure the final touches on a tweak to a piece of software that hung on some big software that got used by the city of New York was actually working and that it got properly deployed. It made sure that calls from pay booths and cell phones where the voice was not English immediately got to an interpreter and-the part I tweaked-that an interpreter actually answered.  A thankless task. On Monday morning, someone had left a news clipping on my desk.  A Serbian woman in NYC had a seizure, managed to a speed dial, the first two interpreters weren't there and the third got medical help. A tiny tweak saved a life.  Every day, everything we do in technology affects people's lives.  We don't always get to know when or how but it's true. The next time you see a motorized wheelchair, think about the battery, the control system, the brakes, the motors, the foam in the seat, the strong lightweight frame that only working together give mobility to someone.  Then look around and be amazed. See that creativity that touches lives?  THAT is God, and I'm glad to be a priest in that calling.
