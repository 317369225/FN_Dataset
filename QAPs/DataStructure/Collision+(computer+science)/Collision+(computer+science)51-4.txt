What are some interesting careers like those of Jim Moriarty and Sherlock?I am greatly influenced by the Sherlock series and wish to live an exciting life like them. What are some careers or occupations in physics/ mathematics/ computer science that are as interesting,as challenging and require as much brain work as Sherlock Holmes?
