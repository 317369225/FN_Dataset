Why doesn't the UPSC include computer science, engineering, or information technology in the Civil Service and engineering service exams?
UPSC is tired of protests. Every single change introduced by the UPSC do not go down well with the students, the so called to-be administrators. Because if they do, students from Chemical Engg, Pharmaceutical Engg, Material Science and Engg etc would fast unto death. Administration in the capital would go haywire. Water cannons would be used to disperse the protesting students off the India Gate and the water shortage problem in Delhi would take a turn for the worse. Heated debates, disruptions and adjournments would follow in the Parliament, Because Computer Science graduates have alternative career options and don't lobby hard enough for the inclusion of the subject.Usefulness of Administrators who are well versed in Computer Technology while implementing e-Governance initiatives like Digital India, Digital Locker Schemes and in combating Cyber warfare cannot be overemphasized. It is worth mentioning here that IRCTC servers fail to cater to the burgeoning demands during the peak hours of ticket booking. Having said that, there is a strong case for the inclusion of Computer Science & IT in IES Exam given its applications in the functioning of Indian Railways ranging from Online Reservation, GPS enabled enquiry systems, Wi-Fi, Collision Avoidance Algorithms etc.
