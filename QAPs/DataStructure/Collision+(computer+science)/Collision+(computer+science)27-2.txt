What are some computer science/engineering jobs or fields which saves lives everyday?
Access to education can save and vastly improve lives. At Duolingo, our mission is to bring free language education to the world. There are currently 1.2 billion people learning a new language globally, of which the majority (around 800 million) are of low socio-economic conditions and learning English to find a better job. Learning English can really improve people's life opportunities, but existing options were all expensive (private school, tutors, Rosetta Stone, etc.). That's why Duolingo was created. There are currently over 100 million people learning languages on Duolingo worldwide.
