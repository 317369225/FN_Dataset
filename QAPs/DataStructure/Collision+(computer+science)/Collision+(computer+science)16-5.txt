How do I go about learning how to make games?
That depends on what is your part in the development process. If you want to create a game from scratch as a one-man team, learn to program first. If you don't slack off, you'll get the basics in a semester of C or C++ classes . A course in algorithms is highly recommended too. "How Computers Work" has little to no relevance on game development today. For the most part, you don't need to understand most of the hardware to write software for it. 1&4. Textbooks? Books? Everyone has their own choices. None of them are perfect for everyone, fully comprehensive or error-free. Find one that is understandable for you and start coding. Hands-on experience will teach you more than any textbook. 2. Computer Science as a branch of science is pretty much the foundation of everything that goes on in your game engine. 3. Stack Overflow. The C++ Resources Network for reference and examples on C and C++ (in fact, that rather than a textbook has been my primary resource for learning both) Some people take to software development like fish to water. Others... well, about 60% of self-professed programmers can't figure out FizzBuzz. If you have a knack for math and logic, and you find you enjoy coding, you have a chance at being a good programmer with a few years of hard work. Carmack? There are programmers, and there is John Carmack. The man is a legend for a good reason - you don't just become another Carmack by studying alone, you have to be exceptionally predisposed to and almost literally live for your work.
