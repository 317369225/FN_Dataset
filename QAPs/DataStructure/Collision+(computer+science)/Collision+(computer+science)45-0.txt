Why do we have the hierarchical principle in adding interactions to a model? What is the significance of it?This is specific to modelling. And in general linear regression models. Textbook says that even if the main effect is insignificant, one should add it if there is an interaction term with that. Why?
OK, "hierarchy" in interaction models usually means that if you have an interaction term you have to include all the lower level effects involved in the interaction. Most simply (and commonly) if you have a 2 way interaction you have to include both main effects. This is nearly always true. Why? Suppose, you are modeling the relationship between income (logged) as the DV and race/ethnic group (White/other) and sex (male/female) and their interaction (I am keeping this simple - I know there are more than 2 ethnicities and more than 2 sexes).Â  You have four combinations: White men White women Other men Other women If you include the interaction and the main effects, you are saying that each of these could be different from the other three. If you do not include the interaction, but only the main effects, you are saying that all four could be different, but that the difference between White men and White women is the same as between other men and other women; this might be reasonable (but I've seen evidence that it is not true) But if you only include the interaction, then you are saying that the first three are all equal and the last is different. That makes no sense here and it is hard to think of cases where it does make sense (but not quite impossible, see PsycNET - Display Record )
