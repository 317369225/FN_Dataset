How can I combine a computer science from a great school with a interest in a trade such as welding?I'd like to put this combination to work in the maritime industry. I want to get my hands dirty but keep my brain active.
Find the problem that you and other welders share and automate it. It might not be the physical act of welding, but you're the one that would know best. There's a quote somewhere from someone that said something along the lines of how every new skill you learn compounds the chance of success because you can intersect skills together.
