How do I become a game programmer or developer by doing computer science and engineering at an average college of India with self-effort, as there is no typical college in India for gaming?
That is a lot of questions inside a question. I will try to answer as far and as best as I can. Taking up a computer science stream in your college is the right thing to do for a beginner but that doesn't mean you need a CS background to develop games. I did Bachelors In Computer application and the only way by which that course helped me is to only get comfortable with the foundation of programming. Never depend on your computer science education as the sole reason for game development. When I started developing my game I started up by looking into different available game scripts in the internet @The Art & Business of Making Games really helped me a lot in this case. You said you want to develop a game engine but before doing that I suggest you to look for the available game engines and start working in it. Unity3D is an excellent and free game engine which can give you a great kickstart and confidence in developing games.Â  Unity has their own learning resources which is free and will also help you to start developing your first game and give you more ideas. They have their own community of thousands of people to help you in case you came across any problem. If we talk about game programming all you need is a basic idea of any of the programming languages ( C , C# or JavaScript etc). I've learned C in my college so I was able to quickly get comfortable with javascript as I learned to develop games on unity. I hope this helped you. My very first android game Dodger Ball will be released today in the playstore and I will make sure to share the link here.
