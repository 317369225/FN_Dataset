How do I prepare for a software engineering job interview?This is a follow-up question to What's the best way to prepare for job interviews?
There's some great general answers here. For practice with algorithm problems, , these were the ones I found most consistent with the interviews I actually tookÂ  (large companies like Google/Facebook/Microsoft/Amazon showed significant overlap, smaller ones were more original). Also, I'd use these as a lower bound for difficulty, I had some interviews that were harder and focused more on areas I claimed to know stuff about. http://www.leetcode.com/ - not too many problems, but each is really well explained and they're just about the difficulty I got at most places... Google/Facebook/etc. http://xorswap.com - Not too many questions and most of them are good phone screen/first round candidates. I've found incorrect answers so I wouldn't rely on them. http://www.careercup.com/ I've heard good things about the book but the signal to noise on the forums is way too low, and I found some answers to be incorrect. Also, most questions are first round/phone screen level, and there are different questions that are popular in different countries with some companies like Google and Amazon.
