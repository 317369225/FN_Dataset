What areas of expertise are necessary to create autonomous UAVs?
First of all don't create an autonomous UAV - use what already exists, that took years and hundreds of people to be created. Build on what is available, don't reinvent the wheel. Second you should build a low cost UAV from parts, fly it, and talk to people who could use it.Â  Use your talents to fill in a real need, instead of developing what you need they might need. Third, take what you excel at and love the most (whether control, computer vision, electromechanical etc) and apply that to UAV. DIYDrones is (used to?) be a great free source of information, and open source so everything at your fingertips.
