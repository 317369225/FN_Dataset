How do I prepare for a software engineering job interview?This is a follow-up question to What's the best way to prepare for job interviews?
Relax!  The hardest part about interviews is the duration. Being grilled for 4-5 hours is tough, and you have to remain "on" and personable the entire time, while still maintaining your mental sharpness. I don't know another industry - save medicine - that has such lengthy interviews. Get a great night's sleep the night before, be sure to clear your head of any work related stress, and try to have fun. If you get stressed out before or during your interview, you'll have a hard time regaining your composure.  You want to be able to methodically answer any questions you're asked. Studying for an interview is a wasted effort, and you'll just stress yourself out trying to do it. There's such a breadth to computer science that you'll never be able to guess what you'll be asked. That said, studying your resume is important. Make sure you feel comfortable answering in great detail anything on your resume. A very common interview technique is to play resume roulette. The interviewer will pick something random on the resume and start drilling down as far as possible to see where you break.  If you've padded your resume with inconsequential items, you're going to have a hard time. Be sure you can talk at length and detail about anything on your resume. The best way to make it through an interview is to try to have fun with it. A lot of the times, the engineering questions people ask are fun. Try to get your head into a state where you'll have fun answering those questions. Also, practice makes perfect. Never interview for your dream job first.
