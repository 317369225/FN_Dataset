Psychology of Everyday Life: What are some of the greatest examples of presence of mind?
This incident took place one evening, ten years back. It was just me, my sister Afi and dad at home. I and Afi were having candies and arguing about something.  Dad was beside us reading. All on a sudden Afi stopped talking. Her mouth was open and she was  trying to talk but no voice came out. Her face started getting bluish and eyes were bulging out. I understood she's choking and called dad. Like all does,  dad did tap her head once or twice.  By now she was making weird gestures and was totally blue. The next moment dad stood behind her and with hands on her abdomen he applied a pressure there. The second time he did that the toffee popped out of her mouth and she was back to normal in few minutes. Following that he scolded us for arguing.  After he was calm I asked him what was that he did. For that he replied he'd gone to a first aid class few years back. He then heard this was the technique to relieve choking.   Only after years while studying forensic medicine I knew this is something called Heimlich maneuver. Had I been  alone when she choked I would've panicked and lost her. Now that im into medicine i can manage such situations,  but being a nomal person it requires a great presence of mind to manage emergencies. Especially when it's someone very close to you in a critical situation, your thought process may get numb out of panic. HEIMLICH MANEUVER: (for those who doesn't know of it) It is named after Dr.Henry Heimlich who first described it in 1974. It is a first aid procedure to treat upper airway obstruction (choking) by foreign objects. Rescuer stands behind the patient and uses his hands to exert pressure on the bottom of diaphragm. This compresses the lungs and exerts pressure on any object lodged in the trachea, hopefully expelling it. ​
