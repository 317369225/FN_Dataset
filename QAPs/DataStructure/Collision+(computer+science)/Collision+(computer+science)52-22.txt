Psychology of Everyday Life: What are some of the greatest examples of presence of mind?
This comment by Harsha Bhogle during his speech at IIM Ahmedabad Q. What was your GPA when you were a student here? Harsha : I learnt this very early in my childhood, 'Remember the good, forget the bad! and another one which I read this a long time back On a train to a large computer convention, there was a bunch of engineers and a bunch of managers. Each of the managers had a train ticket. The group of engineers had only ONE ticket for all of them. The managers started laughing, figuring the engineers were going to get caught and thrown off the train. When one of the engineers, the lookout, said, “Here comes the conductor,” all of the engineers went into the bathroom. The managers were puzzled. The conductor came aboard, said, “Tickets, please,” and got tickets from all the managers. He then went to the bathroom and knocked on the door and said, “Ticket, please.” The engineers stuck the ticket under the door. The conductor took it and moved on. A few minutes later, the engineers came out of the bathroom. The managers felt really stupid. On the way back from the convention, the group of managers decided that they would try that method, too. They bought one ticket for the whole group. They met up with the engineers in the same train car. Again, the managers started snickering at the engineers. This time, NONE of the engineers had tickets. When the lookout said, “Conductor coming!” all the engineers went to one bathroom and all the managers went to the other bathroom. Before the conductor came on board, one of the engineers left their bathroom, knocked on the managers bathroom and said, “Ticket, please.” Edit (Suggested by Gangaprasad Pabba): After reaching the City, they all board the local tram car and this time all the engineers buy the tickets and none of the managers take a ticket. Amused, one of the managers asks an engineer after boarding the train "Why did you all take the tickets now?" and the engineer answers "Because the local trams does not have bathrooms". P.S. I don't think that this story actually projects the level of intelligence of Engineers and Managers. It's certainly a funny story though, with a good example of presence of mind.
