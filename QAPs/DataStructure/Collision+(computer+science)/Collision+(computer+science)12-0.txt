What is the significance of the n-Queens problem in computer science?
None. :-) Except for: The problem is easy to visualize. The algorithm is simple. The algorithm is intuitive and does not depend on more sophisticated techniques. Which makes it a good starting point to learn. Yet, the algorithm illustrates quite a few important concepts to get a feel before diving into computer science. The final program is easy to code in many languages. The presence of one simple output -- the number of solutions -- makes it very easy to see whether the program is doing the right thing. And I even remember how many distinct solutions for N=8 are there with and without taking reflections and rotations into consideration. :-) Updated 6 Jan 2014 â€¢ View Upvotes
