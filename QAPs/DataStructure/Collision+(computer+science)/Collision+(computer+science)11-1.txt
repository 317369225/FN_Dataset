What are some innovative final year project ideas for an IT/CS student?
Hi, Thanks for A2A! I think, I'm not the right person to answer this .. currently in second year :p but I'll try to answer! If you want to do something innovative try doing some research projects. Choose current evolving branches of Computer Science like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing and Security, Data Mining, Image Processing, Gesture Controlled Robotics etc . There are lot of research work going on, on AI and ML. Check research papers you'll get some idea. Here are some ML projects! Learning to Recognize Objects in Images.
