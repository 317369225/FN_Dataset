Originally Answered: What are some final year project ideas for an IT student?See when your are looking for a project, if have any good idea just try to make it work with your implementation or else try to enhance the existing system. Try to find out the flaws in existing system for any project which you like and avoid them with your implementation. The Cloud API Hub provides lot ofÂ  information about API's. These API's may help you to finish your project in less time. My suggestion regarding technology's better to use python or ruby for web applications becoz they are such a robust languages and client side tech. jquery.
