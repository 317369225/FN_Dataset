Psychology of Everyday Life: What are some of the greatest examples of presence of mind?
This happened to a friend of mine. Very white, new PhD in hand. She got a job teaching at an historically black college, a course on the history of race in America or something similar. She introduced herself went over the syllabus, described the course. One of the black students said, "You can't teach this course because you're not black." Without missing a beat she replied, "How do you know?" The course went well after that.
