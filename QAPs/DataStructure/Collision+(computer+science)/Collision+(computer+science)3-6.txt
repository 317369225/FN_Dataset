What are some good computer science final year project ideas?
Originally Answered: What are some project topics for my final year project in computer science?A very interesting topic would be Reversible Quantum Computing. This topic is a sensation nowadays. Lot of research is going on all around the globe. A short description on why this subject? We all know the normal irreversible gates(like AND,OR) which has 2 inputs and 1 output. So, one bit is disregarded everytime we use a single gate. This disregarded bit generates heat. A complex structure like a Computer is built with millions of gates. Feel the heat?Uh? How about if we build a computer with Reversible gates? No heat would be generated!!! Imagine playing high graphic games on laptops without feeling the heat!
