Is reality a database?
No, reality is vibrating fields of energy.  The database is in your brain, where facts are stored in a structured way and updated in response to external and internal stimuli. I'm lying in bed at the moment, surrounded by reality, information about which floods into my senses unbidden.  Most of it is distilled out before I could ever be aware of it, and even less of it is recorded.  The more I attend to it -- to my cat as I pet her, for example -- the less I see that could be mistaken for an external fact or entity. Even though this answer is about reality, I had to answer it by querying my mental database.
