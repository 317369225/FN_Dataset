Is computer science without computers just maths?
No! For one simple reason. Mathematicians work to come to a solution through better and more elegant operations. Computers (and Computer Scientists) have two routes to achieving the same solution: 1) Implement the mathematician's elegant solution -or- 2) Brute force it by performing a massive series f (super fast) calculations PS. The Russians have always been light years behind the West in Computer Science. ... Then again, many of the most profound Mathematical work and texts in the West are translations of original Russian works!
