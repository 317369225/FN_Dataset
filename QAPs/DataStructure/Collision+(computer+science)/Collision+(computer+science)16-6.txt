How do I go about learning how to make games?
If you want to develop games on your own, you'll need art skills (2d, 3d, audio), programming skills and game design skills. All of those take both learning and practice. If you're happy to work in a team (the recommended path), pick the talent you enjoy most and learn and practice as much as you can. When you feel comfortable with what you're doing you might want to look for a related job. If you want to go independent, connect with people that complement your skills. When you're using a game engine like Unity, you don't need to worry to much about the low level stuff but you still want to have a basic understanding so you don't accidentally mess up performance (both as programmer and artist).
