What is it like to work at CERN?
Being a summer student at CERN, what I think is most interesting is how to organize thousands of very intelligent people to work efficiently together. There are so many different things that you can work with, it is definitely possible to find something you will enjoy doing very much. The atmosphere at CERN is very nice, clubs and people hanging out together. And Geneva, Switzerland is a great place to live, better than all other places i visited. However, many scientists are quite stressed, which some argue can be partly CERNs fault for triggering competitiveness. This does drive serious science, but has it's downsides.
