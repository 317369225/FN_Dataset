Psychology of Everyday Life: What are some of the greatest examples of presence of mind?
Stanislav Petrov - The guy whose presence of mind saved the world from a deadly nuclear attack and possibly averted WWIII but sadly ruined his own career. On September 1st, 1983, a Soviet jet shot down a civilian airline killing 269 passengers, including US Congressman Lawrence McDonald spreading widespread outrage during the worst phase of US/USSR relations. Soviet leaders were convinced that the US was planning a first strike and sent a flash message to its operatives warning them to prepare for possible nuclear war. On September 26th, 1983, Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov was the officer on duty when the warning system reported a US missile launch. Petrov kept calm, suspecting a computer glitch. Then the system reported another US missile launch. And another, and another, and another. The policy of the Soviet Union called for launch on warning and Petrov was supposed to relay a message to its military base to launch the nuclear attack on US.But instead, he sent messages declaring the launch detection a false alarm. His decision was based solely on his personal belief that the US did not seem likely to start an attack using only 5 missiles. Petrov was first congratulated, then extensively interrogated, then reprimanded for failing to follow procedure. He resigned in poor health from the military several months later. He is now spending his retirement in relative poverty on a pension of $200/month. Source: 9/26 is Petrov Day
