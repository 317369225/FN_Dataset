How would you explain hashing to a non-computer science Person?
A person, similar to long string, cannot be described easily in order to quickly identify him/her, just like long string cannot be searched quickly. Hence, a shorter, compact "hash value" is used to identify the string, just like a name ia used to identify a person. Then move on to explain hash collisions like ppl with similar names, to avoid the collision one can move on to "secondary hash functions" such as age or gender. Finally a hash function is just like a simple conversion formula. Updated 1 Jul 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
