What are the most mind-blowing techniques, tools or approaches in computational biophysics?
1. Green's function reaction dynamics (GFRD) [1]. These techniques make it possible to simulate chemical reaction networks like signaling cascades in cells while taking into account low copy number stochastic effects, spatial localization and diffusion -- effects that cannot be modeled with standard ordinary differential equations. I think computer science-y people (i.e. Quora) will like GFRD. Its sort of like an event-driven simulation that you would do for collision detection and an n-body billiards ball problem, but stochastic. 2. ? [1] http://gfrd.org/
