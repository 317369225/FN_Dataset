Psychology of Everyday Life: What are some of the greatest examples of presence of mind?
On February 20th, 2003, my arch-nemesis undid my carefully-hatched scheme with one infuriating stroke of brilliance. It happened when I was in Grade 10. I was a bit of a James Dean sort back then, with a special fondness for protesting and stirring the pot. An announcement was made over the PA one day that the school had reconsidered its policy on allowing students to wear hats indoors. This practice was now banned, completely and forever. They claimed it was a security measure, meant to allow easy identification of unwelcome strangers (who apparently always wore hats). I never really wore a hat. But, on the principle of the thing, I was opportunistically outraged. I decided this was the perfect opening to really stick it to the school administration: I would organize an epic protest to reclaim our right to cover our greasy heads with whatever accessories we chose. So I went home and created this poster over the weekend, which other students and I then liberally distributed around the school the following Monday. By Tuesday morning, it was the talk of the school. Schoolyard plans were drawn up. Classroom debates were had. Opinions were published in the school paper. Excitement was high, and it built through-out the week. Then Thursday afternoon came. Just before we were released for the day, the administration wanted to make an important announcement. Because they loved students and cared for their enjoyment, they were going to host the first-ever "school spirit" event the following day. The features of this wonderful affair? Only one: for just $1, you could wear any hat you wanted. Well played, Mr. Mozina, well played. Updated 21 May â€¢ View Upvotes
