What are the advantages of hiring someone who has been in the US military?For a non-military job.
If your firm does business with the Federal Government, and that business requires your employees to have security clearances, you can save a LOT of money hiring recently discharged veterans who held security clearances while on duty. As an Intelligence Specialist, I held a very high clearance while in uniform.  That clearance made it possible for me to secure civilian employment over uncleared people who had as much (or more experience).  Consider that for a civilian who has never held a clearance of any kind, it can cost an employer many hundreds of thousands of dollars (and many months) to get that employee cleared to Top Secret.  A newly discharged veteran with a Top Secret clearance terminated within the past 6 months can cost only about $10,000 to have their clearance reactivated; a military reservist with a current clearance required only $2,000 or so to transfer their clearance. You can see that Government contractors have a lot of interest in hiring veterans for more than just their discipline and work ethic; they can save you a whole lot of money very quickly!
