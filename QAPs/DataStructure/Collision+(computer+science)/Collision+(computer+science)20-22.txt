How do I prepare for a software engineering job interview?This is a follow-up question to What's the best way to prepare for job interviews?
Lots of great answers already here...  Study the basics, Practice talking, Practice whiteboarding, Practice programming in general. ---------- I wanted to add one note about the inevitable puzzle questions.  As has been stated elsewhere - while some interviewers rely on these questions, they generally provide very little useful insight into candidate qualifications.  With that said, it is my belief that you should prepare in the same way you would for any other question: study them.  A few sites are out there listing common puzzles and their solutions such as: http://www.techinterview.org/ http://xorswap.com/ Why are puzzles bad interview questions?  If you know the answer to a puzzle then there is generally very little to talk about, they rely on an 'AHA' insight and are logically trivial once you understand them.  As such they can lead to long periods of being 'stuck' and then solved in a flash - which is simply not very illuminating.
