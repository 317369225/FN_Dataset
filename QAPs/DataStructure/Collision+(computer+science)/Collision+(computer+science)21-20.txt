Why do many software engineers not like Java?
They don't like what they can't understand. Java sits at a sweet spot. If you've ever developed serious software in C++, then Java is not verbose at all, and in some cases it's even faster than C++. Compilation time and compilation in Java is heaven compared to the mess building can be in C/C++ with so many different build systems, and the complexities of linking in so many possible ways. Java is super comfortable for cross os deployments, build time is a breeze after you've spent days at the time getting things to properly build with C/C++. Don't like having to specify types? Then be ready to write a ton of stupid unit tests that will make sure you're not passing bananas for apples and end up with unexpected runtime errors. All that supposed non verbosity and productivity promised by the likes of those script dialects is lost in unit tests and countless hours trying to fix bugs a type safe language would've saved you in the first place. Not to mention that type safety and a good IDE can help you refactor hundreds of files in seconds, not so much in Python/Ruby/Javascript. Java haters are a bunch of whiners, grow up and face your fears when you're ready to stop playing with your scripting languages that run hundreds of times slower than java, it's the most popular programing language in the world for a reason, it's backed by years of bleeding edge computer science, hundreds of millions of dollars of investment, a billion dollar enterprise industry, and now lots of other newer languages are building on its amazing virtual machine technology, while also powering the android ecosystem. Take that biatch. Updated 28 Apr â€¢ View Upvotes
