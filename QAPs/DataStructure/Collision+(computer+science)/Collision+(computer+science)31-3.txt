How do I become a game programmer or developer by doing computer science and engineering at an average college of India with self-effort, as there is no typical college in India for gaming?
Your college doesn't really matter. Infact, I have not come across one programmer from India in my life who is good due to the college they have been to. There are both crap programmers and good programmers from wide range of good, okayish or even worse colleges. Most of the good ones I met have been good at programming ONLY because they are different from their own classmates in the way they take interest into it and explore and work hard towards learning new things. If you are determined to work hard towards making games, and since you're just joining an Engineering college (may be no programming experience yet?) 1. You can start off making games using GUI based engines like Construct2 or GameSalad. 2. Mostly recommend joining an existing project who are looking for help (check Construct2 forums, a lot of them are asking for team up) It will clear up your mind of whether you want to be a game programmer or take up more roles (like level design, game design or QA) and also give you good experience. 3. Slowly move on to Unity or UE4 engine as you hone your programming skills and probably start working on small independent project by yourself. Most importantly, its easy to start something but difficult to stick to it during the odds. Sticking matters.
