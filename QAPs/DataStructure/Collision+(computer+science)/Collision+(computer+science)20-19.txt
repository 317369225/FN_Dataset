How do I prepare for a software engineering job interview?This is a follow-up question to What's the best way to prepare for job interviews?
I created an online tutorial for this purpose: Algorithms for Interviews To prepare for interviews, go through it and make sure you can solve the challenges it links to. This module reviews answering questions, analyzing algorithms, and algorithms strategies. It briefly reviews basic concepts in Data Structures, Trees & Graphs and Recursion, and links to relevant tutorials and challenges on Learneroo. The last two pages review software design and provide additional resources to study. The tutorial is focused on Algorithms and Data Structures, but briefly reviews some other topics, such as software design. Review those topics in more depth as needed, as well as specific topics (such as Ruby) a given company may ask you about.
