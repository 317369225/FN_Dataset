What are the advantages of hiring someone who has been in the US military?For a non-military job.
While I was at EDS as a systems engineer I worked in its Military Systems Division out of Washington DC on several US Army and DOD contracts.  I spent most of my time in the field on military installations.  My customer was the military, and EDS hired a great many veterans.  I have nothing but appreciation and respect for military persons.  I would hire veterans all day long.  Here are my top 5 reasons why: 1. They are conscientious and they care. 2. They are exceptionally well trained. 3. They are team players. 4. They honest and loyal. 5. They suit up and show up and do what they say they will do.
