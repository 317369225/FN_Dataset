How can I explain Computer Science Engineering to a layman?
Originally Answered: Can any person currently doing his/her Btech in CS tell me what is CS all about in laymen terms?Now Question is changed According to me . Instead of  getting  insight from others . Go get yourself . Take Harvard CS50 from youtube or edX.  An introductory course from Harvard university. It will let you know exactly what is CS all about. But remember don't think the way they teach, you will be getting in India. I don't think even best colleges of India can match them. Once you will take that course.  Read syllabus of university in which you are going to take course. You can Ask - Balaji Viswanathan ,  Aanand R Pandey  , Tony Li ,  Phillip Remaker ,  Tamal Biswas  May be they can give you an explanation. Edit - Hey Balaji wrote an explanation . Do you think its helpful ? If the answer is no , Wanna know Why? Then Adults , read answer by Sudarshan Iyengar's . Which is thee reason I did not even tried to explain myself ( see comments below by questioner ) . Updated 9 May • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Anshuman Gupta
