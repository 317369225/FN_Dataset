What are some interesting careers like those of Jim Moriarty and Sherlock?I am greatly influenced by the Sherlock series and wish to live an exciting life like them. What are some careers or occupations in physics/ mathematics/ computer science that are as interesting,as challenging and require as much brain work as Sherlock Holmes?
To be precise someone asking me that they want to live life sherlock way. Here is your million dollar answer: You dont live like anyone but you can determinately think like that someone. You can be anything in your this life and feel miserable about it or you can start thinking in absolutely new ways and get around to realise that the best way to live is to use your imagination. Now consider me and how I changed my answer here: I m in bank,  I m learning how to do ten things in one go both efficiently and effectively. You ll say that's not possible but thats what job demands,  and that's what sherlock have taught us. Updated 28 Sep • View Upvotes
