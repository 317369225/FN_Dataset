What are some of the best books on Discrete Math for Computer Science?I am looking for an undergraduate beginners guide to discrete mathematics. Recurrence relations and Graph theory are important for the course at college. (We are following the book by Mott, Kandel & Baker. Any suggestions to make the best use of this as are also welcome)
I have used only one book for discrete math, "Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications" by Kenneth Rosen. Its awesome ! I like the way he has "structured" the book, every chapter has sections, every section has "huge" exercise problems to solve( believe me they are very interesting) and then at the end of the chapter, there is miscellaneous exercise on the entire chapter. All the problems are very interesting, you will be amazed that simple theorems/concepts can solve "real-life" difficult problems.
