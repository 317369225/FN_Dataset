Electrical Engineering: How is the culture of EE different from that of CS?
In CS, it is considered perfectly natural to spend all day at a job where you code, and then go home and do more coding as a pastime. Indeed, in some communities the mark of a good coder seems to be all about how singularly you focus on coding. In EE, someone who worked as an engineer during the day, and then went home and did more engineering at night, would be seen as a bit weird. Now, there are lots of exceptions to this. There are probably lots of people in the robotics industry who are tinkering with Arduinos on the weekends. But I just don't see anyone rushing home to do DSP after doing it for 8 hours previously. Just my observation.
