How can we collect big data from the internet in general?For economists, the prevalence of negative words like “inflation” or “unemployment” might signal a recession. Epidemiologists can predict a widespread influenza outbreak in a similar fashion. How can we search the whole internet (just as Google does) so that analysis can be done? Does there exist a cheap/free program for this purpose?
You can crawl specific websites using Apache Nutch. if you are not looking for real time data specifically, the several data sources are already available, which you can download. there are API's available to extract data from Twitter, LinkedIn etc which will give you enough content for your specific project. You would not really like to download the whole internet as you will run out of memory !!
