What scientific problems are best suited for parallel computing?
Hadayat Seddiqi already made a beautiful exposition of a classic partial differential equation case (by finite differences, for heat - there are more approaches). There is no argument against this type of problem dominating the world of parallel scientific computing, but it is an additional, minor point that best suited can mean several things. PDE solvers are undoubtedly the most common parallel scientific codes, and that makes them the best in the sense that they have a large body of developed methods that scientists can leverage and rely on. In a technical sense of what sort of problem can give you the greatest benefit from parallelism, Embarrassingly parallel workloads are perhaps better still. These are problems which do not require (problem-related) communication between the participating processes, and therefore can be run independently, either in sequence, or using as many parallel units you have available. They aren't purely a theoretical case, examples include ensemble runs (sets of copies of input with differing random perturbations), deriving some property for each sample point in a large set from an experiment, parameter sweeps (simulating all possibilities from a range of initial variables), and the list goes on. Just a footnote, really.
