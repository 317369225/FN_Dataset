What are the advantages of hiring someone who has been in the US military?For a non-military job.
I have never been in the military, but I have had a number of veterans work for me as direct reports and on projects.  They have come most often from the Navy, Air Force, Army and Marine Corps, in that order. (There was a Naval Air Station in Silicon Valley) 1. Easy to work with and get things done. They are really oriented towards results. They will make new managers look good - even the somewhat clueless managers like I was. 2. Smart and hard working, and quick to learn new skills. A good mix of theoretical and practical.  If you ask for documentation and comments, you get good, usable documentation & comments, not complaints. 3. Generally good judgement and don't cause problems. They aren't going to do anything that you will have to apologize for.  You will not need to talk to HR about some problem.
