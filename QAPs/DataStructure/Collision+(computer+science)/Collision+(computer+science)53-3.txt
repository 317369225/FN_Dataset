Is computer science without computers just maths?
Theoretical computer science is often seen as a branch proper of mathematics as it concerns itself with abstract computers, which are mathematical entities that may or may not have analogs or incarnations in the actual world. But reducing all of computer science to mathematics in a world where nobody ever manages to build an actual computer is akin to reducing all of physics to mathematics in a world where nobody ever manages to carry out a physics experiment. So is all the physics theory for which experiments aren't yet feasible just mathematics? Not quite.
