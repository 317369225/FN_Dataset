How do I go about learning how to make games?
A game is a software designed to entertain people. So knowing software engineering techniques help a lot. A lot of stuffs in Computer Science apply to game development (such as AI, networking stuffs, etc). You can start by learning a game engine (such as Unity, Cocos2d, Unreal, etc etc, but no GameMaker or GameSalad if you are going for the technical aspect). Once you are comfortable with the engine, you can start creating a few simple games yourself. If you are a tech only guy and have issues with the art assets (like me :-p), you can grab some royalty-free assets from http://opengameart.com. Once you are able to achieve the above, you will have a basic understanding how a game is made. Nonetheless, most of the best games are made by a team, not solo (most, because there are outliers like Flappy Bird). Remember, you are leaning towards technical, so everything you do so far is likely technical. So your next step is to join a team and experience what it is like to develop a game in a team. In the midst of all these, remember to be humble. You have your aspiration, you desired to become someone like John Carmack but you have not reached that level yet.
