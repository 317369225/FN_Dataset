What are some innovative final year project ideas for an IT/CS student?
you may or may not heard the below topic..but this is one of most challenging SDLC phase for any IT organization before making their developed application/product delivery to the clients. Application Performance. healthy application may work very well for few user load, but when load Increases gradually  and hits the peak - application may not respond or crash, which is a disaster when it is in production environment. Hence we need to test this in pre production environment and ensure the application good enough to handle the expected load. Now the challenging area: when the user load hits the peak - what happens to the application ? which tier/component is not supporting or unable to handle the load ? which is the slow performing or not responding SQL query in the program code ? what are the corrective measures to be taken ? How do you troubleshoot and resolve the above challenges. this is where application performance engineering plays major role. this is huge project when considering for final year project but when you have all the setup and expert available - you can achieve this easily. when you present such challenging projects to your IT interviews, they will be surprised to see such unique projects been done at academic level.
