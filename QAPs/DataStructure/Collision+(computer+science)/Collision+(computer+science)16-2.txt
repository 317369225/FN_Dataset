How do I go about learning how to make games?
If you want to learn the fundamentals of computer science and use that knowledge to make Games, I would strongly recommend that you take Harvard's CS50x (Introduction to Computer Science). It is a freshman course taken by students at Harvard University. They will first teach you the fundamentals of programming and at the same time acquaint you with the C language. As soon as you will reach week 4 there is a problem set called "Breakout" (Problem Set 4: Breakout) in which you will make your own GUI based breakout game using Stanford's Portable Library. It is good course to get you started with Game Development. Let me know how it goes :)
