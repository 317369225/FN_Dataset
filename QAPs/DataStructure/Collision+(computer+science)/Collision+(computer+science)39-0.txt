What are the computer courses required for chemical engineering?
It greatly depends on how you want to structure your ChemE curriculum, and the type of work you want to do after graduation. There are many flavors of computing and how it can make a contact with chemical engineering. My research interests are in AI and its connection to control. So my answer will be biased towards these fields and their interaction with chemical engineering. If you want to do computing work, but within the realm of ChemE: In other words, you view and want to study computing strictly as a tool to understand chemical and physical phenomena. In such a case computational courses connected to transport phenomena are the obvious choice. Computational methods, numerical linear algebra, and to a lesser extent parallel architectures and simulation methods are useful. These fall more under the realm of computational sciences or applied mathematics as opposed to computer sciences. Collision of ideas from CS and ChemE: Here focus or interest is in the computing side, and process engineering problems are viewed strictly as an application domain. In such a case you should take as many CS courses as possible. Data structures & algorithms, graph theory, machine learning, optimization, and control are probably the most important courses. There has been an explosion of activity in this area. See Gyan Data and Computational sustainability. If you just want to do software engineering or shift completely to CS: In this case basically do as little ChemE courses as possible and do all CS courses. DSA, graph theory, and machine learning are again the most valuable courses. Also try to do all other AI courses like computer vision, natural language processing, data mining, social networks, algorithmic game theory etc.
