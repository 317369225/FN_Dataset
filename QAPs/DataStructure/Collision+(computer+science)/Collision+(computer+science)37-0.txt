I am studying for a BS in Computer Science. What are some suggestions and ideas for my Final Year Project? I am interested in game development.Should I make a game? I have been working with Unity 3d for two years. Which platform should I target? What type of game should it be?
It might sound very exciting to develop a game as part of your Final Project or degree thesis. However, I would advise you to look into some academic problem as part of your final project. Your project can then be to solve that problem. As you have mentioned that you are interested in game development, I would suggest that you look into various optimizations that can be done in algorithms related to shading, collision detection & handling, physics simulation etc. This will contribute towards game development. This will also give some weight to the research component of your work and you will learn something new and most importantly, create something new. If your optimization yields a significant improvement, implement and test it to prove your point. You can create a add on plugin or asset packages for various Game Engines available in the market. Have Fun! Good Luck!
