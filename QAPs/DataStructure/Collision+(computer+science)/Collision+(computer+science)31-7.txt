How do I become a game programmer or developer by doing computer science and engineering at an average college of India with self-effort, as there is no typical college in India for gaming?
One suggestion I would like to emphasize on is Start small . Start from pong , then may be Brick breaker , then Space Invaders , then may be Tetris . Basically do something which you can finish. And don't just go about developing your own engine. Understand why engines exist ? What problem they solve ? Basically they exist so that you don't have to deal with lower level tasks and abstracting numerous functionality to your finger tips. If you are interested in low level stuff then pick up an engine which allows you to do this . Also as you will keep on developing games , always be conscious of the various tasks which are needed to be done again and again you can develop your own in house frameworks for those tasks, as you will keep on developing games this framework will grow and may be after several years your framework become so robust and flexible that it can be called an Engine !!
