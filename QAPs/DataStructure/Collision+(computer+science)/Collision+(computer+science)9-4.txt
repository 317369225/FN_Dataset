Why do so many CS graduates flunk simple interview questions in algorithms?
The premise of your question is incorrect. For example, I can assure you we did not learn about 64 bit multi-server data processing in algorithms class. Students' exposure to such a problem would be highly dependent on what projects and advanced work they ended up working on AFTER the basic courses. Inquiring about that work and then asking them to adapt those ideas to new contexts will give you a much better idea of how capable the candidate is of applying knowledge. If you're truly concerned about the candidates' ability to handle a particular topic, you will find more success having an "interactive lesson" with them. There is no point in dismissing them for not recalling (or having never come across) a particular piece of information that hasn't been relevant to their work - instead, give them this information and then see what they can do with it. It's a conversation, not a quiz. You're testing their intelligence, not whether they've memorized their algorithms textbook.
