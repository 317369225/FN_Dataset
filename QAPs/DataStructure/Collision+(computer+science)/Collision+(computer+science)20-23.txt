How do I prepare for a software engineering job interview?This is a follow-up question to What's the best way to prepare for job interviews?
This depends a lot on how much preparation time you've given yourself and your current skill level. If you have months of prep time, you should work on as many parts of a software project as you can. Whenever possible, work on a project with a more experienced coder. This will give you a sense for best practices and good habits in addition to architecture and design knowledge. If you don't have much time (days or hours), I recommend reading Programming Pearls by Jon Bentley to get into the right mindset.
