Why do we have the hierarchical principle in adding interactions to a model? What is the significance of it?This is specific to modelling. And in general linear regression models. Textbook says that even if the main effect is insignificant, one should add it if there is an interaction term with that. Why?
It is important because it provides a way to look more closely at relationships between specific independent variables and a dependent variable due to adding the independent variables into the model sequentially rather than all at one time.
