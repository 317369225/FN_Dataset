What is going to be the next "big thing" in the next 5-10 years?
Originally Answered: What are the next big things?I realize this is a 2 year old question. A lot of next big things are on the horizon. There's nano-medicine, bio-printing, and lifespan extension (Google's immortality project Calico_(company). There's Lockheed Martin's graphene project for desalination and their Skunkworks project on nuclear fusion: Fusion Power Could Happen Sooner Than You Think. Lockheed Martin also bought a Quantum Computer from D-Wave Systems. Beyond that, we can speculate that the confluence of brain emulation, direct neural interface, optogenetics and nanotechnology may next allow an even faster "Internet of Minds", and some of those minds will be AI. This will allow techno-telepathy and the control of prosthetics or robotic avatars (some will use it for body-swapping). We will also be able to meet each other in different virtual realities for work, school and recreation.
