What are some good computer science final year project ideas?
Originally Answered: What are some good final year projects for computer science students?I am in a tier I engineering college final year,I can give you a step-by-step guide on how to make a "marks-getting" final year project in computer science. Step 1: Search for a computer science research paper on google and make sure it must contain heavy words,such as "Anthropomorphic Bias",Baysian Stimulation . Make sure you have little understanding of it ,but not all.Let's call it X Step 2: Find a working project basically code that has a beautiful GUI. It may or may not be related to X. It should  not be as  simple as railway management system.No!!! .Something of higher degree .More complicated.Let's call it Y Step 3: Most difficult step,relate X to Y in partial convincing way.Not totally convincing but partially. Step 4 : Laugh your ass out while explaining it to mentors and supervisors. On a serious note: Major project even in good colleges is not taken seriously,so how can we take it seriously.The whole point is documentation not the project,you get barely 5 min to explain the whole thing you did in 6 months. Marks are given on the basis of how well the documentation or how well the supervisor knows the student.
