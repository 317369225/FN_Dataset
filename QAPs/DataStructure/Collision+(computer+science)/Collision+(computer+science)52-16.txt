Psychology of Everyday Life: What are some of the greatest examples of presence of mind?
Racist comments and attacks against black footballers are common in Spanish football. On 27 April 2014,  in the La Liga match(Barcelona vs Villarreal) when Dani Alves (Brazilian footballer) was about to take a corner kick, Alves was targeted by Villarreal fans, who threw a banana at him. Alves picked up the banana, peeled it, and took a bite. Alves converted this racist attack into an opportunity to fight against racism. He responded to the racist incident by saying: "We have suffered this in Spain for some time. You have to take it with a dose of humour. We aren't going to change things easily. If you don't give it importance, they don't achieve their objective." Dani Alves's actions were backed by footballers and celebrities across the world as support flooded in from fellow professionals posting pictures of themselves with bananas on to the internet. Here are a few photos of fellow professionals in his support:- Neymar Jr. Sergio Agüero Oscar, David Luiz and Willian Luis Suárez and Philippe Coutinho Mario Balotelli Bacary Sagna Fernandinho
