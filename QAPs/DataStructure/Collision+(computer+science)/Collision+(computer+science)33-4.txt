What algorithms should a first year computer science student know?
First year - I'll keep it simple for you: Sorting - bubble and sink sort Searching - binary trees, hash tables Compression - basic concept of LZ77 and LZ78 derivative lossless compression algorithms, maybe toss in Huffman statistical compression as well. Modern compression algorithms like LZMA are just super-fine-tuned derivative implementations of the classic LZ77 algorithm. LZ78, by contrast, which is used by GIF, is similar, but at the same time quite different. It's better for streaming data.The rest you can leave for later years, but this is a good starting point. Some people might leave off compression, but it's so important to give you an idea of how this is done. It really helps a student understand how data is represented on the system, and how it can be compressed/decompressed, and how important good search and sort algorithms are to the performance of such. It really ties it all together, in other words.
