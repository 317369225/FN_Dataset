I am a computer scince student in 3rd year but i dont want to leave other topics of science like physics. Now where to start?In school time I had interest in whole science not only in computers. But I chose cse as my stream.I am in third year. Now I realize that only computers was never an option for me. So now I want to continue with physics(acc to me what actually completes my choice of science) . So basically my question is where to start.
I am a computer scientist and I love physics too. Being a computer science guy, i know the best practices and best algorithms for doing stuff. So i started applying it to solve the problems in physics. You need to learn the basics of computer simulations (Numerical Methods, Finite Element Analysis, some higher mathematics) and then you can start finding the answers to tough questions in physics like: calculating the effect of turbulence on an aircraft, etc.
