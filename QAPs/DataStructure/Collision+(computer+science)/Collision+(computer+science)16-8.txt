How do I go about learning how to make games?
Start with GameSalad. I can't emphasize that enough. If you start with something easy you won't give up, but instead, you'll start to fall in love with the beauty of making games. Once you get a hang of it, transition into more complex tools/frameworks. You can transition into something like Unity or Cocos2d (or whatever you prefer). But it's really nice to start out with something that is easy enough to get a gist of how making games works. I started using GameSalad 5 years ago (when I was 14) and have never stopped making games ever since. It introduced me to this new world of creating things. It helped me transition smoothly into programming and making games with other tools that are more advanced. I also started a Quora blog for new game developer of you're interested: A Teenager's Guide to App Development Updated 24 May â€¢ View Upvotes
