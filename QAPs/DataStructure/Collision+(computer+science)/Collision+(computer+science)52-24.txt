Psychology of Everyday Life: What are some of the greatest examples of presence of mind?
"Faked Death, Saved Life" - A real life incident! The driver of the white maruti 800 used in the terror attack in dinanagar on 27th July, 2015 got away with bullet injuries because he "pretended to be dead" and was thrown out of the car by the terrorists. Early morning on that day, when Kamaljit Singh Matharoo was out for buying vegetables, his eyes fell on three gunmen some distance away. They saw him and signaled to stop the car. They looked different. He realized something was wrong and tried to reverse the car. But they shot the car, and then to him. He lost count of the bullets. Fearing of his life, he pretended to be dead. He held his breath and slumped over the wheel. He tried not to move though he had been shot and the pain was intense. They assumed he was dead and threw him out of the car. And then they took his car and rushed to attack to nearby police station. While we have heard a story of a person pretending dead seeing a bear and saved his life, it must not be easy to apply in such a situation when you have been shot and suffering intense pain. It must take a load of presence of mind and lots of courage to save one's life in such a terrifying situation. While we strongly condemn the terror attack, we praise his presence of mind and act of bravery! Source: Gurdaspur attack: I faked death, they threw me out of the car, says a survivor
