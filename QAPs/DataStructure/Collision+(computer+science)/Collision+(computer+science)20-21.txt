How do I prepare for a software engineering job interview?This is a follow-up question to What's the best way to prepare for job interviews?
Do lots of software engineering job interviews.  This builds confidence and prepares you for questions you'll be asked in future interviews.  Log the questions you're asked and think about them more later. Learn (and solve a bunch of problems using) a terse scripting language like Ruby or a functional language like ML.  These languages promote clearer thinking and make it much less painful to write solutions to most interview problems.  People who can only think in C or Java are at a disadvantage. Practice answering and asking interview questions with your friends. Get plenty of sleep in the days leading up to the interview. Have some coffee or an energy drink if you feel tired.
