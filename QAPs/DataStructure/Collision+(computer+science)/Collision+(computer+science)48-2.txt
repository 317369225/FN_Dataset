What is it like to work at CERN?
I have a very physics-centric view, very orthogonal to Daniel Lobato García's. CERN is a place where you can make all sorts of geeky jokes and not be frustrated. It's a place where the library is open 24/7/365. It's a place where the contents of what you say matters, regardless of your age, gender, attire, or status. It's a place where negative results are also important; i.e., there is no shame in publishing that you have looked for something and did not find it. It's a place where the scientific method is employed in many areas, from metallurgy, to metrology, to computing, to physics. It's a place where you can speak 5 languages in one day without breaking a sweat. It's a place where your colleagues' nationality, cultural quirks, or political views are not as important as what they can contribute to get the problem you are both working on solved. It's a great place to work. Updated 25 Mar • View Upvotes
