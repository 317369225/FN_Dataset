How important is linear algebra in computer science?what is the relation between computer engineering and linear algebra
Depends on what you want to do. Linear algebra shows up in the theory of a lot of fields in computer science. Statistical learning models frequently rely on matrix algebra and decomposition. Image manipulation relies on vector manipulation and matrix transformations. Anything with physics will use vector manipulation and differential equations which require linear algebra to truly understand. If you want to get into the theory of it all, you need to know linear algebra. If you want to read white papers and consider cutting edge new algorithms and systems, you need to know a lot of math. That being said, as a professional software engineer I rarely use my knowledge of linear algebra and I know many very talented engineers who couldn't find the eigenvalues of a matrix to save their life. Still, I'd recommend it. The more you study the easier it is to learn.
