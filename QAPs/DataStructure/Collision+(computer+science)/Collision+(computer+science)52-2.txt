Psychology of Everyday Life: What are some of the greatest examples of presence of mind?
India vs New Zealand cricket test match in Mohali, sometime in early late 90s or early 2000s. Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid were batting and Chris Cairns was bowling some amazing outswingers at them, beating them twice or thrice every over. Due to the pitch surface and background, it was difficult for Sachin and Dravid to figure out which is the shining side of the bowl and hence determine the direction of the swing. After struggling for some time, when Dravid was on strike, Sachin walks up to Dravid in the middle of the over and displayed one of the finest moments of a good presence of mind: Sachin: I think I've an idea. I'm closer to the bowler when you're on strike, I can see which is the shining side before each ball when Chris Cairns starts his runup and then I'll hold my bat in the same direction at the non striker's end, which will tell you which direction the bowl is going to swing. And voila! They started doing that and Chris Cairns lost his entire momentum in the next couple of hours, going for cover drives and flicks across mid wicket. Watch Sachin tell the full story here with a funny ending on what happened when Chris Cairns finally figured out what was happening: https://www.facebook.com/video.p...
