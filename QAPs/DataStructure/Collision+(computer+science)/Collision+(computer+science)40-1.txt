What areas of expertise are necessary to create autonomous UAVs?
UAV: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (Assumption: You intend to get into field of UAVS and not just programming an off-the-shelf toy-UAV) 1. Aerodynamic design (creating things that can fly through air, need good foundation in fluid dynamics) and Propulsion design either turbine or propeller based ( providing that thrust to push the vehicle forward in air, need good foundation in fluid dynamics) 2. Control Systems for fly-by-wire flying (programming actuators for controlling the air-vehicle, need good foundation in hardware ) 3. Radio Systems ( communication systems for the air-vehicle to interact/communicate with the ground-station, need good foundation in electromagnetic field theory and hardware) 4. Power systems ( either battery/fuel powered for powering your turbine/propeller, need good foundation in power systems/hardware) 5. Optics and Sensor hardware ( for providing "eyes" and other sensory functions, need good foundation in physics and hardware) 6. On-board processing (computer vision for collision avoidance, target honing, etc; signal processing for understanding sensory inputs, interupts, etc; artificial intelligence for navigation; Need good foundation in mathematics (linear algebra, probability theory etc) A background in CS (Computer Science) does not provide much insight into your foundations. Most of above areas require coding of some form or another atleast in development/testing phase. Depending what your foundations are you can choose one of these areas.
