How do I become a game programmer or developer by doing computer science and engineering at an average college of India with self-effort, as there is no typical college in India for gaming?
Short answer : Best programmers I know learned with real life experience/experiments, not in school.Â  I'm not saying college is useless, I'm saying it's not enough, and it's not mandatory if you love programming. We have a wonderful thing called Internet, best way to learn IMHO.
