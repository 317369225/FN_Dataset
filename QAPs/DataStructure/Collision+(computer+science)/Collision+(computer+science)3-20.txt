What are some good computer science final year project ideas?
Originally Answered: What are some best final year main projects in computer science?Write a game. You will learn everything from that experience. More than what has been taught to you in class. More than what you will learn in the job. It is a very demanding project. Check with your professor though first. Some profs are crabby and don't like you having fun so you may want to check what will get you max marks. After all, college is a "game of marks". On a personal anecdote - I learnt coding when in my 10th standard. ICSE board meant that I could opt for the 6th subject - which was Computers in my case.Â  I had to do a project and I wanted to make a game. The only issue - no one had made anything like that. I talked to my teacher and he was happy ! The point I was thinking as an issue was a big positive for him - for exactly that reason - it was something new! Those days we had the BBC micros and they were too expensive for my parents to afford. So, I used to stay back after school for 2 hours every day to code. I never enjoyed the time in school as I did those few months. The school I was in ( North Point, in Darjeeling) is a boarding and a day-scholar school. Computer lab was a favorite as kids could play games. As my game neared completion - other kids wanted me to load the game on their machines so that they could play after I went off home. What a great feeling. So yeah. Make a game :)
