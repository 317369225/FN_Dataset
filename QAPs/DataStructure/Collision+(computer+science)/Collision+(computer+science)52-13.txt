Psychology of Everyday Life: What are some of the greatest examples of presence of mind?
Originally Answered: What are some great examples about presence of mind?Quite a few of the answers here are stories and fictional accounts. So I thought a real account of Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde's arrest would be a good fit here. I recently came across this on a Reddit post on/r/todayilearned/. TL;DR: When the co-founder of Pirate Bay was arrested he asked to phone his girlfriend so she could watch his house before leaving with the police. The police allowed him to make the call, but instead he used an app on his phone that immediately encrypted all of his computers at his work and home. Details: On 31st May 2014, when Peter is chilling at his girlfriend's (in Sweden) there's a knock on the door Peter answers it, only to see someone dressed as a civilian standing at the door Since, it's been 2 years the interpol issued his arrest warrant, he doesn't confirm when the man asks "Peter?" That doesn't work (obviously the officers know what he looks like) and they place him under arrest His girlfriend isn't home, so Peter asks if he could inform her, so that someone can take care of the house After the cops agreed, he did dial a number, but he also opened an app His phone sent a signal to all his computers: "Shut down, immediately"; everything was encrypted (Looks damn pleased with himself) References - Actual article by Guardian: Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde: 'In prison, you become brain-dead' Reddit discussion: TIL when the co-founder of Pirate Bay was arrested he asked to phone his girlfriend so she could watch his house before leaving with the police. The police allowed him to make the call, but instead he used an app on his phone that immediately encrypted all of his computers at his work and home. â€¢ /r/todayilearned
