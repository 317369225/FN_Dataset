What are the goals of the Large Hadron Collider project?
The outreach portion of the project gives the following: fundamental research education (technical students, Ph.D.s, post-docs, associates, &c.) spin-offs ("the world wide web, for example") knowledge transfer investment international relations To flesh out the pure science goals, the CERN site summarizes the project's goal in saying that it seeks to address key unresolved questions in particle physics, and lists areas of inquiry such as: questions about mass (origin, masslessness, &c.) and the Higgs boson. questions about dark matter/energy and supersymmetric particles questions about matter, antimatter and the matter-antimatter imbalance questions about Big Bang conditions and properties of the quark-gluon plasma questions about whether extra hidden dimensions of space exist Sources: http://lhc-machine-outreach.web.... http://public.web.cern.ch/public...
