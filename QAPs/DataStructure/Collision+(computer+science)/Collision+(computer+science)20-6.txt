How do I prepare for a software engineering job interview?This is a follow-up question to What's the best way to prepare for job interviews?
A technical interview will include several coding questions.    Unless you have a unique job your existing work will probably not prepare you for this kind of question - these questions often have more complex edge cases and require more creative use of datastructures and algorithms than your day-to-day coding.  The best way to prepare is to work through a bunch of questions that have these properties.   The CLR algorithms book is a good source (http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/...), as well as Skeina's Algorithm Design Manual (http://www.algorist.com/).   These are worth reading even if you aren't preparing for a job interview.
