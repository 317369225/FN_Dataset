How do I become a game programmer or developer by doing computer science and engineering at an average college of India with self-effort, as there is no typical college in India for gaming?
When i want to do similar thing this was 8 years back.. u might know there is even less help on the internet too.. So i started to DirectX and OpenGL but not went much.. now it is not matter there is no gaming college etc.. Plan like this.. use ur engineering degree to learn and be very good at programming, data structures, Algorithms and Design patterns. And extra you have to learn game specific maths and graphics. For these you can take references of open source game engines like Ogre, cocos2dx etc.. Everything is available in net, it is just one had to do it... release some cool games...
