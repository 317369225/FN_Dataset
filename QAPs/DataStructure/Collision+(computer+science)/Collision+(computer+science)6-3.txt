How do atheists explain how the world was created?answering that it came from something before is not an answer
Well the most obvious response to that is to ask how religious people explain the existence of god, where "he's just always been there" isn't a good enough answer. You're dealing with questions of first causes here and there's millennia of philosophical thought around it. The truth is no one knows the answer to the question "why is there something instead of nothing". It's quite conceivable that some kind of supreme intelligence created everything. But it's just one of a near-infinity of possibilities and we have little or no evidence in any direction. So, in a way, you can believe whatever you want. But using that evidenceless belief to justify pretty much any other action is a bit strange and that's pretty much the position of most atheists - there's probably an explanation, we don't know what it is, it's possible but unbelievably unlikely that it's the judeo Christian god, and in the meantime we'll think about it and look for more evidence. Easy.
