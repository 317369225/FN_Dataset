Can anyone list me all the branches of computer science? Can anyone also recommend TONS of books on each separate branch [from beginner to advanced]?
Sure. How much are you going to pay me for the time that's going to take? And chances are, if you're willing to pay for that information, I'm going to just be honest and point you in the direction of someone way more experienced, educated, and wiser than me like Barry Rountree. Maybe I'm wrong, and I don't intend to be rude, but the only way that I can foresee answering this question fully and robustly is through a lot of internet research via Google search and a lot of writing to fully cover your answer. Even if some of the Ph.D's here happened to know every branch of Computer Science off the top of their head, they'd have to go digging for a lot of textbooks to cover each topic from "beginner to advanced" because it's highly unlikely that they know every branch and, therefore, consider themselves an authority on textbooks for those topics. Unless your branches are very generalized, but the second I start to think of a "general branch", I think of how it really deserves to be split into two branches. And then one of those deserves to be split again... and so on. Here's a list of branches in Computer Scence: Outline of computer science I'd be willing to bet that a lot of Ph.D's in CS will find that list to be unsatisfactory; there's probably a lot missing.
