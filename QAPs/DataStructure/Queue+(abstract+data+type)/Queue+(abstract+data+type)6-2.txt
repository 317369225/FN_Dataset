Software Engineering:Â What are the best data structures to learn about?
Hash tables - for amortized constant time access to data, especially when you know the size/distribution ahead of time. This is one of my favorite efficiency hacks for programs, because it isn't necessarily the first thing I think of for data, but it offend ends up being a good solution one way or another. As a bonus, the same idea underlies linear time sorting (cool stuff) too, but that's an algorithm that applies the idea, and a little tangential to the question because it already seems like Algorithms was well covered. A little more can't hurt I guess.
