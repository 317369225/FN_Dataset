What is the CSE syllabus at the IITs/NITs for the first semester? Which languages must one know before joining?
I'm an undergraduate student pursuing Computer Engineering at Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology, Surat. In the first year, one of the two semesters will have a course titled 'Fundamentals of Computer Programming'. There's lots of theory in this course. For the programming part though, learning C will be enough. However, what you need to remember is that Computer Science is more about learning how to think than about learning programming languages. I'd highly recommend you to take the introductory computer science course by Harvard University at edX titled 'CS50x' (Link attached at end of answer). It is a well designed course aimed at people with little or absolutely no programming experience. By the end of the course, you'll learn how to think algorithmically and solve programming problems efficiently. You'll also be familiar in a number of languages, including C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML among various other things. This, according to me, would be the best way to spend your summer productively and learn something that interests you. Introduction to Computer Science CS50 trailer:
