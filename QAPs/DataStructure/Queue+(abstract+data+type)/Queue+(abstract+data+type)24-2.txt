I have one year left to complete my CS graduation. How should I prepare for Google?
You're getting close to the last couple of times you can apply for an internship at Google. I *strongly* suggest you devote your career efforts towards getting an internship, at any Google office, in any sub-field. It is the number one straightest path to getting hired. CamMi Pham's advice is good as well.
