Why am I not smart enough?
Nonsense! This is definitely not a matter of intelligence but lack of discipline to engage in a thorough self-teaching process. Your colleagues might be smarter, or not, that's irrelevant. Put your ego aside. The difference is that they have been exposed to a great curriculum in their schools AND have practiced and continue to sharpen their skills. Jump, now, to Coursera they are offering 2 Algorithms courses for free (Algorithms Part I and Part II) from Stanford University. Enroll, study, practice, practice some more and use what you learned to solve more programming challenges not part of your course material. Each of these courses is ~6 weeks long, and requires around 3 to 4 hours every week to cover the material (excluding programing assignments). The more hours you invest, the better you will get in a shorter period of time. The lovely thing about these 2 courses is that the material (lectures and exercises) and programing assignments are inspired by real world applications which makes the problem solving challenge more interesting and fun! Go to http://www.quora.com/about/challenges solve their challenges, they will expose you to a LOT of new things to learn and tinker with. As a last note, don't be intimidated by fancy algorithm names and gibberish looking implementations, to really understand an algorithm you have to do the implementation at least once in any language of choice. It's going to take some time! Don't give up. Practice. Other sources of programing challenges HackerRank Interview Cake: Coding Interview Questions and Tips
