What is the stack and queue abstract data type?
When you drop dirty cloths (say 1 by 1) in a bin for laundry,the cloth you drop last lies on top and when you push them in washing machine ,the cloth that was dumped first  is washed first. Bin does clothes like stack and Washing machine does them like queue. You ll expect a smarter bin to find it unusual , if you drop clean clothes in it mistake  and  update its current top position with the latest cloth dropped, so as the washing machine can set its' env(cold/warm/hot etc) as per the type of cloth,before it is pushed. Stack implemented at carnotweat/elem is such a smarter bin  in which data stands for cloth & integer stands for dirty. [won't dropping in foremost in an existing ticket window line will be somewhat inconvenient]
