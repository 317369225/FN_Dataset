What is Queue?
Queue is a widely used data structure. It is based on first in first out ( FIFO) that is the element that enters the queue first , leaves the queue first while deleting the elements in the queue. We use front and rear as variables initialised to -1 and then as and when we start inserting values into queue the values of front and rear keep changing.If the values of front and rear are same one possibility is that queue is full and no more insertions can take place.Front and rear are just variables and one might use them as they wish, but the logic in the algorithm for insertion and deletion must be used correctly. Queues are mostly used in scheduling processes wherein we have waiting queues , ready queues etc for storing different processes before giving them access to a resource. Queues are also used to buffer data that is to store the data while transmitting between sender and receiver.
