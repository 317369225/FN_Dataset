Software Engineering: What are the best data structures to learn about?
Once you have the basics, like lists, queues, hash tables etc. the next class of data structures I'd normally suggest someone spend some time on would be graphs.  Trees, hierarchies, networks, directed acyclic graphs and other variants are commonplace in commercial software development and understanding the terminology, classification and algorithms available for searching graphs can be useful.  Knowing what type of graph to best use in modeling your real-world application can save you a lot of grief later on, as can understanding what you can and cannot do easily or quickly with a particular class of graphs. You've already covered the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for computing network flow.  If you haven't covered graphs more generally then it's probably worthwhile to spend some time learning about how to find unconnected subgraphs, detecting cycles, the convex hull problem, etc.
