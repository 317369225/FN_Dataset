I have one year left to complete my CS graduation. How should I prepare for Google?
Just some thoughts... Seems popular nowadays to engage in and contribute to open source, along with github portfolios. At the very least, that should hone your practical programming skills for the inevitable technical interview. Perhaps, you could also target open source projects that interests Google. Interviewed with, but never worked at Google. One of my interviewers shared with me that he worked on some Linux Kernel optimizations patches during his graduate studies that Google had found useful. When he came looking for a job, it was an easy interview as many of the questions targeted the area he was naturally familiar with.
