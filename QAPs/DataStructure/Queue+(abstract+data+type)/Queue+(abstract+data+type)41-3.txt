What are some good resources for learning about distributed computing? Why?
I'll assume that you mean distributed computing and not distributed databases. If that's the case, you're going to use map-reduce in some form, most likely Hadoop. Don't start by reading a bunch of books and papers that you probably won't understand until you've done some map-reducing yourself. As a general rule, avoid reading as a beginner. It's just an excuse to not code. The only pre-req I would recommend is the actual Google map-reduce paper: http://research.google.com/archi... . You can skip anything past section 2 for now. Start by running a one-node Hadoop "cluster" on your own box. Write a few map-reduce jobs that do trivial things (word frequency counting on web pages for example,) then move on to pipelining jobs into each other. You will want to look into a pipelining library like Cascading and write in a language that doesn't suck at expressing data-processing like Java does (strongly recommend Clojure.) Once you are comfortable with that, hop on EC2, spin up a few machines and start dealing with the shit-show that is multi-node Hadoop. In terms of distributed databases, let me simply pose a question: suppose I'm Amazon and I have a shopping cart that I want to write to a distributed database (I hope you see why Amazon shopping cart data needs to be distributed.) This means that the data needs to be replicated across several machines. Using this scenario, show me why the CAP theorem ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP... ) is true. If you can answer this question, you will have a solid grasp of distributed databases.
