I have a bump in the road of learning object-oriented programming. What are some tips that you can give me from your experience?
Some teach OOD from day one. Some people teach procedural (for, while) followed by OOD. I learned the second way. Initially I did find OOD confusing because it was new, but I got better as time went on. The first explanation that I got was from my favorite Just Java book. The author explained Classes as a rubber stamp that creates Objects. That just made sense to me. The best way to learn programming is repetition. Another way is to find good examples. There is a lot to OOD, each language has wrinkles, like c++ has multiple inheritance, java has interfaces that allow a type of multiple inheritance, etc. Generally like most complicated things the 80/20 rule applies. A book might be covering "anonymous inner classes" and you are thinking "WTF". Maybe you do not need to know that yet, maybe you come back in two months and that same example makes sense, come back in two more yeas and year realize something you did not realize before ! Objects do not have to be a mystical thing. A basic use is they group data with methods to access the data. That makes sense, you would put your hammer with your nails and your screwdriver with your screws. Or maybe you but the screws and nails together and the hammer and screwdriver together. It is all about the design that makes the most sense to solve the problem.
