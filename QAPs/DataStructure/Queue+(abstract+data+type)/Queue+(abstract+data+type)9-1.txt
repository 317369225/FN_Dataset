What is Queue?
A queue is a linear list for which all insertions are made at one end of the list; all deletions (and  usually all accesses) are made at the other end. (FIFO principle) A deque ( "double-ended queue" ) is a linear list for which all insertions and deletions (and usually all accesses) are made at the ends of the list. A deque is therefore more general than a stack or a queue. In some disciplines the word  "queue" has been used in a much broader sense, to describe any kind of list that  is subject to insertions and deletions. Taken from: Donald E.
