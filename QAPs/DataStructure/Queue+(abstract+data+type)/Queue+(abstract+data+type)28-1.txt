Do you think Lisp is jealous of Haskell?
I hope not. I'm not ashamed to say I'm struggling to learn Haskell. While Lisp might have a strange syntax at first, it makes sense after a while. The structure may be different but it's not a radical departure from the usual imperative programming. I've been studying Clojure for the most part and its tutorials make it gentle and accessible. Haskell, is something else. The learning material assume you are good at maths or logic, or, you want to be. But I haven't given up for good... I'll still give Haskell another try. I haven't tried MOOCs for it, so I signed up for FP101x Introduction to Functional Programming (edX course).
