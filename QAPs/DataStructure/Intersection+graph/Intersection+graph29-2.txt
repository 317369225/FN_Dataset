How can you solve 8 x +9 x =10 x   ?Without trial and error or approximation methods, please show details.
Using Wolfram Alpha, compute Unapproximated form This graph shows the intersection of This occurs at approximately This was so, because the intersection of two graphs, or the graphs of two equations gives the common solution of the equations. We can plot the graph for e^x and it is a parabolic sort of graph. The graphs for 9^x and 8^x have a similar nature to the e^x graph - that is parabolic. So you draw the curve for the 8^x+9^x graph and the 10^x graph, and wherever they intersect, you get the solution for 10^x which is 4.42439 Source @8^(x)+9^(x)=10^(x) - Wolfram|Alpha Thanks :)
