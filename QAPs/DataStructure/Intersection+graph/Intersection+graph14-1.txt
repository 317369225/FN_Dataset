What is your favourite area of mathematics? Why?
For me it is number theory. One theorem which has fascinated me the most as a kid is Fermat's theorem. Consider the problem: What is the remainder when N=20142014 2400   is divided by 31. Fermat's theorem renders this problem trivial. The remainder is 1. Here is why: If p is prime and N is a number not divisible by p, then N^{p-1} leaves a remainder 1 when divided by p. Consequently, 20142014 30   leaves a remainder 1 when divided by 31 and hence 20142014 30∗80 =N  also leaves a remainder 1. Firstly, imagine the arduous task of finding an answer to this problem in the absence of such theorem. (20142014 leaves a remainder 12 when divided by 31, so even binomial theorem will not be of much help). Secondly, imagine how big the number 20142014 2400   is. It is HUGE. 20142014>10 7   and hence N>10 10000   , much much greater than the total number of Atoms in the Universe. Here is a theorem which can say (nontrivial) things about a number so large. Thirdly, this theorem can also be used for primality test. If N<p, then this theorem is used to find the probability that a (large) number is prime: Fermat primality test. Number theory is full of such fascinating theorems and unsolved problems which look deceptively simple. List of unsolved problems in mathematics
