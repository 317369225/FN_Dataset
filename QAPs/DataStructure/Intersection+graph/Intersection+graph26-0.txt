If f(f(x))=x 2 −1  , what is f(x)  ?Obviously there are an infinite many solutions, but just one will suffice :P
There's a recent article that's relevant to this question.  Ion Chitescu and Traian Gîdea, Solution of the functional equation f ° f = g for non-injective g, U.P.B. Sci. Bull. 73 (2011), 112–118. The article considers the functional equation f(f(x))=g(x)  where g  is a known continuous function that decreases on the interval (−∞,x 0 ]  and increases on the interval [x 0 ,∞)  , and both limits of g(x)  as x→±∞  are ∞  . Your g(x)  is x 2 −1  , and x 0 =0  . Point 5 on page 115 says that there cannot be a solution if g(x 0 )<x 0   . Since 0 2 −1  is less than 0  , so for g(x)=x 2 −1  there is no solution. The rest of the article is interesting.  A solution is constructed so long as g(x 0 )≥x 0   . An example functional equation which has a solution is the equation f(f(x))=x 2   . A solution to that functional equation is f(x)=|x| 2  √    , graphed below.
