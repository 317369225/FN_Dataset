Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
The logic of this question is just not correct in a few ways. Just counting deaths Heroine led to less than 9000 deaths in 2013, far less than cars or guns. By the straight numbers logic, clearly you'd argue heroine should be legal. I would argue that as a society, if you're choosing freedom over safety, then drug enforcement is kind of a waste of money when guns are legal. At least with drugs, the damage is more focussed on the buyer. Arguing that there is no street safety movement In New York, laws are slowly movie to hold speeding, and careless drivers more accountable, for example. Politicians are being asked why more and more when police say, it's just an accident when drivers kill people. The NYPD is having its reputation demolished through the perception that they back car culture over pedestrians. It's just another way they don't care about people.
