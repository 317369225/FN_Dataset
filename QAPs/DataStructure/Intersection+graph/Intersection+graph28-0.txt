Let f(x)=ax 2 +bx+c  be a quadratic polynomial where a,b,c  are real numbers. How can it be proved that f(f(x))=x  has no real solution?
Or even if you don't want trivial solutions, consider the "logistic map" f(x) = 4x(1-x).  Then f has a fixed point at x=1/2; that is f(1/2) = 1/2.  So you can hit 1/2 with f until the cows come home: in particular, f(f(1/2)) = 1/2. In general, if f is any function, then a point p such that f(p) = p is called a fixed point.  Not all functions have fixed points.  But if a function f DOES have a fixed point p, then f(f(p))=p. Algebraically, finding fixed points (if they exist) of quadratic equations is easy.  You're solving f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = x, or ax^2 + (b-1)x + c = 0.  So you just use the quadratic equation with b-1, and off you go. Graphically, a fixed point of a function f is any point where the graph of the function f intersects the graph of the function g(x) = x.  So if you have graphs, you can find fixed points by visual inspection.
