Why does the sine of an angle has more than one solution? For example: sinβ=0.5 My textbook says there are two solutions for β, 30 degrees and 150, but my calculator with the function arcsin only gives me 30, why so?
The graph of the sine function looks like this: Where does sin(x) equal o.5? Imagine a line on that same graph for y=0.5. Where does it intersect the graph of sin(x)? Lots of places! That's why there are lots of answers. The graph of sine is a repeating pattern. The two answers your book gives, 30° and 150°, are the two places where y=0.5 intersects y=sin(x) in just one time through that repeating pattern - one period of the wave. Every time you add or subtract 360°, you get another intersection on a different period of the wave. Or consider your angles again. Two supplementary angles always raise a line segment the same distance away from the 180° straight line. See that big point that is x=0.5 away from the line? What angles raise that line segment exactly that high off of the line? α=30 ∘   and β=150 ∘   . So why does your calculator give only one answer? Look back to the graph of sine. Arcsin (also called inverse sine and written sin −1   ) looks for the answer that is closest to zero. There is one y value for any sine of x somewhere between that low point (trough, rhymes with cough) at x = -90° and that high point (peak, crest) at x = 90°, so that's the range arcsin looks through. Your calculator gives the answer from within that range, because that's the only answer the arcsin function is supposed to give. But there are lots more places where y=0.5 besides merely x=30°. (Side note: this graph of sine is in radians rather than degrees. You don't need to know the difference to understand the rest of this answer, but if the graph looks weird to you that might be why. A complete circle is 360 degrees or 2π  radians.)
