What are the major differences between grid cells and place cells?... and why do we need both?
Both of these neuron types are found in the hippocampus of rats and mice (the only animals in which they have been studied). Collectively, they help the animal (and possibly humans) map out space for purposes of learning and navigation. Place cells were discovered first. They fire when the animal is near a familiar location in their environment, for example a particular corner in a maze. A fascinating dynamic property of place cells is that they exhibit "phase precession": There is a dominant aggregate theta (4-8Hz) oscillation frequency in the hippocampus, and the firing of the place cells occurs sooner or later relative to this dominant oscillation depending on the animal's physical distance from the location. Grid cells, in contrast, do not represent particular locations in the environment. Instead, they "tile" the environment, and are re-used over and over, like the intersections on graph paper (hence the name "grid"). Grid cells have different periodic spacings, and it is believed that collectively, they form a universal, flexible code for mapping otherwise undifferentiated navigable space. A working model is that grid cells map out space according to its sensed structure, and that the place cells layer on top of them to add meaningful locations, such as where food is stored or places to turn for navigation. So the grid cells are like graph paper and place cells are like the markings on the graph paper that form the territory map.
