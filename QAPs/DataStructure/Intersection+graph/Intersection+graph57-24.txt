What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
African prehistory.  I find it endlessly fascinating, especially the cattle based semi-nomadic cultures.  I am fascinated by the people of the tassali n'ajjer who lived in the Green Sahara.  I think its because its so hard to ferret out the information about these places.  Also because their art is superlative.
