What are some of the best stories about life at IIM Ahmedabad?
At the Golden Jilubilee celebration at IIMA, one of the senior alums recounts an incident to show the tradition of importance placed on academics at the institute: One fine day we find the following notice on the notice board - Due to the death (read, assassination) of our prime minister today, the institute will remain closed today. However, the classes will continue as per schedule. Another incident from my own class: Course: Strategic Marketing So there was a case to be solved and as per the ritual, 2 groups would prepare presentation on the case and present it to the class and one of the groups was mine. So it was a marketing case full of numbers and calculations and I had done all of them and we went for the presentation. I had two solutions, the other solution without any basis / calculations but on the basis of but feeling. So as soon as I had completed the presentation with the solution, the prof. stopped and started discussing the case with the class. Discussing my solution, he asked the class what they had to think of it. The class agreed to the solution (based on all the NPV, IRR and financial projections). The prof. starts laughing and says this is all ra dom stuff. You can't do business with all this... And then he asks if there was any Gujarati in the class (the case was related to a business organization in Ahmedabad). I (still standing in front of the class) raise my hand and the prof. again asks me what the solution may be. So II just talked about the other solution which actually contradicted the one already presented... And the prof. was happy!
