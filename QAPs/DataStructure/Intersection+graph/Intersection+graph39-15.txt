Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
Consider this in addition: Car accidents are a major contributor to fatality stats in almost every country. The US is much safer than Russia, Portugal, India quite a bit safer than most European countries. Gun related deaths in the US are disproportionately higher than in any other 'civilized' country, and rank - per capita - with much more backward and poorly governed nations. Another challenge the gun culture faces is to the myth that guns keep us safer. I won't comment beyond this as I respect Quora's factual, scientific preferences as opposed to political or belief based discussion forums.
