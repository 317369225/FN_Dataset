What does e x   mean?
Since e x   is a fundamental mathematical entity, we should try for a mathematical description of it that is yet elementary. I like to pay attention to mathematical entities and see what they tell us. There is a natural relation {(x,y)}  between numbers added and numbers multiplied. To describe it, you need limits. Approximately, the sum b 1 +⋯+b n   corresponds to the product (1+b 1 )⋯(1+b n )  . In the limit wherein the b i   are required to diminish to zero, the limiting sum corresponds to the limiting product. You might say that on the microscopic level, b  corresponds to 1+b  : if you add b  here, multiply by 1+b  there. The to-and-fro of the relation are called x↦e x   and y↦lny  . A formula for e x   is the limit of the products (1+x/n)⋯(1+x/n)=(1+x/n) n   , whose corresponding sums are always x  . (So x  is the limit of the sums). We may think of x  as a "seed" of the number y=e x   that encodes the multiplicative aspect of y  in additive way. The series representation for e x   e x =1+x+12 x 2 +13! x 3 +⋯   (which arises from the products above via the binomial expansion) shows the seed x  "embedded" in e x   . The operation x↦e x   "develops" the seed in such a way that any partitioning of the seed into a sum factors the development into a corresponding product—and (this is what makes it natural) a tiny summand b  of x  will correspond very nearly to the factor 1+b  . Call this the (mathematical) law of natural growth: add here and multiply there in the simplest way possible on a microscopic level.
