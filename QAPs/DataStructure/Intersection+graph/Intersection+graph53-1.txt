Which are the top blogs to follow to explore about algorithms and data structures?
Here is a website and youtube channel that explain various algorithms and data structures with videos, java code and algorithm visualization techniques which makes it very easy to understand the solutions. This also has a learn together feature with which you can learn within a group. Website: IDeserve Youtube channel: IDeserve The videos are of 4-10 minutes duration and provide a clear explanation of the algorithms with examples and animations. Some Dynamic Programming Problems: 0-1 Knapsack Problem To print maximum number of As using given four keys. Longest Common Subsequence Longest Common Substring Palindrome Min Cut Shortest Palindrome Total number of possible Binary Search Trees with n keys Gold Mine Problem Some Trees and Graphs Problems: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal Create a balanced Binary Search Tree from a sorted array Diagonal Sum of a Binary Tree. Recover a Binary Search Tree if positions of two nodes are swapped. Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm Topological Sorting of a Directed Acyclic Graph. Some Arrays and Strings Problems: Buy and sell stocks Find a Peak Element in an array Find Majority Element in an Array Search a sorted matrix The Skyline Problem Find median of two sorted arrays Some Linked Lists and Stack Problems: Reverse a Linked List - Recursive Reverse a Linked List - Iterative Find intersection of two Linked Lists Find intersection of two Linked Lists - O(m + n) Time Complexity and O(1) Space Complexity Detect a loop in a linked list and find the node where the loop starts. Minimum Stack O(1) Hope this will help you too.
