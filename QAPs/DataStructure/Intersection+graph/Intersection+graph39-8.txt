Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
It's not between Gun culture and Car culture , not even culture relevant at all，but a killing weapon versus communication media. There is Gun Culture as well as Car Culture in the US, and many Americans are proud of their cultural diversity, but as to security concerns, people don't feel threatened by car accidents that much as they do facing a campus massacre, why? Because the latter is a terrorist attack conducted deliberately by a terrorist , while the other one is an accident caused by a careless normal guy just like ourselves. So the number of victims may not worry us most, but the contingency and horror does. We know exactly that if we drive carefully and fasten our safety belt then we are more unlikely to encounter traffic accidents，in which circumstances we feel that  we could take control of our prospect, even though we ourselves is not the only traffic factor on the road, but our prospective counterpart in an possible car accident is doing his best averting this tragedy as much as we do, so we are allies in this scenario. But in a terrorist attack, using heavy weapons differs from any car "accident", we have a deliberate killer here, he or she is an enemy, conceiving his or her plan long before his final act, we don't know their horrible idea in advance, which is even worse that we can do nothing to stop it, anyway you can't suspect someone you dislike with a crime attempt from hostile look in their eyes, can you? Finally, guns are born to kill, while cars are a certain kind of vehicle, yes it can kill as well, but you can't deny that knifes can do the same thing if you wish, it's even handy by your table at breakfast, available to everyone with a much cheaper price, shall we tolerate the knifes?
