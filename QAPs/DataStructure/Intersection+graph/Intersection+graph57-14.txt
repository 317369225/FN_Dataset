What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
Lucid Dreaming Dream: Your subconscious mind creates a dreamscape (based on your day-to-day emotion, or perhaps random neuron firing), and it also creates you in the dreamscape and you behave the way your subconscious wants. In this movie subconscious is in-charge of building the set and making the actors act. Lucid Dream: You realize that you are dreaming, and you suddenly realize you are in control, there's no more a director-in-charge for this movie. It gets so real. You gain full awareness of your 5 senses, within the dreamscape. On top of it, you can actively imagine anything (any damn thing) and it will manifest in your dream, right in front of you. In this scenario, you have your subconscious and conscious working simultaneously, subconscious making the dreamscape, and the conscious (that is your active state of mind) altering it the way it wants. That's how incredible mind is on a whole! Also you can fly in a lucid dream. The visuals are stunning (the colors are extremely vivid), you can see places where no one has every been to. The clouds, the mountains, the fields, everything will startle you with its beauty. You can meet people no one has ever met. And have the weirdest (or the most meaningful and deep) conversations with those dream characters. You can ask them anything, and they will respond. Here 'they' is 'you' for most of the part, the otherwise neglected 'you'.
