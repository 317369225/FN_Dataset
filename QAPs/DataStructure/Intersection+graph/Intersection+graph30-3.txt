What is the difference between PeopleRank and the "reputation graph"?PeopleRank: http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21... Reputation Graph: http://jonbischke.com/2011/01/07...
After having tried the tools that Jon Bischke proposes as current best examples of reputation graph, I can't help but not seeing a big deal of difference, as all of them rank people one way or the other. However, a difference in place is is that Reputation graph tools are more holistic and incorporate a clear offline element to it. Ranking coworkers, everything, including affinity, will play a key role. This is not true for PeopleRank as I don't usually know the person I upvote. It's solely based on attributed expertise. Which is the way to go? Which is a better predictor of social influence? Jon Bischke says PeopleRank and I differ. Partially. I would like to address you to Dr.Germaine's studies on attributed expertise where she scientifically proves: “it is a well established fact that 80 percent of speakers attributed expertise is based on delivery skills such as extroversion, self/assurance or ambition, whereas only 20 percent will be based on actual content.” More on attributed expertise can be found here http://digitalinfluentia.co.uk/h...
