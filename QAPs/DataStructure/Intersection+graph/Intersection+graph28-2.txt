Let f(x)=ax 2 +bx+c  be a quadratic polynomial where a,b,c  are real numbers. How can it be proved that f(f(x))=x  has no real solution?
The fixed-point idea is interesting, and it suggests a related question: are there solutions to f(f(x))=x  which are not fixed points of a quadratic polynomial f(x)  ? If so, then there must be numbers u  and v  satisfying f(u)=v  and f(v)=u  , since it is these numbers that yield f(f(u))=f(v)=u  .  Because we are looking at quadratic polynomials, we can take f(x)=(x−u) 2 +v  in order to get f(u)=v  . Then f(v)=(v−u) 2 +v=u  implies (v−u) 2 +(v−u)=0  , so (v−u)(v−u+1)=0  .  The first factor gives v=u  , which is the fixed-point solution. But the second factor gives v=u−1  , which is not a fixed point solution. Thus, every quadratic polynomial of the form f(x)=(x−u) 2 +(u−1)  =x 2 −2ux+(u 2 +u−1)  has a non-fixed-point solution to f(f(x))=x  . And, for completeness, we consider the function g(x)=f(x)−x  .  Since g(u)=f(u)−u=(u−1)−u=−1<0  and g(u−1)=f(u−1)−(u−1)=u−(u−1)=1>0  , the Intermediate Value Theorem says that there must be a point between u−1  and u  where g(x)=0  .  So these quadratic polynomials must have a fixed-point solution in addition to the non-fixed-point solutions.
