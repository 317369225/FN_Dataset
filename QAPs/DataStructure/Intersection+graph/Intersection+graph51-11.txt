I am the programming karate kid. You are the programming Mr. Miyagi. How do you train me?We have one year until the grand hackathon that will either bring glory to our names or shame to our families. I am a headstrong novice who is impatient and thinks he knows best when he does not. How can I be trained to perfection in the little time we have before the ultimate showdown? What are our daily practices and goals? How I wax on wax off?
First, you learn the Data - I would make you write console applications until you had a very good understanding of managing and transforming data. Since there is no UI at this layer, your achievements would be successful input and output. Second, I would make you purposefully inherit from shitty code and ask you to extend it. This my Little Bird would teach you that laziness leads to complexity; If you do not mark the road after traveling it once, how will others know where the road leads. Third, I would make you master regular expressions, so that you know how to pull a pebble from a great waterfall. Forth, the loops. Multiple loop recursion, this would teach you to visualize yourself as the Data. ...and so on...
