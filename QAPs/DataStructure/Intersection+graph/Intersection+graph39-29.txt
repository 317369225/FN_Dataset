Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
Because cars have utility, and handguns have very little.  If we didn't have cars, we would be wasting much more time in traveling.  That equates to lives.   As a rough calculation, we currently spend about 15 hours a week, 5 years during our lives in a car.  That is about 1/15th of a life.  If we had to take trains or buses, that travel time would perhaps double or triple.  That's 5 to ten years off each life.   So looked at a that way,  overall, cars EXTEND our useful lives.  They might kill 35,000 a year but in that same amount of time, they've freed up lets see, say 500 to 1,000 hours per person.   I can't do the math, but I think that is a net positive gain.
