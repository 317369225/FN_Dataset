In graph theory, is there a method to compute the minimum number of dimensions the layout space must have so that no two edges ever intersect each other, assuming all edges are undirected segments and the layout space is euclidian?Does such a metric provide insights about the structure of the network? Does it have any known applications?
This all boils down to planarity testing, because you can draw each graph in 3D Euclidian space with straight edges. Here's a simple argument: If you pick four random points A,B,C,D  in [0,1] 3   , the probability that the line segments AB  and CD  intersect is obviously zero. Hence, if you pick n  random points in [0,1] 3   , for any finite n  , and draw all possible line segments, the expected number of intersections (other than the n  vertices) is still zero, and therefore there exist configurations of n  points in [0,1] 3   with no intersections. The above argument is, of course, overkill, and there are simple explicit constructions. I'm too lazy to check now, but my guess would be that you can draw K n   by placing its vertices onto  the points (1,1 2 ,1 3 )  through (n,n 2 ,n 3 )  .
