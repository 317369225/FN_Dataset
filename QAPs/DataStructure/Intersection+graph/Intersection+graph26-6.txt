If f(f(x))=x 2 −1  , what is f(x)  ?Obviously there are an infinite many solutions, but just one will suffice :P
Alon Amit proved that the solution of f(x)  does not exist, and some general conditions of the existence for f(f(x))  to be quadratic polynomial are given by Joseph Heavner's, David Joyce's reference and derived by Gram Zeppi. Now I am more curious about how does the solution look like, if it does exist. In general, want to know if f(f(x))=x 2 +px+q  and the solution of f(x)  exists, what will it be. I will give a partial answer of the form f(f(x))=x 2 +2ax+a 2 −a  , if f(x)=(x+a) 2  √  +b  , f(f(x))=((x+a) 2  √  +b+a) 2  √  +b  , if b=−a  , f(f(x))=x 2 +2ax+a 2 −a  and f(x)=(x+a) 2  √  −a  . For example if f(f(x))=x 2 +2x  , then f(x)=(x+1) 2  √  −1  is a feasible solution. As shown in John Chase's reference, when a solution exists, there will be infinite number of solutions. With the analysis shown there and Alon Amit's approach, it can be shown that the condition given by Joseph Heavner's and David Joyce's reference are both tight, correct and equivalent. We can derive the criteria here, let g(x)=f(f(x))=x 2 +px+q  , with g ′ (x)=0  , x=−p2   . The discriminator is g(−p2 )=−p2   , or p 2 −2p−4q=0  . If g(−p2 )<−p2   or p 2 −2p−4q>0  , there is no feasible solution for f(x)  . If p 2 −2p−4q≤0  , there are infinite feasible solutions for f(x)  . If p 2 −2p−4q=0  , an explicit feasible solution can be shown as above. (Notice that when  f(f(x))=x 2 +2ax+a 2 −a  , this discriminator condition is satisfied.) Note that Gram Zeppi's discriminator is a sufficient (as described in his derivation) but not necessary condition because (p−1) 2 −4(q+1)>0  implies p 2 −2p−4q>0  but not the other way around.
