What does Einstein's theory of relativity teach us?Short words to explain Please!
Originally Answered: What is the theory of relativity?Classical physics, built upon the work of people like Isaac Newton, seemed to cover all the bases for everyday life.  But people like Einstein realized that it didn't work so well at the extremes – when things are really, really small, really, really big, or moving really, really fast.  The Theory of Relativity was about trying to find models that fit not just the realms that Newton's laws fit, but also those extremes. The Theory of Relativity is really the combination of two theories that Einstein worked on over several years.  The first, in 1905, was Special Relativity, and the second, in 1915, was General Relativity. Special Relativity essentially states two postulates: 1) Principle of Relativity: The laws of physics are the same for all inertial reference frames. 2) Principle of Constancy of the Speed of Light: Light always propagates through a vacuum at a definite velocity, which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body. A result of Special Relativity is that we have to account for relativistic effects for objects that are either moving really, really fast or are really, really small.  These effects introduce things like time dilation and length contraction. General Relativity began with the Principle of Equivalence, by which Einstein realized that he could compose the equations of a scenario to neglect gravity and that Special Relativity could cover that scenario and he now needed to think about gravity.  The result of that thinking revised Newton's theory of gravitation by defining gravity as the curvature of space-time, rather than as a force.  This allows us to explain the effects involving the really, really big.
