What are some of the best stories about life at IIM Ahmedabad?
There is a Technology Strategy course if you opt for it in your second year. Prof. Mehta was showing us a video of the founder of the Indian company Su-Kam (inverters). There were two exchange students (1 french and 1 italian) in my group of three. The founder was speaking in Hindi so Prof. Mehta asked me to help the exchange students since the video didn't have English subtitles. I was happily doing that. There came a section in the video which when translated, made a very funny double meaning. Professor heard that translation, he burst out laughing and sat on the teachers table with an impact on the glass top. The glass was probably weak and due to the impact of sitting, it smashed into pieces with professor crashing into the broken table ! Just like we see in desi action movies. ! The whole class burst out laughing and by God's grace nothing untoward happened to professor. Within 5 minutes a new glass was brought and then professor did something even after the accident ( visibly shaken due to the crash! ) that i will probably remember all my life. He proposed to the assistant to help clean the broken glass and then even asked if he needed to pay for breaking institute property due to negligent use. !! My respect for him increased several fold and because of that I took it up on myself to do the exam, quizzes and final project to utter perfection. We did the best group project in years (Processors, Comparison of Intel and AMD from a business perspective) and professor discussed that in the last class. I managed to get an A+ in the subject in the final results. The main motivation was respect for the professor. One must always be grateful to the teachers who give us real lessons on life and how to be a true professional :)
