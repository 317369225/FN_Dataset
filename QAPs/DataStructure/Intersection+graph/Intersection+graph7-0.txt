How do I verify that two graphs f(x) and g(x) intersect at x=0 and x =3.193? What's the area between them?f(x)=2sin(0.5x)  g(x)=0.5e 2x−5  
This looks like a very specific and basic problem. Is it homework? Kind of looks like it... I'll answer it as such, and suggest some ideas. What would it mean for two functions (or, rather, the curves represented by two functions) to intersect? What does the difference between the two functions represent? If you define h(x)=f(x)−g(x)  , what does it mean if h(x)=0  ? Taking precautions about the sign of the integrand on the interval, area between two curves can be found by integrating the difference between them (that is, either h(x)  or −h(x)  ). That said, your functions as written don't intersect at either of the points you've asked about. If you modify g  so that instead g(x)=12 (e 2x−5 −1)  then they will intersect at zero and near about 3.303.
