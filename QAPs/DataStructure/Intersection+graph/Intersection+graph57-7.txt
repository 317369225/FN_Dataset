What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
Without a doubt : Inner Peace ! "Inner Peace" -- such a, such a, soothing concept. What a beautiful thing to experience ! During the entire life span, there are lot of mini dreams that we set for ourselves. While some are achieved, many of them remain far from the golden touch of reality. However at the end of the day, what most of us crave for is : Inner Peace ! Dreams accomplished or not, inner-peace will keep us happy & act as a catalyst to live a life, well, worth calling a life. Experiencing Inner Peace is not a dream, it is the dream. Why does it fascinate me ? Simply because I don't have it! The mind is constantly cluttered with lots of thoughts, resulting into poor concentration & mediocre productivity. Come inner-peace, and then you realise how beautiful every moment is. In true sense, one can live each and every moment, enjoy it, feel it ! What is inner-peace ?>Inner-Peace(IP) is something which is un-affected by "outer" things i.e outer conditions, outer people etc. Irrespective of the various conditions one is thrown at on daily basis, IP is something that remains "un-disturbed", like a still water in a distant lake. >IP is not "absence" of conflicts, but the ability to cope with them & remain stable ! It is the wisdom that nothing in this world is going to last forever, hence one must not feel "hopeless" when things are bad or must not feel "overwhelmed" when things are good !
