Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
You said, "Look at speeding. If we really wanted to make driving a lot safer, we'd make it so cars could not exceed, say, 75 mph." That sounds good but if you look at statistics you will find that speed is only a component in automobile fatalities as a secondary issue.Â  The primary reasons for automobile fatalities are drug/alcohol impairment and distracted drivers.
