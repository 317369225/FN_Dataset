What does Einstein's theory of relativity teach us?Short words to explain Please!
T= 2L/c÷√[1-(v^2/c^2) Maybe travelling with the speed of light can make human immortal. •Thus, time travels slower for an object with higher speed! •Human can travelled entire universe in lifetime, if he travels with the acceleration of 1g all the way. •matter deterimes the space curve that further determines the movement of objects. •Due to natural curvature of earth, the shortest distance between any two objects is never a straight line. •no physical object can travel at or faster than speed of light, it is a speed barrier. •One second is exactly 9,192,631,770 beats of a Caesium atom, very close to 1/(24 x 60 x 60) of an 'earth rotation' day. An earth rotation day is the varying time it takes for the earth to rotate once relative to the sun. •The speed of light in a vacuum is exactly 299,792,458 m/s. Light reaches all objects from all directions at the same speed, regardless of their motion. Even if you travel at 240,000 metres/second, light approaches you head-on at the same speed it reaches you from behind. So, regardless of the speed of light sources and receivers, light always travels at the same speed. It also follows that light has no concept of time, because (to light) all distances are zero, and therefore it would perceive that it reaches its destination instantaneously. It was this thinking which led Einstein to his theories of relativity. •The above 2 exact definitions of a second and of the speed of light define the exact length of a one metre: it is the distance travelled by light in a second, divided by the speed of light in metres per second.
