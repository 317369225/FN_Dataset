Facebook Graph Search: Has Graph Search been removed from Facebook?With the new Search that lets you find search through posts etc, has Facebook discontinued Graph Search capability? I can no longer search for strings like "Friends of X who are friends with me and from India".
I found this. It might help. While there is a method for reverting settings, you can only turn off Facebook Graph Search until the system forces all users into Graph Search, so the “old Facebook” will only be available for a limited time. Meanwhile, click the gear icon at the top of your Facebook page, click “Account Settings,” then open the “General” tab and select “Language Settings.” Here’s where it gets tricky. If your language is defaulted to English (US), select another version of English, like English (UK). The reason this turns off Graph Search is that the updates are currently only available in the US, so changing your language will switch Graph Search off, but again, this only lasts until Facebook rolls out the new options to all users. After you’ve altered your language, hit “Save Changes” and Graph Search will be gone immediately. Thanks
