Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
Driving  is strongly regulated. We have driver's tests, mandatory insurance in  many states, DUI laws, speeding tickets, airbags, annual vehicle  inspection, seat belt laws... What is done for gun ownership? The primary purpose of a car is not to kill, but to move. The primary purpose of a gun is to kill. The death by car is most often an accident and not  intentional. It is easier to enact laws when it comes to driving where new evidence  proves the increase of a certain risk. For instance, the no texting while driving rule enacted in most states now. When it comes to gunning, people are notoriously inflexible and impervious to facts. For most politicians it is a suicide to talk against NRA. Updated 26 Dec 2012 • View Upvotes
