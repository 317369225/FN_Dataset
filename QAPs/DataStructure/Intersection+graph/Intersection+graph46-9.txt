What is the key feature missing in geolocation apps such as foursquare, Gowalla, SCVNGR, PlacePoP, etc?
Can I check in to my friend's place? If I am checked in, can I invite my friends closeby to qualify for a special going on? If my friends check in through my invite, can I gain more points etc.? Can I request a public checkin for people with common interest to find me, say at a bar drinking jeiger. OR Can I tag things I tried at a place last time I checked in, say I tried creme brulle at this place 6 months ago, but wanna try something else. Can I gain insider info on a place if something changed since my last checkin? (Kind of like a Geo wiki), say the place had their head chef changed.
