What is an equation of a line parallel to 3x-5y=30 and passes through the intersection of the lines y=6x-5 and y=-2x+11? Don't use algebraic method, solve it by graphing linear equations on graph. (I'im in grade 9)
Firstly, condense all your equations 3x - 5y = 30 -5y = 30 - 3x y = 0.6x - 6   - equation 1 y= 6x - 5   - eq2 y = -2x + 11 - eq3 Find the intercepts of the graphs and then simply plot the graph! y intercept; x=0 Substitute X= 0 X intercept, y=0 Let the equation of X = 0. Now you have two points on the graph. All you need to do now is draw a line connecting all these points for the three graphs. After that, get two rulers. One ruler will line the graph 5y-3x=30 (ruler A) The other will line the side of the ruler. (Ruler B) Slide ruler A down along ruler B until ruler A intersects with the point of eq2 and eq3. Draw the line and that is your answer
