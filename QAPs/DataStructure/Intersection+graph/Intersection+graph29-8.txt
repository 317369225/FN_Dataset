How can you solve 8 x +9 x =10 x   ?Without trial and error or approximation methods, please show details.
The dignity of a professional mathematicians (no matter however small it is ) doesn't allow (him/her) to use or explain a mature formula for The A new Pythagoras theorem , which is a direct solution  it states that for any given acute triangle with known three integer distinct sides say (S,M,L), there exists a real positive number say (P),  where (S^P + M^P = L^P) , where, L  is the longest side, & P is given in terms of the sides of the triangle &  P is greater than two & irrational number ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   The formula is:    Assume (L>M>S), there exists an irrational positive number say (P), such that the following equation holds true always S^P + M^P = L^P SOLUTION: for obtaining (P) from the given three distinct positive integers Let, x = Ln (S / M) / Ln (S / L), Where Ln is the natural logarithm to the base (e=2.718281828...) Let, f (x) be a series function of x defined as below: f (x) = (1-x)*{1+(3x/2-1)+(2x-1)*(4x/3-1) +(5x/2-1)*(5x/3-1)*(5x/4-1) +(3x-1)*(2x-1)*(3x/2-1)*(6x/5-1) +(7x/2-1)*(7x/3-1)*(7x/4-1)*(7x/5-1)*(7x/6-1) +...}. Note that the general nTH Term of the series will be: (1-x)*(n*x/2 -1)*(n*x/3 -1)*(n*x/4 -1)*...(n*x/(n-1) -1) Also note that the series is absolutely convergent the unknown (P) can be obtained then from my following formula. P = Ln (f (x))/Ln (S/L)   Substitute in the above formula (L=10, M=9, S=8) which forms an acute triangle, & P is your desired x in question, now you can solve any question of this type See link: Where can I find the proof of the new Pythagoras Theorem?
