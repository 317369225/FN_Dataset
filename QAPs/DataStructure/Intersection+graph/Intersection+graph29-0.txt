How can you solve 8 x +9 x =10 x   ?Without trial and error or approximation methods, please show details.
How about using Binary Search? If you are unfamiliar with the technique, then let me illustrate it for you. Consider the function f(x)=8 x +9 x −10 x   . Now, we want to find a solution for f(x) = 0. Clearly, our function is continuous since it is defined for every real value of x. [Almost there now] Now, we check the value of f(x) for x = 0. f(0)=1>0   Also, f(5)=−8183<0  Now, the continuity of the function comes handy. Since f(0) > 0 and f(5) < 0, there must be a value of x satisfying 0≤x≤5  such that f(x) = 0. Now take the average of the 2 end points (which are 0 and 5 in our case). The average comes out to be 2.5. Again, f(2.5) > 0 and f(5) < 0. Take the average of 2.5 and 5, which comes out to be 3.75. Again, f(3.75) > 0. Continue until −epsilon≤f(x)≤epsilon  where epsilon is set to be around 0.0001 etc. In some 6 iterations, we get to a reasonably well approximation for our solution. :) Python code: def diff(x): return 8**x + 9**x - 10**x eps = 0.000001 s = 0.0 e = 10 iters = int(raw_input()) m = -1 while iters > 0: iters-=1 m = (s+e)/2 v = diff(m) if v > eps: s = m elif v < -eps: e = m else: break print m P.S: The solution is mainly to give an idea about a technique which can be used to solve such problems. Although, in some cases [especially here as well], the calculations can't be done without a calculator. Edit: Please go through the comment of Shreyas Basarge. The corresponding part which attempted at proving that the function is decreasing has been removed. Updated 22 Sep • View Upvotes
