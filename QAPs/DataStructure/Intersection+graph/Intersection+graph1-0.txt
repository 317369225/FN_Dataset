Given the equation of a line 5x + 3y=15, at what point does the graph of the line intersect the y-axis?
First of all, we know that any point (x,y) on the y-axis has zero (0) as its x-coordinate; therefore, the x-coordinate of the point of intersection of the line whose equation is 5x + 3y = 15 and the y-axis is 0. We also know that the coordinates (x, y) of any point on the given line has to satisfy its equation:Â  5x + 3y = 15. Therefore, we can find the y-coordinate of the point of intersection of the line whose equation is 5x + 3y = 15 and the y-axis as follows: 5x + 3y = 15 5(0) + 3y = 15 0 + 3y = 15 3y/3 = 15/3 y = 5 Therefore, the line whose equation is 5x + 3y = 15 intersects the y-axis at the point (0, 5).
