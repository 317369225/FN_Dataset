Why are there no solutions to the equation x 2 +6x+9 − − − − − − − − −  √ =x  ? Wouldn't x=−3/2  be a solution?
Note that                               x 2 +6x+9 − − − − − − − − −  √ =(x+3) 2  − − − − − − −  √ =|x+3|  and, therefore, the equation x 2 +6x+9 − − − − − − − − −  √ =x  can be written in the form |x+3|=x  . Hence, For x≥−3  , we have the equation x+3=x  , which has no solutions. For x≤−3  , we have the equation −x−3=x  , whose solution set is the singleton {−3/2}  . However, −3/2>−3  , so this solution does not count, as {−3/2}∩(−∞,−3]=∅  .We conclude that the solution set of equation |x+3|=x  is empty.
