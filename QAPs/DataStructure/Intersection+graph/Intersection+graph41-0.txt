What are some common mistakes to be avoided in Mathematics?Especially in Algebra, Coordinate Geometry, Calculus and Trigonometry.
I taught Algebra 1 to freshman for years. (Not that these mistakes are exclusive to beginners, but they are typical for those who struggle with algebra.) Here are some common ones for algebra. Improperly doing operations with negative numbers Addition, multiplication, ect. Simply not understanding how to work with negative numbers. Undoing multiplication of positives by division by negatives 2x=8  2x−2 =8−2 =−4  Ignoring order of operations 2 + 5(x + 7) = 7(x + 7) Failing to distribute a negative to all terms x + 5 - (2x + 4) = -x + 9 Changing a sum of two terms (one being variable) into a product 5 + 2x = 7x Doing balancing operations on the same side 4 + 5x + 6x = 3 (subtract 5x from both 5x and 6x) 4 + x = 3 Not distributing division to all terms 2x + 5 = 8 becomes x + 5 = 4 "Distributing" division to multiple factors. (2)(4)(8)2 =(1)(2)(4)  "Distributing" exponents to multiple terms. (x+y) 2 =x 2 +y 2   (This one makes Pythagorus very, very, angry.) Not substituting numbers (especially negatives) and expressions correctly into equations: a = 1, b = -9, c = 5 b 2 −4(a)(c) − − − − − − − − − −  √ =  −9 2 −4∗1∗5 − − − − − − − − − − − −  √ =  −101 − − − −  √   and y = 2x +4 x = 3y + 2 y = 2*3*y + 2 + 4 Thinking that x 0 =0  Thinking that x −1 =−x  Using exponents to multiply (not in the right way) 7 2 =14  Forgetting that x=x 1   (2x)(4x 5 )=8x 5   Mixing "normal rules" and exponent rules example 1: (2x 3 )(3x 4 )=5x 7   example 2: (2x 3 )(3x 4 )=6x 12   I'm sure there are many I am forgetting, but this was quite cathartic. The ghosts of a thousand failing tests can now find rest. Updated 27 Apr • View Upvotes
