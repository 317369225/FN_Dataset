Facebook Graph Search: Has Graph Search been removed from Facebook?With the new Search that lets you find search through posts etc, has Facebook discontinued Graph Search capability? I can no longer search for strings like "Friends of X who are friends with me and from India".

With graph search gone, there is a huge void for me at-least.
