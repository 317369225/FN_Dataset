Let f(x)=ax 2 +bx+c  be a quadratic polynomial where a,b,c  are real numbers. How can it be proved that f(f(x))=x  has no real solution?
EDIT<< For f(x) =ax^2+bx+c   [definition] We cannot prove f(f(x)) =x has no solutions We can find  the circumstances in which there are no solutions. If f(x)=x    [equation to be solved] Then by applying f() to both sides of the equation Then f(f(x)) =f(x) , thus f(f(x))=x. Conversely, if there is no solution to f(f(x)) = x there can be no solution to f(x). >> So the cases where f(x) =x has no real solution will be what you ask for. I.e. When f(x)-x =0 has no real solutions in which case ax^2+(b-1)x +c =0 has no real solutions Which ( using the quadratic formula) is when 4ac> (b-1)^2 EDIT note that for the non-stationary functional form from Kevin Coombes 4ac = 4u^2+4u-4 (b-1)^2 = 4u^2+4u+1 This solution is outside the exclusion range described above. I.e. The non-stationary form is consistent with my work. Updated 5 May • View Upvotes
