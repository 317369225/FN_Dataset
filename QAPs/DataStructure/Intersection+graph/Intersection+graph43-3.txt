If you put 5 points on a plane, is it possible to connect each pair with a continuous curve without any two curves intersecting?If so, provide an example.  If not, provide proof. I believe it's not possible, but I have no clue how to prove it.
Utility Graph -- from Wolfram MathWorld is a variation in name and problem definition but is at the core, the same problem.  Note that as your question is stated, the curve not required to lie in the same plane as the points.  Thus a line might cross through the plane only at the target points  and reach the last point without ever intersecting itself.
