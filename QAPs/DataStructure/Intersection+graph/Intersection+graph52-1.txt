Rockets: What's the reason behind Aestus engine chosen propellant mixture ratio?Aestus is the engine that powers the second stage of the Ariane 5G. The rocket combines MMH/N2O4 as its propellants. The mixture ratio given by the official website is 1.9. What could be the reason behind choosing this ratio instead of any other ratio like the commonly used 1.65 for these propellants?
You are quoting an overall mixture ratio. Since the fuel burns very hot, you vary the mixture ration across the injection plate to lower the temperature near or at the nozzle walls. Â  If you can get an engineer on the engine to look up his numbers you may find that the mixture ration at the longitudinal axis of the engine is close to the ideal for maximum thrust.
