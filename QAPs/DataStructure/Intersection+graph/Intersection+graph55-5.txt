How can I solve this equation: 2 x =x  ?
2^x=x can be written as f(x)=2^x-x now let us find derivative of f(x) which is log2*2^(x)-1 as we can see it is monotonic function let us call this derivative g(x) thus g(x) has one root at which function f(x) will take minimum or maximum value. Therefore  graph of f(x) will take one sharp turn on x-y plane as we can see f(x) tends to infinity  for both -infinity,+infinity i.e f(-infinity)=infinity; f( infinity)=infinity.Therefore this sharp turn will give minimum of a curve, if at this point value is negative or zero solution exist else no solution to the equation f(x). From here we can find f(x)=2^x-x - Wolfram|Alpha minimum value is zero so no solution Plot of the function f(x)
