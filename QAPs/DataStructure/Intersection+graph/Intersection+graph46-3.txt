What is the key feature missing in geolocation apps such as foursquare, Gowalla, SCVNGR, PlacePoP, etc?
Everytime you go somewhere, there's a chance it could be one of the most memorable experiences of your life.Â  What if a small piece of information is the difference between this happening and it just being another day? Are you willing to invest the energy it takes to checkin to find out? Checking in presents an opportunity to inspire a memorable, real world experience that the user never would have otherwise known existed. Foursquare touches on this with tips. SCVNGR attempts this with challenges. Curating and customizing these experiences is not easy, but the company that gets this right will win.
