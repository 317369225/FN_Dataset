What is the key feature missing in geolocation apps such as foursquare, Gowalla, SCVNGR, PlacePoP, etc?
1. Value to the user - beyond just being a Mayor, give real rewards in dollar terms 2. Accountability - I can check into locations that I am not actually in. To monetise the check in, I need to know who the user is, how many times they visit me and that they have actually been on premise. Ultimately, the check in needs to evolve into a full loyalty based, location aware system that connects to CRM systems, delivers offers and coupons and gathers data on user habits. There is a lot more features I could add but you get the picture. The check in right now is too primitive to be attractive for advertisers or brands to spend big, but the potential to drive loyalty and rewards and huge and that is what those companies should be looking at and if not, I guarantee someone else is.
