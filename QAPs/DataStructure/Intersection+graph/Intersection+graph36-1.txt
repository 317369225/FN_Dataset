Is there some sort of analogue tothe vertical line test for polar coordinates?
Choice of coordinate system is arbitrary insofar as any coordinate system provides a way of unambiguously specifying a point in the plane, i.e. the space R 2   . But when you're talking about graphing real-valued functions of one variable, you don't really care about R 2   ; your function is going from R  to R  . Every input value (x value) returns one output (y value). We then plot the pairs of values in R 2   as a nice visualization, and it follows that each vertical line hits the graph at one point, because each input has only one output. That's why the vertical line test works. There are two possible analogues in polar coordinates, depending on whether your function gives radius as a function of angle or angle as a function of radius. In the first case, r(θ)  , it would be a "ray from the origin test", just as Carter McClung said, because each angle could have only one output value. In the second case, θ(r)  , it would be a "circle around the origin test", because each radius corresponds to one angle.
