Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
United States congress, authorities and people should also consider the effects of the arms industry and market in other places outside the USA (and feedback consequences you get because of this). To the  ≈32,000    deaths/year statistic we need to add at least 80,000 deaths between 2006-2012 in Felipe Calderón's war against drugs (only in Mexico). Most of these deaths were caused by firearms comming from the USA, so,  the consequences of the arm industry/market don't only limit to schools and cinema shootings, they involve a lot more: drugs traffic, sexual slavery, etc. I am only speaking for Mexico because I am mexican, but I am sure other countries in Latin America and other regions in the world are very affected by this iresponsible policy. It is necessary to raise our voices and press for changes if our interest is to build a more peaceful world.
