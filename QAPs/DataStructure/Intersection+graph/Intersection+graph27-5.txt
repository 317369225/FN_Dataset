When solving polynomial equations, how do I make educated guesses when trying to obtain its real zeroes?An example would be: y=x^3+6x^2+21x+26. Based on Descartes' rule of signs, I know that this polynomial equation has no positive real zeroes, 1 negative real zero, and 2 imaginary real zeroes. Still, I know of no way to further determine the real zeroes without blindly plugging numbers into the equation, and that's the problem. Surely there is a way to more accurately choose numbers to substitute for x?
