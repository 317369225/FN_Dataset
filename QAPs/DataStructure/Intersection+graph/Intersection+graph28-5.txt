Let f(x)=ax 2 +bx+c  be a quadratic polynomial where a,b,c  are real numbers. How can it be proved that f(f(x))=x  has no real solution?
As a number of people have already pointed out, this question's problem statement is false. Natalia Nezvanova's answer shows that, subject to the constraint that a≠0  and given the value of one other coefficient, you can always solve for a range for the third coefficient such that f(f(x))−x=0  has at least one real solution. You simply solve for the range(s) of the third coefficient using these two inequalities 4ac−b 2 +2b−1≤0  and 4ac−b 2 +2b+3≤0  . These two inequalities arise from the closed-form solutions for this problem's quartic equation. They assure two square roots in that closed-form solution are non-negative, precluding complex roots for the quartic. Since we can pick coefficients ensuring real solutions, the problem statement is falsified.
