Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
I agree with what Sandor Szabo mentioned, but I'd also like to point out that while guns outnumber cars in the US, cars are being used all day, every day by the common person. Guns, on the other hand, are only used on certain occasions- hunting, recreational shooting, and of course to kill. If guns were as commonly used as cars, I'm sure the gun deaths would be much higher.
