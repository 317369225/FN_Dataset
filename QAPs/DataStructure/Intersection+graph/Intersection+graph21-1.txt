What does e x   mean?
e^x is the exponential function http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E... I don’t know how elementary my answer needs to be. This is a very broad question. e is the irrational number called the Euler's number. It’s probably the second most commonly known irrational number after Pi. Its value is 2.71828***** and it goes on. The x is an exponent indicating how many times to multiply e by itself. The x is a variable. If x is 2, you’d have e x e. If x is 6, you’d have e x e x e x e x e x e. Plotting the value of x and e^x gives a curve on a graph and that curve is what you see in the exponential function curve in the link above. As convention, when x is 0, e^0 is 1.
