What are the applications of graph theory?
Originally Answered: What are some surprising applications of graph theory?Cell Signalling.  Graph theory is the language of biological networks. (SHARP project- the retinoblastoma pathway) Research performed by Avi Ma'ayan's group at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine shows some fascinating applications of mathematics to this biological discipline Using shortest path-algorithms on already known connections, Bromberg et al predicted a new use for a signalling protein, and a new way for a signal to get from one place to another.  Graph theory points the way for how information actually travels in the network. The vertex degree (number of connections per vertex) shows a power law distribution, characteristic of heterogeneous systems where nodes have a wide variety of different functions. Motifs such as the bifan, feedback loop, and feed-forward loop contribute to noise filtering, stability, time delays, and can amplify signals.  Mathematical analyses show that the bifan motif occurs most often, and negative feedback occurs more often than positive feedback near the cell surface.  http://www.medscape.com/viewarti...
