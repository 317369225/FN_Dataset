For a given polynomial, is it always possible to associate 'geometric properties' of the curve to its coefficients?For example, we all know that for the polynomial mx+c, m represents the slope and c the intercept. Are there similar interpretations for higher polynomials? I am particularly interested in the 5th order polynomial.
Suppose the polynomial is p(x)=a n x n +a n−1 x n−1 +…+a 1 x+a 0   . The free coefficient a 0   is always the "intercept", namely the point where the graph of the polynomial intersects the y  axis. The next coefficient up, a 1   , is the slope at that intercept point. If you "zoom in" enough on the graph around the intercept point, it will eventually look like a straight line; the slope of that line is a 1   . "Seeing" the other coefficients is not nearly as easy. The roots of the polynomial are visible as the places where its graph intersects the x  axis; if you add those up you get ±a 1 /a n   where the sign is determined by the parity of n  (positive when n  is even, negative when it's odd). So if you've already determined a 1   as above, this can give you a n   . Calling this a "geometric property" is a stretch. There are similar formulas for the other coefficients but they are even further away from being geometrically visible. The leading coefficient a n   controls the behavior of the polynomial for large values of x  , but not in a way that is purely geometric. If you find that the polynomial has the value 10 10   at x=100  and the degree is 5, you can estimate that the leading coefficient is 1, because the other coefficients don't matter as much for large x  . Whether or not 100 is "large enough" here can be roughly determined by looking for the region where the graph starts persistently sloping up or down and stops wiggling. (Why are you interested in degree 5, and what exactly are you hoping to achieve?)
