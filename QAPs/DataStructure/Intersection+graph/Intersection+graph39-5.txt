Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
I wish I could be introduced to whoever taught logic to people who ask questions on Quora so I could smack him in the mouth. By this logic, anything that kills fewer people than something we find we must accept should not be of great concern. So if war kills more people than cancer, why should we worry about cancer, right? But to answer the question I think you're asking, which is why society doesn't impose or try to impose harsh control laws on cars the way some want it to on guns, the answer is, again, your premise is faulty. Cars have to endure rigorous safety standards, and to be allowed to drive one, you need to pass a series of tests, including a field test, a written test, and an eye test. You're also required to register your vehicle, wear a seatbelt, and obey posted speed limits, traffic officers, and road signs. Relative to this, the safety requirements for manufacturers, sellers, and users of guns are relatively light. Even if they were equivalent though, this would be okay, despite the fact that more people are killed in vehicular accidents, because guns, WHEN USED CORRECTLY, kill people (or animals). Cars do not. Also, you wish to sidestep the issue of utility, and I don't blame you, because it's a big one. Car use dramatically improves the quality of life for a large segment of the population. You may like your guns, but unless you're a hunter with no other means for getting food, or you are a member of law enforcement or the military, there is a high likelihood you will never really need to use one.
