It is given that the graph of y=x 4 +ax 3 +bx 2 +cx+d  (where a,b,c,d  are real) has at least 3 points of intersection with the x-axis. How do I prove that either there are exactly 4 distinct points of intersection, or one of those 3 points of intersection is a local minimum or maximum?
If the three known distinct points of intersection are x=r 1   , x=r 2   , and x=r 3   , then it is easy to factor y=x 4 +ax 3 +bx 2 +cx+d=  (x−r 1 )(x−r 2 )(x−r 3 )(x−r 4 )  where r 4   might or might not be distinct from the other three r i   .  If x=r 4   is in fact a distinct root, that gives us four distinct points of intersection--otherwise it will be a local min or max.  The details are "left as an exercise to the reader" :) .
