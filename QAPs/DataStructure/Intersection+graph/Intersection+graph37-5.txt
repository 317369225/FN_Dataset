Is 0  one of the answers of x x  √  =x  √  x   ?
Thanks for A2A. This is  purely a matter of convention. Calculus folks often define x x   as e xln(x)   thus automatically restricting the definition domain of this expression to x>0  .   But if a question would be a part of some test I would include the solution x=0  since one can perfectly make sense of LHS and RHS if x=0  .  No one  would be able to say that this is wrong since it would break a rather profound and thoroughly deliberated convention about empty products profusely used in many classical math texts such as  e.g. Bourbaki.  So it has 3 solutions.
