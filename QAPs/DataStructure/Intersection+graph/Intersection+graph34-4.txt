What are some of the best stories about life at IIM Ahmedabad?
For me, it has to be Prof. Siddharth Sinha's class on 'Futures and Options': While explaining the importance of hedging and a concept related to it he suddenly turns back from the board and just says: Â "The purpose of life is to have a good night's sleep". And he goes back to continue writing Greek alphabets on the board. Profound statement, always relevant.
