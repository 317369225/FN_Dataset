Why are there no solutions to the equation x 2 +6x+9 − − − − − − − − −  √ =x  ? Wouldn't x=−3/2  be a solution?
A more visual way to see this would be to graph the two sides of the equation on the same set of axes. Since what is on the right hand side of the equation has to equal what is on the left hand side of the equation, you would be able to "see" a solution wherever the two graphs intersect. In this case, however, when we graph f(x)=x 2 +6x+9 − − − − − − − − −  √   and g(x)=x  , we see that the two do not intersect, so there is no real solution to the equation. When x≥−3  , the two graphs are parallel so they never intersect. When x≤−3  one graph is always below the x-axis and the other is not below it so they do not intersect. There is no real value of x for which the graphs of the two sides of the equation are equal [take on the same y value] — and since f(x)≠g(x)  for any real value of x, we can say (and see) that this equation has no real solutions. However, in older math books, x 2 +6x+9 − − − − − − − − −  √   would have been considered a two-valued-function, and included both the negative and positive values of the square root. In that case, the blue graph would also include its mirror image across the x-axis, which would, indeed, intersect the red graph at x=−3/2  .
