What are some of the best stories about life at IIM Ahmedabad?
Some of these things are true and some of them lies. But they are all good stories! And because there is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you, here are some top-of-the-mind-recall (short)stories from the class of 2012 Teaching assistants[TA] grade you in every class, by noting down how relevant is your contribution to the class discussion. Nothing amuses you more than hearing this from a TA- Chahe tum kuch na kaho, maine sab sun liya... Or until a prof labels a open-book-case-study-exam as "Talaash" Or having a professor walk into a class, ask the most insipid question ever - "Do you know the score at which Tendulkar is batting?" and end up watching the match for the next 1 hour on the classroom projector, and to everyone's delight - a double century from the master blaster. That those from A did not regret that IIM-K was significantly increasing female student intake. They were happy that their probability of meeting a super cute intern during summers had substantially increased. We call it positive externality in the jargon here. Or having  Harsha Bhogle as a guest speaker, asking him about his CGPA at IIMA - only to be told "I learnt this very early in my childhood, remember the good, forget the bad." Blushing all the while. Or welcoming the contingent from IIM-B for the annual sports meet with a tongue in cheek placard - "Congratulations, you finally made it to A" or with "It takes 1000 B's to make A litre of honey." Something similar for the contingent from IIM-C was "Ahmedabad is 53 meters (171 ft) above C level." Not to mention that this is friendly banter and that both the other teams were as well equipped.Tons of stories there. Will have to tax the memory cells, for more, maybe!
