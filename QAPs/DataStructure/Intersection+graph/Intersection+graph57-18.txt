What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
Wow, so many fascinations, I feel fascinated by reading all these answers itself, but one thing that really fascinates me the most would be The Origin of our universe, Ever Wondered how all the Neutrons, atoms, elements, living organisms, bacteria, humans, animals, plants, earth, moon, planets,sun, stars,galaxy, milkyway, Universe, Multiverse How did it come into existence, from nothing !!! When was the origin? What was it like? When did everything start? Who created it? How did Space come into existence? These are my fascination..... :)
