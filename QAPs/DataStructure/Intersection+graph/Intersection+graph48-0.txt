If f(x)=7x+12  , what is f −1 (x)  ?
If you graph the given equation, f(x) = 7x + 12, which defines function f, you’ll see that the graph of function f is a straight line that passes the horizontal-line test (There is no horizontal line that will intersect the graph of  f(x) = 7x + 12 in more than one point); therefore, function f is an one-to-one function and therefore has an inverse function! (Remember, an one-to-one function is not only a function in which each member of its domain is associated with exactly one member of its range, but also, each member of its range is associated with exactly one member of its domain) Now, we’re ready to start the process of finding the equation, fˉˡ(x), defining the inverse function fˉˡ as follows: (1.)     f(x) = 7x + 12 (the given equation defining f)                                           Replace f(x) with y and equation (1.) becomes: (2.)         y = 7x + 12 Now, interchange the variables x and y in equation (2.) to produce the following new equation: (3.)       x = 7y + 12  Now, let’s solve for y: (4.)       x – 12 = 7y + 12 – 12 (5.)       (1/7)(x – 12) = (1/7)(7y) (6.)       (x – 12)/7 = y (7.)       y = (x – 12)/7 (equality is symmetric, i.e., if a=b, then b=a) Now, replace y with fˉˡ(x) in equation (7.) and the desired inverse function fˉˡ is defined by the following equation: (8.)       f ˉˡ(x) = (x – 12)/7 Check (very important): Since inverse functions undo each other, then when we combine the equations defining functions f and fˉˡ in a process called composition, our final result or output in either direction should be just x, the initial input, that is: (f ᵒ fˉˡ)(x) = f(fˉˡ(x)) = x  and  (fˉˡ ᵒ f)(x) = fˉˡ(f(x)) = x. (1.)        (f ᵒ fˉˡ)(x) = f(fˉˡ(x)) = f[(x – 12)/7]                                                    = 7[(x – 12)/7] + 12                                                    = x – 12 + 12                                                    = x + 0                 (f ᵒ fˉˡ)(x) = f(fˉˡ(x))= x for all x in the domain of fˉˡ. (2.)        (fˉˡ ᵒ f)(x) = fˉˡ(f(x)) = fˉˡ(7x+12)                                                    =[(7x+12) – 12)/7                                                     =(7x+ 12 – 12)/7                                                    = (7x+ 0)/7                                                                                                             =7x/7                  (fˉˡ ᵒ f)(x) = fˉˡ(f(x))= x for all x in the domain of f. Conclusion: The function f defined by the equation f(x) = 7x + 12 has an inverse function denoted by fˉˡ which is defined by the equation:  f ˉˡ(x) = (x – 12)/7. Updated 2 Oct 2014 • View Upvotes
