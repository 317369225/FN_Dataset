What is the key feature missing in geolocation apps such as foursquare, Gowalla, SCVNGR, PlacePoP, etc?
If you asked me this two years ago, I would have said that they needed to do more to give me deals and coupons and loyalty points. But I've been checking in for three years and can count on one hand the number of deals I've received or redeemed (mostly from 4Square.) I think today, these services make the most difference as loyalty portals where companies can see their most active and engaged customers and then they need to use that to interact with them. This isn't even so much a feature, but I would love to see stores figuring out that its very common for people to do a movie at this theater, dinner at this restaurant and then ice cream at this shop. Then partner together to turn it into a deal. Make a board in your restaurant to showcase the photos and info people leave behind at checkins, turn the information you know about these people into a more custom experience. Ultimately I think the mobile wallet, possibly via NFC, is what's going to take over the role of loyalty and coupon delivery since it's far more validated - so I'd love to see these checkin services evolve into a way to create custom experiences for people.
