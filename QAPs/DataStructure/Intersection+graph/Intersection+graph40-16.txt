What does Einstein's theory of relativity teach us?Short words to explain Please!
Once Einstein told, "Without going into any science behind Relativity , it's just like you are doing a journey by train & in front of you a beautiful young lady is sitting then your long journey also overs quickly , but if on the same seat a 60 year old salient man is seating then small journey also appears long enough to boar us. This is Relativity ."
