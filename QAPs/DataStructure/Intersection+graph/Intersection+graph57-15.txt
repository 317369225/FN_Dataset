What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
Cloud Spotting. They have been and will always be something that nudge my dormant creativity. And when you really want to catch a break from all the slogging on the week, try catching a break with a cup of hot tea and a cigarette on the balcony, trying to spot God saying 'Look! Look here!!!' I have spent most of my life along coastal areas. First it was Orissa on the east coast of India, and then it was Goa on the western coast. The coming of rains was much more than a relief for me. It was sheer and pure ecstasy. The advantages of living in a coastal area is the sheer display of cloud forms. Just to give you an idea..... A cloud monkeying around over Bangkok.
