Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
The answer to your question is very simple: Guns are built to shoot. Cars are built for transportation. People who kill with guns do so purposefully. People killed from cars die accidentally. Guns can't be made safer because their purpose is to shoot. Cars can be made safer because the purpose is transportation.
