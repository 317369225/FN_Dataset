How can you solve 8 x +9 x =10 x   ?Without trial and error or approximation methods, please show details.
Well, you can always use the Result vs Sending Functional Graphs. Remember in High School when the intersection point between two graphs was your result? And remember how the e^x graph was a parabola? Well, graphs for 9^x and 8^x have a similar nature to the e^x graph - that is parabolic. So you draw the curve for the 8^x+9^x graph and the 10^x graph, and wherever they intersect, you get the solution for 10^x which is 4.42439
