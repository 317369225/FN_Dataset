What are some of the best stories about life at IIM Ahmedabad?
So this incident happened in Class 'X'. One of my friends (Mind it, he is an Ischol) dozed off during the lecture. The professor noticing it, got angry and "Cold Called" him and asked a question. The guy went on for five minutes talking about International Trade, Eurozone Crisis and other things after which the professor politely replied, "I am really impressed the way you handled the question considering the fact that you have been sleeping since the lecture started and then have been speaking for the last five minutes about something which has NO RELEVANCE with the discussion currently going on in the class or the question I asked" The whole class burst out into fits of laughter !! #GlobeMax
