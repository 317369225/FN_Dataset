CW complexes are defined inductively to be pushouts of diagrams, I think that this excludes (think graphs for simplicity) X_1 skeleta whose edges intersect in points that are not vertices. How to show this?I think there should be quotient map between the $X_{1}$ skeleton and other 1-spaces whose edges intersect in points other than the vertices. Correct ? How to show this in general ?
