What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
The Universe. As a kid, I called the moon 'chanda mama' which means uncle moon. It was fascinating how it followed our car everywhere. I was so sure people live on it and they saved me from the monsters under my bed. Well, I grew up and things changed, a little. I love looking up at the night sky. Its so fascinating to even think about how vast the universe is and what lies in it. I am just a tiny little dot in this huge book of existence. Every person I see every single day, in every lecture and every appointment, everyone I pass on the street or see in line at the grocery store, every single one of them has a past and a future, family, friends, memories, dreams, goals - they all have an entire life going on that I'll probably never know about or have any impact on in any way. The sky is not at all what the universe looks like. It's amazing how billions and billions of those points of light don't even exist anymore. They burnt out and died before we were born, before our species existed, before our planet was made. The empty patches of blackness I see in the sky right now, in reality have stars that were born at the same time, but their light has not yet reached us. In this deep, dark, black, empty patches of night lies uncountable diamonds of light, which our eyes can't see.And out there, somewhere and some time, there may be another life form, staring up at the sky, and seeing our point of light. Or maybe, they're far enough away that we are nothing but the darkest patch of black away. Its amazing, out there is a new world. Out there is our destiny. A2A, Thanks Shashi.
