What are some of the best stories about life at IIM Ahmedabad?
okok my turn. So this is Two States, the only difference is that the guy this time is from Tamil Nadu, and the other state involved here is Paris. Understandably, there is an exchange student, a girl, and a Tamil boy who cannot speak Hindi for nuts. The girl was doing a survey about the living conditions of underprivileged people in Ahmedabad, and our man volunteered to be the Hindi translator to impress I am going to put that in bold. Hindi Translator They went to this place where a lot of underprivileged people live. A few questions here and there like what is your name etc (where our man did impressively with "Aapka naam kya hain et. al) the girl asked another question. At this point I would like to add that the family they were talking to was living inside a big hollow pipe. The question was, "What do you do for shelter?" Our man thinks, thinks, thinks and says "Aap acco ke liye kya karte hain?"
