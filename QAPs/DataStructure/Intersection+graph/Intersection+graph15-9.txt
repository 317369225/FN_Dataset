What is the interest graph, and what sites have done the best job of mapping it?
The answer to the "what" has been well described above, but I'd like to comment on the implications of mapping together interest data. I'm excited to see where Interest graphs can lead, specifically in terms of generating and facilitating local commerce. We'll begin to see a big wave in discovery over the next five years, and it'll be interesting to see how much commerce (online, social, local) is generated by web-based tools that can tap into an interest graph and then recommend boutiques, shops, restaurants, products - and the list goes on. My new NYC-based startup, Hoppit (http://hoppit.com), is specializing in taste graphing out local places of interest. It's our belief that consumer taste data, in correspondence with robust place data, can result in an incredibly effective recommendation engine for "place discovery." We're hoping to drive people out into the local commerce scene for new discoveries. Our strong belief is that interest graphing can be a direct catalyst of all sorts of commerce.
