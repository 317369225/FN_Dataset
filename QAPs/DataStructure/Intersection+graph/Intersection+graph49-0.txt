Can you find the number of points satisfying the 2 equations?How many points (x,y) in the plane satisfy the two equations |x| + |y| = 1 and cos(2(x+y)) = 0 ?
I am not a fan of giving answers to simple mathematics questions on Quora, since you should encourage people to think about maths, not just give solutions. Therefore, for in the future, take a look at wolfram alpha first. I typed in your command for you and the result should be available if you click the following link (or copy, paste it): https://www.wolframalpha.com/inp... This should always get you started. Wolfram Alpha is a very powerful mathematical engine in which you can type almost anything and it will give you a solution. If this is more of a conceptual question instead of a practical one (which I hope it is and then I'll give you some insight in the problem), then you should first look at each equation separately. The first equation |x|+|y|=1 will clearly be a square, as the four easiest solutions are -1,0 ; 1,0 ; 0,-1 and 0,1. As we are dealing with a linear equation, these points will be connected with straight lines. The second one, you should look for solutions that make a cosine equal to zero. You know for which values a cosine equals zero I assume (don't forget to put your angle in radians). Every angle can be adjusted by 2*pi and will still give the same result. You now have a new set of equations, namely 2(x+y) = AngleYouShouldKnow + k*2pi, where k is an element of the integers. This set of lines are parallel lines with the same slope as the edges of the square from the first equation. You can easily find the intersection points of these lines with the x-axis. If you do so, you will notice that two of these intersection points lie within the square. Therefore, as the lines are parallel with the edges of the square, you will have four intersection points. To find coordinates for these points, solve the correct part of the first equation (it has four parts, depending on which sign you give to x and y) with the correct line for the second equation (k=-1, 0 or 1, depending on which angle you have taken).
