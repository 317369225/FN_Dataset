What are some of the best stories about life at IIM Ahmedabad?
Course- Operations Management I Professor- Prahalad Venkateshan I had not solved the case on my own and had copied the solution minutes before the class began. As luck would have it, I was called to solve the question on the blackboard. I confidently copied the solution from the notebook. Prof- (Pointing to a number in the solution)- How did you get that? Me- Some random stuff Prof- Have you solved it on your own? Me- Yes sir. Prof- Well you see. The intelligence in the universe is constant. And the number of people is constantly increasing. You get my point? Edit: Thank you guys! My first century on Quora :) Edit 2: My first double century. So, it is Sachin, Sehwag, Sharma, Gayle and Achin now :D Updated 13 Mar â€¢ View Upvotes
