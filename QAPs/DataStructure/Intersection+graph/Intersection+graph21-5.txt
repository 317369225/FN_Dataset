What does e x   mean?
e x   is an exponential function. It means e, raised to some power x. As others have said, it is similar to any other constant raised to a power, such as 2^x. When x is a positive integer, then it just means e multipled by itself x times. I'm not sure if you are familiar with exponents are not, in general. Now, what is so special about e? Well, it does have some interesting properties. For instance, if you take the following: (1+1n ) n   and you take its value, with ever increasingly large values of n, you will end up with a value which approaches e. In other words, e is the limit of that function. If you understand derivatives, then the exponential has another interesting property, as Akash Gaba has pointed out, is that if you take the derivative of e^x you end up with e^x.
