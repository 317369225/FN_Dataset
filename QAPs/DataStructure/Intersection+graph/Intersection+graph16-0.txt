What is the meaning, physical significance and use of partial derivative?
Partial derivatives are just derivatives. Consider a function f(x,y)  of two variables. The partial derivative ∂f∂x   is just the derivative when the other variable y  is taken to be a constant. The graph z=f(x,y)  is a surface in xyz-space. The tangent plane at a point (f(x 0 ,y 0 ),x 0 ,y 0 )  to the surface has two slopes: the slope in the x-direction, which is ∂f∂x   evaluated at (x 0 ,y 0 )  and the slope in the y-direction, which is ∂f∂y   evaluated at (x 0 ,y 0 )  . If you intersect the graph z=f(x,y)  with the vertical plane y=y 0   , the result is a curve in that plane. The slope of that curve is the slope in the x-direction mentioned in the previous line.
