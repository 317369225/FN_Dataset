How can I easily draw a graph for mod functions? Example: |y-3|=|x+3|
I ain't an expert but I tried to draw the graph for the problem given by you so here are the generalized step that might be useful for further questions, Determine the type of graph to be plotted by the equation provided, since it is a one degree equation then it can result in line only. (One thing needs to be taken care is that line doesn't only mean one straight line, for example y=|x|) Plot some guiding points for example by putting values of x=0,1,-1 etc. After plotting some points you will have a guiding line to follow, connect the dots and you will have your graph.
