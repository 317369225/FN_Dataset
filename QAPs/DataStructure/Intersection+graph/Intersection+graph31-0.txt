Facebook Graph Search: Has Graph Search been removed from Facebook?With the new Search that lets you find search through posts etc, has Facebook discontinued Graph Search capability? I can no longer search for strings like "Friends of X who are friends with me and from India".
Facebook didn't remove Graph Search entirely. All, or most, of its functionality is still available, but slightly hidden. The simpler queries can easily be typed in using the search bar, but the more advanced queries can only be accessed through a direct URL. Searching a Graph Search-like query will often return a Graph Search box at the top of your search results: Clicking "See More" will bring you to the Graph Search URL show you the full Graph Search results. If you study the URLs, you can form your own advanced queries.
