What does Einstein's theory of relativity teach us?Short words to explain Please!
First of all we must distinguish between the two relativities, the special theory and the general. The special theory can be viewed as an answer to the question: Which group of space and time transformations leave Maxwell's equations invariant. Lorentz and Poincar√© found the answer but refrained from interpreting the transformation of time as physical; Einstein found the same answer but in a simpler physical way, i.e.: from the two fundamental postulates. The general theory is an answer to another question: Newtonian gravity is not relativistically invariant, is instantaneous and violates simultaneity, so how do you fix that? The answer is Einstein's general theory (a very unfortunate name, it should be relativistic theory of gravitation or Einsteinian gravitation).
