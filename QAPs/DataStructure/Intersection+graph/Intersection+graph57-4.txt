What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
The thing that fascinates me is whatever's over the next hill. No, I'm serious. I'm not a one-subject kind of guy. I'm kind of a slut for knowledge. I would always rather do something different tomorrow than the thing I did yesterday. I enjoy the steep part of the learning curve, the opportunity to get a lot better at something in a relatively short time, rather than the long slow burn of true expertise. Even things that I stick at a long time (Shakespeare, running, baking) are constantly subject to revision and novelty. The diversity of that tiny list is because they are broad subjects that I can continue to work on and find ways to create intersections. There are Shakespeare roles I get because I run; running lets me eat what I bake; I've even baked for Shakespeare shows. The world is a vast interconnected graph of knowledge, an epic buffet of stuff to taste, and I could never name a favorite because it's the buffet itself I adore.
