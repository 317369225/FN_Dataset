Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
It's not okay that 40,000 are killed in cars.  There is extensive regulation and government testing of cars and car safety.   In fact all most gun control advocates want is to test and regulate guns maybe to the level of cars.  Maybe. Not only are cars tested by the state, the state has the power to order a recall of cars.  The state can ban the sale of classes of cars.  The state can demand a test to license the use of cars and can revoke a person's right to use cars, which it does all the time. The state can determine where cars can and can not be used.   The state mandates a driver have valid license to use a car, that they have it on them, that they have insurance, that they wear seat belts and maintain the car to a certain level, as well as registering the car and showing a license on the car, and in the front window. Guns only have a waiting period to do a background check.  You don't have to pass a test, you don't have to register or carry a license, and the state can't even test guns for consumer safety.
