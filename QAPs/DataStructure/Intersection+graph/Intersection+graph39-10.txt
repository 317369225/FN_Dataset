Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
I asked a German colleague why Germans cannot see that letting people drive over 100 mph is a bad idea. He replied, You Americans love guns. We Germans love autobahns. Both are emotional, not rational. You cannot change an emotional feeling with a rational argument.
