What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
Thanks for the A2A ! It may sound childish or silly. But AEROPLANES ( AIRPLANES for USA) fascinate me. I am walking on the road alone and I hear an aircraft's sound, I immediately look up. So do a number of people ( kids and elders ). I watch in AWE and ADMIRATION. So do they. I have a few friends who studied Aeronautical Engineering and who know how it really functions and actually flies. And there's so much research going on. There are people like Robert Frost who may know everything about an aircraft. But then, that's what fascinates me. Human beings made something fly ! And hey, I hear an aeroplane's sound. I am going to be awed. Yet again !
