Facebook Graph Search: Has Graph Search been removed from Facebook?With the new Search that lets you find search through posts etc, has Facebook discontinued Graph Search capability? I can no longer search for strings like "Friends of X who are friends with me and from India".
Originally Answered: Is Facebook's Graph Search dead?Graph search as a natural language semi-structured search engine is gone. It's been replaced by a more keyword based search engine focused on posts. However if you make queries similar to what graph search used to be, e.g. "Friends who live in California" then there will be a section of results pointing you to that structured query.
