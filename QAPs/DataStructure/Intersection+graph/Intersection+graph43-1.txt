If you put 5 points on a plane, is it possible to connect each pair with a continuous curve without any two curves intersecting?If so, provide an example.  If not, provide proof. I believe it's not possible, but I have no clue how to prove it.
Practical Proof Let us take a plane and put in the first point. Now put in the second point and join them. Now put in the third point and join them. Now you can put the fourth point inside the triangle or outside the triangle. Where-ever you put it and join them all, you will  get something like this. Or like this. Both are topologically same : there is a big triangle with one point inside. Now let me add some colours to the regions to explain. Now try to put the fifth point. No matter where you put it, one point will be out of direct reach. Eg, if you it in the grey region, then the rightmost point is outside that small triangle. If you put it in the brown region, then the topmost point is outside that triangle. If you put it in the yellow region, then the leftmost point is outside that triangle. If you put it in the white outside region, then the inner point is not reachable. Basically when adding fifth point, you will have to cross a side of a triangle to reach one point. Hence, it is not possible to put 5 points as required. Updated 8 Oct • View Upvotes
