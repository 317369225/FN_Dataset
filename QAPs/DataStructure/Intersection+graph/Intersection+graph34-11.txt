What are some of the best stories about life at IIM Ahmedabad?
Grateful fools. Prof. Saral Mukhurjee taking on CAs. Hilarious. Prof Saral's peak was however when he quoted a slogan from the Tibetan book of the dead and he changed a few words, As we stand at thee edge of darkness, let our chant fill the void so people would know that in the land of THE NIGHT the chariot of SUN is drawn by the grateful DEAD As we stand at thee edge of darkness, let our chant fill the void so people would know that in the land of business the chariot of strategy is drawn by the grateful fool See this photo-post on FB Facebook And then there are the eternal Cheetah, the Elephant, Tortoise, Ant among others. And IIMA is turning into a zoo. Courtesy prof Saral Updated 29 Apr â€¢ View Upvotes
