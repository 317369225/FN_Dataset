What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
The human body fascinates me. I mean, have you ever thought about it? We have all these veins, arteries, tissue, muscles, organs, blood all packed in our body. How does it all fit?! Most importantly, we know so much yet so little about it! It's amazing to think that our nervous system is what controls our entire body! The spinal cord is responsible for so much of our every day functions, yet we're so oblivious to it (well I was, at least). We risk our lives every day by falling, hurting ourselves, or causing various damages to our back, without even thinking about our spinal cord and the important thing it does for our body. It's amazing to think that our body can go against itself, our immune system can attack itself. It's just overwhelming! How can we know so much, yet so little about our body? How can it be? It leaves me awestruck every time I think about it or read about it.
