What are some common mistakes to be avoided in Mathematics?Especially in Algebra, Coordinate Geometry, Calculus and Trigonometry.
Losing sight of what each of the numbers in play at some intermediate stage of solving a problem actually represents (often caused by failing to indicate units of measurement, etc) - so leading to those numbers being combined / manipulated in ways that are meaningless given what they actually represent.
