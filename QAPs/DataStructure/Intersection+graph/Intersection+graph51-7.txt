I am the programming karate kid. You are the programming Mr. Miyagi. How do you train me?We have one year until the grand hackathon that will either bring glory to our names or shame to our families. I am a headstrong novice who is impatient and thinks he knows best when he does not. How can I be trained to perfection in the little time we have before the ultimate showdown? What are our daily practices and goals? How I wax on wax off?
Everything about coding feels ominous to a novice. What you write is called 'Code' which means cryptic, the kind of stuff decoded by the secret service. What you run the code through is called 'Terminal' which sounds deathly. Imagine if the the words Code and Terminal were replaced with Poetry and Play-doh we could approach it all with much less trepidation.
