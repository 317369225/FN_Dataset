How can you solve 8 x +9 x =10 x   ?Without trial and error or approximation methods, please show details.
This problem should not be posted under "Number Theory". The solution for x is obviously not a natural number. Some people here have provided rather fancy methods to solve the exponential equation. I think there is a far easier way to solve for x to any arbitrary precision, which can be used even on scientific calculators. The key is to re-write the equation in the following manner: x n+1 =log 10 [1+(8/9) x n  ]/[1−log 10 (9)]  It can be easily shown that this recursive equation is numerically stable for all positive x and will quickly converge to the solution.
