Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
Cars primary function is transport, when used correctly they are very beneficial, when used incorrectly they can sometimes kill. Guns primary function is to kill, when used correctly they kill, and when used incorrectly they can sometimes kill those you least want to kill.
