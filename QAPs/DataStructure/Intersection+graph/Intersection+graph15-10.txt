What is the interest graph, and what sites have done the best job of mapping it?
My understanding of social graphs is that they are more than just your social connections, but also everything that is shared among them.  The inferences drawn from a social graph become the interest graph. Every time something is shared among your connections, another node is created that gives the graph more context, thereby revealing more about your interests.  When the frequency of sharing increases, more clarity is created, and thus more inferences on interests can then be more easily and accurately derived from the graph. As I see it, social graphs, interest graphs, and even Zuckerberg's Open Graph are all the same - digital maps that tell a story.  If there are differences, it's mostly semantics.  What I believe it comes down to is what we intend to use the data for - which for the most part is understanding and predicting future actions based upon past behaviors. It is all very fascinating when you begin to imagine the possibilities of achieving higher levels of accurately predicting human behavior as our social graphs become more complete, and theoretically, more accurate digital replications of who we are. Taking this a step further, our social and interest graphs will soon tell us a great deal about ourselves that we may not know, because we cannot see ourselves as others do. In other words, our communities of connections will have the power to describe by their actions who we are, which we'll have to reconcile with our own understanding. It's pretty amazing where this can go.
