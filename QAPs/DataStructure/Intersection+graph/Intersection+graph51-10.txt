I am the programming karate kid. You are the programming Mr. Miyagi. How do you train me?We have one year until the grand hackathon that will either bring glory to our names or shame to our families. I am a headstrong novice who is impatient and thinks he knows best when he does not. How can I be trained to perfection in the little time we have before the ultimate showdown? What are our daily practices and goals? How I wax on wax off?
"Build one to throw away" - you code once and then you throw that code away and program it again knowing the pitfalls and opportunities for optimization. No cutting and pasting or reusing code is allowed. If you take this a step further and keep optimizing your code repeatedly you can sharpen your skills to that of a ninja.
