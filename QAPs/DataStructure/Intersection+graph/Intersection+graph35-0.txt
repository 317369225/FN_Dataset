How can I easily draw a graph for mod functions? Example: |y-3|=|x+3|
Simply divide and conquer,you can have 4 cases in total case 1: y-3>0 and x+3>0 so y>3 and x>-3 your equation, y-3=x+3 y=x+6 Plot it.. case 2: y-3>0 and x+3<0 so y>3 and x<-3 your equation, y-3=-(x+3) y=-x Plot it.. case 3: y-3<0 and x+3>0 so y<3 and x>-3 your equation, -(y-3)=x+3 y=-x Plot it.. case 4: y-3<0 and x+3<0 so y<3 and x<-3 your equation, -(y-3)=-(x+3) -y+3=-x-6 y=x+6 Plot it.. Required graph.. intersection point (-3,3). Lines above it represents case1 and case2 and below ones case3 and case4. One very famous example to practice |x|+|y|=1 Answer for the same here,the rhombus formed is the required graph.. Hope it helps :)
