Is 0  one of the answers of x x  √  =x  √  x   ?
Yes and no.  As David Joyce pointed out, the limit as x→0 +   is the same for both expressions, namely 1. (The limit as x approaches 0 from below doesn't exist.)  But that's not the same thing as saying that 0 is a solution. Strictly speaking, 0 0   isn't defined!  If f(x) and g(x) both approach 0 as x approaches a, then the expression lim x→a f(x) g(x)   is called an indeterminate form, and can take a variety of answers depending on the details. Bottom line: What do you mean when you write x x  √    at x=0? Do you mean a limit, or do you mean a function that actually has 0 in its domain? If you mean a limit, the answer is yes. If you mean a function, the answer is no.
