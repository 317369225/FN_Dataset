What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
There is one thing that fascinates me the most, and that is Consciousness. Let's start with a really simple question: What is consciousness? Consciousness refers to your individual awareness of your unique thoughts, memories, feelings, sensations and environment. Your conscious experiences are constantly shifting and changing. For example, in one moment you may be focused on reading this article. Your consciousness may then shift to the memory of a conversation you had earlier with a co-worker. Next, you might notice how uncomfortable your chair is or maybe you are mentally planning dinner. This ever-shifting stream of thoughts can change dramatically from one moment to the next, but your experience of it seems smooth and effortless. [Source: How To Explain Consciousness]  As Max Velmans and Susan Schneider wrote in The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness: "Anything that we are aware of at a given moment forms part of our consciousness, making conscious experience at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives." [Source: Consciousness] Now, we all know the basic differences between living and non-living organisms. Characteristics of living things Living beings, especially the higher organisms, have extremely complex cellular structures, neural pathways, billions of cells, connections and efficient and intricate system of checks that no man-made machine has been able to ape efficiently yet. However, in the future, even if we are able to create such machines, robots etc. or let's say, re-create life, say higher life, by some means: Can we induce consciousness in them? The sense of self? Or is consciousness the same as being alive? This fascinates me endlessly. [Note: I'm no expert in this subject. Many of the questions I'm posing may seem obvious.] Updated 8 Jul 2014 • View Upvotes
