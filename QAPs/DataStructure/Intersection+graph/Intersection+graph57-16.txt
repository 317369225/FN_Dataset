What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
Human behavior. It took four decades (and the introduction of sophisticated brain scanning equipment) to figure out why so many seemingly intelligent, rational, and honest people consistently behave so foolishly, irrationally, and dishonestly and then deny their actions.  The explanation is fairly straightforward — addictions to behaviors that are (in highly addictive societies) considered normal, logical, and even admirable. I believe that (in addition to acknowledged addictions to drugs, gambling, and foods) the most destructive addictions are to unacknowledged addictions to common behaviors, including all of Abraham Maslow’s deficiency needs (safety/power, acceptance/approval/attention, esteem/status) plus money and belief systems. Researchers are slowly establishing that there’s only one addiction and it’s to the neurotransmitter dopamine. The difference between addicts is that some use drugs to trigger dopamine while others use gambling, money, belief systems, and/or Maslow’s deficiency needs. Addictions reduce all behavior down to protecting and triggering dopamine flow. As a result, it’s possible to understand an individual’s psychological makeup by how s/he protects or triggers dopamine flow. Ironically, while marketers are treating consumers like dopamine puppets by spending billions to understand how to manipulate our dopamine flow in order to get us to purchase products we don’t need, few individuals are interested in learning how to keep from being manipulated like dopamine puppets. Why? Understanding how powerful dopamine is threatens dopamine flow because the information threatens safety, esteem, and peer approval (for the few who try to explain the phenomenon to the many who don’t want to know).
