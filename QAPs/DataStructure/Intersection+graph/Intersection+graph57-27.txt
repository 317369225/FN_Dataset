What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
The universe in general. Because it makes me wonder what's there, beyond our narrow world. Â It also makes me realise how insignificant we are when looking at the bigger picture and makes me see that, no matter what we do, the outcome is not in our hands. Stars die, wiping out everything in sight, meteors fall, neutron stars are born and can be lethal, etc. The universe is a wonderful, mysterious and deadly place to be in.
