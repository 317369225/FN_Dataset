What is the key feature missing in geolocation apps such as foursquare, Gowalla, SCVNGR, PlacePoP, etc?
I would think that closing the loop would be useful - I'll explain. Check-in is a real world to online action sequence. Once you've connected your real world visit to McDonald's to your online presence, the only benefit/value is remaining online. Well, may be some coupons to return back. But there is no real life instant benefit. How about (and this may sound crazy) ringing a bell when a Mayor walks in? Or greeting by the first name? I hope I made it clear. One of the reasons social games are so popular, because players are capable of achieving greater satisfaction when playing, as opposing in real life. So if I achieved a certain status doing my check-ins to some venue, it is only logical to take close the loop and take the achievement back to the real life - great me by my first name when I am doing the next check-in to the store and on the spot give me 1% discount.
