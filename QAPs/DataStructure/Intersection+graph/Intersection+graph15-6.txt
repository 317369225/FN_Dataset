What is the interest graph, and what sites have done the best job of mapping it?
Since these answers all pretty much cover everything, I'll try to briefly synthesize in short-form what the term "Interest Graph" means to me, definitionally: The "Interest Graph" is the digital reflection of connecting users online around their primary (and secondary, etc.) interests with the explicit goals of (1) allowing users the chance to contribute, consume, and signal knowledge; (2) enabling users to make new connections based on interests; and (3) to create vertical-specific content that is structured from the beginning such that it optimizes for search, which may provide better and more attractive arenas for advertisers to target messages to those users. The site that has done this the best (so far) is Quora, hands-down. No one has the topic ontology that they have built, but that's not to say others cannot.
