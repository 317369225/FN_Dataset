How can I solve the equation sin x (x)=x  ?
Equations like that are called transcendental equations and do not have a closed-form nice solution like others do. However, you can solve them numerically or graphically. The numerical method involves "smart-guessing" values of x  until you can find the solution to your equation. There are several techniques to guess the correct x  . Perhaps the most used one is Newton's method, in which you first guess a solution (e.g. x=1  ) and the method provides an algorithm to find your next guess. Most techniques are based on this principle: you first guess any number and then the technique provides an algorithm to approach the right solution. Finding the solution graphically involves plotting both functions (sin x (x)=x  and x  ) and finding for which value of x  the graph intersect each other. You can also look it up on Wolfram|Alpha, where both methods are shown.
