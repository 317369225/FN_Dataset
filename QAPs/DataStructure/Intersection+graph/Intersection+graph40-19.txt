What does Einstein's theory of relativity teach us?Short words to explain Please!
Lots of good answers, but most too long! The OP asked for "shorter words to explain", after all;) Einstein's theory of special relativity "teaches us" that there is an unexpected new constant of nature, the speed of light in a vacuum. This new constant has a dramatic effect on our understanding of mechanics and dynamics, changing them completely for speeds close to that of light. Our intuitive notions break down badly at such speeds. The special theory also teaches us that there is a huge amount of energy implicit in matter itself. This is from the famous equation E = mc^2. The General Theory teaches us that any energy or matter curves spacetime by its very presence. This allows us to see motion under gravity as a shortest path on that curve between two points in spacetime, which also radically changes many things. This in turn means, for example, that a man in an elevator cannot tell the difference between the force of gravity and other external forces by any experiment of physics. It also means that there is no way to shield against gravity, since how can you shield against the curvature of spacetime itself? You can't.
