Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
Everyone seems to have casually missed the importance of the numbers being thrown around for firearm-related deaths.  The CDC numbers are frequently referenced, so why don't you stop and look at those numbers for a minute?  No one wants to admit that about 60% of the firearm-related deaths are suicides.  People kill themselves with guns more often because, as many have pointed out, it is an instrument designed expressly for that purpose.  Get people to stop killing themselves with guns and this debate changes dramatically.  The approximately 11,000 firearm-related homicides for 2011 are one third the accidental motor vehicle deaths, or accidental poisonings, or a little less than the alcoholic liver disease deaths for the same period.  But the almost 20,000 firearm-related suicides for 2011 rivals many causes of death, including the accidental motor vehicle deaths. No one wants to admit that the rampage killers have family and societal problems.  They make great headlines and they get people riled up, but they're small potatoes in the grand scheme of this debate.  It's easier to point at some object as the problem instead of ourselves.  If you want to rally around something to make a difference, and reduce firearm-related deaths, stop and hug your kids and try to be a little more friendly to one another.  It might actually reduce more than just the firearm-related deaths.
