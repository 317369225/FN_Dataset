What are some of the best stories about life at IIM Ahmedabad?
So this incident is from the year 2011.. Prof Saral Mukherjee was addressing the batch of 2013 fifteen days before the summer placement season kicked in.. Most of the Cluster 1 companies had already come to the campus for their PPTs. As a tradtition/ gesture (or whatever reason that i might be unaware of) these companies used to treat the students with Pizzas and beverages post the formal presentation. The idea was to provide students a platform to have informal discussion with the the senior members of the  company. What actually used to happen was that most of the students grabbed their pizzas and soft drinks ( sometimes more than one , for themselves if they are starved or for their dorm mates or fachchas! ) and rush to their rooms ! Only a handful of CP( class participation) enthusiasts used to stay back and chit chat with the senior team! As a result of this the feedback to the placement team from the companies after these PPTs was not very encouraging.. So, coming back to Prof . Saral Mukherjee's address.. He obviously was infuriated by this " bhukkad" attitude shown by the brightest students of the country :P And then came the statement that I and many of my batchmates still laugh out loud on:  "What is going on here! No one has any interest in the PPTs. Everyone seems to go only to eat Pizza . You want Pizza? I will give you Pizza" And the whole auditorium was in splits!! :)
