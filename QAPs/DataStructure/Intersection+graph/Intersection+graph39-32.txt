Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
To add to Vijay's answer, purposeful killing is much more psychologically distressing than an unavoidable accident. If a horrible car accident happens and you lose a loved one, it's very sad, but sooner or later you get over the fact that nobody meant harm, and life has to move on. (I've been in this situation.) If someone purposely kills, or even hurts a close friend, you, and possibly many others, may live a lifetime of psychological scars. Likewise, those who survive car accidents and recover usually live their lives on happily ever after. Those who survive murder attempts, injured or not, live a lifetime of suspicion, doubt, uncertainty, shock, and in some cases, mental instability. Finally, murder attempts can be cruel, physically and psychologically. When accidents happen, they usually happen rather suddenly, and help also arrives as quickly as possible in developed countries, minimizing the cruelty factor in most cases. On the other hand, guns or not, murderers may deliberately seek the most cruel way to kill people and suffering may ensue for much longer than in most accidents, and medical personnel may not necessarily be able to act fast until the perpetrator is under control.
