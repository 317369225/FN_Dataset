What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
I would have liked to say human beings and their endless variations. The fact that they are capable of so much kindness and yet also possess the capability to show so much unkindness at the same time. The fact that almost each and every person in this world has the capacity to surprise you. However, since this has been covered by so many others before me, I will like to say Beauty. Yes, IMHO beauty fascinates me. Be it the intangible beauty of beautiful relationships, beautiful moments and the people who gift me with such beauty in my life- voluntarily or involuntarily. Beautiful artwork (Xu Beixi's beautiful creations ensure that I will always keep coming back to Quora) Millet: Harvesters Resting (1853) Beautiful words: She walks in beauty, like the night    Of cloudless climes and starry skies; And all that’s best of dark and bright    Meet in her aspect and her eyes; Thus mellowed to that tender light    Which heaven to gaudy day denies. Even beautiful people I find the beauty of nature to be similarly fascinating That being said, the definition of beauty is different for different people. For me, Kindness is beautiful. Sometimes, even sadness is beautiful. All faces with warm smiles are beautiful. Little kids and animals are beautiful.
