What are some of the best stories about life at IIM Ahmedabad?
During a class in SMDA, professor Madhavan asked me a question. I had no clue about the answer and tried to stutter and stammer through it. When my answer was done, the professor said:  " You are like that uneducated fellow who was asked the spelling of 'coffee' and he replied back saying 'k-a-p-h-y' implying he didn't even get one of the original alphabets of the word 'coffee' correct in his spelling. Similarly, in your answer, not even a single aspect is correct." The whole class burst into laughter. Updated 25 Jul 2014 • View Upvotes
