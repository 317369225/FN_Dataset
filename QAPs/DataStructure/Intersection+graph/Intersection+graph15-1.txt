What is the interest graph, and what sites have done the best job of mapping it?
The world grows more and more fragmented and granular every day. There are many, many questions that cannot be answered credibly just by one's circle of friends. This is a truly exciting space. My Interest Graph startup Ranker - is also helping to solve this, with some success (I believe our Quantcast numbers are significantly higher than any of the other startups mentioned). Ranker is a site based on lists and rankings of people, places and things. Users can easily make lists of just about everything, and because our site is powered by a semantic dataset of the aforementioned "triples" (thank you Freebase and Factual), we have the ability to aggregate individual lists and votes into master "wisdom of crowds" rankings. We can map the interest graph to an extremely granular degree - we can tell that a visitor who votes on this list likes anchovies on pizza but hates Canadian bacon http://www.ranker.com/list/the-t...Â  Some people (such as myself) love to rank things. But many more people love to consume information in the easily-understood format of a list - and in the same way the best answers get voted up or down here on Quora, people participate as well, voting items up or down, and the rankings get more and more credible as the network effect kicks in.
