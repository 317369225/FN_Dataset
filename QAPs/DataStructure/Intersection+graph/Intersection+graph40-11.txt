What does Einstein's theory of relativity teach us?Short words to explain Please!
Originally Answered: What exactly does Einstein's theory of relativity try to prove?Special Theory of Relativity is a modification of Newtonian physics for particles travelling at a speed close to the speed of light. It has been proven that time dilates and space contracts for high speeds (near the speed of light), thus making the laws of physics invariant in all inertial systems. It also states that the speed of light in vacuum is a constant value and a fundamental limit in our universe. General Theory of Relativity is the addition of Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation to Einstein's special relativity theory. In simple words it postulates that mass is nothing but energy and momentum and that it bends time and space, thus creating a gravitational force. Of course this doesn't even start describing neither theories, but it is a very raw approximation.
