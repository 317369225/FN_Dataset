Facebook Graph Search: Has Graph Search been removed from Facebook?With the new Search that lets you find search through posts etc, has Facebook discontinued Graph Search capability? I can no longer search for strings like "Friends of X who are friends with me and from India".
Since its launch, Graph search feature was considered as 'complicated to use' and 'faulty' by Mark Zuckerberg himself. There were many critics who even wondered it actually worked when they introduced and got viral! Mining through trillions and trillions of user information data and facebook updates would have been hard to manage eventually. So they took it down. Such a let down though for people who want to find and stalk someone new :P Thanks for A2A!
