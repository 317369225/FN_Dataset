What is the difference between PeopleRank and the "reputation graph"?PeopleRank: http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21... Reputation Graph: http://jonbischke.com/2011/01/07...
I would suggest that PeopleRank forms part of the reputation graph.  The reputation graph is, to extend Jon's description, the formation of reputation that arises from participating in society and more specifically the various communities within society. A person's reputation is made up over the reactions of other members in the communities they participate in.  For example, I will have a one reputation (or trust, authority) within one community and a different one in another community. The reputation graph links those so that you can generate a good overview of the overall reputation of someone and likely response to different situations. The reputation graph is important as it gives a better understanding of the other person. Not everyone is great at everything and it helps to know this. The reputation graph is not limited to simple knowledge or expertise but also more human qualities as Jon refers to in his post (honesty, drive etc.). PeopleRank does what it says, rank people. Now this can be globally (e.g. Klout) or locally (e.g. PeerIndex).  By local I mean topic related. In one case this is more a popularity measure and 2nd case it is more a expertise related. I differ from Jon in that I am wary of referring to influence as this is an outcome.
