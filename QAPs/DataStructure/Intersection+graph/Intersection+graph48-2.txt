If f(x)=7x+12  , what is f −1 (x)  ?
inverse function means if you turn the graph of y vs x axis to x vs Y axis i.e rotate by 90 deg.....how would you deem the x value with respect to y, notice 'the ealier y axis' would become now the 'new x axis' and x axis as y axis. How do you calculate 'the new y axis' in terms of 'nex x axis' ? This way : earlier y = 7x + 12; so x was = (y -12)/7, mark it down as equation 1 ...as now x and y are interchanged we can write the new equation in terms of new x and new y as : y = (x-12)/7, notice i just replaced x by y and y by x in equation 1. So here is your inverse f(x)= (x-12)/7
