Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
It's the wrong question, because it leaves out entirely the issue of human rights.  The right to keep and bear arms is protected (not bestowed or created, but recognized as a pre-existing right) in order that the people may have the means to guard and preserve (or restore) their own freedom and political future, if they should ever need to.   The founders had just fought off their own government, with their own arms, by forming their own well-regulated militias.  The first battle of the Revolutionary War was fought to defend a cache of privately owned weapons from government seizure.  The 2nd Amendment was written precisely to ensure that the people retained the physical power to control their own government, the power of political self-determination.   The 2nd Amendment says "SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED". Not "shall not be infringed unless the court says it's OK", or "shall not be infringed unless the police feel unsafe", or "shall not be infringed unless the government thinks it will make the public safer", or "shall not be infringed unless someone thinks the arms might be too effective. It says "SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED". It also says "the people" and "arms" -- neither of those with qualifiers or exceptions.  The first half of that amendment expalins the reason for it, but does not in any way reduce or qualify the right.   There's a thread here that is all too prevalent these days, and all too common with several other trends in our country and society -- and unfortunately the common elements are (a) the government violating people's rights, (b) the courts permitting it, and (c) far too many people inexplicably and pathetically being OK with that, or even demanding it. Sad.
