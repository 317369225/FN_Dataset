How do you solve for y in the equation y 2 +2y=x−1  , and is this a function?
The first step is to complete the square of the quadratic expression in “y” on the left side of the above equation by taking one-half of the coefficient of the middle term, squaring it, and then adding it to both sides of the equation as follows: y^2 +2y + 1 = x – 1 + 1.   Now, factoring and simplifying , we get: (y + 1)^2 = x. Now, taking the square root of both sides of the equation, we get: y  + 1 =  +/-[ x^(1/2)], which is plus or minus the square root of x.  Now solving for y, we get: y= +/- [x^(1/2)] – 1 Also, the original above equation, y^2 +2y = x -1, does not define a function, but it represents a relation.  If you graph the two equations y = x^(1/2) - 1 and y = -[x^(1/2)] - 1 or graph the original equation solved for x, i.e., x = y^2 + 2y + 1, you get a parabola whose axis of symmetry (the line y = -1) is parallel to the x-axis. Except at x = 0,  this graph fails the “vertical line” test for representing a function. In other words, except at x = 0, any vertical line drawn through any x-value in the domain will result in the vertical line intersecting the graph at two points. (The domain of the relation defined by x = y^2 + 2y + 1 is the set of all real numbers x such that x > or = 0.)  In other words, for any given x-value in the domain, except for x = 0, there are two points or ordered pairs which have the same first component or x-coordinate; This characteristic violates the “vertical line” test for ascertaining a function from its graph. If the equation x = y^2 + 2y + 1 and its corresponding graph did indeed represent a function,  the “vertical line” test would have been satisfied because any vertical line would have only intersected the graph in at most one point, thus no two points or ordered pairs would have had the same first coordinate, which is the requirement that satisfies the definition of a function.
