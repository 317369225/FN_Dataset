Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
1. Subtract out the suicides = about 11,000 deaths/year. 2. People like to say "guns are purpose-built for killing" when in fact, they are built for many purposes: hunting birds, shooting sporting clays (shotgun), hunting for meat or varmints (various rifles), home protection (shotgun, handgun), protection in societal breakdown (assault rifles, e.g. LA Riots, Hurricane Sandy), etc. 3. According to the FBI/CDC whlie guns kill 11,000 in homicides, about 1M violent felonies are stopped or prevented per year with guns. When was the last time your car prevented or stopped a felony? You are comparing apples and oranges here in order to draw some equivalence around cause of death, which is silly. It is like comparing accidental poisoning (very high) against auto deaths...nothing in common.
