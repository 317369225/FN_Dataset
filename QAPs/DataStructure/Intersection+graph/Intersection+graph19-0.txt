How do you solve this equation using the a graphing calculator? 5^X = 1000
With my Texas Instrument TI-89 Graphing Calculator, I can solve the given exponential equation, 5^x = 1000, as follows: (1.)   First of all, press the “MODE” key on your graphing calculator keypad (or keyboard).   Tab down to “Exact/Approximate” and set it to “Auto” and then press ENTER to save.  This preliminary action is being taken so that you can easily switch back and forth between “Exact” for a precise answer and “Approximate”  if  “close” to an exact answer is sufficient.   (2.)   Now,  press the “F2” key for “Algebra”.   (3.)   Under “Algebra,”  highlight  “solve ( ”  and press ENTER.   (4.)   “solve ( ”  will now appear in the input area at the bottom of the display window of your graphing calculator for you to input the remainder of the problem.   (5.)   In the input area at the bottom of the viewing window and after the first parenthesis type:  5^x = 1000, x)    so that your whole display at the bottom the viewing window is:  solve(5^x = 1000, x)   (6.)   Now, press ENTER.  The exact answer to the given problem will appear at the bottom of the viewing window as  x = 3*ln(10)/ln(5) .  In the input area,  if you put a decimal point behind the “1000” or the “5” , i.e., solve(5.^x = 1000, x)  or solve(5^x = 1000., x)  and press ENTER,  you will get the approximate answer of  x = 4.2920296742203, rounded to 13 decimal places!   (7.)  In the input area of your graphing calculator,  you can check this answer for x by substituting back into the original equation as follows: 5^x = 1000                                         5^x = 1000   5^(3ln(10)/ln(5))  = 1000               5^4.2920296742203 = 1000   1000 = 1000                                      1000 = 1000.0000000002
