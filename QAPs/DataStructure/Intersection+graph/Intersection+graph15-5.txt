What is the interest graph, and what sites have done the best job of mapping it?
It would be nice to find out who was the first to coin the term interest graph. Regarding the Jim Plush's note I can mention a Sep 2008 Techcrunch publication where Santiago Sir is quoted saying: “What we envision is that there is a new dimension of interests that emerges over the social graph, you can call it the interest graph.” http://techcrunch.com/2008/09/09... Other recent relevant publications that comment the mapping of interest graph include http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/17... and http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/03...
