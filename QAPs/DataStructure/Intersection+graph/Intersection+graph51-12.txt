I am the programming karate kid. You are the programming Mr. Miyagi. How do you train me?We have one year until the grand hackathon that will either bring glory to our names or shame to our families. I am a headstrong novice who is impatient and thinks he knows best when he does not. How can I be trained to perfection in the little time we have before the ultimate showdown? What are our daily practices and goals? How I wax on wax off?
What I find curious is no specific books were suggested. We have free operating systems and free compilers.  The hardware is cheap so grade school kids could start programming if they wanted.  But no book suggestions!?!? http://www.ebooksuit.com/c-the-c... I won't say there aren't better books and I only have the 2nd edition. Understand how a von Neumann machine works.  Your code must run the machine. The computer industry is strange in that all of the devices are von Neumann machines but the term is rarely used. And then there is video for Android: Updated 20 Dec 2013
