Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
I'm afraid the comparison is both improper and irrational, and doesn't achieve your presumed purpose of defending the gun culture. The problem has to do with purpose, and therefore with people, rather than with the things themselves. To equate the two things in this way is a logical fallacy. Killing people is the purpose for which guns, particularly handguns, are designed and manufactured, but is an incidental and unintended result of using cars for the purpose for which they were designed and manufactured. Also, motor vehicles are a vital central component of our social and economic lives, while guns are not. BTW, this focus on the gun rather than the shooter sounds strange coming from a presumed gun proponent such as yourself - you are the guys who always reflexively quote the aphorism that guns don't kill people, other people do. Perhaps I should offer you one in return - cars don't kill people, drivers do! In closing, may I remind you that the US constitutional right to firearms was instituted not for a modern society, but for a frontier, largely rural, one which had just successfully completed an armed rebellion against its established government. At that time a man's gun, usually a long gun rather than a pistol, was a necessary TOOL, rather like a car is today.
