How do you solve this equation using the a graphing calculator? 5^X = 1000
Log(base 5) of 1000 = x Or x = log 1000/log5 (All base 10) Or it can be rearranged: 5^x-1000=0 So you can graph Y = 5^x-1000 And see where it crosses the x axis (idk why you would, but you could if you wanted to do it graphically)!
