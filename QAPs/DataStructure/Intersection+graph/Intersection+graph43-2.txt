If you put 5 points on a plane, is it possible to connect each pair with a continuous curve without any two curves intersecting?If so, provide an example.  If not, provide proof. I believe it's not possible, but I have no clue how to prove it.
For this special case, we can prove impossible of the question without relying on other theorem. There are totally (52)=10  edges. You can always select 5 of them to form a loop. The loop will separate the plane into two regions, inner and outer, and we have 5 more edges to construct. If we look at inner region, there are only 5 possible edges. Lemma: we observe any two inner edges have no common vertex will intersect. Want to show any three inner edges will have an intersect. proof:  three inner edges must have at least one common vertex, because there are totally only 5 vertexes; three inner edges must have at most two common vertexes, because there is no loop from three inner edges. 1). when there is one common vertex, three edges will contact 5 vertexes. If we remove a edge with common vertex, two other edges will contact 4 vertexes, thus intersect  according to lemma. 2). when there are two common vertexes, three edges will contact 4 vertexes. Because every vertex connects at most two edges,  three edges are connected as a line, if we remove the edge connects two common vertexes, two other edges will contact 4 vertexes, thus intersect according to lemma. QED. The proof is somewhat overkill for inner region. But the same argument can be used for outer edges. If we just replace inner in the lemma and proof with outer, we have any three outer edges will have an intersect. Because there are 5 more edges to construct, either inner or outer region will have at least 3 edges, thus intersect.
