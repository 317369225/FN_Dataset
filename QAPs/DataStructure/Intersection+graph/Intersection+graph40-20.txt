What does Einstein's theory of relativity teach us?Short words to explain Please!
Originally Answered: What exactly does Einstein's theory of relativity try to prove?If you mean Special Relativity, then it proves that inertial motion produces the effects of time dilation and length contraction. Both of these effects are considered to be purely relative but there is a suggestion that whilst length contraction is purely relative, the time dilation is in some way real as well as relative. For example, The pilot of a near light speed ship is not expected to be physically flattened or injured by his speed and nor are any close observers who also appear length contracted from the pilot's perspective. Nevertheless, the pilot's watch will have lost time due to his speed and this demonstrates his time rate, or rate of existance actually did pass more slowly than any "static" observer. In this sense, the time dilation is relative but also real. Regarding General Relativity, this demonstrates that the motion of any object or particle is influenced by the "curvature" of time and space caused by the presence of massive bodies such as planets or stars. Certainly the curvature of time is a real phenomenon and this can be measured as the changes in time rates at different orbital elevations in a gravitational field. e.g. corrections are necessary for the clocks onboard the GPS satellites to take account of both SR (speed effects) and GR (gravitational effects). However, it is accepted that the curvature of space is an abstract mathematical notion. This cannot be measured and the physical causality for this effect is not yet known. In my opinion it is "AS IF" space is curved but I would argue that it cannot be a real physical curvature. (This is not the mainstream understanding which remains silent on this issue).
