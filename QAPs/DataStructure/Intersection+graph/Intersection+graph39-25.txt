Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
The automotive sector has acknowledge its responsibilities in reducing deaths from their products (seatbelts, collision avoidance systems). They productively investigate new designs to reduce injuries and deaths. The gun lobby denies the problem at hand or any reasonable measures offered to reduce deaths or injuries. They only offer the solution of more guns, guns in malls, guns on the streets or even in schools. What is being created is an arms race within the American culture and people are being conditioned to shoot their way out of arguments. If big tobacco had a lobby group as effective as the NRA, they would be able tell the public that smoking more cigarettes would help kill off the cancer cells and people would believe them.
