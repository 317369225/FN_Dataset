How can I make a curve like this one (see the image attached)?
The equation is Y= 1/X. The lines are called asymptotes. An asymptote is, a line that a graph approaches, but does not intersect. In the graph of y=1/x (above pic), the line approaches the x-axis (y=0),  but never touches it.  No matter how far we go into infinity, the line  will not actually reach  y=0, but will always get closer and closer. How to draw in excel Just create two columns one with all the x values and in second column, give the formula as 1 over adjacent cell i.e B1=1/A1. Just drag till the end and then you will have set of X and Y values. Use plot option to plot the graph.
