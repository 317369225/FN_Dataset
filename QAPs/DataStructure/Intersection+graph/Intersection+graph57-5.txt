What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
Thanks for A2A. :) Human life fascinates me! Nature fascinates me! I mean see, how perfectly everything goes. How well it's designed. The days, the nights, the sun, the moon, stars, trees, rivers, oceans, mountains, birds, seasons, everything! Now, talking about Human life. Sometimes, I think for hours about the transience of human life, about how we spend our whole lives running after one thing then after the other, totally forgetting that one day no matter what we do it's going to come to an end. These endless wars, this thirst for power and money, this constant rat-race is for nothing! Updated 28 May 2014 â€¢ View Upvotes
