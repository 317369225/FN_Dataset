What is the interest graph, and what sites have done the best job of mapping it?
I love this point Jeff >> " If there are differences, it's mostly semantics.  What I believe it comes down to is what we intend to use the data for - which for the most part is understanding and predicting future actions based upon past behaviors". This begs a few questions whether interest graphs can be implemented in smaller sizes? For example, an average community page within Facebook using 'likes' is an interest graph too. But these communities, call it micro-interest graphs are much smaller in size as compared to the larger picture - the Facebook.Lastly, are these independent micro-communities/interest graphs sustainable?
