What are some common mistakes to be avoided in Mathematics?Especially in Algebra, Coordinate Geometry, Calculus and Trigonometry.
It is not a common mistake but I am sure you will land up here when you are deep into mathematical solving. We are well aware of finding roots of some equations like: y 2 =x−2    and y=x 3 −2x+1  What we do is basically put  0    in place of  y    and find the solutions. Dont we ? Because it basically means the point where the curve cuts the x  axis are the roots. But what about an Equation like f(x,y)    =  cosx−    y 2 −2x  ? We normally try putting  y=0    in this particular equation to find the roots. But this isn't an explicit equation. This is an implicit equation defined it terms of x  and y  . So instead of the  y    to be 0    we want the entire function to be zero to find the roots. Hence the roots of the equation will be the point/points where the graph of cosx  will intersect the graph of the parabola y 2 +2x  and not just where y=0  since the equation is like  cosx−(y 2 +2x)  COROLLARY:  It is not always that the equation given to us have roots where  y=0    but instead where the entire function is 0  . So finding the points where the graph cuts the X-axis is not the solution for finding the roots of the equation. Otherwise if that would have happened then we could easily say that all the roots of any Equation will lie on a straight line (i.e the X-axis) irrespective of the equation is which is definitely not true for all the cases.
