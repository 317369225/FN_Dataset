Is 0  one of the answers of x x  √  =x  √  x   ?
Square roots are always messy.  Let's let  t    denote  x  √     so we can get rid of them.  Then we're looking for values of t  such that  (t 2 ) t =t t 2  ,  that is, t 2t =t t 2  .    Here's a graph of the two sides of the equation.  The blue curve is the graph of the function on the left side of the equation, namely t 2t ,  and the red curve is the graph of the function on the right side of the equation, namely t t 2  .  It appears from the graph that the two curves do intersect at t=0,1,  so x=0,1  should both be solutions to the original questions.  The other solution  t=2    (giving  x=4  ) is off the graph.  (Note that you can't consider negative values of x without going to complex analysis.) Now it's clear that  x=1    is a solution to the original equation x x  √  =x  √  x .  Your question, however, is if x=0    is also a solution.  The graphs above suggest that it should be.  More analysis, left out here, shows that both limits                                       lim x→0 +  x x  √      and   lim x→0 +  x  √  x   also equal 1 (as suggested by the graphs).  So, yes, 0 should also be considered as one of the solutions to the equation.
