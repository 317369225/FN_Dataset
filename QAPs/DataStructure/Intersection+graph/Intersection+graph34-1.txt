What are some of the best stories about life at IIM Ahmedabad?
This is of Operations Management - I Class. Class 1 Prof. Chetan Soman walks inside the class for the first time. Starts like just another day, says So how was the case? Have you guys read the case? Few nods - most of us prefer to be quiet - picks up a first bencher lets call him AR (a dear friend - I am sure he will have a laugh when he reads this - IIMA has alphabetical seating - so unfair to some I know) Sees AR's case mat - replies No underlines - you haven't read the case. Is it? Laughter all over the class. AR is trapped - accepts - he smiles - but one of the jolliest profs lets him go. Class 2 Professor enters, So, How many of you have read the case? Walks up to Mr. A Aah A. (likes to have either a first name/last name basis) Lots of underlines and highlights. You have read the case. So, Did you like the rap song in the case? He got stunned - poor guy started searching - so did most of the class. He meekly replies So you guys haven't read the case completely - just superficial reading. (Damn we realise he has got whole class fooled) Everyone was thumping desks (you don't clap here) and falling off seats laughing. Class 3 He enters this time - look at the front bench casemat - underlined and highlighted - well memorised. So, How many of you have found the rap song inside the case? Smart guys of nation - no one turns a page this time knowing the trap. You can't fool the same class twice. Some people boldly say No rap song in the case He says Go to page xx and actually makes few lines into rap songs. (Whole class stunned. Damn that creativity.) Once more thumping and some laughs - but overall huge respect for the prof. Undoubtedly, we respect and love him so much. People get one more proof why everyone wishes they were here. Also, people managed to read cases well and work hard for his classes. Updated 25 Mar â€¢ View Upvotes
