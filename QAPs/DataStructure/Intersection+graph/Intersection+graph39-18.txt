Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
Well, we do set speed limits, require driver's education, impose pretty strict licensing laws, and have minimum age requirements to drive and rent a car. Is it really too much to ask that we impose similar regulations to ensure gun safety? It's easier to get a gun license in Virginia than any other kind of ID, how is that responsible?
