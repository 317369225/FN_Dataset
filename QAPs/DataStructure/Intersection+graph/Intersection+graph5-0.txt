What is the graph of a curve in the first quadrant, that is not a straight line, but all its points are a constant distance from a line that intersects the X axis perpendicularly, but does not intersect any point on the curve?
Originally answered: "What is the graph of a curve in the first quadrant, such that all its points are a constant distance from a line that intersects the X axis perpendicularly, but does not intersect the curve?" Let that line be x=b  . Your curve function is x=a  ; such that a>0  and a≠b  In other words your curve is actually a line that is parallel to the Y-Axis.
