Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
To drive a car, I have to pass a test showing that I have knowledge of how the car works. I also have to pass a test behind the wheel, showing that I know how to drive safely. My car is registered and licensed, and I am licensed to drive it. My license is subject to review and renewal. If someone around me starts driving VERY recklessly, other drivers will try to get out of the way. Car accidents are tracked and cars are recalled if they are found to be defective. If a manufacturer KNOWINGLY makes a defective car I can sue them. Car manufacturers are liable for defects in their products. To buy a gun, I have to pass a background check, instant in many cases. I don't have to show any knowledge at all that I know how to use it. I don't need a license and I don't have to register my guns. If someone around me starts shooting recklessly, other people may pull guns and also start shooting--people with no training whatsoever. Also, by law, gun manufacturers have no liability for their products. I'm not worried about people who are mentally stable and have proper training to use, handle, and store guns but AM concerned about the huge number of people who simply buy guns but never learn to properly use them.
