Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
The question is incorrect in many ways.Â  Consider this graph: Guns and motor vehicles kill similar numbers of people. However, gun-related deaths are rising and traffic fatalities are falling. Further, to count a thing more dangerous, one must consider exposure. People spend a lot more time in and around cars than handling guns. By any reasonable measure, cars are less dangerous. We also must take utility into account. Public-policy decisions have to consider cost-benefit tradeoffs. Which would most Americans rather do without for a month: their guns? Or their cars? Which do they spend more money on? It's pretty clear that people see cars as very beneficial. Lastly, US car culture is a matter of great concern. Car deaths have been falling despite increasing population because we've taken it seriously. Consider: Mothers Against Drunk Driving The substantial rise in penalties for drunk driving Big cultural changes around discouraging drunk driving Major improvements in car safety Tough regulations around car crashes and safety devices Serious local efforts to improve dangerous intersections And as a bonus, let me point out that this is a false dichotomy. Nobody is saying we can only fix one of these things. We can and should fix both of them.
