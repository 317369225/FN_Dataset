Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
I'm going to put this simply.. Cars aren't designed to kill people.  Guns are. I am in no way an anti-gun nut, but this question is ridiculous.  How are you even comparing these two things?  House fires kill people too; are you going to compare owning a house to owning a gun as well? On top of that, how many people use guns on a daily basis and how many people use cars on a daily basis?  If you were to compare usage/deaths, you'd see that gun deaths are tremendously higher.
