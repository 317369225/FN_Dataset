Do we know whether factorization is harder than graph isomorphism?
Factoring is in NP intersect coNP, but Graph Isomorphism is only known to be in NP. We haven't proven that there isn't some algorithm which decides GI asymptotically faster than any algorithm can factor, but the current state of knowledge suggests that factoring is easier. Let's say you're wondering whether 323 has any prime factors less than 16. If I tell you that 17 x 19 = 323, then you know the answer to your question is "no". That's because you're exploiting some deep mathematical structure, namely, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic which tells you that 323 must have exactly one prime factorization. Now let's say you want to know whether (G1, G2) are isomorphic graphs, and I bring in a different graph G3 and show you that G1 is isomorphic to G3. That doesn't give you any insight about your original question. The reason GI seems harder is that we don't know what evidence I could give you that would ever make you realize those times when the answer to your question is "no" -- i.e., we don't think GI is in coNP.
