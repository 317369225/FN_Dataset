What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
Thanks for the A2A! The Universe. It fascinates me a lot. And I am quite inquistive about anything related to the sun and the stars. Their might, power,Â  all the phenomena involving them and revolving around them. EVERYTHING! How many more galaxies are out there? How many light years away? Which is new born star? Which is the closest black hole turning star close to solar system? Are there aliens out there? Where? The night sky amazes me and soothes my senses. It invokes in me all sorts of feelings and emotions. I love gazing at the stars at night. I get so absorbed into the night sky and tend to time travel light years away!
