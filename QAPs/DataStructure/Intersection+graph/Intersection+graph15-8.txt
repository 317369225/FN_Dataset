What is the interest graph, and what sites have done the best job of mapping it?
We're working on a very interesting "interest graph" in regard to connecting people with one another.  The issue gets quite complex when you realize how fluid our interests really are.  It's a fun problem to tackle.  If you'd like to explore how we're tying interest and social discovery, keep an eye on my startup.
