What are some common mistakes to be avoided in Mathematics?Especially in Algebra, Coordinate Geometry, Calculus and Trigonometry.
If not already clear to you, sin^-1(theta) does not equal 1/[sin(theta)]. The first is an inverse trigonometric function [in this case, the inverse sine function, also known/written as arcsin(theta)] and the second denotes the reciprocal of the sine function [and is equivalent to csc(theta)]. The latter is also called the multiplicative reciprocal. It's an elementary, but far too often seen mistake. I suppose it's a hallmark of structured bodies of knowledge (i.e., mathematics, here) that notation can be as much an aid as an obstacle...
