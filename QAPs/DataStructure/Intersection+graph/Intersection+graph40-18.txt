What does Einstein's theory of relativity teach us?Short words to explain Please!
Originally Answered: What is a definition of the special theory of relativity and the importance of it?It was already known that the speed of light always seemed to be the same, even for moving objects.  Einstein noticed that Maxwell's equations for electomagnetism also implied this. His vision was of a much closer connection of time and space, as a single space-time.  And that an object that accelerated would experience a slow-down in time, so that it would still observe the same light-speed.
