How can I solve this equation: 2 x =x  ?
Consider the function f(x) = x.  This is typically drawn as a 45-degree angled line through the origin, passing through all points y=x.  It is negative for x<0, and positive for x>0. Now consider the function g(x) = 2 x   .  It passes through (0,1), above the origin.  As x becomes more and more negative, g(x) is asymptotic with the x axis, getting closer to 0, but never becoming 0.  g(x) is always positive. This means that there is no place when x is 0 or x < 0 where f(x) and g(x) have the same value. What about when x > 0? At x=0, f(x) = 0, and g(x) = 1. At x=1, f(x) = 1, and g(x) = 2. At x=2, f(x) = 2, and g(x) = 4. Because 2 x   keeps growing, so much faster than x, there is no x > 0 where f(x) = g(x). So there is no x for which 2 x =x  .
