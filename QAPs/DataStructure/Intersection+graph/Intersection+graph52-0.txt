Rockets: What's the reason behind Aestus engine chosen propellant mixture ratio?Aestus is the engine that powers the second stage of the Ariane 5G. The rocket combines MMH/N2O4 as its propellants. The mixture ratio given by the official website is 1.9. What could be the reason behind choosing this ratio instead of any other ratio like the commonly used 1.65 for these propellants?
The ideal optimum oxidizer to fuel ratio for N2O4/MMH is 1.73 because that is the ratio that provides the highest specific impulse.  However, real life numbers have to be adjusted based on properties of the launch vehicle.  For example, a graph like this is used to determine the appropriate mixture ratio.  We measure the chamber pressure of the engine and find the intersection of that with the pressure at the exit of the nozzle and then look to the left to find the mixture ratio.
