What is the key feature missing in geolocation apps such as foursquare, Gowalla, SCVNGR, PlacePoP, etc?
From the beginning, I always thought limiting things to just "Mayor" could be improved upon. I thought they should add all sorts of titles that mean different things, like: most visits in the last month vs. most overall. Or other telling statistics. I wanna be "The Duke of Home Depot", or "The Earl of Chipotle" Additionally, I'd encourage businesses to loosen the grips on rewards for 'Title-holders'. Make the positions hold more value. I'd I got a Free cheese burger every time I wet to Mcdonalds because I was the "King of the 5th Street McDonalds" not only would I stop there more, I'd tell a bunch of people about it. Competition would be greater for these titles atÂ  businesses with better rewards, which all leads to more business in general.
