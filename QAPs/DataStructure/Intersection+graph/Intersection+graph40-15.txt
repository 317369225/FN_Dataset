What does Einstein's theory of relativity teach us?Short words to explain Please!
A philosophical answer is "does any theory teach us anything?" A theory like this is an attempt to describe observations in a way that properly makes predictions about new observations. The relativity theories are quite good at this, they appear to give a very good description of the universe at very large and small scales. But I'm not sure that it teaches us how the universe works? For me, the closest to a lesson learned from the theory of relativity is the assumption that Einstein used to derive it: that there is no difference between different reference frames, or consequently, that there is no way for any observer in the universe to know whether he is moving or at rest.
