A uniform random variable X  partitions the interval [0,1]  into two intervals. Let a random variable R  be the ratio of the measures of the smaller and of the larger intervals. How do I compute the probability density function of R  ?
The first step is to note that P(R≤r)  is equal to the sum of P(R≤r|X≤1/2)P(X≤1/2)  and P(R≤r|X>1/2)P(X>1/2)  .  After that, the rest is just calculations.
