Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
Gun deaths data include suicides, and are falling on a per capita basis over a twenty year period for both suicide and homicide.  Automobile related deaths per capita are also falling.  People keep talking about how much higher our murder rate and specifically gun murder rate then other countries, but frequently fail to discuss our significantly lower overall violent crime rate.  Because we are able to use guns in self defense, less motivated and cowardly criminals are less likely to turn to violent crime.  This protection even extends to those who don't own/carry guns, as the potential criminal has no way to know which potential target is armed.  In addition, a large number of homicides in the USA are criminal on criminal violence (drug gangs) and far too often innocent bystanders in the black market drug distribution turf wars.  The action that would lead to the most dramatic reduction in gun violence would be legalization of drugs, removing the violence associated w the black market in drugs.   Also, no matter what the facts are or what your opinion is on the danger/value of ownership of guns, in the US, gun ownership is a constitutional right which can not be restricted w/o changing the constitution.  IMO, most previous firearm restrictions have been unconstitutional, and most current proposals are as well.
