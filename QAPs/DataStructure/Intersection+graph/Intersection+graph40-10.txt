What does Einstein's theory of relativity teach us?Short words to explain Please!
Originally Answered: What is the theory of relativity?The theory of relativity is divided into two parts: 1. Special relativity- The theory states that some objects are relative to us and some objects are absolute to us. For example if I keep a glass towards the left side then the person sitting opposite to me has that glass on his right side. This is relativity, which means the object position changes with respect to the observer. Now if I fill that glass with water up to the brim then that glass remains filled for everyone whether we look from the side or from the top, this is called absolute to the observer. Using this Einstein defined principle of relativity for an object in space. Hence this theory satisfied the equation E=mc^2. More the mass of the object more energy it has. So the inference from special relativity is that speed of light is same for everybody, the length and distance of an object depends upon the observer who measures it. 2. General relativity- In this theory Einstein stated that gravity is not an ordinary force but a component of space time geometry. Einstein stated that space can be depicted as 2-D. According to general relativity particles in space travel in straight line but due to gravity the particles are distorted an appear to be accelerating. So this theory suggested that gravity was the factor causing the distortion in space time geometry. Let us consider that space is flat thin sheet. If we place a mass on the sheet it would produce a valley like feature. From the above image the mass which is the sun produces a valley. So for an observer on earth observers an object A behind the sun it would appear to be at point B. This happens because when light travels close to the sun the it is distorted by gravity which means that light bends towards the mass. Hence for the observer on earth sees the object at point B but it is actually at point A.
