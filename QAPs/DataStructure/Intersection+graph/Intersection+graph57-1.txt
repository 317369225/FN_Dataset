What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
I'm currently fascinated by the atom and all it's particles. This video is a good reason why: The real reason is that we don't know everything about time, space, or the interactions of atoms and there is much potential for innovation in terms of materials. Â  The atomic/particle world also underlies much of what happens in the universe. I also am really stuck on rocks. Here's my latest cool rock picture from the Global Stone Project in Berlin, Germany (I doubt I will ever see them all light up on June 21) : I am especially interested in how they relate to what we will find and use in developing space, and the key to understanding planetary development starts with chemical and atomic reactions. And I believe that we will find an atomic energy (non-nuclear) means of space travel.
