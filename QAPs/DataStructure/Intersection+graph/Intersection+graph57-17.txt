What is the one thing which fascinates you the most? Why?
'The world of Fantasy' fascinates me the most. Fantasy is imagining impossible things. There's so much power in imagination. In the world of fantasy, there are always things which are unheard and unseen. Some magnificent creatures and some magical beasts. What's unheard and unseen is always more fascinating to us, or at least me. Anything can happen in the world of fantasy, anybody can be anything. Fantasy is always enthralling. Since our childhood we're told the stories of fantasy, which we have always wanted to be a part of. My fascination for the world of fantasy is from my childhood. You start imagining something and it's possible in your own world. Sometimes, these impossible things imagined lead to new inventions. Just to give an example, look at Wright brothers. Wanting to fly like a bird was their fantasy which lead to this amazing invention of the century. In a world of fantasy, you can be friends with a lion which is gonna guide you with its wisdom. In a world of fantasy, you can ride a hippogriff! C'mon how cool is that! In a world of fantasy, you can conceive Dragons! And in a world of Fantasy, you can rule every single kingdom on the planet just by owning this single ring! One Ring to rule them all! So fascinating, it is!
