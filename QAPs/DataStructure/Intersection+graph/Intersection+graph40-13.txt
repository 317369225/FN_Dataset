What does Einstein's theory of relativity teach us?Short words to explain Please!
Originally Answered: What exactly does Einstein's theory of relativity try to prove?A2A. Short answer, Albert einstein used the theory of relativity to prove the speed of light was constant for all relative non-accelerating observers. Additionally, it illustrated that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observes unrelated to speed of the observer. Furthermore, he illustrated that space and time were fundamentally linked in a phenomenon called space-time. This showed that events that occur at a certain time for one observer could possibly occur at a different time for another observer. Additionally, he proved that massive objects actually bends space-time which can lead to interesting phenomena like gravitational lensing and gravitational redshift. Sense this is a very general overview (and I do mean VERY general) I encourage you to visit the following sites: Einstein's Theory of General Relativity (for an easy read) Page on ffn.ub.es (for the orignial publication of the paper. Translated of course) A fun way of understanding Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (in case the previous reads were out of your scope)
