What does Einstein's theory of relativity teach us?Short words to explain Please!
That the laws of physics are the same for all observers, regardless of how they move, including both inertial motion (special relativity) and accelerating motion (general relativity), the latter also encompassing gravity by necessity, due to the equivalence principle.
