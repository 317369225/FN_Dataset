What is the easiest way to prove that if the intersection of 2 paths is a connected graph, then the union of the 2 paths has at least one circuit?
The question is actually slightly ambiguous. Intersection of two paths being disconnected does not necessarily imply that their intersection contains a circuit. Consider a P 8   , path with 8 vertices, with vertices labelled v 1 ,...,v 8   taken anticlockwise. Now let P 1 =v 2 −v 3 −v 4   and P 2 =v 4 −v 5 −v 6   . Intersection of P 1   and P 2   is v_4,hence trivially disconnected, but their union does not contain any cycle. If, however, the intersection is more than 1, say a,b  , then follow P 1   from a−>b  in the union graph and then follow P 2   from b−>a  in the union graph to get a cycle. If the intersection is more than two, then you need to choose  a,b  such that both lie in different components in the intersection.
