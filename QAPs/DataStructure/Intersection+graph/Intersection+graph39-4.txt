Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
This is a Straw Man argument. There is only illusory similarity between these two things. Automobile: A passenger vehicle designed for operation on ordinary roads and typically having four wheels and a gasoline or diesel internal-combustion engine. Gun: a weapon consisting of a metal tube, with mechanical attachments, from which projectiles are shot by the force of an explosive; a piece of ordnance. So observing the actual definitions of these nouns... one is helpful in moving people around quickly, provides for vastly increased commerce and is generally a boon to day-to-day life. The other is helpful in protecting, maiming, and killing. However, if we were to take you Straw Man argument and tackle it, you might say that in The United States of America since the 1960's, the general trend in vehicle related deaths has been going down. This is happening almost exclusively because of government regulations- most notably the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. So why should not the same be true of guns? A rigorous overhaul of our various gun laws may help end a large number of needless deaths in the same way that automobile regulations did. I am not suggesting the abolishment of the right to bear arms in the US, but laws that outlaw some types of weapons are not removing that right. Imposed minimal safety standards is not taking away that right.
