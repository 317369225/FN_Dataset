What does e x   mean?
I like to define the function e x   as follows. Draw the graphs of y=2 x   and y=3 x   on the same pair of axes. Since 2 0 =3 0 =1  , the graphs intersect at the point (0,1)  . Note, however, that the gradient at the point (0,1)  for the graph of y=2 x   is less steep than that for the graph of y=3 x   at the same point. It turns out (you can draw these graphs accurately to confirm this) that the gradient of the graph y=2 x   at (0,1)  is less than 1, while the gradient of the graph y=3 x   at (0,1)  is greater than 1. Intuitively, this means that there must exist a number between 2 and 3, which, when raised to the power of x  and plotted against x  , passes through the point (0,1)  with gradient exactly 1. This number is called e  . Thus: e x   is the function which, when plotted against x  , passes through the point (0,1)  with gradient 1.
