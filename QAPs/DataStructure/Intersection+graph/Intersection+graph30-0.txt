What is the difference between PeopleRank and the "reputation graph"?PeopleRank: http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21... Reputation Graph: http://jonbischke.com/2011/01/07...
I've blogged about this recently and here's an excerpt along with a link to the full post: PeopleRank is an extremely useful and powerful way to measure influence on a general or topic-specific level while the reputation graph is a mapping of some or all of the things that people think about the people who are in their social graph. Companies like Klout and Quora are the best examples of PeopleRank while companies like Honestly, Mixtent and CubeDuel are the best examples (at least at the moment) of the reputation graph in action. http://jonbischke.com/2011/01/26... This is a rapidly evolving space and so it'll take time to see which terms and definitions stick. I do think that PeopleRank will play a role in building the reputation graph and that the reputation graph will consist, in part, of data from companies who are building PeopleRank. Lastly, I completely agree with Tom's statement that no one company will own the graph outright. I think a number of companies will be involved in creating both the reputation graph and PeopleRank, both some of those that have been referenced here already and new entrants to the space.
