What is the key feature missing in geolocation apps such as foursquare, Gowalla, SCVNGR, PlacePoP, etc?
At HipGeo we see the next generation of geolocation apps and solutions, providing crowd sourced and friend sourced blog posts as opposed to simple check-ins or ratings.  People want the ability for more self expression, and in the process this creates the side effect of rich UGC for places beyond check-in, ratings, and photos, which will all still have a place, but we expect check-ins and ratings to be by-products of blog posts which contain photos, videos, text, audio, etc.  This will create an opportunity for cloud based solutions to do the heavy lifting in regards to curation.  We see a service which is a bit like Tumblr and  a bit like Foursquare, that allows the natural intersection of place graphs, interest graphs, social graphs, and commerce graphs.
