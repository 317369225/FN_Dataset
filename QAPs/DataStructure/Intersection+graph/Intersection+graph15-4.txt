What is the interest graph, and what sites have done the best job of mapping it?
In Layman's terms, this is nothing more than interests and how they support each other. Here's how a mock-up of a travel and outdoors business' interest graph may look like. Notice how obviously do the dots connect, and how often relevant interests are missed by companies building their brand presence. I must say I love what Steven Dziedzic said about the implications of the interest graph on local commerce. Think about it - if your local barber, and local grocery clerk both would like to watch the upcoming finals, in which your local sports team plays, big chances are they'll visit the local pub, or buy some beer that day. Now if you translate these connections into ecommerce, you can easily understand, that someone google searching for the term Interest Graph, is bound to also be Interested in Social Media, sociology, and perhaps ecommerce. This way, we can facilitate this knowledge (and measure its weight) for practical use like - SEO (keywords) - Branding and product positioning - Tailoring site content to reflect more than just one specific emotion or interest A prime example of this happening around the clock is Twitter - all the hash tags talking about #custserv or #bizdev are reflections of interests, and reading tweets of these followersÂ  (or even your company) will help you understand in what context of search terms and relations between them, you exist.
