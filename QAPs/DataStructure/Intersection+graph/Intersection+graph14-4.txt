What is your favourite area of mathematics? Why?
Although I have not yet had the opportunity (AKA time) to explore the full realm of mathematics, Calculus has by far become my favourite subject within the bit of math-world I have explored. It's fluid, dynamic, and well-workable with fluid dynamics. It is an artistic sort of math that has a fun freedom to it. I look forward to delving further into it my upcoming senior year of high school.
