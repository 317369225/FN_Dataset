What is the difference between PeopleRank and the "reputation graph"?PeopleRank: http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21... Reputation Graph: http://jonbischke.com/2011/01/07...
"PeopleRank" is currently used to describe an initiative by Quora to determine the quality of a Quora user.  As noted in the Techcrunch article referenced in this question, Quora's initiative is currently in development.  The Reputation Graph as referenced in blog posts by Jon Bischke and increasingly by bloggers covering projects like CubeDuel and companies like Mixtent is used to refer to the facets of a user's overall web identity that relate to what they know, how well they practice what they know, how they are perceived by others with respect to what they know and how they practice what they know, and their ability to influence others with what they know. In this context, I make the proposal that the "reputation graph" referenced by Jon and others might be more accurately referred to as the "knowledge graph" or "practice graph" and it's the intersection of this graph and the "social graph" that create a person's "reputation graph." I'd argue that no one company will own a particular graph outright (unless and until we all use one singular website at the expense of all others) but that a small handful of companies will be larger influencers to a particular graph of a user. As a related aside, the TechCrunch article credits Shervin Pishevar for coining the term, but as Azeem Azhar pointed out in a comment to my answer, Ajit Jaokar used the term in a 2006 blog post that can be found here: http://www.opengardensblog.futur...
