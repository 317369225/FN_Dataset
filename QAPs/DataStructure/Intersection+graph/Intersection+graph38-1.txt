Why does the sine of an angle has more than one solution? For example: sinβ=0.5 My textbook says there are two solutions for β, 30 degrees and 150, but my calculator with the function arcsin only gives me 30, why so?
The Arcsin (sin −1 )  function gives the (unique) angle between -90° and 90° with the appropriate sine value. It cannot give two values, because then it would not be a function! However, there are infinitely many angles with a given sine value (just consider β+360°). And, in fact, there are usually two angles between 0 and 360° with a given sine value. (The exceptions are a sine value of ±1.) For a positive sine value, these two angles will be in the first and second quadrants; for a negative sine value, they will be in the third and fourth quadrants. Whether positive or negative, they will have the same reference angle.
