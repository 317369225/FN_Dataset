When solving polynomial equations, how do I make educated guesses when trying to obtain its real zeroes?An example would be: y=x^3+6x^2+21x+26. Based on Descartes' rule of signs, I know that this polynomial equation has no positive real zeroes, 1 negative real zero, and 2 imaginary real zeroes. Still, I know of no way to further determine the real zeroes without blindly plugging numbers into the equation, and that's the problem. Surely there is a way to more accurately choose numbers to substitute for x?
The best way to do it is to look for different values that give you a sign change.  For example, we can immediately see that x=0 gives y=26 and x=-10 gives something like y=-584.  So the root must be somewhere in the middle.  For high degree polynomials, you won't generally be able to find an exact solution (and even for cubic, the general method that leads to exact solutions is too ugly to employ), so unless the root is rational, you'll need to resort to a numerical solution like Newton's method.  Being able to do the analysis you already did (i.e. that there is one real root) combined with knowing a relatively small interval like (-10,0) where the root lives gives you enough to make the numerical solver work great. If the root is rational, then as Justin Rising's answer to When solving polynomial equations, how do I make educated guesses when trying to obtain its real zeroes? explains, we can use the rational root theorem to narrow the list to a just a few choices.  In the case of your example, the only possible rational roots in the interval (-10,0) that we need to check are -1 and -2.  It turns out that -2 works. But roots aren't usually rational, so don't get too worked up over looking for them.  It's more valuable (outside of school) to know how to get good numerical approximations.  If you look for the numerical solution and it happens to turn out to be rational, then great!
