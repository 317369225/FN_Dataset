Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
The question is just wrong. Period. How can you compare a car crash (i.e. - unintentional event that is a catastrophe) to an intentional murder. If you will see the most common % of deaths - its is household accidents. So what shall we do? Live in a mental hospital environmentÂ  I mean smooth edges on our furniture etc etc? You are comparing things that NOT comparable in any way shape or form. Also - any country is trying to reduce the amount of car accidents by building better roads etc etc. So saying that government does nothing about it - is wrong as well.
