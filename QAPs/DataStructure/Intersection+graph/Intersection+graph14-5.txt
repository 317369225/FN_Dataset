What is your favourite area of mathematics? Why?
My favorite isn't so much an area of mathematics as a perspective on mathematics.  I enjoy the history of mathematics. How did it develop?  Who was doing it?  Why did they do it?  How did it connect to previous and succeeding mathematics?  How did it change over the years and centuries? I find the story of mathematics the most interesting part of it.
