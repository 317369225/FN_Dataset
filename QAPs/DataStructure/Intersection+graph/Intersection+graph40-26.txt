What does Einstein's theory of relativity teach us?Short words to explain Please!
Laws of physics are same for all frames of reference in uniform motion. This is by definition.! What I understand that the relative nature of time is such a common phenomenon at day to day life that someone need not know Einstein's theory to understand this. Imagine the difference in expenditure of time when u incidentally met your long lost friend and then had a heartily conversationÂ  with when u waited outside the loo desperately for ur turn. ! Time - which is so intimately constant for all of us is actually specific to our experience in earth , I.e it's subjective. In short passage of time is a relative reality , and we don't need hard mathematics to understand this. ! I Hope it's short
