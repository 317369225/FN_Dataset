Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
And why are our the deaths resulting from our perpetual wars abroad of less concern to the public than our auto and gun deaths hear at home? Given the below quick and dirty calculations: AUTO deaths as a percent of US population living in homes with a car = 1.1%; GUN deaths as a percent of US population living in homes with a gun = 3.1% and, BTW; US MILITARY deaths since 2001 resulting from war injuries and suicides as a percent of 173K US troops now deployed overseas = 8.0%. Given these per capita numbers, where should our priorities lie: more auto protection; more gun control; or less preemptive wars abroad? SIDELINE NOTE: These "US Military" causalities don't include, of course, the 100K to 500K in overseas civilian "collateral" damages by our military (estimates still vary widely according to recording agency - but they are high!); or the so-far totally unknown number of collateral deaths resulting from drone attacks by the CIA.) SOURCE NOTE: Wikipedia provided the military death rates which are not, admittedly annual rates; but given the total number of active military service personnel now deployed abroad (173K), this TOTAL TO DATE number of deaths in action (5.9K) and deaths from suicide (6.0K) since 2001 should give at least aÂ  rough estimate of the annual death rates of today's deployed US military personnel.
