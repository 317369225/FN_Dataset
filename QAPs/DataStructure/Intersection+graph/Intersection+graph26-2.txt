If f(f(x))=x 2 −1  , what is f(x)  ?Obviously there are an infinite many solutions, but just one will suffice :P
The question needs to be made precise first. One must clarify what f  is supposed to be (a function from where to where?), and which are the numbers x  for which the condition needs to hold (all numbers? Some numbers?) If you wish to find a function f:R→R  such that f(f(x))=x 2 −1  holds for all x  between -100 and 100, then there are infinitely many such functions and they are very easy to construct. For example, define f(x)  to be f(x)=x+300  for x∈[−100,100]  and then define f(x)=(x−300) 2 −1  for x∈[200,400]  . Define f  arbitrarily elsewhere. Done. Of course, the choice of interval [−100,100]  is completely arbitrary. You can find appropriate solutions for any prescribed interval, including functions that would satisfy the equation for all numbers between negative googolplex and googolplex. But if you wish to find a function f:R→R  such that f(f(x))=x 2 −1  holds for all x∈R  , then there aren't any such functions, and then "obviously there are infinitely many solutions" isn't quite true. Here's why. Suppose that there is such a function. Observe that f(f(0))=−1  , and f(f(−1))=0  . Let's give f(0)  a name, say f(0)=a  . Then f(a)=−1  . Now, f(−1)=f(f(a))=a 2 −1  , and finally f(a 2 −1)=f(f(−1))=0  . So we have a cycle of length 4: 0→a→−1→a 2 −1→0  . It's important to realize that this really is a cycle of length 4: all of its elements 0,a,−1,a 2 −1  must be distinct. Why? If a=0  then we get 0→0→−1→−1→0  . This is nonsense, since the function f  is a function: it takes each number to a specific value. Here we have f(0)=0  and also f(0)=−1  , impossible. So a≠0  . 0≠−1  requires no explanation. 0≠a 2 −1  . Otherwise, the cycle becomes 0→±1→−1→0→0  and once again 0  tries to get mapped to two different values. So a≠1  and also a≠−1  . a≠a 2 −1  . Otherwise, we get 0→a→−1→a→0  and this time it is a  which tries to map itself to two different values. Again, impossible. So a≠1±5  √ 2   . We've checked the condition f(f(x))=x 2 −1  at 0,a  and −1  , but we haven't tried a 2 −1  yet. Shall we? f(f(a 2 −1))=f(0)=a  but we know that this must also equal (a 2 −1) 2 −1  , so (a 2 −1) 2 −1=a  a 4 −2a 2 +1−1=a  a 4 −2a 2 −a=0  . This easily factors as a(a+1)(a 2 −a−1)=0  So a  must either be 0  , or −1  , or else it must satisfy a 2 −a−1=0  which is the same as a 2 −1=a  . But a  cannot be any of those things, because we just excluded all of these possible values for a  in the bulleted list above. So, there's no such function f  . Updated 17 Oct • View Upvotes
