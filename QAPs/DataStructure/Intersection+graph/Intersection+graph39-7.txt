Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
This is what we call whataboutery. There is no reason not to solve both problems, without assuming one should have priority over the other, and the two death rates are not necessarily related. The question you need to ask yourself is whether your gun culture is okay. I think your country is far to blas√© about instruments which are designed to kill and additionally, a lot of your population are desensitised to that issue. Your auto-culture is largely about an item designed to provide transport. Your gun-culture is largely about an item designed to kill. I wonder why you can't see the problem with this. In the meantime, your transport regulators and auto-engineers are putting work into making cars safer. I'm not sure what you can do to make something designed to kill less likely to kill.
