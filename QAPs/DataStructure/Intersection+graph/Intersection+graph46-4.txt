What is the key feature missing in geolocation apps such as foursquare, Gowalla, SCVNGR, PlacePoP, etc?
I like the direction Jake Diner's answer is suggesting, although I think "closing the loop" has other meanings in this space (ie, the loop between deal interest and redemption). The mayor bell exists, as do realtime leaderboards and other stuff, in hacker form...I think a lack of commercially-available, *extremely* easy-to-configure product that offers that will keep it from reaching most merchants/venue owners. (That said, I've been toying around with the bell/leaderboard idea forever and am considering a Kickstarter for it...interested? ;-). It would be especially cool if your loyalty to a place allowed you to unduly influence the jukebox/Spotify stream. Another awesome hack I've seen checked each visitor's Klout score and subtly alerted the staff if a particularly influential person checked in. I was at a bar recently that maintained a physical board of names/aliases and dollar amounts...the idea was, you could leave a drink for a friend asynchronously. I'd love to see this applied to an LBS and a mobile payment service because it would turn the venue's digital presence into much more of a vibrant, repeatable experience. (i.e., I generally don't leave repeat Tips at a place, but would check out/use the asynchronous moneyboard more often).
