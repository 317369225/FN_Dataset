Is there some sort of analogue tothe vertical line test for polar coordinates?
Not unless you restrict your domain to [0,2pi) and your range to positive numbers. If you do that, instead of vertical lines, draw rays out from the origin at every angle. If any of those rays intersect the graph more than once, then the polar graph is not a function, because for a given value of theta there are multiple values of r. The reason this does not work for an extended domain is that you can have coterminal angles that are technically different inputs and can create different outputs, causing this test to fail, though it is a function. The reason you cannot have negative values of r is that those can interfere with angles like pi and 3pi where negative values of r on one angle will appear on the ray pi radians away. Edit: The reason the vertical line test works is all those vertical lines take the form x=__, in the case of the polar test, the rays all take the form theta=___ As far as why a relation can be a function in polar and not in rectangular coordinates; while two relations may plot the same location on a Cartesian plane, it does not mean that the relations are the same. One can be a function while the other isn't.
