Facebook Graph Search: Has Graph Search been removed from Facebook?With the new Search that lets you find search through posts etc, has Facebook discontinued Graph Search capability? I can no longer search for strings like "Friends of X who are friends with me and from India".
Originally Answered: What happened to Facebook's Graph Search feature?It is working still the same but they have included post search as well so you may not get things right in search bar.  If you want to look for people who like Quora.  Just search for "likers of quora"  and click on the search and you will get an option to see all people who have liked Quora. Play around and you can find more info about your audience.
