Why is America's Car Culture, which kills 40,000 people per year, okay, but its Gun Culture, which kills far fewer, of such great concern?
That's actually a great point, even if "far less" is totally wrong. Our car culture does kill more people, at least for the next year or so. Which is exactly why there there have been so many governmental regulations to improve safety in cars. Seat belts are mandatory. Air bags are mandatory. Drivers have to be licensed, insured and pass both written and practical tests. Punishments for drunk driving have increased substantially. (You know, all the kinds of the things that the NRA has fought against for decades.) As a result, car deaths are projected to drop below gun deaths within three years. The car culture has become safer because safety trumped political considerations. When will the gun culture agree to the same thing?
