When solving polynomial equations, how do I make educated guesses when trying to obtain its real zeroes?An example would be: y=x^3+6x^2+21x+26. Based on Descartes' rule of signs, I know that this polynomial equation has no positive real zeroes, 1 negative real zero, and 2 imaginary real zeroes. Still, I know of no way to further determine the real zeroes without blindly plugging numbers into the equation, and that's the problem. Surely there is a way to more accurately choose numbers to substitute for x?
The rational root theorem gives you a list of the possible rational roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients.  Beyond that, if you know that there's only one real root and it's negative, then you know that for any number less than that root, the polynomial must be negative.  So you can try out the integers systematically and see what that buys you.
