He didn’t use a computer at all for many years. But he was a pioneer of the science of information theory. He is best known for creating Huffman coding, which was an innovative method of designing prefix codes for lossless data compression for a given input. He is also one of the pioneers in the field of mathematical origami. He was an expert in a rare specialized field. Someone who is hired to be such a specialist wouldn’t need... (more)
