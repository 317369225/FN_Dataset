I have developed a lossless compression algorithm which is more efficient than Huffman coding in some cases. Should I publish it as a journal paper?
Generic compression formats, like 7z, rar, and zip, contains file of any kind, so they must rely on lossless compression to guarantee any input bit is extracted exactly the same with no loss of information. Lossless compression uses statistical models to map the input to a smaller output eliminating redundancy in the http://data.In this way the output carry exactly all the information featured by the input in less bytes, and can be expanded when needed to a 1:1 copy of the original data, which is a fundamental property for storing some types of data - i.e. a software, a database.
