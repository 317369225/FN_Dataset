What is the relationship between a Huffman code and the Fibonacci series?
If you construct a Huffman tree with weights proportional to the Fibonacci series (excluding 0): 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, … Then you’ll see that the resulting tree is maximally unbalanced: every internal node has at least one leaf descendent. Consequently the nodes labelled “1” will have a very high depth: if we include the first d+1  d+1 Fibonacci terms in the tree, then the 1 nodes will have depth d  d . There are many more sequences of numbers that yield such an unbalanced tree, but the Fibonacci sequence achieves this with the flattest possible distribution: it answers the question “what is the larges...
