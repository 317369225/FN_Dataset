How does the DEFLATE compression algorithm work?
I support Al Klein's answer. This is something that can be and should be googled. You ask how it works exactly, you ask about Gzip and deflate. Gzip is based on deflate but is not a plain implementation of the deflate algorithm. It has many details. I can give you a very small explanation of deflate here just because it might help others get started. Deflate is a combination of LZ77 and Huffman codes. LZ77 is an algorithm designed to compress repeated sequences of characters, for example you can replace "internet" with a pair pointing to the offset where that sequence appeared before and... (more)
