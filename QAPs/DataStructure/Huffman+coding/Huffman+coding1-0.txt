What exactly is a Huffman coding tree?
It is one of the lossless compression method. Loss less means that there is no loss of data in compression nor while retrieving the original data. In this algorithm, The character that occurs the most, gets the smallest code. Huffman coding tree is built in order to calculate these codes. Huffman coding tree is a binary tree. From a text, character and their occurrences are calculated and are sorted in increasing order. First two nodes, i.e, characters with lowest frequency are removed from the list and combined in one node and their frequencies are also added.... (more)
