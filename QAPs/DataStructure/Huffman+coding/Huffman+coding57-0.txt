What are some examples of problems for which a priority queue proves useful?
Dijkstra's algorithm (single source shortest path; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dij... ) is one. Another is if you want to get the largest N items out of a bunch of sorted lists (each of length roughly N), you can use a min heap as a priority queue. Walk down all of the lists in parallel, pushing items onto the heap if they're larger than the current min, and popping the min off whenever there are more than N items in the heap. You can terminate the walk down each list when its value is less than the current min in the heap. There are some bad cases but on average that ends up taking about O(... (more)
