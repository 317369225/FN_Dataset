What exactly is a Huffman coding tree?
First let's talk about coding trees in general. You don't really need coding trees if you want to transmit only a single message. For every possible message, you just come up with some code word, any sequence of ones and zeroes that is not yet used for another message will do, and that's the end of it. However, there is a problem when you transmit a sequence of messages: how would the receiver of your code stream know where one message ends and the next one begins? For example, suppose we use a code where "monkey" is encoded as 110 and "discombobulating" as 11010. Upon receiving 110, you w... (more)
