What is the maximum possible word length for a Huffman code?
it depends on the frequency of the word in the string plus how tree is formed for finding compressed version of the letter or character. still if we think. H is a height of a tree. N is numbers of nodes. H= floor( lg(N) ) = ceil( (lg(N+1) - 1) ) //as H is integer so a approx. word of length H can be formed. 136 Views
