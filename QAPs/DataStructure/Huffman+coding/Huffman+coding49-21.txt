What are the 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm problems?
Top 10 algorithms will be very difficult to choose, and will not do justice to other awesome algorithms. So, I will list out few important algorithms and data structure one should know â€“ Insertion sort or Selection sort or Bubble sort Merge Sort, Quicksort Binary Search Breadth First Search (BFS) Depth First Search (DFS) Lee algorithm | Shortest path in a Maze Flood fill Algorithm...
