What do you think if a senior software developer can't write code?
Software development is about solving problems and expressing ideas in code. If you cannot write code then you are not a software developer. There are practicing computer scientists who do not write much, if any code, but most can, especially if they obtained their PhD in the last 40 years. There are also senior-level development and management positions that involve more design and architecture work than coding. In my experience, most of the people who attain such positions are, or a one time were highly competent coders. 1.6k Views Â· 8 Upvotes
