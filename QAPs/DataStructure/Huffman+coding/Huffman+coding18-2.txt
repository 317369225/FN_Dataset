Typically, how long is compressing an image using Huffman coding?
Huffman coding is not a particularly slow process. However, reading an image can make your code slower. Iâ€™d like to suggest that you evaluate the way you are analyzing your image. A professor of mine, who works heavily in the field of machine vision, told us during a lecture that calling getter and setter methods can cause execution time to slow down (in C# at least). In addition to calling a method, the bounds are checked, and the result placed in a neat little data structure before returning. As this must happen for every pixel, twice, the slowdown compounds itself. He countered this by usi... (more)
