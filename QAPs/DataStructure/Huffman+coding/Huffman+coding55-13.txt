What do you think if a senior software developer can't write code?
Though the developer word shouldn’t be in his title... He’s smart... In the sense that; he can find the right people to get his coding work done for him, without raising any suspicions, and can most likely understand their codes to a decent extent, for instant debugging. He’s a theoretical software developer (If it’s a real thing), basically. Such people are mostly leaders (thus; the senior role) who assign and monitor developers that CAN code, or software entrepreneurs. 538 Views · 2 Upvotes
