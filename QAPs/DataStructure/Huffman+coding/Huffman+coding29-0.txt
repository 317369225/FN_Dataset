I have developed a lossless compression algorithm which is more efficient than Huffman coding in some cases. Should I publish it as a journal paper?
Huffman is a very simple lossless coding scheme and very easy to beat. Most modern audio and video compression algorithms use some version of arithmetic, Golomb/Rice coding (Golomb coding ). For example, AVC and HEVC use CABAC coding. In general, coding algorithms are selected and optimized based on the typical probability distribution of your data. You can certainly try to publish it, but the reviewers will expect that you compare it with the “state of the art,” not just Huffman. 341 Views · 4 Upvotes · Answer requested by Washik Al Azad
