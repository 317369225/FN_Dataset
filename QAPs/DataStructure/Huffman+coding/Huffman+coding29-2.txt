I have developed a lossless compression algorithm which is more efficient than Huffman coding in some cases. Should I publish it as a journal paper?
Before writing a paper I would do a few things. First, test your program on some benchmarks to see how it compares with other programs. Here are a few that I maintain. Large Text Compression Benchmark Silesia Open Source Compression Benchmark 10 GB Compression Benchmark Second, review the current state of the art if you havenâ€™t already. I wrote a summary that you might find helpful. Data Compression Explained Third, I would publish the source code and invite comments on the forum http://encode.ru/ This is probably the biggest forum for lossless data compression research.
