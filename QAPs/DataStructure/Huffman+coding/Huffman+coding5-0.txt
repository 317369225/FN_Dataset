Why do we use huffman coding?
Today, we mostly don’t because it’s not very good for most general compression tasks — there are far better alternatives available. In the past, it was regarded as a reasonably good compression algorithm and it was easy to implement and understand. Prior to 1978, when the first Lempel-Ziv compression paper came out, its performance was regarded as good. So pre-1978 technologies like fax use Huffman encoding. Lempel-Ziv-Welch, the “zip” algorithm that offers the best lossless compression, was covered by a patent for a while which made it problematic to use. So Huffman was a reasonable “good en... (more)
