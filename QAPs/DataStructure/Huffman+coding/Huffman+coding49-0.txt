What are the 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm problems?
Dynamic Programming (DP) appears to account for a plurality (some estimate up to a third) of contest problems. Of course, DP is also not a single algorithm that you can just learn once and retain, so maybe this doesn't answer your question. I suppose it also depends on whether you consider data structures in the same category as algorithms. There are certainly some data structures that you should be familiar with if you want to do well in programming competitions. The most important ones are range trees (variously known as interval trees or segment trees) and binary indexed trees (BITs), a... (more)
