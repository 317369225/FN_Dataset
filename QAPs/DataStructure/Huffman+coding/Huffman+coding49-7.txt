What are the 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm problems?
Some quotes from my email communication with some Topcoder top 10 guys five years ago: From my experience, you don't really need to know that many advanced algorithms, not even in the ICPC world finals. It's much more about just realizing which algorithm in your arsenal you should be using on a specific problem, implementation details etc. And the only way to get that practice is to solve many, many problems - like 1000+ or so, just in order to speed up your coding skills, improve the implementation ...
