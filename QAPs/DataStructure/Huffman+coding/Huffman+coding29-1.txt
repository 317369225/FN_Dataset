I have developed a lossless compression algorithm which is more efficient than Huffman coding in some cases. Should I publish it as a journal paper?
I would do a bit of literature search first. Wikipedia has 88 pages about lossless compression algorithms: Category:Lossless compression algorithms Your algorithm might be similar to one of those, or entirely new. I donâ€™t know. You are in a good position to tell. I believe that sending your algorithm for review in a journal would also identify if you have developed a new algorithm or reconstructed an old one. But doing this yourself is quicker IMO. EDIT: You may also want to consider sending this as a conference paper. The turnaround time on these is usually shorter, and their importance in th... (more)
