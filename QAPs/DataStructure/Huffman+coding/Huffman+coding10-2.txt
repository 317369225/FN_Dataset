How do I calculate the code word length using Huffman Coding?
The information theory is related to the concepts of statistical properties of messages / sources, channels, noise interference etc. The information theory is used for mathematical modeling and analysis of the communication systems, following two main points are resolved: 1). The irreducible complexity below which the signal can not be compressed. 2). The transmission rate for reliable communication over a noisy channel. Huffman coding also uses the same principle. This type of coding makes average number of binary digits per message nearly equal to Entropy ( average bits of information per m... (more)
