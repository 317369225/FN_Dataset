What do you think if a senior software developer can't write code?
You are not a senior software developer if you can’t code. Why? Because of the title itself, it includes the word developer, as in, someone who develops software. That doesn’t mean you can’t have a senior computer scientist who can’t code much (Or at all, I guess) but a software developer has to be able to develop software. 971 Views · 6 Upvotes
