How do I calculate the code word length using Huffman Coding?
I assume the codeword is created from binary alphabets (0,1). In that case, that log is log base 2. I am more confused about the use of square brackets rather than floor/ceiling. Taking the integral part of the number, and adding 1 makes sense, since you cannot have fractional codeword lengths for a given symbol. Else you can simply take ceiling function without adding 1. However in your case for example for the first symbol, information content is log(1/0.1) = 3.3 , which is the minimum required number of bits, i.e assigning more than 4 (in your case it is 5 ) is pretty wasteful. Anyways, as f... (more)
