What are the 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm problems?
I see people telling good things but they focus on the algorithm itself and it's right and  wrong at same time. I know the question is about algorithms, but probably what you looking for is "what most important thing one should know to solve most challenges/puzzles". "Solutions/algorithms emerge from  the right strategy, not the inverse" 1) When you face a real problem you barely know what you trying to solve, the first thing you think is about the strategy. The 3 strategies you MUST totally understand are: Greedy... (more)
