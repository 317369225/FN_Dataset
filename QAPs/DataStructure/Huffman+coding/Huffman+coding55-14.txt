What do you think if a senior software developer can't write code?
There are plenty of senior developers who aren't great coders. Coding is only one part of the job. I worked with a very senior engineer at one of the most famous tech companies in the world. His code is not that great. However, his technical knowledge, his methodical approach to identifying bugs and planning new features, along with his work ethic are what make him great. All that is to say, I look at the total package: they might not be a great coder, but they may still be an amazing engineer. 970 Views Â· 9 Upvotes
