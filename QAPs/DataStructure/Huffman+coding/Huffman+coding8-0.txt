How can I generate Huffman code tree?
I am suspicious that this is homework, but I will nudge you in the right direction. 1) treat each letter (and ~) as a one node tree holding the probability. 2) take the two smallest probability trees and make them leaf nodes of a three node tree.  The root of the new tree contains the sum of the probailities of the leaves. 3) Now you have six trees instead of 7, one with 3 nodes and five with 1 node. 4) Continue in this fashion, merging the two smallest trees into a new tree until there is only one tree left.  That is your Huffman tree.  It is not unique. 324 Views · 3 Upvotes
