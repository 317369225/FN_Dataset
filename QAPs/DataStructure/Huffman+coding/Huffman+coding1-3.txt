What exactly is a Huffman coding tree?
Huffman Coding tree is the tree used in Huffman Coding algorithm which is a losslesss data compression algorithm. Huffman Coding algorithm is developed by David A. Huffman in 1952 while he was a Ph.D. student at MIT. This algorithm is widely used in mainstream compression formats such as JPEG, PNG, MP3, GZIP etc.  The steps for creating the Huffman Tree are as following - Step 1: Sort given symbols according to their frequency. Then we create a Binary Tree using following steps - Step 2: From the frequency table, select two symbols S1 and S2 with least frequencies(say ‘f1’ and ‘f2’). Create n... (more)
