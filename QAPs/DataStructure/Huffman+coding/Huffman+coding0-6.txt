What is an intuitive explanation of Huffman coding?
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm based upon occurrence. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. The most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent character gets the largest code. If a message has more number of repeating characters then it will took relatively less transmission bits. Let me explain you how it is done. Suppose we have to send a text “Tonight lit a bright light” to a second party. Now with the help of standard AsCII bit r... (more)
