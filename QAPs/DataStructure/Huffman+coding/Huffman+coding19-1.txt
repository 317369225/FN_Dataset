What does it mean when we can compress one text file more than other using huffman coding?
Huffman Coding comes in two basic flavors: Static and Adaptive.  In Static Huffman, each character has a predefined key based upon its general frequency within the English language - sort of like Morse Code.  The most common characters (such as e) have the shortest keys while least-common characters (such as x and z) have the longest. The key strength and weakness of this scheme should be obvious:  It offers ungodly compression ratios when the source file is comprised primarily of most-common characters, but can wind up significantly larger than the original if it contains a large numbe...
