Typically, how long is compressing an image using Huffman coding?
No one can give you a definite answer without knowing the concrete numbers of what you call “a lot of time” and “larger dimensions”. Also, we would need to know what hardware are you running your software on, including your CPU speed, memory speed, and disk read and write speeds. Have you studied the source code for existing image compression algorithms? You will learn a lot if you do, rather than “reinventing the wheel”. Often RAM and disk I/O are the limiting factors. Do some simple calculations to determine what percentage of your time is consumed by reading and writing to disk. Have you t... (more)
