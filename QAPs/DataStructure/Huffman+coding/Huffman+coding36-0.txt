Can I do a project on Huffman coding for my 3rd semester? Will it gain me good marks?
I wouldn't rate it as a very difficult project for 3rd semester but only as an average difficulty project!  I cannot tell about others but if I were your instructor, you cannot expect anything more than a B+! But then again, I am NOT your instructor! If you really are serious (which I gather you are because of your question on Quora), you will pick something a little more difficult and challenging.  Best of luck! 204 Views
