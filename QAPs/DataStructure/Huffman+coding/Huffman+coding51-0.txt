How does the DEFLATE compression algorithm work?
The data is compressed as a combination of encoded bytes ("literals") and matching strings, where the strings are to be found in the preceding uncompressed data.  Each match is a length and a distance back from the current position.  The literals and lengths are combined into a single Huffman code, and the distances in another Huffman code.  Longer lengths and distances fall into bins, followed by extra bits to determine which entry in the bin to use.   The stream consists of a series of literal/length codes, where a length code is followed by a distance code.  A distance may be less than t...
