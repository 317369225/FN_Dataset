What is an intuitive explanation of Huffman coding?
There are some real life occurences where ideas very similar to huffman encoding have been used (not exactly Huffman encoding, but a parallel mindeset). RISC processors: times ago processor instructions were getting more and more complex. At a time someone care to count how many instructions of each kind were executed when running a typical software. It occured that some instructions were executed very often (like 90% of the time) while some others were quite rare. Then processors designers changed instruction set to make the frequent ones short and fast... and completely removed the rare ... (more)
