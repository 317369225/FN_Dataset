Why is the Huffman coding algorithm considered as a greedy algorithm?
Huffman's greedy algorithm look at the occurrence of each character and store it as a binary string in an optimal way.The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. We create a binary tree and operate on it in bottom-up manner so that the least two frequent characters are as far as possible from the root. In this way, the most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent character gets the largest code. 1.5k Views · 6 Upvotes · Answer requested by Aswin Venugopal
