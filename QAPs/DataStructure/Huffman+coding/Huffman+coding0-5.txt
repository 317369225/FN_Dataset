What is an intuitive explanation of Huffman coding?
There are two parts of the intuition to understand: The first: how is it efficient? It is more efficient because it uses fewer bits for more frequently used symbols, and more bits for less frequently used symbols. The second: If the symbols all have different lengths, how can you figure out where one symbol begins and the other one ends? Huffman codes have a clever way to make this work:Â  No symbol is a prefix of another. Because of this, you don't need markers to separate the symbols, making the coding very efficient. Using a coding tree is an easy way to make the prefix property work,... (more)
