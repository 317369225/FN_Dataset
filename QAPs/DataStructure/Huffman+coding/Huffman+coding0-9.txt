What is an intuitive explanation of Huffman coding?
At the time of transmission,data need to be encoded and would be converted into binary format with values 0 and 1.If all the character data is converted to binary format of same length irrespective of their priority,length of the entire code will be large. So,huffman encoding follows a rule of assigning short length code for most frequently used words and longer length code for less frequently used words.Thus the length of entire code gets reduced. The above picture has table with data bcade containing 5 characters b,c,a,d,e with priorities assigned to it. b and c have least priority of 13... (more)
