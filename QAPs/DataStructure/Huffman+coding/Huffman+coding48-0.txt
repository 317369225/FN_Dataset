How does Huffman's method of coding/compressing text differ from Shannon-Fano method?
Huffman coding and Shannon-Fano method for text compression are based on similar algorithm which is based on variable-length encoding algorithms. Additionally, both the techniques use a prefix code based approach on a set of symbols along with their probabilities. However there are two major differences : Huffman is optimal (Shubhanka Bhandari's answer to How do we prove that the Huffman coding algorithm is optimal?) while Shannon-Fano is sub-optimal. Shannon-Fano does not achieve the lowest possible expected code word length like Huffman Coding. The set of probabilities {0.35, 0.17, 0.17, 0.1... (more)
