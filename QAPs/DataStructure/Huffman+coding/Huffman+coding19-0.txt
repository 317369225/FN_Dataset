What does it mean when we can compress one text file more than other using huffman coding?
When you say "using Huffman coding", you are leaving out one key piece of information. Huffman coding is an entropy encoding technique - it codes symbols using variable lengths which depend on the probability of a symbol. Every entropy encoder is used in conjunction with a model. The model determines the probabilities for different characters. The characteristics of the model are what determine how much compression occurs. The simplest model might be a fixed order-0 model. You might sample a lot of English text saved in ASCII format, then create a probability table that a given character... (more)
