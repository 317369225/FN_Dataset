What are the 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm problems?
It is difficult to handpick 10 algorithms given the different types of algorithmic problems there are. But one must know following topics in order to solve most algorithm problems: 1. Arrays - Searching in an array/sorted array/sorted rotated array, Sorting of arrays, pattern matching. Here is a playlist on array problems: 2. Linked List problems - creation, reversal, detect a loop, find intersection of 2 linked lists. Playlist on linked list problems:... (more)
