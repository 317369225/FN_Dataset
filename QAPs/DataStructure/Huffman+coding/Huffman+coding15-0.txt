Does Facebook use Huffman coding to compress the chats?
Precisely more sophisticated versions of Huffman coding is used for text or chat compression in the Messengers like Facebook, whtsapp ,Viber etc. DEFLATE (PKZIP's algorithm) and multimedia codecs such as JPEG and MP3 have a front-end model and quantization followed by the use of prefix codes like Huffman coding. Even though most applications use pre-defined variable-length codes rather than codes designed using Huffman's algorithm but the fundamental principle remains the same. Let me explain you how it is done. Suppose we have to send a text “Tonight lit a bright light” to a second party. Now with the help of standard AsCII bit representation technique it will take 208 bits but after Huffman coding it will take only 86 bits to send the same message. In the following video It is throughly explained that how we got 60 % of data saving for the same transmission with the help of Huffman coding 479 Views · 9 Upvotes
