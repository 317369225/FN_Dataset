How do I create a RDF database?
Your use of "create" is ambiguous; however, let me attempt to interpret what you mean.  You basically have three options: 1. Create an RDF database in an existing triple store like Sesame or Apache Jena.  To do this you simply add RDF statements (Subject, Predicate and Object) to your named database in the triple store. 2. Create your on RDF database (your own custom triple store) via a relational database backend.  This typically entails creating a simple schema where you have a table with a Subject, Predicate and Object column (there are open source relational schemas available).  Then each row is an RDF statement. 3. Create your own RDF database (your own custom triple store) in a No-SQL type database like a graph database.  Node-link-Node is basically equivalent to Subject, Predicate, Object. I recommend you go with Option #1.  Best wishes!
