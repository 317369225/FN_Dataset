What are some papers demonstrating the use of representation theory in computer science?Papers in any sub-field would be interesting, but of particular interest are those in machine learning.
Like Sitan, I am not certain about applications to machine learning, but I can provide another example where representation theory is utilized at a much more fundamental level: the theory of formal langauge and automata. In particular, a language L  that is a subset of the free monoid on some alphabet Σ  can be viewed as a representation of the free monoid over some other monoid. There are a lot of interesting results in this subfield, one of which is the fact that a language is regular if and only if it has a finite representation.
