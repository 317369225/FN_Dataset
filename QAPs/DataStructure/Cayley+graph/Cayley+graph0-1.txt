Abstract Algebra: What is a Cayley graph?
If  the elements of a group [1] G are permutations of a given set P (permutation group),it can be represented with a pair of countable sets Vertex set(V) that has elements of G : g i   and Edge set s.t.  g i ∗  (one of  ends of an edge element) = another end. Any position of a permutation puzzle can be made to look like  another just by relabelling the pieces of puzzle[2] ,i.e. vertices of the cayley graph taken from it , not because the puzzle is special, but because the corresponding group is a permutation group.
