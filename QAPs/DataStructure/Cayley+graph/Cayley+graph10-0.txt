Database problem.                   if we have 3 tables brand, companies, employee say we have a brands, b companies and c employees(in lacs) so brand has companies and companies have employees.Now you have to search an employee who belongs to company x and brand z.Do you have any faster approach other than using inner join and all?
I've asked Marin Dimitrov to answer this question; he will have more specifics than I do. The questioner describes a relationship problem. In general, getting away from tables and using graphs instead will simplify the relationship analysis. This is the method that Facebook Graph and Google Knowledge Graph use. Here's how this sort of thing would be done using the Google Cayley graph database and Go for a movie-actor relationship analysis using a Freebase schema and KeyLines network visualization: Visualizing the Cayley Graph Database with KeyLines network visualization Updated 31 Aug 2014 • Asked to answer by Anonymous
