How can solving a Rubik's Cube be framed as a graph problem?And what are some interesting algorithms to solve it?
The graph modeling of the problem is the following: 1- Nodes are the states of the cube. 2- There is an edge between any two nodes x and y. If you can go from x to y or from y to x in one single move. Then you can get the shortest path between the current state and the initial state to the final state using any known shortest path algorithm.
