What are some good examples of using Semantic Technologies for Enterprise Metadata Management?Or in more general terms to get better view of how data, processes, applications and capabilities are inter-related within a large enterprise.
Linked data promises to be an agile approach for data AND content integration (Enterprise Linked Data Integration). RDF graphs have the ability to represent information which was originally stored in documents or CMS as well as in XML or relational data models. Based on controlled vocabularies and its derived entity extraction modules + entity linkers + rules engines (e.g. Jena) rich enterprise knowledge/data graphs can be semi-automatically generated and permanently synched and linked with legacy data. Powerful quad stores like Virtuoso or OWLIM and its SPARQL 1.1 endpoints are used to build APIs and end-user applications on top of it (by outperforming almost any relational database or indexing engine). PoolParty Semantic Suite - PoolParty Semantic Integrator is a platform which offers a full stack of technologies mentioned above: - taxonomy & ontology management - linked data management: entity linking, linked data harvesting - text mining & entity extraction - XML to RDF mapping - relational databases to RDF mapping - storage layer (Virtuoso / OWLIM) - semantic document index - SPARQL 1.1 - REST API - scheduler and rich set of connectors (UnifiedViews) - integration with SharePoint, Confluence, Drupal, WordPress - various visualization and end-user applications
