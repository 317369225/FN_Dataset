Why is Freebase proprietary?It would seem quite sensible to make the software behind Freebase free, as Freebase is part of an open data. But Freebase was always proprietary from the start. Why is that so?
Freebase was originally owned by Metaweb, which utilized Freebase's database as part of its core business strategy. It made sense for the data of Freebase to be open to modification, as that would improve the quality of the data used in Metaweb's business. Making the database technology itself free however did not serve Metaweb's purposes. The Freebase wiki says "Metaweb has no announced plans to open source graphd or even to sell it as a commercial product. Much of it is kept secret." (See Graphd - Freebase) Now that Metaweb has been acquired by Google though, one might think that Google would open-source the database, as they have done with many of their other projects. The only reason I can think of for why they haven't is that they are somehow using this technology as part of their Knowledge Graph.
