What are interesting characteristics of graph databases that would incline you to buy one product as oposed to any other?I am refering to query language, high performance, good optimisation technology, out of core capabilities, administration tools, etc.
Having never needed such a database or worked with one, I would first carefully consider whether I really need one for the task at hand, something that fits the problem and is faster that conventional methods and stable enough. The sparse Wikipedia article, makes rather broad assumptions about speed compared to relational databases. The implementation may look nothing like the conceptual model and have performance issues that is oblivious to someone that understands the concept but has no idea how it must be implemented, in disk, memory structures, etc, where implementationÂ  for the top relational databases are highly advanced. So, to answer the question, I would firstly need a graph database that is better and faster for the problem than a top relational database, and reliable enough. I suspect a graph database might be able to scale better than a conventional one, for a very large dataset, depending on the nature of the task, that is the most interesting characteristic for me.
