How can one explain linear algebra's Cayley-Hamilton theorem to a 4 year-old boy?Note: this question contains partial humor and it is not expected that one will find a completely satisfactory answer. However, I am interested in seeing how close we may get.
Consider your poop. Let us say your poop comes in only one shape, example cube, but can be any size. Now, consider a toilet. The toilet is designed for a specific shape and size. It can flush other sizes of cubes, but it won't completely go away in one flush. The toilet was made for that specific type of poop and the possibility of that specific type of poop was why the toilet was made.
