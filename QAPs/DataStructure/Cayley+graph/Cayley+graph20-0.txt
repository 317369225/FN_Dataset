How does sparsity of a matrix affect matrix inversion?I want to know the time complexity involved in computing the inverse of matrix. In general it is O(n^3) where is the matrix size (n rows / n columns). But what if the matrix is sparse, can the time complexity be expressed as a function of non-zero elements in the matrix?
Unfortunately no because there is no guarantee that the inverse of a sparse matrix is still sparse, and quite frequently it is not. Once you go through enough steps of an inversion the number of nonzeros-and therefore the number of operations- will grow until you are doing an O(n 3 )  algorithm. If you don't need the actual inverse (and most of the time you don't) then iterative or factorization techniques can usually avoid the full cost of an inversion.
