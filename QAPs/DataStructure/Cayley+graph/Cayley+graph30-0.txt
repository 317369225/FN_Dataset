What are good ways to prepare for GATE(CS) while having a job?I work as software developer and spend daily more than 8 hours at work. So how can I prepare for GATE  2014. I have more than a year.
First Thing, Get enrolled in weekend/part time classes Office work and stress won't let you concentrate fully towards your goal. Sometimes you will want to drop the plan. Classes provide you a direction along with a consistent plan for preparation. You get motivation. You've friends to discuss with. You have professors who can help you if you get stuck. Second, Create a Plan Weekend classes aren't enough. Put in at least half an hour everyday to review what you were taught in the classes. Collect new problems, solve them, ask people for help. There are 12-14 subjects in GATE. Manage your schedule accordingly. Stay Active You can find GATE communities and forums online. Hear what other people are saying and doing. Keep yourself up-to-date with stuff like change in syllabus or exam pattern. Meanwhile give good attention to coaching classes and preparations at home. Expertise in the Subjects Going for GATE and preparing your your way towards MTech means you want to ponder deep into your subjects and make them your life. Leave GATE besides. You'll really enjoy your MTech life if you're perfect with the basic courses you were taught during your undergrad. No one will teach that again. You've got over one year of time. If you are from CS background, everything from Data Structures to Operating Systems to Computer Networks to Discrete Maths should be on your fingertips. Lastly, ask yourself, Do you really want to go for GATE? I've met people who've spent months preparing for it and even got good AIR but later they found that M.Tech is not their thing. Many people move to other fields. Many believe that they've a good scope of growth while staying with their current job. Think... Prepare well. Best of luck! Updated 12 Apr 2013 • View Upvotes
