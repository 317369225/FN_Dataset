What is the importance of graph theory for a mathematician?
This question, in its current form, is somewhat unclear to me. Graph theory is a subset of mathematics, which is important to mathematicians who study graph theory for the obvious reason that it is their field of study, much in the same way algebra is important to a topologist. For mathematicians in general, graph theory represents a major area of discrete mathematics, a topic that is often overlooked for topics involving, in one way or another, continuity. Graph theory has quite a few connections to other fields of mathematics. Maybe the most significant connection of this sort is that with algebra, particularly linear algebra, for instance in the study of spectral graph theory where one studies a graph in terms of eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and more, and group theory, for instance using automorphism groups to investigate graphs with symmetry as a major concern. Cayley graphs are a particularly nice example of such a connection.
