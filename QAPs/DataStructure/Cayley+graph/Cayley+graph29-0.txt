Wow, this was pretty hard to remember. Luckily, somebody had made a list of books I had studied from and posted it here [1]. The relevant excerpt from the post: 1. Engineering Mathematics : 1.1 Mathematical Logic -> a] Tremblay and Manohar, b] Russell and Norvig 1.2 Probability -> Gupta and Kapur 1.3 Set Theory and Algebra -> Kolman, Busby 1.4 Combinatorics -> a] Hall and Knight b] Internet materials 1.5 Graph Theory -> Narasingh Deo 1.6 Linear Algebra -> "Higher Engineering Mathematics" by BS Grewal 1.7 Numerical Methods -> "Higher Engineering Mathematics" by BS Grewal 1.8 Calculus -> "Higher Engineering Mathematics" by BS Grewal 2. Theory of Computation 2.1 Formal Languages and Automata Theory -> John Martin 2.2 Analysis of Algorithms and Computation Complexity -> a] Horowitz and Sahni, b] Sedgewick, c] Lewis and Papadimitrou 3. Computer Hardware 3.1 Digital Logic -> John Yarbrough 3.2 Computer Organisation -> John Hayes 4. Software Systems 4.1 Data Structures -> "Data Structure using C and C++" by Aaron Tenenbaum et al. 4.2 Programming Methodology -> Kerninghan and Ritchie 4.3 Algorithms for problem solving -> a] Horowitz and Sahni, b] Sedgewick 4.4 Compiler Design -> Aho and Ullman 4.5 Operating Systems -> a] Galvin and Silberchatz, b] Andrew Tanenbaum, c] William Stallings 4.6 Databases -> "Database System Concepts" by Korth and Sudershan 4.7 Computer Networks -> Tanenbaum [1] Plz guide me to choose books for preparation of Py Miss Manju, whoever you may be, thank you very much.
