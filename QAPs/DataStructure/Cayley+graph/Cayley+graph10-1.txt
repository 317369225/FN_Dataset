Database problem.                   if we have 3 tables brand, companies, employee say we have a brands, b companies and c employees(in lacs) so brand has companies and companies have employees.Now you have to search an employee who belongs to company x and brand z.Do you have any faster approach other than using inner join and all?
I don't think there would be much other possibilities in an normalized database instead of joining tables together. If you don't like to change your database model you can think of using Redis or something like that as a cache. You can cache your assignment and select your data with SQL using the IN statement for example.
