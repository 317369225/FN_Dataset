What are some papers demonstrating the use of representation theory in computer science?Papers in any sub-field would be interesting, but of particular interest are those in machine learning.
I'm not sure about applications to machine learning, but in the study of pseudorandomness, representation theory comes up when we talk about small-bias spaces, basically distributions on {0,1} n   which fool parity tests, as it offers a way to extend Fourier analytic methods to studying small-bias sets inside nonabelian groups. If we think of parity tests as characters, we can ask what happens when we generalize to higher-dimensional representations. Why care about generalizing from bitstrings to elements of an abstract group to elements of a nonabelian group? One cute fact is that ϵ  -biased sets over groups correspond to Cayley graphs of spectral expansion 1−ϵ  , i.e. graphs where random walks quickly "mix" the likelihoods of reaching each vertex. Fourier analysis allows the study of the expansion of graphs corresponding to abelian groups, but a nonabelian analogue may give better expanders, and studying them requires the representation-theoretic viewpoint sketched above. And while we're on the topic of expanders, Margulis famously came up with the first explicit families of expander graphs by making use of the fact that SL(n,Z) has the so-called Kazhdan's property (T), (very) roughly speaking a property concerning unitary representations and their invariant vectors.
