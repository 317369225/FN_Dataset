Is it possible to draw Cayley graphs of algebra with two operations?
Yes and no. Suppose our algebra is A=⟨A;f 1 ,f 2 ⟩  , where the two operations are binary. Suppose further that we've chosen a generating set X⊂A  . Then it's always possible to define a directed multigraph structure on A  where there is a directed edge labeled by f i   and x  from a  to f i (x,a)  . (This assumes that the generators are thought of as acting on the left.) The question is whether this structure gives either new mathematical information, or is visually helpful for someone trying to understand the structure of A  . In general, the answer will be no, even for algebras with only one binary operation -- the symmetry properties of groups are what force a lot of the nice, geometric regularity properties of group Cayley graphs.
