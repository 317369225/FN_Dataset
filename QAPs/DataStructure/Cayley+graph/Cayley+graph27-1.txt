What are some things about databases everyone does not understand?What are some important things people should understand about databases? 'Everyone' means everyone who uses it (software engineers, developers, database administrators..).
Most widely popular database choices such as MySQL and PostgreSQL can store a lot more data than most people think before you need to consider scaling and sharding. They also don't require as many resources as many think they do, you can get quite far on a cheap VPS which all come with solid state drives as standard now (the good hosts anyway). The reality is MySQL for example can store tens of millions of rows of data without breaking a sweat and it'll remain fast as well. Provided you have the appropriate indexes setup and your queries aren't greedy, you can query a dataset of a million rows very quickly. I couldn't count the number of times I've seen questions asking how to scale MySQL before it was needed (premature optimisation) on Quora. It still surprises some when I show people a site I built that scrapes multiple data sources and it is only using one MySQL database and it's already got 65+ Million records in there and it doesn't skip a beat (yet). Eventually I'll split the database but I don't need too yet.
