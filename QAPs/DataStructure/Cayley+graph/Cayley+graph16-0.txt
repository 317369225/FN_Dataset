Does Kruskal algorithm generate all possible spanning trees of a labelled graph with equal probability?Assuming initial ordering of edges is random.
No K₅ is a simple counterexample. K₅ has 10 edges and hence the edges can be permuted in 10! ways. Using Cayley's formula, K₅ has 5³ spanning trees. Since 10! is not divisible by 5³, all spanning trees cannot be generated with equal probability.
