How can one explain linear algebra's Cayley-Hamilton theorem to a 4 year-old boy?Note: this question contains partial humor and it is not expected that one will find a completely satisfactory answer. However, I am interested in seeing how close we may get.
Consider the set of "child prodigies in mathematics." Now, consider the graph formed by plotting "year of birth" (x-axis) against "age at which they are known to have understood university-level mathematics" (y-axis). Now consider the sequence formed by the "lowest prodigy again documented by year x" As you'll see, we have some points for consideration: Pascal, born 1623, level of maths knowledge achieved at age 16 Ramanujan, born 1887, level of maths knowledge achieved at age 11 Lawrence, born 1971, level of maths knowledge achieved at age 10 If we plot these and extend until Y=4, we can see that we are unlikely to have a sufficiently gifted 4-year-old [1] until approximately 700+ years [2] into the future. Either that, or I have a truly marvellous proof that will make it clear, but the margins on this screen are such that the text-entry box isn't wide enough to write it down this evening... [1] Boy or girl - Ruth Lawrence, after all, is female [2] It is left as an exercise to the reader to calculate a closer value
