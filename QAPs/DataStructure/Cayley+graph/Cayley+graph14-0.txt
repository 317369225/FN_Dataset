Graph Theory: When is CG(Z p ,{−1,1,−i,i})≅CG(Z p ,{−1,1,−j,j})  for j≠i  and j,i≢0modp  ? (p is prime)CG(G,S)  is the Cayley Graph on the group G with S as the  generating set.Z p   is the additive group modulo p.
It was shown that cyclic groups are CI-groups (see [1]). Therefore the two mentioned Cayley graphs are isomorphic if and only if there is a constant t∈Z p   such that if we multiply (in Z p   ) each element of the set {1,−1,i,−i}  by t  then we are getting the set {1,−1,j,−j}  . So 1⋅t=t∈{1,−1,j,−j}  . Since Z p   is a finite field and i≠j  , this happens if and only if i⋅j=±1  , or i=−j  . Reference: [1] Turner, J., Point-symmetric graphs with a prime number of points, J.
