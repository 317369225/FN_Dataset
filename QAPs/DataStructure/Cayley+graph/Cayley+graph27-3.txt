Huge issue is awareness about requirement to have proper database performance management and design for performance in place. Today's business users just expect database to be "magically" fast and scale indefinitely. Engineers hide from database performance issues behind ORM, JSON, NOSQL, etc, and in most of cases, past writing "okay" SQL do not see how it suddenly becomes a "show-stopper" when deployed into production. Many production DBAs are working in reactive mode and in majority of cases DBAs fire-fighting issues that could be prevented if attended early. With a great awareness about SQL/NOSQL database design, high availability and disaster recover, database performance is one the areas that modern Enterprise should put a great focus on and develop deep understanding Ron Warshawsky Enteros
