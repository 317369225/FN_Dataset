Is Cayley actually used by Google for their knowledge graph?The Cayley description reads: "Cayley is an open-source graph inspired by the graph database behind Freebase and Google's Knowledge Graph." Does this mean that Cayley resembles the graph database behind knowledge graph, or that it actually is the knowledge graph (perhaps with a couple of tweaks).
No.  The original Metaweb graph database engine was called graphd which is what Freebase was hosted on when Google acquired Metaweb.  It ran on a single large machine with the entire graph in memory.  After the acquisition the database engine was adapted to/re-hosted on Google technologies and infrastructure.  It seems likely that a distributed/sharded architecture to allow it to scale up in size to accommodate the size of the Knowledge Graph would have been a key addition at this point. Cayley is an open-source clean sheet implementation of a graph database by one of the key contributors to the two implementations described above, so it benefits from his expertise and experience, but otherwise doesn't have anything in common.
