What are some examples of some dead research fields?
In CS, the field of developing computer architectures optimized for functional programming seems pretty dead at the moment. There used to be quite a diverse set of projects in this vein 20-25 years ago, but they all got out-competed by variations on the Von Neumann model. The dream of the Lisp machine is mostly dead, at least from the perspective of hardware design. Then again, the field could spark back into life with the gradual ascension of FPGAs. In mathematics, I think a relevant example is the study of finite groups... because it's basically done. The field was completed by one of the most incredible theorems in modern mathematics, the classification of finite simple groups. (Simple groups are the "building blocks" of all finite group, so this is sufficient to fully characterize any finite group.) Apparently it's also a particularly favored field among prospective math grad students, who end up disappointed because there simply isn't enough research to be done there. Somebody I know actually dropped out of a PhD program at Berkeley with a masters with this as one of the reasons.
