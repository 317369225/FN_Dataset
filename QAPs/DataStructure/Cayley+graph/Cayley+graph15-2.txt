How do I create a RDF database?
I presume you are not asking about creating your own RDF DBMS - then the answer would be to put together a storage engine, an index, a SPARQL engine andÂ  a reasoner. However if all you want is to create a DB and to run a few examples, here is the order of steps: Select whatever product requires less learning. Say I used Stardog to experiment with Sparql and Ontologies. I believe MarkLogic 8 would be a contender due to good query console, if you don't need OWL. What you want is to download something, run the installer, start using it - as long as it has free development license. You have too many things to learn to concern yourself with complex configuration, APIs etc. Find an RDF dataset or convert your data to RDF - there are heaps of converters to RDF, plus it is not that hard to write one say in XSLT. Load your dataset - I presume in the platform you've selected it is done by one command line or a button. Start querying it. There are so many RDF systems, and some of them are so complex, you are running serious risk to spend a couple of years working hard without getting the essence of it. Resist such temptation, go to the key things the shortest way.
