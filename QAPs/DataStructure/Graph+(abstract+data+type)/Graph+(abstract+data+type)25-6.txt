How are students in Indian colleges taught programming?
If I had to explain how most people clear lab exams in one picture EDIT: Some people seem to be on about how it isn't this bad. It's worse. In my first semester I had a Basic C programming course. One of the questions in my final exam was to write a function to calculate the factorial of a number. Having studied C++ for 2 years already, it took me not more than 5-6 lines of code. I later found out that I got the lowest grade in my class. It's only recently that I figured out that one of my lines of code read num*=fact(num-1); or something to that effect and that the code we had been given was longer and didn't include *= as an operator. My final paper was graded 52/100 despite me knowing everything that came and finishing close to an hour before I had to submit my answer script. Ever since that day I haven't given a rat's ass. I used to love programming until coursework irreparably ruined it for me. I now know that toppers use the C:/Windows/Temp more than other people and that the reward for understanding and writing efficient code is a lower grade.   From wanting to become a software engineer, I would now settle for any job that would allow me to distance myself from a compiler.That is the reality of how engineers are taught programming Updated 25 Apr 2013 • View Upvotes
