Is a linked list linear in computer science? Why?
A (linked) list is the linear degenerate case of a Tree, which itself is a special case of a Graph. Note that the "linked" aspect is implementation, the abstract data type (ADT) is a List (ordered collection supporting sequential and random access). Edit: In computer science usually operations/algorithms are described as linear, etc, not data structures. For instance, add an item to an unsorted linked list is constant time O(1), as is inserting an item after an item you have the reference to. However, random access to an index (i.e. the "5th item") is linear because you have to start at the beginning of the list and countÂ  your way down. An array based implementation of the list would be almost the opposite.
