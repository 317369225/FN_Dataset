There is no way to automatically adapt a portrait image to a landscape box, without stretching it, cropping it or adding letterboxing. Really, there isn't. Also there is NO WAY to avoid that users steal images from your website. Disabling right click is not an option, and no, it's not so smart as you have think when you noticed this on your competitor's website. If you don't want users to steal your pictures, don't publish them on the Internet. Editing a website to make it multilanguage is not hard, but it will be a pain when the customer wants to add new buttons and messages. You'll finish translating new texts yourself to avoid asking him everytime.
