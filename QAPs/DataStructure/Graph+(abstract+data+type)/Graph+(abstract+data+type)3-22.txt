What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
Most people think "hackers" are socially inept teenagers toying away with their cool gadgets trying to break into NASA. Though the word "hackers" has been demeaned by the media, it represents people who like to build constructive things.  In the words of Eric S. Raymond: "There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments.  The members of this culture originated the term ‘hacker’.  Hackers built the Internet.  Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers make the World Wide Web work.  If you are part of this culture, if you have contributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you a hacker, you're a hacker".
