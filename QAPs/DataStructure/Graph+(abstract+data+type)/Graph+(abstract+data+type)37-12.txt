Is recursion actually useful? I can't find any reason to use it. Why do some people love to use it?
A lot of times it's just a stylistic choice. You can write a function and call it on its own output in a loop, or you could just have the function call itself. However, sometimes it can really be useful. The classic example of a recursive program is finding the nth Fibonacci number. Here it is: int f(n) { if (n == 0) return 0; if (n == 1) return 1; return f(n-1)+f(n-2); } However, this algorithm is O(2 n )  . We can make it O(n)  by introducing an array we pass around; if we have already calculated p(n), look it up; otherwise calculate it. Now, however, our code takes some explaining; we're passing around a list, so we have to be careful not to copy it, or it won't speed anything up. Now let's try it again, without recursion, keeping in mind our O(n)  goal: int f(n) { vector<int> fs(n); fs.push_back(0); fs.push_back(1); for (i=2; i<n; ++i) fs.push_back(fs[i-1]+fs[i-2]); return fs[n-1]; } It's O(n)  and is almost as easy to understand as the recursive version. Long story short: it doesn't matter. Some languages integrate it more than others. Write your code to be fast and clean, and don't worry about whether you use recursion.
