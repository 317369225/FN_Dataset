What are the applications of set theory in computer science?
I'd say that depends on what you mean by set theory. I'm not aware of any applications of set theory in the sense of the Axiom of Choice, different sizes of infinities, etc. But (finite) sets are useful abstract data types whenever you want to keep track of a collection of things and don't care about their order or multiplicity. For this purpose, sets can be implemented as hashtables under the hood so that individual elements can be added or checked for membership in constant time. As an example, when doing graph traversal, you may want to maintain a set of visited nodes so that you can avoid visiting the same node twice. EDIT: For more specific applications, take a look at the Examples section of the Wiki page for bloom filters.
