What is the most recommended coding language for creating full blown human AI?
There will be many languages involved, and as noted, some of which have not been created yet. Lisp was once the dominant language in AI, but many other languages now have nearly all of the AI-specific capabilities of Lisp. Current AI can be and is coded in nearly any modern language. Human-like AI will likely be something different. The term Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is the current vernacular for human-like AI. This also differentiates AGI from expert systems, some of which are already far better in their specialty than humans. High level modelling languages, such as Octave, are used to develop and test the algorithms. Once tested and refined, the algorithms are then re-coded into a lower level language, such as C, to improve efficiency. I suspect that an even lower level assembler-grade language will be developed to further improve efficiency and enable AGI-unique capabilities. In addition, there will be a multitude of languages used to create and maintain the corpora and other other elements that a core AGI engine will draw upon. Some of these bits have already appeared and will mature to the level needed for AGI.
