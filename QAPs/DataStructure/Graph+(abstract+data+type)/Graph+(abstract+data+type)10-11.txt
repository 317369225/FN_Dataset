Which book(s) and other resources would you recommend for a beginner to understand Data Structures in C++?Books which preferably are well written and provide good examples/problems to work on and understand concepts clearly?
Amazon.com: Classic Data Structures in C++ (9780201508895): Timothy A. Budd: Books While Weiss's book was the recommended one for the course when I took it, my library had run out of that (again!). And I came across this. Over the duration of the course I also had opportunity to study from Weiss's book, but I found Budd's book the better, more clear of the two.
