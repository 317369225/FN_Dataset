Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
College, at any level, is an exercise in building a good referenceÂ  library and learning to where to look for information when you need it. Its not so much about gaining knowledge of specific details, as it is learning what you don't know and how to find the right answer when you need it. And for most people, learning what they don't know is a huge undertaking.
