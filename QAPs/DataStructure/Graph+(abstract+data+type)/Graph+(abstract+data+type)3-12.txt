What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
That sometimes (actually very often), mostly when you are very concentrated, you dream about code. It's not like you could imagine. You are not sitting in front of a computer writing lines of code, but it's a different kind of dreaming, where the code seems to be underlying everything and works in such a complex and beautiful manner, that you could cry when you awake. And, of course, you wants to scream to remember every single detail of that magical world (and try to implement it in the real world). And that makes you feel pleasure... somehow...
