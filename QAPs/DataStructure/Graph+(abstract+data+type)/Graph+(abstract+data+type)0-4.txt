What are some "practice problems" that everyone should work on in-order to get better at programming (in any programming language)?If you have any problems corresponding to your field of work/research then mention that as well!
Some great resources have already been mentioned (I visit Project Euler periodically, myself), but here's a gem no one seems to be aware of: Timus Online Judge This is an "archive of programming problems with automatic judging system". For any given problem, you submit your code, and the system compiles and runs it against a suite of example and edge cases. You can solve Project Euler problems by a fluke, with unresolved edge cases, or brute-force; not so with Timus Online Judge problems.
