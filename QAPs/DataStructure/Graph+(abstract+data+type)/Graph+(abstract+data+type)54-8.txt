Which is better for quantitative finance, R or Matlab?Which do you prefer for what? Or just general pros and cons.
BOTH! Use both man. They are very similar but have subtle differences providing different context. Depending on what you're trying to do, I have used both for almost everything. They're so similar, that once you learn you essentially learn the other (aside from stupid syntax issues).
