Is recursion actually useful? I can't find any reason to use it. Why do some people love to use it?
Even if you're worried about stack depth, recursion can be useful, and is used in db engines to do things like walk parse trees and execution plan structures.Â  Execution plans are often stored in structures that look like S-expressions (even if the DB engine is coded in C or Java), and these are both easy to walk recursively and not particularly deep, so call stack depth isn't as much of an issue as it is for a tree structure storing user data such as an in-memory binary tree. If you're doing a lot of programming, you will need to understand recursion, and when - and when not - to use it.
