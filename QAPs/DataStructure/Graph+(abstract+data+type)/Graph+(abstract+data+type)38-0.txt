What is the most recommended coding language for creating full blown human AI?
Lisp is not the "most recommended" in the sense of automatically being best but likely it is the most commonly USED language for much AI research, especially academic work. The "best" language will be the one available on your platform, most suitable to your problem, and witht the best or most available LIBRARIES for solving many aspects of your problem. It is quite likely that C++ might be the best choice for neural networks, not for absolute feature of the language but because there are likely more existing libraries and sample code. Some symbolic AI was done in Prolog (especially many expert systems), or again in Lisp.  Languages like Haskell etc. may be subsuming some mindshare today. What's your problem? (i.e., what must the program DO?) Where must it run?  (Windows, Linux, ????) What other programs and languages must it interact with?  (e.g., An existing game written in C or PHP or Ruby or whatever?) These questions and other similar questions of context will limit or direct the answer to the proper choice. The Wikipedia article on AI doesn't seem to include a SINGLE direct reference to Lisp, C++, Haskell, or any other particular programming language. It does contain a link to List of programming languages for artificial intelligence but this article is a mere 'stub' and seems either woefully incomplete or woefully out of date. -- HerbM
