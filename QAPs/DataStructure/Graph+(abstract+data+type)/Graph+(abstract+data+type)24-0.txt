Is using a graph database as opposed to a relational database better suited to mining information from Twitter API data extracted in XML/JSON format?How should I model the data in graph database? In relational data mode, I would just have to parse the XML/JSON data into different fields/columns. And what could I mine from using the graph database approach as opposed to relational data model ?
Graphs are particularly good for discovery purposes, including automated discovery.Â  You might take a look at what Marko Rodriguez, one of the creators of the Titan DB and related tools, has done with social media mining in EgoSystem, an application he built on top of Titan to automate the discovery, aggregation and updating of identities and relationships for the Los Alamos National Lab social network. Here's a piece of the model used in this project: Marko Rodriguez, The Social Graph of the Los Alamos National Laboratory Essentially, rather than having to search on Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, etc. individually for alumni names, this app appears to automate the process in rule-based fashion, and the rules create the means to infer new identities and relationships.
