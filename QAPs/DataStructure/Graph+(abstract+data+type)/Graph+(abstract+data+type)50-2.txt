What is the best way to self-teach the skills and knowledge gained in a typical computer science degree?
Everything starts with programming language choice. The current popularity of the programming languages can be seen here: 'The Coding Standards Company'. My advice is to pick a popular language like: Java, PHP, JavaScript, C#. They are most wanted on the market. With them you will have more job opportunities and more questions answered by the community. Which language exactly - it is personal preference. Then follow the advices above. In general, the programming study books are too simplified. After them it is good to work on specific project. For example, you can join an open source project like jEdit.
