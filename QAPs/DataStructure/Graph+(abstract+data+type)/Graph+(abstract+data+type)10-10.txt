Which book(s) and other resources would you recommend for a beginner to understand Data Structures in C++?Books which preferably are well written and provide good examples/problems to work on and understand concepts clearly?
Originally Answered: What book is best to understand data structures using C++?What you are asking for is two different things. When writing programs, you need to be able to do 2 things. The first is knowing what to do, the second is how to do it. Data structures and algorithms fulfill the first part, and for that I recommend Introduction to Algorithms, by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein. The algorithms there are written in pseudocode, rather than any language, and they should give you a decent intro to data structures when you do the how part. The how requires you to write code using a programming language. Since you recommended C++, I would suggest any good book in C++. However, that book should explain the concepts of Objects and Pointers well, otherwise, it just is not worth it. To use both, try and implement data structures in Introduction to Algorithms in C++ using the C++ book you refer to. An added suggestion would be to walk through your code, checking out how it runs, even if it gives correct outputs.
