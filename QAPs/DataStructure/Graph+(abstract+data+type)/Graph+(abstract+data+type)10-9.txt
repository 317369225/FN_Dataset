Originally Answered: Which is the best book for Data Structures and Algorithms for C++?Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et. al. is a standard introductory algorithms book, and is used by many universities, including my own. It has pretty good coverage and is very approachable. And anything by Robert Sedgewick is good too.
