Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
I like a remark I read recently in a book by Peter Lynch, the super investor who ran Magellan Fund. He commented about teaching your children the math that you have forgotten from high school (he is a graduate of Wharton). As the top math student in my high school (plus a couple of years of college math), I remember nearly nothing. And from studying for two Ph. D.s I can observe that most of what I learned for the B.A. in English was forgotten -- beyond a general idea or outline. I doubt anyone remembers those things not used frequently.
