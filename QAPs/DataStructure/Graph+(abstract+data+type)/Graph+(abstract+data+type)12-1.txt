Can one study computer/software engineering by him/herself?
Yes, absolutely you can. All you need is- 1) Passion 2) Dedication 3) A good knowledge of what subjects you should study 4) A routine 5) Resources ( Books, YouTube, Videos) 6) Good Communication Skills ( To have a grasp on what the books and/or the Videos are trying to explain) and... most importantly 6) Exams ( A means to test yourself. Can be the assignments at the end of a chapter. Can be a small project. CodeChef/SPOJ/Other  problems for programming skills. You can study and have a good knowledge of the subjects that are in Engineering, but there is one key factor that makes an Engineer what he is - the ability to perform under pressure. You have 3 exams a day and endless assignments and projects that you have to make (read 'copy from the nerd who made it first'). There is a lot of peer pressure.  You are eating from a Mess that is literally a 'mess'.  You are trying to impress he cute girls from your class.  You are trying to socialize with the Groups and seem like a 'part' of them. At the same time you are confused whether you should start preparing for a Job ( the diversity comes later on. You have to find out what Job you're preparing for), or you should prepare for CAT/GATE/GRE. And all of this happens simultaneously. So, if you want to study the subjects of CS engineering, you can do it. But becoming one is a lot different. It's not only about books and theories, it is about your experiences.
