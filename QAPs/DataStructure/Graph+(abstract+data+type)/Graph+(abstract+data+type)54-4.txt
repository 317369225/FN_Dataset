Which is better for quantitative finance, R or Matlab?Which do you prefer for what? Or just general pros and cons.
I also need a disclaimer that I'm very biased for R, and have barely touched Matlab.  My impression -- which seems to be confirmed by people you use both -- is: Matlab is easier to learn because the language is simpler (or perhaps more streamlined -- depending on your point of view) R is easier when you need complex data structuresYou can do everything in each language, the question is which is easier and ultimately produces better results. I think R has the edge.  Quant finance is really data analysis, and R was specially designed for data analysis.
