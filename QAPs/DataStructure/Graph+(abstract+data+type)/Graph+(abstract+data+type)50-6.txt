What is the best way to self-teach the skills and knowledge gained in a typical computer science degree?
I have learned computer science myself, and made a LOT of mistakes. I started off trying to learn C++ when I was 13, but it was just too hard and abstract for me, both because of my age but mainly because I did not know any other programming languages, or theories (which are most important). Underneath many languages are similar. IMO you are best off learning Javascript first, it is simple enough to pick up and accessible. However all the techniques in Javascript are common to programming in general. Through this you will also learn HTML and CSS which are the core of everything on the web. Next I would suggest learning a more powerful language such as Ruby, Python or Java. They build on the concepts of Javascript but are more complicated and powerful. Once you have grasped that I would dive into C or C++. They agan build on earlier concepts (eg. object orientation, polymorphism) but topics like pointers and memory management are very challenging to learn without some earlier programming knowledge. I think by learning these languages you will just pick up many concepts of a computer science degree. Once you have grasped C, an operating system is a fantastic project to tackle, it incorporates so many elements of computer science and is vital for learning how software actually uses the underlying hardware.
