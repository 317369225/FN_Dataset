What does one mean by 'elegant' code?I have heard some programmers, especially those who are fond of functional programming, state that it is easier to write 'elegant' code in Haskell than in Python or Java. What do they exactly mean when they tell that? Examples would help me a lot because I am relatively a newbie to the world of functional programming.
To me, an Elegant code first and formost clearly comunicates the intention and is easy to modify. Of course if I'm unfamilair with the domain or the language or the idioms and abstractions employed by an elegant piece of code then it is hard to understand for me but that's not due to lack of elegance.
