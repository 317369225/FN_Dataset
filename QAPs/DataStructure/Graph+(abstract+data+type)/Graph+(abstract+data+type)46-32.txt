Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
Knowledge can be divided in to two categories. One - you should know and two -  you should know where to find it. Utilise your college time to get your  fundamentals right and remember them. Do not waste time in re inventing the wheel. Instead, try to spend the same time constructively to look for something new, useful to the world.
