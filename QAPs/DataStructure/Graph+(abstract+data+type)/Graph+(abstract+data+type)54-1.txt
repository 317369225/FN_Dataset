Which is better for quantitative finance, R or Matlab?Which do you prefer for what? Or just general pros and cons.
Since the dilemma is R or MATLAB, the answer is easy: R. R is a better language, and has a much larger number of statistical libraries. MATLAB is actually faster on matrix operations, and sometimes noticeably faster. Both however are much slower than native C++ and FORTRAN on any non-vectorized operations. I don't think that the choice of such a language should be dictated by speed considerations, but by productivity. For truly computationally intensive tasks, the standard in the financial industry is C++, with FORTRAN, C#, Java and functional languages like OCAML and Haskell far behind. In my previous experience as a consultant in the financial industry I had the opportunity to meet with many clients (mostly buy side, institutional and alternative). As of 3 years ago, the majority used MATLAB, with maybe 20% using R, and almost no one using Python (for research, at least). MATLAB users were slowly converting to R though, and Python was beginning to pick up. Nowadays, my guess is that the legacy MATLAB users are either gone or have moved to R (mostly) and Python.
