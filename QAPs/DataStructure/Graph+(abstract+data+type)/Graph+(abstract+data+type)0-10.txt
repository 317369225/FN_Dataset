What are some "practice problems" that everyone should work on in-order to get better at programming (in any programming language)?If you have any problems corresponding to your field of work/research then mention that as well!
Want to get good at real world programming (rather than solving puzzles) ? Here is a good project : Take any database abstraction layer and build an ORM over it. Want something more difficult ? build the goddamn database layer with a query builder with a decent api. Want something even more challenging ? make the query builder capable enough to build nested sql queries.
