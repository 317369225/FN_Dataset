What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
Take into consideration that computer programmers, are people that usually change works every six-to-twelve months. A well seasoned computer scientist, with a developer career of 20 years, could have been working in the guts of several indutries across the world. They do see, the systems and operations of most of the major players of the economy. So, therefore... The ONE thing that is a major discovery that coders and programmers know that most people don't is: The vast majority of the computer systems that rule today's world are, mostly, expensive garbage that is putted in the hands of the users years after they are obsolete. You won't give your eyes credit if you gave a proper gaze as how inept and deprecated your bank's system is, and how they clerks work, in a daily basis. Most of what you see as compelling efficiency in movies are such a fiction as a lightsaber is. I'm not kidding here. Even critical stuff like air traffic or heart surgery, is performed with systems and programs that are far from perfect, mostly varely good enough. So, advice: whenever you have to perform administrative stuff that is critical, find a clerk and do it face to face. Never trust computers for critical stuff. They are falible as hell. twitter: @hernanemartinez Let's code!
