Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
See my comment to Dan Piponi's answer to Where do we see quantum tunneling? This is the kind of thing I remember, 40 years later.  I also remember where to find things I studied.  I still have the texts.  And having worked through the texts, I can remember/understand what I look up more quickly. For me, the most important things to remember have not been derivations or formulas but, How do you calculate that? How do you measure that? How do you prove that?
