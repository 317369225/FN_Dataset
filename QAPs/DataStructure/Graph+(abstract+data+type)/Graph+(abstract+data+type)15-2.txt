What are the differences between a Graph database and a Triple store ?
RDF databases will also infer new triples (data), according to the formal RDF inference rules for example, if you have the following triples (data) in the RDF database: :human rdfs:subClassOf :mammal . :man rdfs:subClassOf :human . then the RDF database will also infer a new triple :man rdfs:subClassOf :mammal . (i.e. if a Human is a sub-class of Mammal, and a Man is a sub-class of Human, then a Man is also a sub-class of Mammal) such inference will not be available in a general graph database, since the graph edges do not have any special semantics there
