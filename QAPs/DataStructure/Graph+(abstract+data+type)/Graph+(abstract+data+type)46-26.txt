Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
This is an interesting question, I am happy to see some people raise a question like this. The answer is, as other people have indicated, No. I have worked in a few different companies and I worked with some engineers who design HVAC systems, one of them is even in a chair of ASHRAE (if you know what that is). None of them remember any of those formulas and how to get a value from what, they all have to look up some reference. As for me, the same. I love Graph Theory and Chaos Theory at the time I was in grad school, but now if you ask me any of those, I won't be able to explain any of those, because my real work doesn't require any of them. So the question comes to, why did I learn those when I am not going to use them in the future? I think ultimately, this question is about that. IMO, grad school is not teaching you life-long knowledge so you would remember forever, instead, grad school is to help you to explore further your particular interest in academic and help you grow in that area. If you are lucky, you get a chance to publish one or two paper, so you can be proud of yourself that you contribute to science. That's just a bonus. Entering grad school is not necessary to help you find a job easier, but it does significantly improve your image as a professional. More importantly, it's the explore spirit and skill you learn, you demonstrate to other people how you conquer difficult problems and look for solutions (either collaboratively or individually). P.S. that's why I always feel those course-based grad program is lacking something compared to thesis-based program. grad school is an interesting and exciting experience!
