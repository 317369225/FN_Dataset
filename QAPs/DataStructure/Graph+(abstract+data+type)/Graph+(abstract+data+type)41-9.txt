What are currently the hot topics in computer science research?Especially in academic research
Parallel programming. It's already here, and multi-core machines and huge clusters both offer such enormous promise to solving problems in very interesting new ways, but 99.999% of the people out there in the wild writing code don't know how to write parallel code - their skills are going to be more and more sought after as time goes on. In research, so many very important algorithms have not been looked from a point of view of parallelism that we're certainly missing the chance at many more discoveries ...
