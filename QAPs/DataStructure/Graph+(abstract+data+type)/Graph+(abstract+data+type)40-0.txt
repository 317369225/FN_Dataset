Why are Palantir Finance and Palantir Government part of the same company?It doesn't seem like there is enough synergy to justify having these be part of the same startup.
While Palantir Finance and Palantir Government are different products, both are built around the same high level insight that there is immense value (and immense difficulty) in allowing humans to make sense of vasts amounts of complex data in intuitive ways through conceptual analysis.  Palantir’s platforms are essentially an operating system class abstraction for data analysis (http://blog.palantirtech.com/200...). Both platforms solve very hard data integration, search & discovery, knowledge management, and collaboration problems, and allow you to leverage that for unprecedented analysis. They are of course targeted at different types of workflows and data. Palantir Finance allows you to model and analyze time series (the most common ones being the daily closing prices of equities, options, bonds, etc.) and highly macro/quantitative data. Palantir Government allows you to model and analyze unstructured and structured data through object graphs along relational, statistical, temporal, and geospatial dimensions. But both products demonstrate a shared commitment to openness, extensibility, beauty (inside and out), and usability.
