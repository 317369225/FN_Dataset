What is the most recommended coding language for creating full blown human AI?
Well,     Could not foirst agree on what could be intelligence... And often, for me,  It is just some random annex aspect of a character that make it "Intelligent". In this case, It is just a mix of fooling game & bluff & poker from a set of predicative rules...   So anything that make an illusion would be good enougth.
