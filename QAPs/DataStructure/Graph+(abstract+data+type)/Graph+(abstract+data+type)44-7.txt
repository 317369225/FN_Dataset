What does one mean by 'elegant' code?I have heard some programmers, especially those who are fond of functional programming, state that it is easier to write 'elegant' code in Haskell than in Python or Java. What do they exactly mean when they tell that? Examples would help me a lot because I am relatively a newbie to the world of functional programming.
Elegant code is concise - you get this with functional programming, not so much with java easy to extend every functional requirement is encapsulated into one immutable working unit(this means that every class has exactly one function in the system, every method has a specific purpose and are named accordingly) the over-all architecture follows a set of known design-patterns Like other people have mentioned, it's very hard to obtain this in production due to various factors: bosses, long sprints, new functionality. But a good programmer will keep his code elegant to a decent degree.
