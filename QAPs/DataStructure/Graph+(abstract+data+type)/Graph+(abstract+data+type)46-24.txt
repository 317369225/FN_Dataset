Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
When you are learning to run, it is not mandatory to remember all the places you travelled. Even if they are the reason for what you learn. All that matters is this  -  "Are you a runner at the end?" Well, I believe that this answer is actually simple till you get it. Just like most of the knowledge in this world! Updated 18 Jun 2014 • View Upvotes
