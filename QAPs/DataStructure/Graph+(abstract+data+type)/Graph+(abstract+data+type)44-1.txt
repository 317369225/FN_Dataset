What does one mean by 'elegant' code?I have heard some programmers, especially those who are fond of functional programming, state that it is easier to write 'elegant' code in Haskell than in Python or Java. What do they exactly mean when they tell that? Examples would help me a lot because I am relatively a newbie to the world of functional programming.
I would say it is code that: Does his job well and thoroughly (no unsupported uses cases, approximations or assumptions) Is easy to read, understand and modify Is concise and contains nothing superfluous Compiles (or is interpreted) to a computationally efficient result
