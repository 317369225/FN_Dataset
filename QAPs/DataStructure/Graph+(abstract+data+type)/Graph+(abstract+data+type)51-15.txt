Does the United States national debt even matter given that the country has always been in debt?
It matters a little, until it matters a lot.  Allow me to make a simple prediction based upon two inevitabilities.  The first inevitability is interest rates, which, for a variety of reasons, will not remain at such historical low levels indefinitely.  Within the next decade or so, if not considerably sooner, they will rise and when they do the cost of servicing our massive debt will also rise - perhaps precipitously.  The second inevitability that we will face as a nation are the rising social costs of caring for our aging population.  In the coming decades a much larger share of our revenues will go towards health care costs for retiring baby boomers.  There's literally no way around this.  Projections from the CBO and others (all based on incredibly rosy scenarios, mind you) predict that these costs will literally absorb the federal budget in the coming decades.  So one needn't be Nostradamus to predict that by 2025 or so the cost of servicing our national debt and caring for our seniors will be increasing at roughly twice the rate of our economic growth.  This isn't a bold prediction by any means.  In fact, it's probably underestimating the situation that we face as a nation over the next generation.  These costs could easily be rising at triple the rate of growth, but no matter what happens they will undoubtedly rise MUCH faster than our economy's ability to grow.  How can we be sure of this?  Because US GDP growth has been declining for the last several decades  (based upon official statistics) and the two costs referenced above will grow astronomically (based upon common sense). My prediction, then, is this:  When these two inevitabilities come to pass no one will be debating whether or not the US national debt matters.  Time will have settled the issue once and for all.
