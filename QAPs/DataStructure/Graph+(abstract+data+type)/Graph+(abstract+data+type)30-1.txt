What is category theory?
Serge Lang characterised it in his book Algebra as "the logic of arrows". (these tiny categories have some extra arrows that are not drawn but are implied by the definitions of category, which were chosen just to restrict the possible diagrams to ones that "make sense". So for example all dots include a self-loop ⟳ which is not drawn, and any sequence of arrows a→b→c implies that also the category contains a longer arrow a→→c. You could define things in other ways but this is what the C. theorists have found made for the easiest way of talking about categories.) Pictures credit: [1303.3255] Sheaves, Cosheaves and Applications That's the simplest explanation I can think of. Some concepts that are clarified with these and similar tiny CT diagrams: lift pullback pair universal property counting mapping group Taking it further you can map diagram to diagram (this is a functor) Elementary school example of functor which leads to the concept of adjoint functor or adjunction which is a mathematical way of talking about analogy—"C is to D as ℱ(C) is to ℱ(D)". The same like how? The gentlest introduction I know is Lawvere & Schanuel. (r.i.p.) Updated 27 Jun • View Upvotes
