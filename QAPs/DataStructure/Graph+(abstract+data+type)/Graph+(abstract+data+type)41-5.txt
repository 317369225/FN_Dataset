What are currently the hot topics in computer science research?Especially in academic research
Depends on what you mean by "hot"! theres several different definitions you can bandy around what areas are currently receive lots of press? what areas are receiving an exceptional increase in funding? what areas still have lots of low hanging fruit (relatively elementary (and interesting!) problems that will succumb to only moderate effort) "lots of smart people are currently focusing on this problem" First of all: if you mean to ask "what sorts of problems are computer scientists very excited about currently", an excellent starting point (for some areas) would to to skim through the paper titles of the various conferences held at this month's FCRC conference http://www.acm.org/fcrc/ . FCRC is held once every 4 years, and a number of flag ship research venues in computer science are held together at the same time! This is somewhat of a meta answer, but your question is a teeny bit like asking a Botanist what his favorite trees are in each square mile of forest in North America. You could get a a specific answer, but it won't quite honestly answer the question you intended to ask. :)
