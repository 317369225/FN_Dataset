Is recursion actually useful? I can't find any reason to use it. Why do some people love to use it?
Actually there are things that you can't do without recursion. Ackermann function is a good example. Here is the link for it: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A... (You can try to compute it iteratively if you want but I am not sure if it is possible :D) And as others already mentioned, you need to use a stack to implement a dfs algorithm but recursive functions already behave like a stack so why would you complicate things :D And also the skew algorithm to calculate suffix array in O(N) is defined recursively so you can't implement it iteratively(Maybe you can but it would be such a pain :D)
