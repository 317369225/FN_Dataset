What does one mean by 'elegant' code?I have heard some programmers, especially those who are fond of functional programming, state that it is easier to write 'elegant' code in Haskell than in Python or Java. What do they exactly mean when they tell that? Examples would help me a lot because I am relatively a newbie to the world of functional programming.
I'm not a functional developer. I use C,C++ and partially functional language Python. But I think elegant coding should be aim of all coders. The code written with intent of being read more will usually lead to elegant code. Elegance is when code is readable, and uses the language feature. Like function does what its name is. Code is well documented then and there, no need of external document. Has adequate tests. Lets if..else conditions. Meaningful and consistent naming. All this accompanied with continuous re-factoring and improvement.
