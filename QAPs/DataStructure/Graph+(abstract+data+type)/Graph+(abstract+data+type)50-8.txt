What is the best way to self-teach the skills and knowledge gained in a typical computer science degree?
As Eric pointed out : Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming is a good point . On alternate note I feel that a student doing his bachelors typically does not have much background in CS equivalent to person before in your context . The flow of a CS curricula is made so that things go step by step and I guess that is pretty much the right flow . Knowledge gained at the end of typical CS degree is not measured by number of languages you have mastered or by how good you are at coding. A close look at the curricula you would realize it is more of the thought process which is the take away .
