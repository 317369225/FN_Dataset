Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
You better hope so! Just kidding. In all honesty, I remember some of the stuff I learned in my undergrad in great detail, while a lot of other stuff exists as a faint memory somewhere in the back of my head. The important point, from my two years of grad school perspective, is that you should be able to come up with logical questions and answers to a variety of hypotheses in graduate school. For that, in most cases, you only need the basic background about the posited question. In a way, we do remember a lot of the stuff we learned earlier, because we are all in grad school in order to learn even more about it. Certain situations will act as a stimuli to bring out that information from your sub-conscience. But depending on memory can be a fallacy under certain circumstances, and hence you make use of google and a textbook.
