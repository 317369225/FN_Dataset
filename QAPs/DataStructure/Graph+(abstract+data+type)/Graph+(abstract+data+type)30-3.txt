What is category theory?
1. From Eilenberg's and Mac Lane's 1945 paper on "A General Theory of Natural Equivalence" and over the next 70 years, category theory's composition, identity and associativity has given birth to foundational ways of re-organising subtle forms of equivalence, from morphism to isomorphism to functor to natural equivalence to adjunction, and most recently re-branded into n-categories. 2. Pedagogically, Lawvere & Schanuel (first edition is better than the second in terms of serving as a "first introduction") Conceptual Mathematics breaks the cultural constraint by showing how CT can be introduced at the high school level. Normally, CT is taught in the first year postgrad and because its best applications are found in higher level maths, this makes sense. 3. But to appreciate where CT can go as an applied discipline then see David Spivak's Category Theory for the Sciences 2014 which I believe will become the standard touchstone for everyone else. His hardback version includes the answers to problems while his "old version" online does not. 4. There is a growing body of great papers and books on CT (e.g. Mazzoli on The Topos of Music and Rosen on Life Itself) and many purport to be introductory but they are not.  There are also some formative critiques of CT but these have only caused further amelioration and integration across categorical logic, topology and abstract algebra. 5. But really CT should not be locked up in maths. It's much too handy as a methodological toolbox. Efforts are underway to apply a naive category theory to law and finance, see Tanega "Default Invariance, a Naive Category Theory of Law and Finance," April 2015.
