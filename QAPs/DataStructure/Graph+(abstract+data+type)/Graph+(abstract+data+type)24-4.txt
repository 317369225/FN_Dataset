Is using a graph database as opposed to a relational database better suited to mining information from Twitter API data extracted in XML/JSON format?How should I model the data in graph database? In relational data mode, I would just have to parse the XML/JSON data into different fields/columns. And what could I mine from using the graph database approach as opposed to relational data model ?
