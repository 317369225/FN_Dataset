Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
Anecdotally, I felt like I retained most of my education right up until I graduated.  However, my field, mathematics, is such a progression of inter-dependent topics, with every class building on previous ones, that it's only natural you have to retain almost everything. After graduation, though, I used only numerical analysis, maybe a little number theory to be conversant with cryptographic algorithms used in the Internet industry.  Other topics rapidly fled from my brain.  I couldn't do a real analysis proof to save my life.  I still recall a bit of PDEs and complex analysis but only bits and pieces, such as the answer to every complex analysis problem is -1, and if you can prove that a PDE converges faster than 1/x, you won't fail the test.
