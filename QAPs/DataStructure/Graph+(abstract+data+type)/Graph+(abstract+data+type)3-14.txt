What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
What I have faced is that people don't realize: Programming is not a five minute activity. It takes time to get into "the zone" to be productive. By micromanaging a programmer and interrupting him/her again and again every few minutes will decrease the productivity rather than increase it. Programmers with a distant look in their eyes are not thinking of a lost love, but trying to figure out why it is not working, or why has it just started working. If you know one language or an OS fundamentals, it means that you can learn another language or OS. It does not mean that you will  be productive from day 1 on that platform. That the demands for a better machine and more monitors is justified (Two Screens Are Better Than One). I had such a hard time to get a second monitor approved that it wasn't even funny. Most programmers haven't built any software from scratch. Updated 19 Sep 2014 • View Upvotes
