Which book(s) and other resources would you recommend for a beginner to understand Data Structures in C++?Books which preferably are well written and provide good examples/problems to work on and understand concepts clearly?
Originally Answered: Which is the best book for Data Structures and Algorithms for C++?I would suggest Algorithm in C++ by Robert Sedgewick Algorithms in C++, Parts 1-4: Fundamentals, Data Structure, Sorting, Searching, Third Edition: Robert Sedgewick This particular book, Parts 1-4, represents the essential first half of Sedgewick's complete work. It provides extensive coverage of fundamental data structures and algorithms for sorting, searching, and related applications. Although the substance of the book applies to programming in any language, the implementations by Van Wyk and Sedgewick also exploit the natural match between C++ classes and ADT implementations. Highlights - Expanded coverage of arrays, linked lists, strings, trees, and other basic data structures - Greater emphasis on abstract data types (ADTs), modular programming, object-oriented programming, and C++ classes than in previous editions - Over 100 algorithms for sorting, selection, priority queue ADT implementations, and symbol table ADT (searching) implementations - New implementations of binomial queues, multiway radix sorting, randomized BSTs, splay trees, skip lists, multiway tries, B trees, extendible hashing, and much more - Increased quantitative information about the algorithms, giving you a basis for comparing them - Over 1000 new exercises to help you learn the properties of algorithms There is also Part 5 which covers graph algorithms: Algorithms in C++ Part 5: Graph Algorithms (3rd Edition) (Pt.5): Robert Sedgewick: 0785342361186
