What is category theory?
Category theory began its life, historically, as a set of tools for Algebraic Topologists to do their job (which as it turns out, typically has almost nothing to do with topology, and everything to do with algebra).  It happens to be studied in its own right now (by a very small set of mathematicians), but for the most part, mathematicians who use category theory regularly are still algebraists of various stripes: algebraic topologists, algebraic geometers, and good old fashioned algebraists. To get a feel for what category theory is good for (but not how it works in practice, that will take a year or so of graduate algebra), here's my favorite theorem of applied category theory (note: this is not an oxymoron!): Theorem (Gelfand-Naimark (paraphrased - it's been a while)): Let Haus be the category of locally compact Hausdorff spaces, and let C* be the category of commutative C* algebras, then there exists a contravariant functor C: Haus -> C* which sends each topological space X in Haus to the commutative algebra of continuous proper functions on it: C(X), and there also exists a contravariant functor M: C* -> Haus which sends each commutative C* algebra A to Spec(A) - the space of characters of A, with the Gelfand topology. Then C and M are an equivalence of categories. This means (to me), basically two huge things:  1) For every *theorem* anyone has ever proved about topological spaces, there is an identical theorem about commutative algebras (modulo contravariance: arrows go the other way), and vice versa. 2) If you take a concept in one side or the other, and relax it, you can essentially *define* a new branch of mathematics: generalize commutative C* algebras to relax the commutative constraint, and run the similar functor to M, and you get a new concept of topological spaces, but now they are spaces where the algebra of continuous functions on them is noncommutative! The idea of mapping *theorems* from one category to another is (to me) pretty amazing.
