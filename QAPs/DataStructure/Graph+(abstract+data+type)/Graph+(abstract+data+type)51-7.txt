Does the United States national debt even matter given that the country has always been in debt?
It matters what we used our overspending for. We spent it on killing people in unnecessary wars, and on giving tax breaks to those who didn't need it. We didn't spend it on improving the quality of life of our citizens other than military contractors and millionaires. Those citizens, who have been neglected by politicians driving up our debt, are the majority of consumers in this country. When they're hurting, they buy less; that's why the economy is bad - people can't afford to purchase more goods.
