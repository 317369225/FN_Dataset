What is category theory?
Category Theory is one of the most powerful mathematical ideas of the past century.  Category Theory is a mathematical formalism that is an alternative to set theory.  The fundamental idea of category theory is the notion of the commutative diagram, which is an extremely powerful way of representing everything that you would use something else for. Category Theory is amazingly powerful.  Everyday I keep coming across concepts and finding that the most natural way to think about them is from the categorical perspective.  Category theory is extremely general however; even group theorists often regard it as "abstract non-sense". In fifty years I believe category theory will be as "applied" a field of mathematics as calculus, linear algebra or probability theory; based on its usefulness and broad applicability.  However for now, the main use of category theory is the proof of more results about category theory itself. Category theory in many respects is even more appropriate as "the laws of thought" than logic.  For representing and manipulating concepts and symbolic representations of domains, no other mathematical formalism come close to the naturalness of category theory.  There have even been papers which suggest that category theory is the mathematical basis of human thought and problem representation and solving capacity. http://plato.stanford.edu/entrie... The best introduction to Category Theory is probably Shanuel's book.  Especially if you are interested in applying category theory to domains outside of pure mathematics.  You will feel schizophrenic after reading this book, guaranteed.
