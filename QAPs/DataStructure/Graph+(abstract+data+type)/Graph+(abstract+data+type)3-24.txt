What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
I think the biggest fundamental thing is understanding how to instruct a machine to do something in an extremely precise way.  That computers have no intuition, no ability to understand what you meant to say.  So you have to explicitly describe how a piece of code should handle every possible situation that could occur. Another big thing is some intuition about what sort of things computers are really good at compared to the human brain, and what they're worse at.  i.e. they're brilliant at doing gigantic and complicated mathematical calculations, searching through huge amounts of data, precisely doing millions of calculations, rending beautiful 3-D scenes, etc. But there's a bunch of stuff the human brain is way better at, like recognizing and naming objects regardless of orientation or lighting. Making sense of human speech across a broad range of accents, tonalities, and speaking mannerisms. Being able to move & balance our bodies, coordinating the movements of hundreds of muscles, to do all sorts of amazing things without any conscious thought.
