Where can I find the best description of the IoT architecture and development flow?(HW, Cloud and apps)
For a start to get an immediate and comprehensive understanding. Please refer IOT-A: Internet of Things Architecture a study by European Union appointed consortium. Copied below text verbatim from their site. IoT-A, the European Lighthouse Integrated Project has addressed for three years the Internet-of-Things Architecture, and created the proposed architectural reference model together with the definition of an initial set of key building blocks. Together they are envisioned as foundations for fostering the emerging Internet of Things. Using an experimental paradigm, IoT-A combined top-down reasoning about architectural principles and design guidelines with simulation and prototyping in exploring the technical consequences of architectural design choices.They also have released a book Enabling Things to Talk - Designing IoT solutions with the IoT Architectural Reference Model Enabling Things to Talk Click link to download the book. Quite descriptive and pretty usefull.
