What is the most recommended coding language for creating full blown human AI?
Most of the answers for specific languages are pretty good, but don't forget that in order to obtain that kind of power, the program will undoubtedly have to run on a massively parallel machine.  That means you will need some kind of messaging or vectorization software such as Message Passing Interface (MPI) or OpenMP or at the very least a compiler/interpreter designed to take advantage of multiple cores.  These are not languages per se, but extensions to existing languages--in the first case a library and in the second case a set of compiler directives.
