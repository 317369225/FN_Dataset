What are currently the hot topics in computer science research?Especially in academic research
The answers provided by Alex Kamil and Paul King suffice your question. Since for the A2A, I'll try to answer differently. Best way to surf for "hot topics in XXX research", where XXX might be any field is 1. Through Google, go to websites of many Grad universities, http://colleges.usnews.rankingsa... http://www.utexas.edu/world/univ... Note: For starters limit many to top Grad universities 2. Go to "Research" section of each of them, collect them in a "database". 3. Now make a list of topics which are researched on more by "analyzing" the database. 4. Now you have your own list! Pick a topic of interest, (hotness!), and try to Master it! These 4 steps by itself include a hot topic called Machine learning, Big Data!
