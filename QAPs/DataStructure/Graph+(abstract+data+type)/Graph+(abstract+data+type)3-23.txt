What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
This is a quote from one of MITs ocw lecture videos on Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs : "So as opposed to other kinds of engineering, where the constraints on what you can build are the constraints of physical systems, the constraints of physics and noise and approximation, the constraints imposed in building large software systems are the limitations of our own minds."                                                                                           - Hal Abelson Always gives me goosebumps !
