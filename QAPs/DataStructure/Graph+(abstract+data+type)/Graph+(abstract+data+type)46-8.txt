Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
Hi, to quickly recall information: Atlas of Human Knowledge - Visual maps, visualizing Wikipedia is an atlas displaying mindmaps to quickly recall how things are connected. All maps in Atlas of Human Knowledge - Visual maps, visualizing Wikipedia are generated through a mobile app to access and visualize the mindmap of factual knowledge. It saves time to instantly make sense of what a topic is about, by visualizing its context. It is also possible to traverse the whole encyclopedia, having a visual reference to recall visual maps while studying or making sense of new information. The following mobile app visulizes a mindmap of collective knowledge over 4M topics and then pulls content from Wikipedia and Youtube to have an instant idea of new information. Learn Discovery - Mindmap of Wikipedia : visual knowledge maps about science history art places and anything in the largest encyclopedia Discover new linked information and create your atlas for reference of news facts articles and youtube videos Meant for students, teachers and learners: engage students and communicate science in way to reach out new learners, starting from what they are familiar with. [Disclosure: I am co-inventor of the method for processing multiple knowledge bases into mindmaps @XDiscoveryWorld,Â  and I curated the UX and UI of the app. I am exploring portability on other devices and web and currently in San Francisco : if you would like to connect to extend the project just write a reply!]
