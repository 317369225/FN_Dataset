Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
It has never been about mug things up. Its about the application of what they know. The whole education system, I suppose and I'm inclining towards the fact that I'm true, is all about grooming up a person for what he'll face next. From lowest grades we start teaching the person of basics of life/science and apparently everything around them for their minimal awareness to survive. And as the grades progresses we know that he's good with the basics and now should focus and should gain expertise in a certain specific field where he'll thrive. From inside the system it looks like we are making the person mug up things and to answer the same things when he's tested. But unless he learns it and not mugs it up there's no use of it.
