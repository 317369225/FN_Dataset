Does the United States national debt even matter given that the country has always been in debt?
The U.S. became Monetarily Sovereign on 8/15/71. Since that date, federal taxes and federal borrowing have not been necessary to support federal spending. If federal taxes fell to $0 or rose to $100 trillion, neither event would affect the government's ability to spend by even $1. The same is true of federal issuance of T-securities (misnamed "borrowing).  Having the unlimited ability to create dollars, the federal government uniquely does not need to ask anyone for dollars -- not you, not me, not China. For the same reasons, federal interest payments do not restrict federal spending. For the above reasons, the following statement is absolutely, 100% false:  "But there exists a possibility that we would therefore spend most of our collective resources (in the form of government spending) on servicing the debt. At that point, incremental borrowing would be prohibitive and we might be unable to afford some desired public good or service." That statement can be true of a monetarily non-sovereign government (i.e. Chicago, Ohio, Italy)  but not of a Monetarily Sovereign government (i.e. the U.S., Canada, China).
