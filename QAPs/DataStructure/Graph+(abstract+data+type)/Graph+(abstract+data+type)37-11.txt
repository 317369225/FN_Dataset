Is recursion actually useful? I can't find any reason to use it. Why do some people love to use it?
Yes, and, not only useful, but necessary for expressing some problems.  (Yes, you can do everything with a Turing machine, but in a practical sense you would need to implement recursion on the Turing machine to be able to program it in reality.)  As a nasty example, see the Ackermann function. Data structures determine algorithms for the most part.  So, if all you use are arrays with no abstractions built on top of them, then chances are you can find a nice way to use them with simple iteration, or at most the use of an additional index array. However, if you are working on a problem which uses trees, graphs, and other non-linear structures, then iterative approaches are clunky at best and nonexistent at worst. Additionally, in many cases people are using badly written versions of recursive algorithms disguised in a while loop, sometimes with goto's strewn in for the case of Fortran and the like. As an educational example, implement a tree or graph data type and try to write programs to calculate different properties of the tree or graph without using recursion.  If you find a better way than recursion for the general case, you get an amazing research paper and some fame.  If you don't, then you've learned the usefulness of recursion.
