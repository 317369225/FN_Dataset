Does the United States national debt even matter given that the country has always been in debt?
Yes, it matters a lot. If we owe too much, our credit rating goes down. If our credit rating goes down, we have to pay more in interest. If we have to pay more interest, it cuts into our ability to spend money as we wish on everything else. We are already spending a lot more than we "make" in taxes and borrowing the difference. However, it's worse. Not only do our interest rates get higher (like Turkey is experiencing), ultimately if we borrow too much we get inflation or even hyperinflation, which makes our money worth less, or even worthless.
