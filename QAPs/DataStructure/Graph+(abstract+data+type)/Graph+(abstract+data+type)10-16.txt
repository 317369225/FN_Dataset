Which book(s) and other resources would you recommend for a beginner to understand Data Structures in C++?Books which preferably are well written and provide good examples/problems to work on and understand concepts clearly?
Originally Answered: What are the resources to learn algorithms and data structures using C++ language?If you know C++ pretty well then... 1. Data Structure and problem solving by Mark Allen Weiss 2. Algorithms in C++ by Robert Sedgewick And if learning C++ is also in recommendation then first "C++ programming" by "Al Stevens" followed by above books.
