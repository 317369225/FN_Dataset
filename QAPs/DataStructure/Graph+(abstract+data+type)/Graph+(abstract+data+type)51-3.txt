Does the United States national debt even matter given that the country has always been in debt?
The government debt only matters when it isn't large enough.  Our economy is made up of three sectors: the private sector, the government, and the foreign sector. All three sectors end up balancing each other out: Domestic Private Sector Net Saving = Government Sector Deficit + Current Account Balance So in short when the government deficit spends it allows the private sector to save.  Also pay attention to our current account balance which is our trade deficit, typically in the hundreds of billions, that is hundreds of billions in currency lost overseas.  Which is not a bad thing if we recreate that currency here and spend it via deficit spending.
