Which book(s) and other resources would you recommend for a beginner to understand Data Structures in C++?Books which preferably are well written and provide good examples/problems to work on and understand concepts clearly?
Originally Answered: Which book should I refer to for data structures and algorithms in C++ (as a beginner)?Normally any book providing just the syntax of the language is much required form for both beginner or expert, both having basic programming knowledge, and earlier I used Thinking in C++ by K & R for same purpose while learning C++. The code for exercises is also provided. Another form where the language is compared with others to show each differences in syntax and design with various examples and there are questions always directed is also really helpful :) Check C++ Annotations and its specifically directed for C programmers trying out C++. Get any of the latest versions in any form and try your hand :)
