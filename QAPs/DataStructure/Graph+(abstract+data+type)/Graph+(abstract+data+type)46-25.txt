Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
Begs the question.... Of course they do! If you accept "what they were taught" as equal to "what they learned", of course they do. Anything they didn't learn, they don't remember. As one of my favorite educators said: "training teaches you to deal with expected problems, education teaches you to hand the unexpected". If you know how to derive an equation, rather than just remembering it, you have learned far more.
