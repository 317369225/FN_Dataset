Does the United States national debt even matter given that the country has always been in debt?
Of course debt matters. The U.S. Public Debt situation is presently the worst since World War II. There is unanimity among economists that debt needs to be reduced. However, the debates are regarding whether it needs to be reduced right now or it can wait until the US Economy takes off and what will be the path of debt reduction: tax rise or spending cuts. The downside of debt reduction will be a recessionary effect on the economy. So there is a constraint, one cannot have the best of both. I subscribe to the view that there should not be too much of a stress on debt reduction with immediate effect. The economy is still down, employment is down, private investment is down and there is a high chance of slipping back to recession. So the government should be cautious of getting too hawkish about debt reduction. One should keep in mind that if there is a recession it too erodes wealth very quickly, even faster than an inflation. A recession will cause stocks to crash, housing prices to nosedive and people's wealth will be worth peanuts within a couple of months. So the job vs wealth argument is not quite right. Once the economy starts to get better tax collection will automatically improve and the government can cut some of the spending as the recessionary effect will not be felt too much. Also, the way to take is to raise taxes rather than to cut spending. Raising taxes have a less recessionary effect than spending cuts especially when growth is fragile and there is uncertainty.
