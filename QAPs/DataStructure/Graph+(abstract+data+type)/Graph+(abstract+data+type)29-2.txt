Where can I find the best description of the IoT architecture and development flow?(HW, Cloud and apps)
Are you trying to wrap your head around the technology architecture of the Internet of Things? I cannot comment on the development flow but on the technology architecture: - It is very hard to find a logical and comprehensive technology architecture for the Internet of Things. - I have seen many people try to do work this out but none of them have really convinced yet. I am in the process of developing an architecture that seems the most logical to me. The picture is half baked and still has some flaws but maybe we can improve the picture together? Please comment to improve!
