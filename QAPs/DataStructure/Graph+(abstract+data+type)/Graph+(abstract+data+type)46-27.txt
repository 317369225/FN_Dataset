Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
In my opinion what graduate school teaches you is to think. I am a biochemistry graduate student and I teach undergraduate students, and I can tell you for sure that I don remember structures and formulas off my head, I have to prepare to teach. Graduate school teaches you to meet deadlines, to be accountable for your work. It makes you think of science and how things work. for me...It is not abt exams anymore....Its abt the world
