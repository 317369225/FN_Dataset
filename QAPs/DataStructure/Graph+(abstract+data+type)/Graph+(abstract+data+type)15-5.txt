What are the differences between a Graph database and a Triple store ?
+1 to the answers above, but note that the question implies that graph databases and triple stores are mutually exclusive.  To the contrary, some purpose-built triple stores, such as AllegroGraph, provide a lower level of generic graph DB support, while there exists at least one RDF triple store, Blueprints Sail, which adapts a variety of graph database implementations to the RDF data model.  It's more accurate to speak of the differences between graph-y operations such as shortest path algorithms and SemWeb-y operations such as inference, than it is to speak of the differences between graph DBs and triple stores, unless you're referring to specific implementations.  In some cases, you can treat the same data, in the same database, at one level of abstraction as a "graph", and at another specifically as an RDF dataset.
