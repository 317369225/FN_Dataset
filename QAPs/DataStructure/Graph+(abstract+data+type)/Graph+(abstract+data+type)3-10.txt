What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
When you say someone that you're a programmer then they assume you can fix all of their computer related problems. This happens to me most of the time. I keep getting questions - - Bro, my computer is not working, can you look into it? - My computer is working quite slow, pleaseÂ  fix it - Do you know why my computer screen keeps hanging - Dude, can you please format my laptop - Audio is not working - My router is not working Being a programmer doesn't mean that we can solve all the computer related problems. At times they do ask absurd questions like- Friend: Hey, you're a programmer right? Me: Yeah Friend: Do you write code and develop websites? Me: Yeah, thats exactly what I do Friend: Cool can you create a website for me which is exactly like FACEBOOK in 3 months Me: contact Mark Zuckerberg please :/ They do not understand the complexity behind developing a website as scalable as Facebook right way. Its a continuous process where you create a site with basic features, increase your user base, hire more developers and make it scalable.
