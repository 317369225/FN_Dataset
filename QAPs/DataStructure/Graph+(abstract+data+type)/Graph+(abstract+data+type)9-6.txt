What is the application of linked lists in data structures?
Linked Lists like most data structures seem very much theoretical and seem to not have many practical applications but believe me they are used in too many practical applications. Consider a situation in which you cannot have a continuos amount of  memory for use but still need something stored. This can be done with the help of linked lists and the amount of available memory can create a pointer to the next set of memory using a particular mechanism. Linked Lists are also generally preferred over arrays in certain conditions on which the length of the array is not known.LL can be dynamically increased in length while with arrays an increase in size becomes quite tedious. Also LL are better to use when we might face a situation in which we wish to insert an element in the middle of the currently existing elements. Also implementing stacks and queues using LL makes more sense a we need not worry what size of those data structures to choose to ensure efficient working. More practical applications would be: A list of images that need to be burned to a CD in any imaging application A list of users of a website that need to be emailed some notification A list of objects in a 3D game that need to be rendered to the screen  Hope this helps.
