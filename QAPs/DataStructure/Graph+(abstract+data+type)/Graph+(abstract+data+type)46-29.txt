Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
I still recall a few formulae from my days studying Physics, simple motion and thermodynamics principally but then I also remember PIN numbers for ATM cards I held 20 years ago, the former can prove useful on occasion, the latter, useless clutter. I found that studying Physics gave me the mind set and skills to tackle complex problems with logic and persistence, it also opened a whole range of interests in other fields of science and design. In my opinion Physics is the only true science - viz - Biology was memory skill, Chemistry is complex cooking - that is only my personal opinion. I studied Chemistry and Biology but I found Physics and Applied maths were practical and memorable. Mind you I can still draw a kidney or heart and work out (albeit simply) phase process reactions. So, to your question or at least your fear...have I learned anything, well yes, in the example you used, you answered the question using logic and insight and surely this is the greatest gift Physics has empowered you with. Keep it up ! It's a life long learning subject. Best wishes to you.
