What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
If a program is doing something strange, and you can't imagine why the developer would ever have chosen that behavior, there's probably a simple explanation: It's probably a bug. UPDATE with a case in point: A bug in the chess-playing computer Deep Blue "was likely what allowed the computer to beat Kasparov": In the popular recounting of Kasparov’s match against Deep Blue, it was the second game in which his problems originated—when he had made the almost unprecedented error of forfeiting a position that he could probably have drawn. But what had inspired Kasparov to commit this mistake? His anxiety over Deep Blue’s forty-fourth move in the first game—the move in which the computer had moved its rook for no apparent purpose. Kasparov had concluded that the counterintuitive play must be a sign of superior intelligence. He had never considered that it was simply a bug. http://www.washingtonpost.com/bl...
