What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
In contrast to the top voted answer, I think that the most interesting thing behind the curtain is how slow the whole industry moves and how superficial the seemingly fast pace of change is (I'm talking software, not hardware). It's 2012, and Unicode has been available for 30 years, UTF-8 for 20; and I still see encoding problems on a regular basis (emails where non-ASCII characters are mangled and replaced by weird symbols, for example). We still use software (Unix [or Mac OS X]) which has telex modes deep down (TTY subsystem). &c &c I work at the intersection of computer science and biology. Biology moves much faster. We learn faster and that changes what people do faster. Updated 14 Apr â€¢ View Upvotes
