Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
Not really. Depends on which stream you are more interested in. Like if you are more interested in physics, and opting for physics as your course in college, you are expected to remember at least the gist of all the major topics you were taught back in your college days. The same goes for most of the other branches of academics. The subject which you opt for in college is most probably your profession. So you come across it very often. So, though not in entirety, you remember some part of it.
