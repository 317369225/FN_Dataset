What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
I am a computer programmer. Not a Network Administrator. I have no idea why your System won't open Yahoo Mail. Not a PC repair technician. I probably have no idea why your printer won't work. Not a "Hacker". When my friends use the term "Hacker", they were referring to some smart way I made code so something that seemed not possible. I can't hack into your school network to change your grades. I can't hack into your lovers email account and hand you his/her password. I can't build you a Google clone in a month. I have no idea why your mobile device won't make phone calls. I am pretty sure an Android application isn't meant to run on an Asha Phone. I don't have a large screen with a black background and a green font in my room. I have an idea why that Flash-Player-thing keeps trying to trick you into updating. I don't know everything. I know a number of things but stop asking me when SkyNet would take over earth. I cringe when you make jokes about computing stuff you know next to nothing about. The reason I am not talking to you isn't because of my social ineptitude, it has to do with the fact that I use too much energy thinking of simpler ways to frame what I tell you so you don't glaze over me than I can spare. Nope, your idea isn't as original as you think. A social network for sharing pictures already exist, it's called Instagram. I write backend code, I would rather not touch HTML and CSS so stop asking if I design websites. Web Programmers differ from Web Designers, one can't survive without the other. Stop asking which one is more important. I hate noisy places most of the time. I can't think in them. Thinking basically embodies everything I do. I like Quora!! Deal with it. :)
