Does the United States national debt even matter given that the country has always been in debt?
We've always been in debt. We have not always been this deep in debt (over 100% of GDP). Actually we've only been this indebted for a few very short periods of time during our history, and never before during peacetime. I don't think anyone can say with certainty what will happen next. One obstacle is that our government has taken to flat out lying to us, as a matter of course. They lie about unemployment, they lie about inflation, they lie about the money supply. Real unemployment (actually unemployed plus under-employed) is at its highest levels in our history. They spent 8 years telling us that inflation was flat, with so-called reputable economists agreeing, while housing prices doubled, and then doubled again with no offsetting deflationary movement of any real note. The impact of offshoring and wealth accumulation - especially the precipitous drop in the number of times a dollar changes hands within our borders, and is subsequently taxed - is downplayed if mentioned at all. Another is the fact that old models just don't work any more, and new ones have yet to be tested. Conservatives love to say that Keynes was wrong, but the truth is we've changed our economy so radically that none of his assumptions apply any more. Same with Freidman. Same with Von Mises. None of them predicted an economy with fiat currency, debt that exceeds production,  and a rapidly declining manufacturing and agricultural base. But the biggest obstacle to predicting what will happen is the fact that never before in the history of the world has one nation simultaneously been the dominant  agricultural and industrial superpower, and then basically abandoned both agriculture and industry in the span of 25 years. We're in uncharted waters, without a map. At some point, we have to either start making things again, or printing money.
