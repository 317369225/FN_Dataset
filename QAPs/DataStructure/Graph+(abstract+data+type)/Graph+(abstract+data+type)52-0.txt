How can I improve search functionality in tables with a many-to-many relationship?
You could put the user skills in a comma-separated list in the user table. This is a form of denormalization, to avoid a join. It makes it more convenient to query the skills for a specific user. But what if you also sometimes need to query all users who have a specific skill? Your query can join from the skills table directly to the users table, but then it has to search for a substring of your comma-separated list, which means it's cannot be made more efficient with an index -- it's bound to do a table-scan. This is the problem with denormalization: it optimizes for one query, at the expense of making other queries against the same data much worse. If you know you will never have to query for all users who have a given skill, then you will not suffer the penalty of denormalization in this case. There are other risks with denormalizing to a comma-separated list. How can you count how many skills a user has? How can you ensure the list doesn't have duplicates? How can you update or delete a user's skill, without fetching the whole list into the application, string-editing it, then posting it back? How do you know the items in the list are legitimate skills at all? What if a skill is removed from the list of legitimate skills? How can you efficiently find all users whose skill list needs to be updated? All these issues are simple to solve with a properly normalized database (the many-to-many table). To solve them with a denormalized table, you have to write and maintain a lot of inefficient custom code in the application to enforce data integrity.
