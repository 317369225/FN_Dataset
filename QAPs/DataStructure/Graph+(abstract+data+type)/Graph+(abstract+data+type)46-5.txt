Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
Not at all.  I had a reputation, as a grad student, of having an extraordinary memory, because people would bring their research to me for input and I would always know the details of their (often very different) work, what experiments they had done before, what they were planning to do, and so on.  The reality was that I had usually pretty much forgotten what they were doing, but when I saw the experiment they were showing me I would work out why they were doing it, which would tell me what their project was, and then how they would have got there and what the next inevitable steps would be, and so on.  Instead of memorizing what they were doing, I would rather understand it, because then everything else comes along with it. Edit: Having just finished Mark Eichenlaub's excellent answer (Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?) -- what he said.  This is the "chunking" he was talking about, just in biology rather than physics.
