I have been a C++ software engineer for 2 years. What should I learn or do to become a software architect?
Because the computer industry is still new - we are still figuring out what titles mean. In most places - "software architect" means "top programer". But if you really want to be an architect - then I think you have to consider broadening your knowledge and experiences beyond just being a day to day programmer. There are 3 fundamental technical skills you must have: 1 - You must know how everything should work together. 2 - You must know WHY it's supposed to work together 3 - You must be able to persuade people to make them work together And number 3 is the most critical. Too often projects fail - not because the developers are not skilled or the technology doesn't work - but because the team couldn't be persuaded to do the right thing.
