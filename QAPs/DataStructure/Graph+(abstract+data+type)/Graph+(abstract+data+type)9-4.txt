What is the application of linked lists in data structures?
Creating dynamic lists, like the queue of McDonald's, insertion is done at one end and deletion at other. And these operations happen frequently. As a way of storing when random access is not required. In situations like that mentioned in point one, order jumps are not done, so no random access is required and hence linked list are perfect for it. If random element deletion/insertion is required in constant time. In case of fixed DS like array, need to re-shift position of all remaining element. If a node of array is heavy, then inserting/deleting costs will be high. In case of Linked list, it will be comparatively very cheap. I was able to find some more relevant examples at: What are concrete examples of use cases of linked lists?
