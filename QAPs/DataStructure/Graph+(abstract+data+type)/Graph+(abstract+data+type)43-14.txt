Job Interview Questions: Which are the frequently asked interview questions for Java Engineers ?
i have seen compreshensive answers and links to really resource full material on possible question  so i will not give my answer based on online research rather by my own personal experience. may not be whats expected but each interview is uniques with some similar components so here goes.   i will not  type out the questions but rather the concepts i was questioned on mostly revolved on wherether 1. i knew and understood what JVM was. 2 if i understood JIT 3.if i knew how many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM and how to utilize each 4.What gives Java its 'write once and run anywhere' nature and how that is useful. 5. if i could utilize classloader and knew what they were 6.java compiler 7.Session Management 8.  software architures such as MVCs and methodologies such as  Agile development 9 if i understood data structures in java 10. function over loading and over riding one thing in common from answers here is that the questions will seek to examine the base of your understanding on java. hope that helped
