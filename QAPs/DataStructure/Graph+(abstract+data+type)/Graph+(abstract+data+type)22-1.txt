What is the difference between statistical graphics and data visualization?It's not clear to me if statistical graphics is just a part of a larger set called data-visualization or if data-visualization is just a new term for statistical graphics ?
Generally, it seems statistical graphics emphasize specific goals and answers being sought, where as data visualization is more interested in creating the best way for data to be explored and questions to be discovered. But obviously there is significant overlap.
