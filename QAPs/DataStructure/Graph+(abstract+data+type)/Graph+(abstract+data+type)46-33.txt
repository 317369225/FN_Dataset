Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
Perhaps the bigger question is: given that knowledge is easily accessible compared with years past, and therefore no longer needs to be memorized, has our educational system also changed to place a much greater emphasis on how to use information instead of retaining information? For example, if passing an exam requires you to remember many formulas, that's what you spend your time trying to remember. However, if exams instead gave you all the formulas, or allowed you to look them up, and focused on your ability to analyze and solve complex problems using facts and formulas, then that's what you would focus on learning. Which would be much more useful in the long run and reflect your future real world experience. I may be wrong, but I don't believe our educational system, at least up through high school and undergraduate school, reflects this sort of training. It's still largely stuck in the past of drilling facts and figures (I'm not referring to doctoral thesis here, but what leads up to that).
