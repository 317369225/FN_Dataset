Which is better for quantitative finance, R or Matlab?Which do you prefer for what? Or just general pros and cons.
The only real answer here is that it depends on what you're trying to do. In my current job I probably use R 75% of the time and Python (a la Pandas, Scipy, Cython) 25% of the time for research. That being said, I used matlab, more specifically a 3rd party optimization library, 100% of the time at my previous job where the strategy was much lower frequency.   There's no use in focusing in one specific language.
