What is the difference between statistical graphics and data visualization?It's not clear to me if statistical graphics is just a part of a larger set called data-visualization or if data-visualization is just a new term for statistical graphics ?
Graphs are tried-and-true ways of representing many types of data. You can manipulate many variables (both in the data or in the graphic) in order to get the best insight. Data visualization tailors the visualization to the dataset and the narrative, so you can not simply plug in another dataset and expect the visualization style to be the best way to represent the new data. Sometime, even simply modifying or adding more data to the dataset will require changing the visualization drastically. There are certainly design patterns for data visualization, but in general, they all require some customization. Data visualization is also more accomdating for higher levels of visual abstraction. Data visualization has been along longer than you may think. It's certainly not just a new, trendy term for statistical graphics. This hand-drawn data visualization in the early 19th century was notable for graphing many different variables—including distance, time, and size—in a two-dimensional image. Another famous visualization is Florence Nightingale's Rose. Some people would argue using a traditional statistical graph would have been more accurate and less misleading though. ;) Image Source: Nightingale’s Rose
