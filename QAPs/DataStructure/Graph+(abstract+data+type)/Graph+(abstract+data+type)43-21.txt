Job Interview Questions: Which are the frequently asked interview questions for Java Engineers ?
Originally Answered: What are good interview questions for Java developers?Do you know any languages other than Java well? This is to guage breadth of knowledge, and while we could ask about all sorts of things, programming language seems most on-topic here. Tell me what are some pros-and-cons of your-other-favourite-language vs Java. Go into as much detail of annoying points about how "hashes aren't really hashes" or how "there's a global interpreter lock" as you want. This is another broad knowledge question which allows the candidate time to explore. We all have things we like or hate about one language vs another, and if we don't, then we probably haven't been doing it long enough. What technical question do you feel you most prepared for before this interview? Because I'm sometimes a bit of a bastard. I'll let them answer it next.
