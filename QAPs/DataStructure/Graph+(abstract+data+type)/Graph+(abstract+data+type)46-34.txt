Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
No grad school students don't remember everyrhing they were taught in college all the time. Mostly nobody does except the whiz kids. Education is not about remembering things you study, has never been that way. It is all about understanding what you have studied and putting it to good use to help society. The description given above is for physics. I study Civil Engineering and will therefore draw paralleles from the same. In college although I have been taught a lot of things, practically a lot of those will have nil applications in the field. But what I have understood will help me apply those concepts to real life problems and construct stable buildings. Theory and practical application are interlinked but are not necessarily the same. You don't have to remember all the stuff you've studied, but you do have to understand everything you've studied.
