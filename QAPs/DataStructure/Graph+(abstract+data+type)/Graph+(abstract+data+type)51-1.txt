Does the United States national debt even matter given that the country has always been in debt?
Yes. There is sustainable (serviceable) debt, and unsustainable debt. We've seen the result of unsustainable debt in the 1997-2006 United States Housing Bubble and subsequent 2008 Financial Crisis. Unfortunately, the external portion of the U.S. Public Debt is nearing an unsustainable level ("external" debt above 90% of GDP according to Economists), and with annual U.S. Federal Budget Deficits increasing it every year, we're headed for Sovereign Default. That's why Standard & Poor's did the United States Credit Rating Downgrade (August 2011). This has very specific effects which I describe in my answer to What impact does debt have on the U.S. Government? See also: Are the promised benefits of U.S Entitlement Programs higher than possible (achievable) federal tax revenues (cf. Hauser's Law), and the maximum amount of U.S. Public Debt that the country can service as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product? (Yes, by a lot - that's why the United States Credit Rating Downgrade (August 2011) happened). my answer to U.S Entitlement Programs: What will spur the US Congress into action on decreasing the financial burdens of Medicare and Social Security? my answer to How does the USA fix its public debt/federal spending crisis? my answer to If the Chinese lost confidence in the USD and US economy as a whole, then called in their loans to the US, what might the consequences be?
