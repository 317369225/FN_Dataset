Does the United States national debt even matter given that the country has always been in debt?
"Given that the country has always been in debt".   As a simple historical fact, this is false.  Andrew Jackson paid off the national debt in the 1830s.  It also dropped very low after the Civil War because guess what?  Many of the wartime taxation levels stayed in place.  The federal government ran surpluses for years.    The problem is anti-tax, anti-government, libertarianism and frankly, selfishness, not the debt itself.   It could be sharply reduced if taxes were raised and yes, unnecessary spending cut.
