Data Structures? Know at least the common ones. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any others than:   scalars  (Strings, numbers, pointers, function pointers, database handles )   lists ( Arrays, Vectors, Lists, Linked Lists )   hashes (hashtable, associative array)   trees   any of the above structures containing examples of any of the above structures, like lists of lists, lists of hashes, hashes of hashes, hashes of lists, etc. Algorithms? Know how to build them but also know :        sorting, filtering, transformation ( map ), lambda
