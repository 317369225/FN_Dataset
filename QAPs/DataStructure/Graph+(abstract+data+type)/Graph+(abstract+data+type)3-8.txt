What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
Data Packing: When you have more spoons than fit in the drawer, flip half around and lay them side by side. Ring buffers: When dropping someone off curbside at the airport, pull as far forward as possible. That way almost everyone will leave at the same time, creating a fully empty curb for the next string of cars to fill it. Atomic operations: When using the restroom; toilet, flushing and washing your hands should be considered one operation to viewers on the outside world. Nothing should interrupt that process or make it get out of sync. Symmetric multi-processing: Your wife would really love if you ordered her hamburger, but separate orders mean different cooks working at the same time and assures faster food delivery. And yes, we all knew Facebook was over-valued.
