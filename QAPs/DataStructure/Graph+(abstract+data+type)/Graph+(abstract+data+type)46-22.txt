Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
I agree with Steven Byrnes post, and in particular just the fact that you feel you should know and understand the derivation means you are learning physics "the way it's meant to be". I received my PhD in physics but since then have worked primarily with engineers and other types of scientists. I still think like a physicist, though, because when I look at some problem to be solved, I expect to be able to write a mathematical model down for it and derive important implications from that model. Sometimes it actually even works and it's a lot of fun when it does :-) This is usually quite shocking to many non-physicists.
