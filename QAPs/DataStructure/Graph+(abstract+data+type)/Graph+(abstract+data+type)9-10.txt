What is the application of linked lists in data structures?
Linked list is a data structure which is used when size of data is not fixed and we want to efficiently utilize our memory space... For example let's say you are creating an array A for record of students of size 100 assuming that you'll not need more space but what if you need realize after some time that your students have exceed 100 and you know length of array is fixed... Here linked list comes into picture where we can use/allocate as much space as we need at run time... Beside that it is easy as well as fast to insert and delete element in linked list as compare to array... That's why it is used in such situations. It is of many types such as singly, doubly, circular linked list. It is used very often into operating system concepts.
