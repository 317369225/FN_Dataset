Where can I find the best description of the IoT architecture and development flow?(HW, Cloud and apps)
IoT is the plural for Internet of Things. There is more then one HW, cloud and the apps are often on already two OS (Android + iOS). An application for a fridge, car or dog collar will be quite different. I can help with my IoT M2M Cookbook with 85 pages DIN A4 and focus on WWAN: http://www.gsm-modem.de/M2M/m2m_... My next book will be related to "Wearables and Sensor Networks". There is no source that can cover all and there is no cloud that can cover everthing.
