What are some actual projects data scientists have worked on?Given how much interest there is in data science, I was thinking it would be great if some data scientists could walk through a project they've worked on, what tools and analytical techniques they used, and most importantly, their thought processes behind each step of their analyses and execution, as well as what mistakes they made.
It would be helpful if we could hear from a Data Scientist about the details of the projects that he had actually worked on. Most of us knows that Data Scientist has become the sexiest job of this time and everybody wants to switch their career into the field of Data Science. The major reasons behind this trend is the salary that is offered to a Data Scientist. It has turned out to be the best paid jobs among the IT professionals. We are very much aware of all these. But when it comes to the question of "What actually a Data Scientist do?", most of them does not have an answer. When we search in LinkedIn for the term Data Scientist more than 35,000 results are showing up. Still why do companies struggle to find out the exact skills. Why does even Walmart go forward with competitions like Kaggle to find out the Data Science skills. These issues arises because people know What Data Science is and they don't know What a Data Scientist do. In order to learn Data Science we should work on hands-on projects with a Data Scientist. Why don't you just grab the chance to listen to a Senior Data Scientist from Walmartlabs. Register now at https://attendee.gotowebinar.com...
