What is the most recommended coding language for creating full blown human AI?
Complex human level AI will require a large knowledge base many Terabytes and a large amount of processing power distributed over a large number of processors and computers.  So the language should support extreme distributed computing, multi-threading, thread safe (functional) coding, and an extremely large memory model out of the box.  Such a sophisticated AI will also probably need to be able to generate code to extend itself and dynamically extend it's data model when the need arises.  Even though it does not meet all these requirements without extensions I'd say Scala is one of the closest right now.
