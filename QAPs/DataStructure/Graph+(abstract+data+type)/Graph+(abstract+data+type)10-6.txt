Which book(s) and other resources would you recommend for a beginner to understand Data Structures in C++?Books which preferably are well written and provide good examples/problems to work on and understand concepts clearly?
Yes, Data Structures , book by Tenebaum is the best. It contains time complexities neatly described. But if you are beginner, then go for Let Us C by Yashwant Kanetkar, first. Also you can refer to videos here: from http://academicearth.org
