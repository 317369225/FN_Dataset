What are some "practice problems" that everyone should work on in-order to get better at programming (in any programming language)?If you have any problems corresponding to your field of work/research then mention that as well!
I heard about OPC from a senior Gunasekaran Namachivayam in my 2nd year of my grade.. Currently i am pursing B.Tech-IT Final year. He asked me to solve problem on #Codeforces #TopCoder, Inc. | Home of the world's largest development community. #Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ) #Programming Competition,Programming Contest,Online Computer Programming But before practising i started attending contest in those sites, i dono about ratings and rankings. They fell rapidly and i started to learn what is behind these contest and started solving practise session problems and now i am rated expert in those sites.. So practising in these sites will improve your knowledge automatically and try to attend contest in those sites..
