What does one mean by 'elegant' code?I have heard some programmers, especially those who are fond of functional programming, state that it is easier to write 'elegant' code in Haskell than in Python or Java. What do they exactly mean when they tell that? Examples would help me a lot because I am relatively a newbie to the world of functional programming.
