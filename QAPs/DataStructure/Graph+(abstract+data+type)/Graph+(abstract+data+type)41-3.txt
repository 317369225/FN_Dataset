What are currently the hot topics in computer science research?Especially in academic research
Computational Linguistics: This field deals with understanding and developing computational theories of human language. Such theories allow us to process natural languages through computational perspective. CL has numerous sub-fields which include speech recognition and speech synthesis, machine translation, dialogue systems, information retrieval and extraction, topic modeling and document summarization, computational semantics.   This is one of the most relevant and active areas of research and is often grouped with other areas of artificial intelligence to make systems that can understand and generate human languages. SIRI, Cortana, Wolfram Alpha, Google Translate, all are outcomes of research in this area.
