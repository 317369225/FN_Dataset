Which is better for quantitative finance, R or Matlab?Which do you prefer for what? Or just general pros and cons.
For finance, I think R is better than Matlab. R inbuilts with several statistics and mathematics analysis capabilities. But to use R well needs high expertise and technical background. I prefer to use esProc (http://www.raqsoft.com/products) for computing and analysis.
