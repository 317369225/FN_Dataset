What is category theory?
Tl;dr: Two objects can be neither equal nor inequal, you need some other way than equality to relate them. In rough words, you can't cross the same river twice. ~Heraclitus . (you or river or both will change by next time). Detail: You could draw a set of all the positive integers (1,2,3,4...)  and  another of all the positive even integers (2,4,6,8...)  and draw an  arrow representing the function linking the elements in the two sets  together.[Namely f(x)=2x  ]. Category theory connects much more sophisticated objects at a much more abstract level.e.g. In high-school set theory, some of us grouped  items by common features  (objects you own that are items of writing, say) into a large set, and then splitting them into subsets  (green pen, black marker,green brush) and drawing Venn diagrams of intersecting circles  to represent how some of the objects shared qualities (the color green,  say), some others did not. There can be more and more reasons(features,e.g. material of the objects) to ,why a morphism fully describes the connection between two objects (or not). A category can be viewed as a special kind of directed graph, where one has the ability to ‘compose’ the arrows(note that these notations are Feynman Diagrams) Here is an analogy to the central correspondence in Category theory with those in some of the more commonly explore fields.
