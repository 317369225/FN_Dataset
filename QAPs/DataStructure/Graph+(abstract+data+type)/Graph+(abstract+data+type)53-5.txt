What are some actual projects data scientists have worked on?Given how much interest there is in data science, I was thinking it would be great if some data scientists could walk through a project they've worked on, what tools and analytical techniques they used, and most importantly, their thought processes behind each step of their analyses and execution, as well as what mistakes they made.
