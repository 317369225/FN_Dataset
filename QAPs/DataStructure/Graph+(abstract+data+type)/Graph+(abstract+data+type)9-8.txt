What is the application of linked lists in data structures?
Linked lists are used in variety of applications in computer Science. Majorly, they are used in places where we cannot get a large chunk of memory or we have to use dynamic memory.  For ex, if you have data worth 1.5 GB and you cannot get that much contiguous space in your computer, but you can get at most 0.5 GB of contiguous memory chunk, you can divide the data into 3 parts and then store the location of first chunk somewhere,  store the location of second chunk in first chunk, location of third chunk in second chunk and so on.     In this way , you can read this large chunk of  data without having to bother to store it as a large chunk. I have given the basic concept above, but there are many more uses. 1) For separate chaining in Hashtables.   2) For implementing non-binary trees.     3) They are used in a refined way in implementing different file systems in one form or the other.  Of course, there are many different types of linked lists, like doubly linked, circular and many more. You can modify them to suit your application.
