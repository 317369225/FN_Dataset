Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
As an ex-prof, I can tell you a couple things. One from Einstein, "I never memorized anything I only knew where to look things up." The second thing is learn to think like your prof. Knowledge is googlable; thought processes and problem solving strategies require humans!
