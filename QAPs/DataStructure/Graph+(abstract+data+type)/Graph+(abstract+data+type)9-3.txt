What is the application of linked lists in data structures?
Linked lists are used in variety of applications in computer Science. Majority, they are used in places where we  have to use dynamic memory or size of input is not known in advance . Some of the major application : 1. Tree 2. Graph 3. Stack 4. Queue 5. LRU/MRU 6. Symbol table management in compiler design 7. Hash table e.t.c If you will see source code of GNU library or any software that is written in C/C++ then you will find lots of program is written using Linked list . The major benefits of linked list is space saving over array since for array we must know in advance how many elements it is going to hold . For large application or software it's not known in advance . Even though it's known then we have to estimate maxm limit on input/ouput. E.g. a ) Let's you are writing  a program to sort given numbers . How to handle input ? 1 . You may assume input size would be maxm 10^6  and declare an array of this size 2. Use linked list  to store inputs b) Other sorting problem :   Let's input contains a database of employees which includes { IDNumber , name (first , last , middle ) , salary , JoinDate } sort this database based on IDNumber . If we use array then we have to do lots of swap when input is in reverse order . But by using linked list it can be minimized .
