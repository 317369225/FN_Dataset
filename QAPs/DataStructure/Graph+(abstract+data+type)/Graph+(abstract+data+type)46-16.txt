Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
One of my favorite professors used to say this : "Physics cannot be taught within the limits of these four walls. Everything related to Physics is outside this room. Don't worry if you don't understand some of the concepts now. You will, with experience you will." Our minds are not super computers. Moreover, we don't study a single subject, hence, the focus gets diverted to multiple points. It is absolutely normal to forget the formulas or the derivations. Now, lets get down to your points : 1. Derivations : It is practically impossible to remember all the derivations because of the basic fact that almost all of the derivations are based on certain assumptions and negations. Thus, in order to remember derivation, one must know what are the assumptions needed and what all parts are to be neglected. This forms a big confusion in mind and until and unless you incorporate it in your regular study (as Steve Byrnes rightly points out ), you will continue to forget them. 2. Marks: You scored 100% in theory because you were totally focused on Physics. You must have avoided many distractions in order to keep up with the exams. Good marks are not the measure of the knowledge one possesses. So relax. If after 6 weeks, you can derive an equation within 15 minutes, then I think you are doing better than the most. 3. Learning : Learning Physics does not mean that you should remember derivations and be able to put it on paper whenever asked. Had this been true, Einstein would have been the worst physicist ever. If you can tell and understandÂ  the three laws of motion, then, in my belief, your base for Physics is strong. And at the end of the day, learning is a life long process. Isn't it? So keep learning without bothering yourself. Life is not a race where you have only 15 minutes to derive satisfaction and knowledge.
