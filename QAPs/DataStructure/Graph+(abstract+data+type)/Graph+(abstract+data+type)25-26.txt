How are students in Indian colleges taught programming?
It's creepy and sad. Excluding the few dozen respectable ones most do not teach CS in a proper manner, as I am sure the others will highlight.  The majority of the others are in rural environments where the situation is pathetic. ======== 90% of Engineering Colleges are in Rural Areas. Programming Environment: ==================== C/C++  : turbo C / Borland C++ 4.0 or something. which is 16 bit. Java     : Oldest JDK 1.4.0 or something. Java IDE : Notepad These Following facts are even more creepy: ============================ Most students memorize Lab Programs (esp: Top-rank holders). The same Lab Programs are prevalent throughout all the different languages [14 usual ones (factorial, Fibonacci series, multiplication tables etc.) in C/C++/Java/C#.NET etc]. All most 80% of Final Year Projects are networking based projects (everybody uses libpcap (and keeps it as super secret). but the professors had no clue. They think students are really manipulating TCP/IP Packets). Its not even funny as this trend has been there around 10 years. Almost all Professors have NO idea about Programming. Students pay more than Rs.15,000 to 25,000  to guys who download the project from Internet and teach them how to run those programs. These people are not even professionals, they don't even change comments in the code. You can see author, GPL license etc. Doing final year projects forms an entire industry where computer centres earn money by millions in one particular year. They even make illegal tie-ups with Head of the Departments to direct all students to particular Computer centre. Those who do the projects on their own gets scrutinized in the subjects and need to face multiple rejections, while others get happily accepted without facing a single question. Students think C#/Java is the latest language and have no idea about scala, clojure, python, ruby. etc.. Students think C/C++ is oldest language and its out of fashion. One should not program with C/C++ (for they think C = TurboC, never heared of Gcc, visual C++ etc.) Students have no idea about Compilers, Artificial Intelligence. Almost all final year projects are on networking (libpcap). Students pay thousands of rupees to computer centres for installing Windows/ anti-viruses in their laptops. But there is hope ============= Some students esp. (Last bench Rebels) 1. They are the ones who keep up with tech and do some innovative programming. 2. They will never get selected via campus interviews(because of their marks). 3. They usually go to start-ups. 4. They are good in tech and they are the sole hope. Funny Category of Students ====================     Some 12th standards students who want to start career in the IT industry don't want to study Computer Science. Their reasons: 1. They aim for SWITCH (Satyam, Wipro, Infosys, TCS, CTS, HCL) Companies. 2. Everybody studies computer science so they want to be different. These guys give the most trouble in any Tech Lead's career. They don't know algorithms, DS, OS etc. And don't want to learn those basics. They want to do an M.B.A and they want 'Onsite Opportunities'. They discourage students to learn about Computer Science. They value only communication skills. They only learn what they think is English (they talk, walk, think everything in  what they perceive to be the English way; while managing a remarkable Indian accent).If you find those guys please don't show any respect; make fun of them. P.S : Sorry this is partly a rant but if you read the above you'll understand my anger. P.S :Studying engineering in big cities gives you a huge advantage compared to doing it in a rural environment. Even if you are studying in rural colleges and if you have some guys  from city environment or if you personally knew any guys from the BETTER ONES(IIT, IIIT, NITs) you have huge advantages. They know about TopCoder, Algorithms, Lisp etc. Even one guy like above category in any college completely change the entire learning environment. Hats off to those guys. But very few colleges have that kind of luxury. Updated 2 Jun • View Upvotes
