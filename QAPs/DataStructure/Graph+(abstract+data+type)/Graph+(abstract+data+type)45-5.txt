What are the best online resources to prepare for GATE exam - Computer Science?
GATE This contains some useful notes for gate which are prepared by a student in IISC (Ankur Gupta). Also, you can listen to relevant lectures on some topics by IIT Professors on youtube or NPTEL . Most of the time these are useful. Also, if you are not clear on a topic, search the relevant lecture on youtube by Stanford or MIT professors. The main part is practicing questions. For that, you can join test series by ACE AcademyÂ  (GATE 2015 Online Test Series) which I think is the best. If you want, you can join test series from Gateforum etc., but I do not have any experience with them.
