How are students in Indian colleges taught programming?
The image that had been put here is a scanned copy of class notes for web technology paper. The question paper is usually set such that we are expected to answer a *programming paper* in a *descriptive manner* (sad.. but we live with it !! :/ ). Happy to hear that few institutes in India have included programming (via online judge systems) as a part of the curriculum (iiit-h an example). But sadly hell lot of institutes here have created a situation where students are forced to *write* programs instead of understanding and creating their own. And the problem here is they fail to understand the importance of *understanding*. Exposure is another problem. Quite a lot of pepole are exposed to programming only after joining college. And that too just for the sake of placements. This situation has to change. Competitive programming, appln development definitely help improve programming skills. And i would proudly say that this is happening a lot in Colleges in India. Few examples: Every year teams from India make it to world finals of ACM ICPC.Â  Results World Finals 2012 Results World Finals 2011 Consistent participation in long and short contests in codechef Programming Competition,Programming Contest,Online Computer Programming Indian ranklist: Ranks (Long Contest) by Country Ranks (Short Contest) by Country topcoder: Member Search Results yahoo's hacku Past University Hack Days and a lot more that i'm not probably aware off!!! But as Prakash Deivakani pointed out.. mostly by seniors/peers help students with programming..
