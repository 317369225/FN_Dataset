Does the United States national debt even matter given that the country has always been in debt?
Only as a ratio of Sovereign Debt to Gross Domestic Product. About that ratio: If the US Economy grows our debt can grow but still stay at a level debt/GDP. We almost never pay down our U.S. Public Debt, we just out grow it. We are almost on track to do that again. Spending on almost all things per GDP is low historically. The one item that makes it grow is Medicare. That can't be solved just by cutting Medicare, that just shifts the problem from public to private but doesn't make the economy any better off. It has to be solved by more cost effective health care. Government Debt in a downturn is a smart way to leverage growth, just like a business uses borrowing to grow. In good times we need to outgrow the debt so the ratio goes down, as we did in the 90s, so we have more room to maneuver next downturn. What level of debt/GDP matters depends on the market. (Japan's ratio is about twice ours but the market still wants to lend to them at good rates.) We have no problem now, people want to lend us money. Interest Rates will eventually go up and then we should slow borrowing so debt/GDP goes down. In the meantime we could borrow a lot in 10-30yr TBills at 0 or near 0 interest and use that for the next 10-30yrs for infrastructure and such. It would be smart management.
