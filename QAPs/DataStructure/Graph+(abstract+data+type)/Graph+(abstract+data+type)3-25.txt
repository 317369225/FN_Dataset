What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
One day, about 7-8 years ago, I was searching online for a radiator for my Mustang when I stumbled on a website: radiators com So, as I am searching this site a windows pops up from with a chat box from a guy named Dave. Dave asks if he can help, I say yes. He asks some question: What year is your car? What size engine Etc. But, "Dave" seems to be a very very fast typer. Dave must be a computer but besides the super fast typing I wouldn't have known. However, and here is what this programmer knew that others didn't: If Dave is a computer then Dave KNOWS Dave is a computer and he will be able to tell me (@Machine Learning Turing Machine). So I ask Dave: "Dave, are you a computer?" His response: "Why, yes, I am! And for knowing to ask that question you will receive 10% off of you radiator purchase today!"
