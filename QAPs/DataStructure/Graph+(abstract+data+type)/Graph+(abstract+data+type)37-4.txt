Is recursion actually useful? I can't find any reason to use it. Why do some people love to use it?
Some problems can be easily solved using recursion, while it is really hard to solve by using iterative solution. For instance, Merge Sort can be implemented using Divide and Conquer strategy. I suppose you could come up with an iterative version of it (without using Stack of course). But it would be much harder to do than the intuitive "recursively sort left half" + "recursively sort right half" + "combine the sorted haves". One downside of using recursion is its running time and memory space. Because recursive involves solving sub problems. If we are not careful, we would end up resolving the sub problem we solved before. So to avoid this, techniques in dynamic programming and memoization are used to store the results of sub problems and then perform simple constant time lookup when solving larger problems.
