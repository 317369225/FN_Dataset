Which book(s) and other resources would you recommend for a beginner to understand Data Structures in C++?Books which preferably are well written and provide good examples/problems to work on and understand concepts clearly?
Originally Answered: Which is the best book for learning data structures and algorithms using c plus plus?If you means implements these data structures yourself, I would like recommond you this book: Data structures and algorithm analysis. It covers common data structures, and not as CLRS cover almost all algorithm in programming. It contains less content. It's for beginners. :).
