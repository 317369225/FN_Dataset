How are students in Indian colleges taught programming?
Most successful software gurus from India are self learners. Most colleges in India lack competent faculty for CS subjects. Thus, students with an inclination to learn programming or any subject for that matter do so on their own. These self learners become successful in the long run. Unfortunately, very few students (maybe less than 20% of them) are self learners. Vast majority of students use their brain merely as memory devices. They just manage to memorize programs, algorithms, equations, theorems without "understanding" them. Indian education system currently emphasize the same. Most colleges and their faculty expect their students to become memorizing machines - the examination and grading system is built to merit such students. Ultimately, students who could memorize and reproduce their memory dump in exams effeciently score higher marks in exams and get placed in a big company. Eventually, most of these candidates actually "learn" programming when they get out of college in to their job. The creative students who question what they learn and devote time "learning" what they like are generally looked down upon. They might not score well in exams. But, in the long run, they would still become successful because of their self learnt knowledge. Updated 24 Jul 2013 â€¢ View Upvotes
