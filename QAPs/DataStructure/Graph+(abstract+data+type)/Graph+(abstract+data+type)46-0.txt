Do grad school students remember everything they were taught in college all the time?
By the time you get to grad school, and most certainly by the time you've been a physicist for many years, you've seen a lot of derivations over and over, often from different perspectives and in different contexts. Often you've taught or explained the derivation to other people. Often you've argued passionately with people about how the derivation works. Often you've tried to incorporate some variant of that derivation into your own research, and spent days struggling with every last detail. By that point, the derivation is like an old friend that you know very well. You and the derivation have been through a lot together!! By this point it's natural and involuntary to remember the derivation, and understand it forwards and backwards and without thinking twice. If you expect to have that level of comfort immediately, in the first course that you've ever seen that kind of material, then you're holding yourself to an unreasonable standard that nobody can meet. If you stick with it, you'll understand better the second time, even better the third time, etc. Spending 15 minutes trying to reproduce a proof after taking the course is something you should be proud of, not ashamed of. It's a very good use of 15 minutes in terms of furthering your education! The mark of someone with a promising future in physics is that they'll spend 15 minutes doing that kind of thing over and over and over, and think of it as an enjoyable and satisfying thing to do. :-D
