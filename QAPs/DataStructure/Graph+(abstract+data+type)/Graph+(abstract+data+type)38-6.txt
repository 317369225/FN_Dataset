What is the most recommended coding language for creating full blown human AI?
This can arguably be answered simply and succinctly in two ways. A. Python - This language contains many abstractions that simplify the monumental task of designing AIs of all levels. In addition to general abstractions, Python has many libraries written for it specifically to build frameworks meant to formulate AI as well as the implementations of many well known machine learning systems/algorithms. B. A general AI will be, by most evaluations of its proposed form and functions, language agnostic. Instead, it is very likely that even the architecture will have little bearing on the end implementation of an AI. It may be better to think of how an AI will be structured as a programming style instead of a language. Object oriented programming was a big step up in development - allowing the massive diversity seen in the programming world to coexist. It is not a different format, or language or grammar, it is a fundamentally different way of thinking about problems, and we have not yet reached that new vista of thought.
