How are students in Indian colleges taught programming?
I recall an incident in my first year of undergraduate C Lab exam, wherein I was asked to write a program which dealt with files in C. I had no clue about files and was in no position to write a program which would be accepted, even by my college standards. I was getting bored sitting inside the lab, and started typing something for about 20 lines. I compiled it and executed it. The program showed around 15 errors. I was certain that there is no way I could convince the examiner that I knew something. Suddenly, the EUREKA moment struck. I inserted a semi-colon (;) next to the 'main' function. I compiled it and executed it. It showed only one error. DECLARATION SYNTAX ERROR. My joy knew no bounds when those 15 errors became 1 and I was now sure that I could convince the examiner by saying that I had only one error, and it was something minor. He bought it. I walked out of the laboratory 2 hours before the stipulated time. I got 48 out of 50 as my external marks.
