Does the United States national debt even matter given that the country has always been in debt?
If nobody went in debt, many opportunities would be lost. Many people could never own a house, many companies could not have been started and many educated people could not has gotten a college degree. There is no shame in government debt as long as the money was invested well. The US pays quite low interest rates. That suggests that the market still has faith in the US (or at least in the IRS).
