What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
Here's one - People are not accounts. Just because an account took some action, it doesn't mean that a particular person took that action.Â  And, vice-versa - just because a person has an account, it doesn't mean that's the account they must have been using to take a particular action on a particular day. Jumping to any conclusion whatsoever about identity, without properly shouldering the burden of proving without a doubt that the person was in fact driving the account, is foolhardy. Legal systems worldwide are still puzzling through this, and there are a myriad of laws which are clearly bunk when reviewed with this in mind.
