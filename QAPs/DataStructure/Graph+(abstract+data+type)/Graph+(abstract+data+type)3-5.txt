What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?
Merge Sort Most people don't know to sort efficiently.  They don't know about algorithms like merge sort.  Instead, they use an inefficient hybrid of selection sort and insertion sort. I once had a summer job with the university housing department.  We served youth organizations that used the dorms over the summer.  The biggest hassle was accounting for the meal cards after each group checked out.  We had to sort them and look for missing card numbers.  Everyone hated sorting duty. Sorting 1000 cards by hand took could take several hours. Management would try to make it faster by assigning more people. As any programer knows, coordinating multi-threaded insertion sort is non-trivial.  When you have human personalities instead threads contending for resources, the coordination is even more difficult. I decided to teach the group to use merge sort.  A 4 hour task was reduced to 30 minutes. Everyone could focus on their own portion until the final merge.
