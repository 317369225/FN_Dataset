What is the advantages for "B+ tree" over "ISAM" in DBMS?
ISAM stands for Indexed Sequential Access Method and describes a physical database organization. ISAM underlies most relational and many other kinds of databases. The “Index” part can be implemented in many ways. B+Trees are one way, and I would venture to say the most common way, to implement indexes in database systems. So you really can’t compare B+Tree to ISAM that’s an apples to pie comparison. Or perhaps a better analogy would be drinking glass to glass blowing comparison since it is a concept versus one way to implement the concept. 471 Views · 1 Upvote
