What is the algorithm to perform insertion in a B Tree?
There are two basic methods: Bottom Up - Find the appropriate leaf node and add your entry to it. If this causes the node to overflow then split it in two and push the middle entry into the node's parent. Continue recursing upwards until insertion into a parent doesn't cause overflow (or you have created a new root). Top Down Traverse down the tree towards the appropriate leaf node. If a child node is full then split it before continuing down the path. In the latter method, if the leaf node was not full then a number of unnecessary splits will be the result. However, it is not necessary to loc... (more)
