What are the differences between B+Tree and B-Tree?
The difference is B- trees (called Btree not B minus tree) keeps key values and corresponding records in the same node whereas all the records are stored in the leaves of B+tree. (If you search a value and it matches with a internal node for B- tree you might get it directly from the node but for B+tree you need to go leaves anyway for the exact record ) In that way each non leaf node is able to store more pointer in the places of records. It gives lower height trees compared to B- trees in which it results some specific pros and cons. Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date?
