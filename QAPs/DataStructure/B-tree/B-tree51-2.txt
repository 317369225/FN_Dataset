How does a relational DBMS internally store its data? In what type of data structure? How does it offer the rapid retrieval without loading the entire database into the main memory (I have heard many DBMS use B-trees)?
RDBMS generally uses variations of B-Tree. MySQL uses B+ tree to store data indexes. InnoDB stores both data file and index file into the memory while MyISAM stores only the index file. So, in majority of cases MyISAM can be helpful if memory is less than data size. Now what if data is larger than memory? Have you noticed anything about query made on unindexed table. Its slow because all of the data have to be loaded into the memory and read one by one to get you results. Same thing will happen in this case, read will become slow. There is something called Buffer Pool, which is responsib... (more)
