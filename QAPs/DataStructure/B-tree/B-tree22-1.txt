How would you explain a B-Tree data structure in layman's terms?
By noting that a B-Tree combines a Linked List with a Binary Search Tree, in layman's terms. A linked list is a simple way to store and search data in O(n). But with a large amount of data to be searched, not all of it can be loaded into memory at once. So the searching will bring in windows/parts of the list at a time for each search iteration, increasing I/O. A binary search tree adds indexing ability - allowing the search for data to be done on meta-data keys alone. The search can be O(logn) and at each element, the left/right half can be discarded as the other holds the value which i... (more)
