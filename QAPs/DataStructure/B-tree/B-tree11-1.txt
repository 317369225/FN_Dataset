How is a B-Tree exactly used by MySQL for indexing?
A Binary Tree (not B-tree) has a branching factor of 2, it means, it has 2 child nodes. From a representation and programming standpoint we call them the left child and the right child. The time needed to find (or declare it as not found) a node in a tree is proportional to its height and balance (balance means, the left and right side sub-trees are roughly the same height). This makes for a good indexing data structure where the access time is a log of the number of nodes. Remember, a log reduces an exponential to a linear. If you have to go through an index to find the address of some piece ... (more)
