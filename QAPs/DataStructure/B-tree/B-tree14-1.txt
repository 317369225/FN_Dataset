What is the simple possible application using B tree?
I use a B-tree for geotagging photos retroactively. Each GPS location and timestamp is entered into a Perl hash tied to a B-tree database, then to tag a photo I look up the locations bracketing that time. This is the code that tags a photo taken at time $time: sub compare { my ($k1,$k2) = @_ ; $k1 <=> $k2 ; } $DB_BTREE->{'compare'} = \&compare ; $trackh = tie %track, "DB_File", "trackdb", O_RDWR, 0666, $DB_BTREE ; #... $key1 = $key2 = $time ; $trackh->seq($key2, $next, R_CURSOR) ; $trackh->seq($key1, $prev, R_PREV) ;...
