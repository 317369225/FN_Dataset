When duplicate keys are allowed in a B-tree, what are the changes of some algorithms when compared to the B-tree with no duplicate keys?
If duplicates are allowed your inserts are somewhat similar. What is different is that when you find a match to select or delete, you then have to find nearby records on both sides of the key. One way to implement that is using a combination of linked list and BTree. You can then link equal items. In fact that is very much what B+trees are doing. Thank you for your feedback!
