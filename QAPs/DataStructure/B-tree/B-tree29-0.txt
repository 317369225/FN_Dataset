What is the Order of a B-Tree?
The B-tree can have any order greater than 2. What's important is to understand what a B-tree is. A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that keeps sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions and deletions in logarithmic time. A B-tree node can contain more than one key values whereas a BST node contains only one. There are lower and upper bounds on the number of keys a node can contain. These bounds can be expressed in terms of a fixed integer T>=2 called the minimum degree of the B-tree. Every node other than the root must have at least T-1 keys. Every internal node other than the root must have at least T children. Every node can contain at most 2T-1 keys. Therefore, an internal node can have at most 2T children. We say that the node is full if it contains exactly 2T-1 keys.
