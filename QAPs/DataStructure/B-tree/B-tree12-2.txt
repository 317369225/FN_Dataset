What does it mean for B+ trees to have high fanout?
B+ trees can store a relatively large number of pointers to child nodes in each node. "Fanout" in this context refers to this number of pointers per node. B+ trees minimize the depth of the tree (and therefore the number of hops to reach a leaf node) by employing high fanout: linking many children from each node. 7.9k Views Â· 21 Upvotes
