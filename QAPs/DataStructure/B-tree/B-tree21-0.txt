In which situations is using a hash index faster than using a B-tree index for an equality search, and why?
Hash Indexes is the general recommendation for equality based lookups since we avoid the overhead of going down the BTREE all the way to the leaf block, and then searching for the desired key within the leaf block and the corresponding row locator. A suitably sized hash table can very well give an amortized O(1) cost for lookup operations. This is not the case with B-Trees where the lookup is O(logn) and is certainly not constant.
