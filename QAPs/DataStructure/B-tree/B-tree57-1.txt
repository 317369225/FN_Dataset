What is the function of a B-tree and how do I use one?
The function of B-Tree is to maintain the balanced structure of your tree and being able to guaranty certain worst case complexities based on this balance. Assume that you have a binary tree and this is the insertion order to your tree. 10 , 8 , 6 , 4 , 2Â  , 1 ... your tree will grow always on the left sub-tree and this is the main reason why the worst case complexity of normal binary tree is O(n) - when you search for 1 you have to traverse all the tree. Although this is not a common case it can happen. In terms of B-Tree no matter the order of values shall be, it will never became this... (more)
