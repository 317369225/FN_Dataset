Are streaming cache-oblivious B-Trees or stratified B-Trees patent encumbered? Would either be safe to implement based only on the published information?
Patent applications are in process for some of the cache oblivious B-trees but it is too early to tell if meaningful patents will emerge from the chaos. There is enough noise in that algorithm area that it is not clear if a truly blocking patent is even possible or defensible, or if disambiguation from the prior art will be feasible. This weakens the patents of everyone working on flavors of these algorithms. Patent areas that have clear technology leaders are more dangerous. Whether or not it is "safe" to implement them is subjective. Like some other areas of computer science, you are lik... (more)
