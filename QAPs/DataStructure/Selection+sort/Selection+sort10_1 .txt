What is the best way to remember the insertion, bubble and selection sort algorithms?I am looking for some hacky way to remember the algo (not the code) so that I can write correct code in interviews.I would be very surprised to see an interview that asked the difference between these, or said "Sort these numbers using a selection sort." I'd honestly think that was a sign of a poor interviewer. I confuse selection sort and insertion sort myself, but if asked to write a sort with no notice I could throw up a bubble sort, one of those two, a merge sort, or a quicksort. (I probably would throw up one of the n^2 sorts first because they're easier to write, then talk about perf and requirements and put up a quicksort or mergesort.)
