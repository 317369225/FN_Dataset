Why is selection sort said to be better than bubble sort though both are of order n square? I dont see a significant difference in their algo. Plz explain?If you have to sort 100 fridges in order of their hight , you ll prefer less number of moves even if it means more comparisons. But if you have to sort a group of 1000 people by their racing speed, it will be annoying for everyone ,if your strategy is to make every possible couple of those people, race every couple, mark the winner and merge to the aggregate list in order of winning.(If you actually implement like this some of these people may punch your face),you d better ask them to race together and record the people who reach the finish line , in that order. from Sameer Gupta's answer to Which is the best sorting algorithm for large data?
