Why is selection sort said to be better than bubble sort though both are of order n square? I dont see a significant difference in their algo. Plz explain?In bubble sort we compare two consecutive elements and swap the elements if they are out of order. Total no. of swaps in the worst case is N(N-1)/2 because swapping is in the inner loop. In selection sort swapping is done in the outer loop. So no of swaps is (N-1). Both methods will make N(N-1)/2 comparisons. So the only difference is in no. of swaps. If copy is costly(like in the case of structures) we may see a better performance from selection sort.
