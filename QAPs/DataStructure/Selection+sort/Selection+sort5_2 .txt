When should one use selection sort and bubble sort ? Is there any advantage of selection sort over bubble sort or vice versa?I hope that we go for bubble sort in conditions where the inputs are moreover sorted with some randomness in it. Even though the best case and worst case complexity of selection sort is O(n^2), when should we go for it?In case of an almost sorted small array, its recommended to go for Insertion Sort rather than Bubble Sort, since the former has a lower constant. Selection Sort is preferred when memory writes are more expensive than reads, as it makes only O(n) writes
