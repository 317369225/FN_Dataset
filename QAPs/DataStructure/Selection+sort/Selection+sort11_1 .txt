Regarding a selection sort, why is sorting an ordered list slower than sorting a random list?Hello, I am a high school student and I wonder why doing selection sort the ordered list is slower. I thoughtÂ  there is less update of smallest index of element in ordered list which makes it bit faster than random list.No, correct implementation should always have time complexity O(n^2) whether the array is sorted or not, with sorted array actually faster than the unsorted by a factor of n. It always check n-1, n-2, ... 1 comparison as it goes from lower index, making it O(n^2), but the sorted array can avoid O(n) swaps. Quicksort is the one that slows down on sorted list.
