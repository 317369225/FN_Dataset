In my experience, from most to least commonly mentioned in interviews: 1. quicksort: implement it, explain it 2. mergesort: implement it, talk about space complexity as well as time complexity 3. insertion sort: explain when it can be better than the above two 4. heapsort: explain how it works, and how heaps work in general 5. bubble sort: why it's awful 6. radix/counting/bucket sort: when it's useful 7. selection sort: usually thrown in as an example when asked to list sorting algorithms you know Pretty much everything else is trivia. I also like to throw in Python's "Tim Sort" in these conversations.
