When should one use Insertion vs. Selection sort?I was reviewing for the AP Computer Science exam coming up in a couple of days and stumbled across this question. Both sorting algorithms are quadratic, so I did not immediately recognize any measurable performance differences. Thus, my assumption is that deciding which sorting method to use is dependent on what is being accomplished. If that is the case, please provide real world use cases.If the list is almost sorted, then Insertion Sort performs in linear O(n) time. Contrast this with Selection Sort, which always performs in quadratic time.
