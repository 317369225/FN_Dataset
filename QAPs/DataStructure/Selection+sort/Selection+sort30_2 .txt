Check out the Algorithms Repository which contains mashup of information from many online resources. Most important sorting algorithms are -: Quicksort Merge sort Heapsort Bubble sort Selection sort Insertion sort Bucket sort Radix sort Other important sorting algorithms are -: Topological sort Counting sort Shell sort There are many online sources which are contributing to this repository such as http://www.personal.kent.edu, Wikipedia, http://www.algolist.net, http://www.cprogramming.com, http://www.codingunit.com, http://www.geeksforgeeks.org, http://www.brpreiss.com, Stoimen's Web Log, http://oopweb.com, http://www.cs.fsu.edu, http://www.codeproject.com, Code n Learn and many other resources. Full list of sorting algorithms in the repository are: Bubble sort Cocktail sort Comb sort Gnome sort Odd-even sort Quicksort Bogosort Stooge sort Flashsort Introsort Timsort Insertion sort Library sort Patience sorting Shell sort Tree sort Cycle sort Merge sort Strand sort Bead sort Bucket sort Burstsort Counting sort Pigeonhole sort Postman sort Radix sort Heapsort Selection sort Smoothsort Bitonic sorter Pancake sorting Topological sort Samplesort Thanks.
