Assume that you are to write a C program which performs a selection sort directly on a file. Is this possible?Selection sort is an algorithm which is bound to comparing two values using a simple condition that the first unsorted object would be compared with all the remaining object in unsorted list[or array or collection...] and replaced with smallest or largest(depending on order). refer this: This algorithm independent of type of object, but dependent on comparator function(which compares two object). There is no other condition in this algorithm. There is no reason why comparing file would be any different. Thus, it is possible.
