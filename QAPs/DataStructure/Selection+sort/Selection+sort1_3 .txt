When should one use Insertion vs. Selection sort?I was reviewing for the AP Computer Science exam coming up in a couple of days and stumbled across this question. Both sorting algorithms are quadratic, so I did not immediately recognize any measurable performance differences. Thus, my assumption is that deciding which sorting method to use is dependent on what is being accomplished. If that is the case, please provide real world use cases.Also it depends on what you're doing. Are you simply taking a list and sorting it? Or are you keeping a list sorted when adding to it? If the later, Insertion is definitely preferred ... But ... You need to consider the cost of swaps against inserts. E.g. an insert into a linked list is O(1) once you've got the position, but when using an array it's O(N) even after finding the position. Thus a selection sort is the better alternative when using an array, while an insertion sort might perform better when using a linked list.
