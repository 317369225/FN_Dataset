What is the worst case complexity of selection sort? Is it theta (n) or theta (n^2)? How?Worst case complexity of selection sort is O(n^2). In worst case, you will have to compare every element with every other element in the array. Worst case scenario: {6,5,4,3,2,1} to be sorted in increasing order. In first pass, you will compare 6 with every other element (5 comparisons). In next pass, you will compare 5 with every other element except 6 (4 comparisons). In the last pass, you will just compare 2 with 1 and swap them to get {1,2,3,4,5,6}. So in all you do 5+4+3+2+1 = 15 comparisons. In general, selection sort costs comparisons in worst case which is O(n^2).
