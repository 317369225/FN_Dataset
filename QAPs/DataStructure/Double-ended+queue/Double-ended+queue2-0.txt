Do any programming languages allow a pop from the bottom of the stack?
No. A stack is an abstract data structure independent of programming language and is defined only to have push and pop from the top. If you can pop from the bottom, it wouldn't be a stack, it would be a queue (a double-ended queue to be precise if you can access both the top and bottom, or an array if you can arbitrarily access any location). At the level of machine code, the stack is just a block of (generally contiguous) memory along with a pointer to the top. It's not special in any way other than that. You can only perform operations on the location the pointer is at* if you restrict yourself to a stack, but there is nothing physically stopping you from accessing the other memory locations if you know where they are. ---- *Possibly with an offset depending if the pointer position is full or empty, which depends on implementation but isn't too important
