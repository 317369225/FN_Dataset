How do you pronounce "deque"?
Most English sites claim that "deque" is "usually pronounced deck". However, I found that this pronunciation often causes confusion (as in "what the heck is a deck?") Hence I prefer to use the full "double-ended queue" at least for the first time in the conversation. When using the short form, I prefer to pronounce it ['dekju:] -- the beginning sounds like "deck" [dek], the end sounds like "queue" [kju:], and the entire word sounds different from "dequeue" [di:'kju:] (the operation of removing something from a queue). It may not be the mainstream way of pronunciation but it gets the meaning across without confusion.
