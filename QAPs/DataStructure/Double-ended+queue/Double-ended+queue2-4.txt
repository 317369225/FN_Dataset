Do any programming languages allow a pop from the bottom of the stack?
A stack is a concept. It is defined to be restrictive in nature and allows only partial access. How it is implemented is left to the programmer. If you take a block of memory and write methods to "allow a pop from the bottom of the stack", it loses its definition of being a stack. You can call your data structure a stack only if you can push/pop onto/from the top. However, that doesn't mean you need to restrict yourselves to. All you need to do often is pretend that your block of memory is literally a stack of plates and you can't touch the ones below the top one. It's a useful pretense. If you're talking about the default data structures present in various languages, like the list in Python, you see that you can pretend that it is a stack or a queue or what not!
