Can all mathematical processes have graphs? Is there any exception?
Let me just leap in and assume that by the word graph you mean something like this: Let me also assume that process means some kind of system that can be represented graphically in this way. The short answer to your question is a definite 'no'. In fact there are many easy to conjure mathematical systems that cannot be represented graphically, at least not in straightforward, obvious ways. Here's an example. You are probably familiar with the concept of the plane, where all the real numbers are represented in the horizontal direction and all of the real numbers are represented in the vertical. Suppose you think of trying to make a graph where every rational number, such as 1/2, or 124/23, along the horizontal dimension is paired with 1 in the vertical dimension, and all of the other real numbers are paired with 2. You simply can't do it, because between any two rational numbers not only are there are infinitely many other rational numbers there are infinitely many other other real numbers. Your graph would appear to be two 'lines', one at 1 in the vertical dimension and one at 2. But in actuality, the two lines would be infinite series of points!
