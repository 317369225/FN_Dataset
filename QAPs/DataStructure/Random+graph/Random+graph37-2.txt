Can all mathematical processes have graphs? Is there any exception?
I am also confused about the terminology here. Does your "mathematical processes" include "mathematical operations"? What does your "graph" include? Straight up from my mind I have the basic mathematical operations (+-*/) as the answer. I don't think you can graph 2+2=4, unless you use apples and oranges like they do in children's books.
