What are some interesting, lesser known applications of data science (machine learning, random graphs, high dimensions, etc.) to e-commerce?
Here's one application of random graphs, but I'm not sure if it's being used in industry.  I've thought about it in the context of mapping user relations in a mobile video game :).  It's related to statistical validation. Say you've just built a graph from private chat messages between users.  You want to know if the amount of reciprocity in the graph is high, or if the clustering coefficient is high.  To test this, you might define a random graph which is constructed (in terms of p, probability of edges, or a more complex model) from your empirical data.  You can then simulate graphs to form p-values to determine whether the structure of your graph is actually statistically different from "random". In another direction, it could be the case that you have multiple different types of communication between people.  If you want to build a simple graph from this data (as opposed to a multigraph), you have to decide how to weigh the individual components.  With a formal statistical model on the likelihood of edges between two given nodes, you can start to think about validating to choose one model over another, maybe by MLE.
