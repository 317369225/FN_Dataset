What are some Python modules I should know for competitive programming?
In addition to the modules already mentioned I would recommend to look into random module for test case generation. It is important to be able to quickly generate big random test cases for your solution to test it on them. Python is definitely the right language for this job. In my answer to How do I create random big testcases for testing by Python script for competitive programming? I have shown a couple of useful one-liners on how to generate random graphs, trees, strings, sequences, etc. So definitely take a look at those as well.
