What is percolation?
In mathematics, percolation describes the connected-ness of random graphs, and hopefully some mathematicians will weigh in with a more rigorous explanation of the mathematics. In colloquialism, I imagine a pond with lily pads arranged on a square lattice, and a frog that can only hop from one adjacent pad to another.  As you take lily pads away, the pathways that the frog can take to hop from one end of the pond to another become limited.  Once you take away enough lily pads (41% for an infinite square lattice), there is no longer a connected path for the frog to hop from one end of the pond to the other.  This sort of problem has been studied for various types of graphs in various dimensions.  The connectedness of the voids in a porous medium, as discussed by AB CD, is another intuitive example. Percolation problems show up in solid state physics.  One example is the dilution of a magnetic lattice with non-magnetic ions.  In some instances, magnetism goes away at 41% dilution (square lattice), just like the percolation problem.  Another example is metal-insulator transitions for thin metal films of sub-unit-cell thickness.  When there is a connected path of metal atoms from one end of the sample to another, it has metallic conduction; when there is insufficient coverage, it is an insulator.
