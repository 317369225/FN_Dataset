What are some good resources for a beginner to learn about random graph theory and spectral graph theory?
For spectral graph theory try these: Algebraic Graph Theory by Godsil and Royle Spectra of Graphs by Brouwer and Haemers Spectral Graph Theory by Chung Eigenspaces of Graphs by Cvetkovic, Rowlinson and Simic
