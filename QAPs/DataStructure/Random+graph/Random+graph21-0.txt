What is a constructive proof of existence?
Claim: there are two people in the world who have the same birthday. Non-constructive proof: there are 366 possible birthdays (taking Feb 29 into account), and there are more than 366 people in the world, so there must be two people with the same birthday. Constructive proof: Christopher Hitchens and Garry Kasparov were both born on April 13. Claim: the equation [math]x^4-14x^2+9=0[/math] has a real solution greater than 2. Non-constructive proof: The value of this polynomial is negative when [math]x=2[/math]  and positive when [math]x=10[/math]. Since the polynomial is a continuous function, it must vanish for some [math]x[/math] between 2 and 10. Constructive proof: Plug in [math]x=\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{5}[/math] and see what happens. Claim: there exist graphs with arbitrarily large chromatic number and girth. (The chromatic number is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph so that adjacent vertices have a different color. The girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle).  Non-constructive proof: Erdös showed in 1959 that if you take a random graph with some carefully selected parameters, and then remove some vertices to delete all short cycles, you can obtain a graph with arbitrarily high chromatic number and girth. This is a great example of the Probabilistic Method in graph theory: we show that certain things exist by choosing them at random. Erdös' method does not yield any specific graph with these properties. Constructive proof: Almost 20 years passed before Laci Lovász was able to explicitly construct graphs with high girth and high chromatic number. The Kneser graph [math]K(m,n)[/math] has for vertices all the subsets of [math]{1,\ldots,n}[/math] of size [math]m[/math], and two vertices are adjacent if the corresponding sets are disjoint. Lovász was able to prove an older conjecture of Kneser stating that by choosing [math]m,n[/math] appropriately we can find a Kneser graph with girth and chromatic number as high as we want.
