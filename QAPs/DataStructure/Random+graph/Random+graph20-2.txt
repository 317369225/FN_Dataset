What are some Python modules I should know for competitive programming?
itertools - Functions creating iterators for efficient looping - They will help you, more often than you think collections - High-performance container datatypes - Believe me, this is pretty awesome heapq - Heap queue algorithm - Obviously, we don't have to hand-code heaps anymore bisect - Array bisection algorithm - Binary Search, simplified Set Dict - Now on, hash Tables are fun to work with Sorting - Don't participate in competitions without reading this completely. Apart from these, all the builtin methods of default containers.If you want to improve your code, you have to find the bottlenecks in the code. To analyze them, you can use the simple, builtin profilers like cProfile and timeit (Measure execution time of small code snippets) In my personal experience, just knowing all the eight items have made most of my topcoder Div 2 250 submissions as one-liners and thereby getting me more than 248 points.
