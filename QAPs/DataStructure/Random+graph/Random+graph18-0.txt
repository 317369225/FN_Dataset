What's the coolest mathematical object?
Personally, I'm a big fan of the Monster group. A group is a certain mathematical structure, i.e. a set G and a binary operation * satisfying some predefined properties (closedness, associativity, inverse elements). It turns out that, on the condition that the set G is finite and simple, all such groups can be classified. There are a few general classes of groups that can be constructed for any number n (e.g., the group of possible permutations of n elements). Aside from those, there are exactly 26 unique groups (called sporadic groups) that are not part of any such class. Out of all the possible numbers, exactly 26 set sizes can be given a structure that adheres to a few simple rules, without visible pattern. I think that's pretty remarkable. The largest sporadic group is the Monster group. It has 808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,710,757,005,754,368,000,000,000 elements. I'll repeat that for you, broken down in prime factors: 2^46 · 3^20 · 5^9 · 7^6 · 11^2 · 13^3 · 17 · 19 · 23 · 29 · 31 · 41 · 47 · 59 · 71 The idea that a simple and often recurring construct such as a group, can give rise to special, unique numbers and structures of this magnitude ... amazing.
