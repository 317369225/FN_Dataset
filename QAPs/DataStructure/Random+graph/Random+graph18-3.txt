What's the coolest mathematical object?
The Rado graph, otherwise known as The Random Graph. Take any countably infinite set as your set of vertices. Now toss a coin for each pair of vertices, connecting them if you get heads, leaving them disconnected on tails. With probability 1 you have constructed a graph isomorphic to the Rado graph. How can this be? There are infinitely many possible pairs of vertices and each one can be assigned an edge or not. So there seem to be uncountably many graphs on a countable set. How can you ever expect to even get the same graph twice, let alone always get exactly the same graph (up to isomorphism) every single time? And yet, by magic, you do. The Rado graph has many amazing properties. For example it contains every finite graph as an induced subgraph. By induced subgraph I mean a subgraph that is formed by taking some subset of vertices and all of the edges with both ends attached to those vertices. What's more, the Rado graph contains every countably infinite graph as an induced subgraph. The Rado graph is also hard to kill. If you chop a finite number of edges and vertices off from it you still have the Rado graph. And if you hack off an infinite piece, then either that piece, or the remainder, is a Rado graph. In fact, both parts may be Rado graphs.
