What percent of people would understand me if I said my research was about generating random graphs with specific properties?
Understanding that statement requires knowing the in-context meaning of "graph". That means the only distinguisher that matters is the amount of exposure your subjects have had to graph theory, and your groupings above are almost irrelevant. Unfortunately for you, for everybody who doesn't know anything about graphs, you either need to incorporate an explanation or elide them completely by focusing on some concrete applications. (For an elevator pitch that obviously reduces to "elide them".) Good luck!
