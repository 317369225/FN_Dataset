Lambert's W-function describes both diodes and the emergence of a giant component in a random graph. Coincidence? Or does the diode's threshold voltage correspond to the emergence of a giant component of *something* at the quantum level?
Why make things so complicated?   A diode can be perfectly modeled by a simple exponential.   The current is the exponential of the voltage, over at least ten decades.  You don't need to muddy it up with anything fancier.
