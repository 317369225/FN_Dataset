What are the most mathematical areas of statistics?
Sounds like you need some algebraic geometry in your life. Singular Learning Theory uses algebraic techniques to study cases where the Fisher information matrix is singular.  Sounds pretty interesting. Another place where algebraic geometry / commutative algebra and statistics intersects is a field called, appropriately, algebraic statistics: Page on berkeley.edu. Mathematical finance as practiced in academia can also be quite mathematically sophisticated.  The math practiced here is usually much more analysis-oriented though.  In fact, I would say stochastic processes are common in many areas of statistics.
