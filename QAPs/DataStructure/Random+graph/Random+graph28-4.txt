What are the most mathematical areas of statistics?
Bayesian Nonparametric Statistics. A very new field with seeds planted in the early 70's by UCLA's Professor Tom Ferguson and 80's by FSU's Professor J. Sethuraman. Draws on deep probability theory, measure theory, MCMC-Gibbs Sampling and computing. Has been applied to obtain some very interesting alternative solutions to estimation of statistical linear models, item response theory, density distributions, and clustering structures. I would not be surprised if there have also been applications to mathematical finance and portfolio theory, and time series models.
