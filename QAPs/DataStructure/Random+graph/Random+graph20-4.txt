What are some Python modules I should know for competitive programming?
Modules that I often use: math - Mathematical functions itertools - Functions creating iterators for efficient looping collections - High-performance container datatypes sys - System-specific parameters and functions ~ Reading all input at once using sys.stdin.read() is fast and very helpful when you are dealing with strict time limits. (especially on judges like Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ) where time limit is same for all languages.) bisect - Array bisection algorithm operator - Standard operators as functions ~ especially operator.itemgetterSome more helpful modules: heapq - Heap queue algorithm functools - Higher-order functions and operations on callable objects decimal - Decimal fixed point and floating point arithmetic fractions - Rational numbers __future__ - Future statement definitions For debugging: The Python Profilers pprint - Data pretty printer For random data generation: random - Generate pseudo-random numbersI never used re - Regular expression operations in competitive programming (may be once) but it is very helpful to know.
