Is it a coincidence that the last people who developed nearly every field in mathematics, such as Hilbert and von Neumann, existed 100 years ago, when the field of computer science arose?
Being a mathematician in 1890 was a far different career than in 1940:  the publication model, funding model, graduate education and potential career paths all experienced a sea change.  So yes, there were a lot more people doing mathematics 100 years ago compared to 150 years ago, and they were far more efficient in how they worked. That said, I think your question does betray a selection bias.  It's often difficult to tell when a "field" of mathematics originates, especially close to the event.  In another hundred years we might think that the statistics developed by Ronald Fisher are passe and the random graph theory that began with Alfréd Rényi and Paul Erdős in the early 1960s has become a field in its own right. So here is a more interesting interpretation of your question:  how long does it take a "result" in mathematics to become a "field"?  If the passage time is on the order of 50-150 years, that would explain what you're observing.
