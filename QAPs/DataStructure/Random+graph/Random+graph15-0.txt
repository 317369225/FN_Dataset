Graph Theory:Â Let G be a randomly generated graph with n vertices. What is the probability that G is connected?
Almost all graphs are connected. This means: the probability of a graph being connected tends to [math]1[/math] as its number of vertices tends to infinity. Look at the book Graphical Enumeration by Harary and Palmer for more information. One result that contributes to this fact is that, for every graph [math]G[/math], either [math]G[/math] or its complement [math]\bar{G}[/math] (or both) is connected. Thus, the probability that a graph on [math]n\geq 2[/math] vertices is connected is at least [math]\frac{1}{2}[/math]. This bound is sharp for [math]n=2[/math] and [math]n=3;[/math] for larger [math]n[/math], the probability is strictly greater than [math]\frac{1}{2}[/math], and is monotonic increasing for increasing [math]n[/math].
