What's the coolest mathematical object?
There are some great answers here.  I'll suggest another that's pretty cool.  The field of complex numbers [math]\mathbf C[/math]. It's what mathematicians call a field, which means you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide as usual. It's an algebraically closed field, which means every polynomial whose coefficients are complex numbers has a root.  In fact, it was created to make the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra true. It's got two automorphisms, namely, the identity and complex conjugation. With only Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (without the axiom of choice), it's consistent that these are the only two. (See Paul Yale's article Automorphisms of the complex numbers and Solovay model.) It's a complete metric space, which means you can measure distances between two numbers (the absolute value of their difference), and with that metric there are no missing points. If a function [math]f:\mathbf C\to\mathbf C[/math] has a derivative on an open set, then it has derivatives of all orders.  Such functions are called holomorphic functions.  They are analytic functions in that a neighborhood of each point in their domain they represented by power series. Much of analysis, physics, number theory, algebra, and geometry depend on the complex numbers. I tell you, with complex numbers you can do anything.                         — John Derbyshire.
