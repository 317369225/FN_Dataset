What are the most important properties of Erdos-Renyi graphs?
Before I answer your question, I would like to clarify something. Let [math]\mathcal{G}[/math] be family of all possible labeled graphs with vertex set V=[n]={1,..,n}. The original Erdős–Rényi model has two parameters, n and m, the number of vertices and edges respectively. The original model assigned equal probability among all [math]G \in \mathcal{G}[/math] with exactly m edges. Since there exist [math]{{n \choose 2}\choose m}[/math] graphs in [math]\mathcal{G}[/math] with m edges, the probability is 1/[math]{{n \choose 2}\choose m}[/math]. Gilbert had introduced a model with two parameters, n and p, the number of vertices and the probability of an edge among any two vertices. Hence the probability measure of  [math]G \in \mathcal{G}[/math] is equal to  [math]p^{|E(G)|} (1-p)^{{n \choose 2}-|E(G)|} [/math] These two models are closely related through an asymptotic equivalence model which pretty much says that you can think of G(n,m) as G(n,p) with [math]p=m/{n \choose 2}[/math] when you study your favorite graph theoretic property.  This equivalence is particularly strong when the properties you are interested are monotone increasing or decreasing. [A property [math]\mathcal{P}[/math] is a set of graphs. We call a graph property monotone increasing if [math]G\in \mathcal{P}[/math] implies [math]G+e\in \mathcal{P}[/math], namely adding an edge does not destroy the property. An analogous definition holds for a decreasing property]. You can find the asymptotic equivalence in any random graph theory book, e.g., Random Graphs (Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics): Béla Bollobás: 9780521797221: Amazon.com: Books). Given this asymptotic equivalence and given that the G(n,p) model is easier to work with due to the independence of the edges, it is referred to as the Erdős–Rényi model. One of the most striking properties of the Erdős–Rényi model is the abrupt way in which properties appear.  This is quantified through the concept of thresholds. Specifically, a function [math]p^*=p^*(n)[/math] is a threshold for a monotone increasing property [math]\mathcal{P}[/math] in a random graph G(n,p) if [math]\lim_{n \rightarrow +\infty} Pr(G \in \mathcal{P})[/math] is equal to 0 if [math]p\ll p^*[/math]  and 1 if [math]p^* \ll p[/math]. Here is the first striking theorem which you can find in this paper Hereditary and Monotone Properties of Graphs Theorem: Every monotone graph property has a threshold. If I had to choose a second important property this would be the phase transition on the size of the giant connected component that an Erdős–Rényi model undergoes.  If p>1/n then there exists a giant connected  component which spans [math]\Omega(n)[/math] vertices. If p<1/n then the order of the largest connected component is O(log(n)). Hence you can see that a small change in p results in an exponential change in the size of the largest connected component. A very simple proof appears here [1201.6529] The phase transition in random graphs. The original proof is due to Erdős and Rényi.
