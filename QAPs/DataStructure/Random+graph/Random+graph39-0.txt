What are current research topics and open problems in the high-dimensional statistics area?
Off the top of my head: Simultaneous tests of multiple hypotheses, large-scale inference (using Empirical Bayes), inference and confidence sets for high-dimensional regression coefficients, inference for parameters of machine-learning methods (decisions trees, SVM, neural networks), inference after selection, high-dimensional covariance estimation and random matrix theory, inference of the structure of large random graphs, high-dimensional goodness-of-fit tests, high-dimensional change-point problems, inference of social network models, PCA, factor analysis, and dimensionality reduction, shocking fundamental problems in spatial statistics (we have so little theory on how to estimate anything from non-iid data.)
