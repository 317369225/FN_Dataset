Is there any known relationship between the number of edges in a graph and the length of its longest simple chordless cycle?
I think we need to refine the question somewhat: obviously you're not talking about the sheer number of edges, because even intuitively it isn't true that just having a billion edges means you can't have long chordless cycles. The graph could be just a cycle with a billion vertices and a billion edges. What you mean to say, I believe, is that if the graph has lots of edges relative to the number of vertices, then it's unlikely to have long simple chordless cycles. So instead of "number of edges", we should be considering the ratio of edges to vertices, or in other words, the average degree. A cycle without chords is more often called an induced cycle. This is because if you look at the vertices of such a cycle, and you throw in all the edges that connect any pair of vertices in this set, you get just the cycle and nothing else. This is what "induced" means. I can find some results on dense random graphs. If the number of vertices [math]n[/math] is large and the density is large too in the sense that the average degree is linear (meaning, the graph has edges chosen randomly with probability [math]p[/math] and [math]p[/math] is constant), then the longest induced cycle has logarithmic length, which I think is reasonable to name "short". So this justifies your intuition that high density implies no "long" induced cycles, at least in the typical case. When the density is [math]o(n)[/math] but still large in some sense, the situation is different - the largest induced cycle is then of linear length, which is actually quite long. Of course the coefficient of linearity is going to be small if the density is low, but I still find it surprising. This result is in: Tomasz Łuczak, The size of the largest hole in a random graph. I couldn't easily find unconditional results that provide bounds on the length of induced cycles given the density, but it's an interesting question. One relevant paper is Van Nuffelen and Van Rompay, On the length of longest chordless cycles. This paper provides bounds on the length in terms of the degree of the adjacency matrix, and it's unclear to me if these can be helpful in finding bounds of the kind you seek. EDIT: here is a simple construction which shows that large holes (long induced cycles) can exist in very dense graphs. Take a cycle of length [math]k[/math] and a complete graph on [math]k[/math] vertices, and connect every vertex in the cycle to every vertex in the complete graph. The cycle is still induced. The graph has [math]n=2k[/math] vertices and [math]m > k^2[/math] edges. If we measure density, as usual, as [math]\frac{2m}{n(n-1)}[/math], then this graph has density [math]1/2[/math] and an induced cycle of length [math]n/2[/math]. We can still wonder what happens in the regime of super-dense graphs with density exceeding [math]1/2[/math], or try to prove precise upper bounds on the constant of proportionality between the induced cycle and the number of vertices, but we're getting fairly hard-core now. It seems to me that the simple intuition of high density excluding essentially long induced cycles is actually false.
