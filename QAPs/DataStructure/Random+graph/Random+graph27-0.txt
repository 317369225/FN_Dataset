Why the current obsession with big data?
The accuracy & nature of answers you get on large data sets can be completely different from what you see on small samples.  Big data provides a competitive advantage.  For the web data sets you describe, it turns out that having 10x the amount of data allows you to automatically discover patterns that would be impossible with smaller samples (think Signal to Noise).  The deeper into demographic slices you want to dive, the more data you will need to get the same accuracy. Watch this Peter Norvig talk on "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data" to get a sense of why it is often better to combine many simple algorithms on large datasets, or combine many large data sets together that provide orthogonal information: Take note of recent innovations in artificial intelligence like IBM Watson and Google's self driving cars.  These advancements were made possible by leveraging large diverse data sets and computational horsepower. I think the main reasons for the obsession with Big Data are the following : Information Asymmetry: Storage gets cheaper every day, and if you have more data you can make better decisions than competitors. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts - many data sets combined tell you more than they do separately Game changing advancements in machine learning are coming from leveraging Big Data Updated 214w ago • View Upvotes
