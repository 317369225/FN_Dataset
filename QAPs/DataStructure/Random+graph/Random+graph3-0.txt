Research problems in complex networks and/or random graphs?
I am not an expert in this field, but I can answer this based on my experience. There are two research problems in complex networks that I know of: community detection [1] and link prediction [2]. I think there are more research in community detection so it will be easier to find literatures on that topic. Hope this helps. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co...
