What are some Python modules I should know for competitive programming?
This is specific to Codechef where I used to run into TLE(Time Limit Exceed). Use this: import psycopsyco.full() The following excerpt about the psyco module will tell you what it does Think of Psyco as a kind of just-in-time (JIT) compiler, a little bit  like what exists for other languages, that emit machine code on the fly  instead of interpreting your Python program step by step. The  difference with the traditional approach to JIT compilers is that Psyco  writes several version of the same blocks (a block is a bit of a  function), which are optimized by being specialized to some kinds of  variables (a "kind" can mean a type, but it is more general). The result  is that your unmodified Python programs run faster. Benefits 2x to 100x speed-ups, typically 4x, with an unmodified Python  interpreter and unmodified source code, just a dynamically loadable C  extension module. Some known bugs associated with Psyco: A.1 Known bugs By the way the Psyco module is dead and no longer maintained. You can switch to Pypy for faster Python JIT compilation. The other answers cover almost all the other points. I stress on Use xrange instead of range It speeds up code abundantly. Also use Double-checked locking for multithreaded operations(might not be a very frequent case for Competitive Programming). And finally you should be aware when to use Closures and how their use affects speed.
