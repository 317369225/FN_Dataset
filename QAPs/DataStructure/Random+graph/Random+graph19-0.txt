What are the most important fields of math to learn if I want to do research in graph algorithms?
Combinatorics (many results in graph theory involve counting or counting arguments) Linear algebra (to understand spectral properties of graphs and uses of graph algorithms in numerical linear algebra) Abstract algebra, and specifically groups (because graph symmetries form groups and that is important when studying graph isomorphisms and canonical labelings) Probability (to study random graphs and randomized algorithms) Calculus (for the solution of recursions, to deal with generating functions in combinatorics, to handle probabilistic calculations, etc). If you focus on some particular topics in graph algorithms, you may be able to skip abstract algebra and much of combinatorics. The list does not include Discrete Mathematics, which is a fairly basic course that covers some Logic, proof techniques, combinatorics, and basic notions from Graph Theory.
