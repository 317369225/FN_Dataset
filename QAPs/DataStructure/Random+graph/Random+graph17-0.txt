What was Alon Amit's PhD thesis?
Thanks for the interest. My thesis was a collection of papers about random lifts of graphs. This is a simple construction of graph coverings or "lifts" of a given base graph which achieves properties of random graphs while retaining some of the features of the base graph. My advisor, Nati Linial, continued pursuing this line of research with other students and collaborators after I moved on.
