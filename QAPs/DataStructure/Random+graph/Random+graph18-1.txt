What's the coolest mathematical object?
There are lots of cool math objects, but I have an irrational love of (non-principal) Ultrafilters  .   They are a simple, yet beautiful and [initially] counterintuitive application of the axiom of choice,  and are poster-children for non-constructive arguments.   They provide [one] bridge from reasoning about [arbitrarily large] finite sets to infinite ones. They show up in many diverse fields, most notably in logic/model theory, non-standard analysis and topology -- I've even seen someone attempt to use them in mathematical psychology --  and every time I see them, I smile. Briefly: a filter is a collection of non-empty sets closed under finite intersection and taking supersets[for example, one filter on the integers is the collection of all sets that are co-finite [that is, all sets that contain every integer except finitely many]. A filter sort of captures the notion that a set is "big enough" for some purpose [in contexts where the intersection of two "big enough" sets will also be "big enough"] An ultrafilter is a maximal filter -- one that you can't add any additional sets to without breaking the "closed under finite intersection" restriction. There's a simple lemma: If [math]\cal F[/math]  is a filter (lets say on the integers, though the argument would work with any starting set), and [math]X[/math] is a subset of the integers not contained in [math]\cal F[/math], then either there is a larger filter  [math]\cal G \supset \cal F [/math] that contains [math]X[/math] or a larger filter [math]\cal G \supset \cal F[/math] that contains [math]\widetilde{X}[/math]  (the complement of [math]X[/math]) (proof outline: you'd like to add [math]X[/math] and all intersection of [math]X[/math] with elements of [math]\cal F[/math] and all supersets of those -- the only thing that can go wrong is if some such intersection is empty, but if so, then it must be possible to add [math]\widetilde{X}[/math]  and all intersections of it with elements of [math]\cal F[/math], and all supersets of those,  since if one of those intersections was also empty, we'd be able to find two disjoint elements of  [math]\cal F[/math] itself. ) From this one can see that if a filter is maximal (i.e. an ultrafilter), then for  every set [math]X[/math], either [math]X[/math] or its complement must be in the filter.  The axiom of choice guarantees that any filter can be extended in this way to an ultrafilter.  Think about what this might look like for a starting filter like the previously mentioned one of all co-finite subsets of the integers: If you partition the integers into any finite collection of disjoint sets, exactly one of these sets is in the ultrafilter. and  if one set is in this ultrafilter, any set that differs from it by at most finitely many integers must also be in it -- (if not, its complement must be in the ultrafilter, but the intersection of this complement with the first set would be finite) What's startling is that this now extends to ALL infinite subsets of the integers, not just the co-finite ones. Every funky infinite set is either in our ultrafilter or its complement is. Either the even integers are in our ultrafilter or the odd ones are, either the perfect squares are in our ultrafilter or the non-perfect squares are, etc. If we say that  all the sets of integers in the ultrafilter have measure 1, all the sets of integers NOT in the ultrafilter have measure 0. This is not a countably additive measure -- since every set of just one integer has measure 0, but the union of all of them has measure 1 -- but it is finitely additive, and it gives a way to define "very big" sets as those of measure 1 that is preserved appropriately  over finite unions and intersections -- which is enough for many interesting and powerful applications -- and for which every set is either very big or very small ("co-very big") Updated 5w ago • View Upvotes
