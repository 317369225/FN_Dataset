Number Sequence: What is the next number in the sequence: 1,3,7,13,21,31,43? The function f(n) = ... .
f(1) = 1 and  f(n) = f(n) + 2(n -1 ) Check:   f(2) = 1 + 2 = 3,   f(3) = (1+2)  + 4 = 7, etc. Therefore, f(n) = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2 (n-1) = 1 + 2 (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n-1) = 2 (n-1)(n)/2 = 1 + (n-1)n. Check:  f(6) = 31, f(7) = 43, and f(8) = 57, also the number of products made by Heinz.
