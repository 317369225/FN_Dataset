What is the best sequence of quadcopters to build for a beginner hobbyist?
Well, if you are learning to build (as opposed to just learning to pilot), then I would go an inexpensive route. In the website Instructables, an electrical engineer walks beginners step-by-step through building their own quad, for about $300. http://www.instructables.com/id/... I would start there. (In fact, I did start there: http://flymycamera.blogspot.com/. I just haven't finished.) After that, strip your cheap quad and move up to a hex/octo with carbon fiber arms and more battery power. Eventually you'll be up to programming your own flight controller and sending a Canon 5D into the sky for cinema-like images.
