What is the next number in this sequence: 11,11,12,13,21,21,?
The simplest solution I could think of is to look at them like this: 11,11,12,13 21,21,22,23 31,31,32,33 ---------------- after here it depends on what base you assume this sequence is from. At least that's my opinion. 41,41,42,43 51,51,52,53 But I guess we will need a smarter approach than mine to tackle this problem.
