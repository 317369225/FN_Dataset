What are the best Bollywood dance sequences?
Dance and Bollywood these two words can be followed by one and only one name-"Madhuri Dixit"!! The queen of Bollywood dancing. Some of her best moves are Zora-Zori Chaneh ke Khet mein http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2... Ankhiyan milaun kabhi Ankhiyan Chuarun Dola re dola re http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4... Humko aaj kal hai http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D... Ek do teen char paanch http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i... Yarana- mera piya ghar aaya o raam ji Badi mushkil badi mushkil-Lajja Aaja nachle title track http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b... Choli ke peeche kya hai, Maar Dala, Dil to pagal hai-dance of envy....and the list goes on forever... Other than Madhuri..we definitely have Malaika Arora khan for Chaiyan chaiyaan http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5... and although I am not a big fan of Aishwarya Rai's dance but her performance in "Kajrare kajrare" needs a mention http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p... Â And this one-only for the effort it would have taken Farha Khan to get this done by Katrina http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z...
