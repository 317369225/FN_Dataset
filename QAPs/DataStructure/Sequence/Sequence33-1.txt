Does Pi contain my DNA sequence?
Valid answers: No Not Likely, and If Yes, You Are Not Special and It Doesn't Mean Anything. No: [math]\pi[/math] does not contain your DNA sequence because one is a single number and your DNA sequence is a long string of base pairs. So, perhaps what you meant to ask is whether, if you convert your DNA sequence to a string of digits and you look at the decimal approximation to [math]\pi[/math], will you find that string of digits somewhere in the decimal approximation to [math]\pi[/math] if you take [math]\pi[/math] out to enough decimal places. The answer to that is "Not likely." Another answer says that because the decimal approximation to [math]\pi[/math] is a non-repeating decimal, your string of digits is on there somewhere. Just because one sequence of digits is infinitely long does not mean that some other string of digits must be present. I can easily describe an infinitely long decimal sequence that does not have "222"anywhere in it. So, you can't say that it is in there. Now, if you posit that there is some truly random sequence of digits that can extend indefinitely, then there is a nonzero chance that some finite sequence is present in some subset of the indefinite sequence, but then so is every other sequence of that length.Â  So, if you do find it in there, just know that you are not all that special.
