Is it possible for a human to generate a truly random sequence mentally?
No. Its is a well known statistical fact that anything that so much as touches a human hand can no longer be considered truly random.  This is why Vegas makes you bounce the dice off the backboard in craps, it reintroduces sufficient randomness into the roll. We are pattern matching machines.  Everything we do is about finding and extracting patterns.  There are plenty of AI programs around that can learn to predict a human choosing supposedly random numbers a surprisingly large amount of the time. People are also quite strongly influenced by their environment.  Magicians have known for a long time that we can increase the odds of a number being selected by introducing that number into someones cognition in a subtle way just before the selection.  We call that "cueing"
