Is it possible for a human to generate a truly random sequence mentally?
No. You would not stand a chance. Tell the aliens to take you now! Cognitive processes have virtually no way of generating truly random events. It would be like trying not to think of something. This is ironic, given all of the unpredictability and imprecision going on in the human brain. But the bottom line is that all behavior generated by the brain is produced by a process that attempts to optimize the outcome using all available information. A process that is wired to find the most beneficial and appropriate action will have a very difficult time producing random actions. Now there is one twist. While behavioral output is almost always meaningful in some way, the actual activity of the components of the brain (neurons, brain waves) is sufficiently unpredictable that it could be used to generate random numbers. If you listen to the sound of a single spiking neuron, it sounds like a geiger counter. Similarly, the amplitude of EEG brain waves above the gamma range looks something like a random walk. Eye movement "tremors" also look like a random walk. So these outputs of the nervous system are sufficiently devoid of predictable output that they could be called random (although there are surely patterns in there somewhere). So if you could record the activity of the nervous system and use that to generate random numbers, perhaps you could fool the aliens. Related Is it possible the brain is completely deterministic?
