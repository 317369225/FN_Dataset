Does Pi contain my DNA sequence?
If you pick any real number at random, it is extremely likely that its decimal expansion will contain your DNA sequence encoded somewhere in it (since "almost all" real numbers are Normal). However, Pi is not a good choice. It has never been proven to be Normal, and so may not contain all possible sequences. It probably does, but no one knows for sure. I don't know who started this rather silly meme about Pi containing everything, but it's really wrong. Most numbers contain all possible sequences in their decimal expansion; Pi might not. Nothing to see here. Move along please.
