What are the best Bollywood dance sequences?
Wow! That's a toughie. But a few that instantly popped from recent films are 'aami je tomar' from Bhool Bhulaiya by Vidya Balan a group dance, 'awaz do apne dil ko' from F.A.L.T.U (sorry couldn't find a better quality video) Then of course there are the epic classics - 'ja re hath natkath' and 'aadha hai chandrama' from Navrang by Sandhya 'and 'jab tak hai jaan' from Sholay by Hema Malini No 'dance' list can be complete without Madhuri Dixit. So here are a few - 'ek do teen' from Tezaab 'hum ko aaj kal hai' from Sailaab and her latest 'majnu laila' from Aaja Nachle Updated 170w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
