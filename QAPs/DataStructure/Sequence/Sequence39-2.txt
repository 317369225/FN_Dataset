Why do many car gears are designed in different order and not in sequence one after the other?
The common design of gears in common cars: But when actually driven, the driver actually just increase or decrease the gear based on desired speed (& other conditions) with just up and down motion. The practice makes it almost impetuous. But, as the question is asked, if gears are in sequential manner, the change of gear would be like this: So the driver has to remember the gear, the location of the lever, the direction to move the gear lever and so on, which is extremely troublesome. So it is much efficient design since no driver needs to look at the position of the gear or the direction (up or down) to move to change the gear. Moreover it's just to and fro motion (up and down) compared to left-right-up-down motion in case of sequential gear. NOTE: 1. I am not an automobile engineer(unfortunately) to give the technical details. 2. My answer is based on the limited driving experience. (I don't have driving licence till now.)
