Is this a good sequence to learn programming languages? What should I add?
Like building a house, you need a good foundation on top of which you could build a strong and stable mansion.  You have to do the same thing to become a good programmer.  You see, once you get the base right, it doesn't matter what language or how many you will learn in the future, it would be more or less the same (unless there is a major innovation in the world of programming). So in light of this, I would go for the following track: - C -> this will give you a very good base to learn the general concept, syntax and grammar of a programming language. - C#/Java/C++/Python/Swift -> Pick one or more from this list, to give you a good base to learn Object Oriented Programming.  C# and C++ will especially teach you to build a desktop software, whilst Java and Swift can teach you to program Mobile App (Android and iOS respectively) - Javascript/HTML/CSS/Ruby on Rails -> this will give you a good base on Web Programming, which is all the rage these days.  Don't forget to check out all those JS frameworks (e.g. MEAN stack). How long will these all take you? All your life! As a software developer it is our nature to keep learning, the world of programming is always in motion, and we need to keep up with them, unfortunately. But don't worry, this is why a good foundation is so important, and also the reason why many people go to University to study Software Engineering.
