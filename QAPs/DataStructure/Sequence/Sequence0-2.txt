What is the next number in this sequence and why?
If you enter the sequence into OEIS you get 6,12,20,30,42 - OEIS, which suggests a series that matches well without the "90" of the other answers (A007622 - OEIS): Consider Leibniz's harmonic triangle (A003506) and look at the non-boundary terms. Sequence gives numbers appearing in denominators, sorted. The answer is 72. Note: It's curious how most of the listed sequences have a 90 in them somewhere, but instead of giving some trivial "it's 90" answer I found it more educational to link OEIS, a very useful site for this kind of question - which still isn't as widely known as it should be.
