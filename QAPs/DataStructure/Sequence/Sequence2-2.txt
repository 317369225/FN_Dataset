What will be next in the sequence 10, 14, 23, ____?
The given series has only three terms which makes it difficult to predict the next term of the series exactly. The terms in the series are:- 10,14, 23 If we look at the difference of the consecutive terms we get :- 14-10=4 23-14=9 So we get two numbers 4, 9. If there had been four terms in the series, we would have got third difference. So that the next term is more appropriate. But here we have only two no. viz, 4 and 9 So the next difference no. could be like :- (i) 4,9,14 Â [adding 5 to consecutive terms] (ii)4,9,16 [Square of 2, 3, 4 and so on.] (iii)4,9,25 [Square of prime no. 2, 3, 5] (iv)4,9,14 [The no. could be written as 2+2=4 3+6=9 4+10=14 Where 2,6,10 are forming arithmetic progression ] So there are large no. of possibilities. Thus the next no. in the series could be (i) 37 (ii)39 (iii)48 And many other.
