How many ways are there of partitioning a sequence of n items into contiguous sub-sequences?
You want to partition into contiguous subsequences.  "Nonoverlapping" is already implied by "partition" in that no element can belong to move than one partition. There is no restriction given on the number of allowed partitions, but I will assume they must be nonempty.  Thus, after each element, we can either continue the existing partition or start a new one. There are [math]n-1[/math] "gaps" in the original sequence.  For each gap, we can make the two choices outlined above.  Each leads to a distinct partitioning.  Thus, the total number of possibilities is [math]2^{n-1}[/math]. But, this is based on the assumption that all elements are distinct.  If this is not the case, then you may create two partitions that look the same.  For example if the original sequence is ABCABC then ABC,AB,C and AB,C,ABC are counted as distinct partitionings but produce the same set of subsequences.  So this answer is really "What is the number of ways to partition a sequence of N distinct elements into contiguous subsequences" or "...a sequence of N elements into contiguous ordered subsequences".
