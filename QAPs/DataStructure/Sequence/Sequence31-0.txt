Do the Fibonacci Sequence, Pi, and the Golden Ratio do anything to prove that the universe was "Intelligently Designed?"
If God had designed π intelligently, he would have made π = 3.  Exactly. Or maybe 22/7.  Intelligent design would not have made it so tough! Was He trying to prove His existence by making π transcendental? In the novel "Contact" by Carl Sagan (but, alas, not in the movie), the aliens had actually designed π.  (Spoiler alert)  They chose its value to contain a design of a wormhole spacecraft that allows travel across the galaxy.  If this story is actually true, maybe that is why π is so complicated.
