What is the difference between a sequence and a Cauchy sequence?
In this context the term sequence means an infinite list of real numbers      [math]a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots,a_n,\ldots[/math]. An example sequence is the sequence of odd numbers       [math]1, 3, 5,\ldots,2n-1,\ldots[/math]. A convergent sequence is one which is approaching a limit [math]L[/math] which means that the distance between [math]a_n[/math] and [math]L[/math] can be made as small as you like if you go far enough out in the sequence. More precisely, for each positive number [math]\epsilon[/math], there is some number [math]N[/math] so that for any index [math]n[/math] greater than or equal to [math]N[/math], [math]|a_n-L|<\epsilon[/math]. The above sequence of odd numbers is not convergent. A sequence is said to be Cauchy if you can make the distance between two elements [math]a_n[/math] and [math]a_m[/math] as small as you like if you go far enough out in the sequence. More precisely, for each positive number [math]\epsilon[/math], there is some number [math]N[/math] so that for any indices [math]n[/math] and [math]m[/math] greater than or equal to [math]N[/math], [math]|a_n-a_m|<\epsilon[/math]. It's easy to show that if a sequence converges, then it's Cauchy. Notice that you don't have to specify a number [math]L[/math] in the definition of a Cauchy sequence. Nonetheless, you can prove that if a sequence is Cauchy, then it converges to some number [math]L[/math].
