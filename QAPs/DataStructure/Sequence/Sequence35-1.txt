What should be the sequence of movies while watching Star Wars?
There are already lots of answers for this question What is the best order to watch the Star Wars series? The order of watching Star Wars â€¢ /r/movies The order which I thought will be good and even turned out to be great is Episode 4,5 - Watching these two movies will really set you on the path of becoming a star wars fan and episode 5 is one of the best in the series which you will like more when you are not spoiled by seeing Episode 1,2,3. Episode 1,2,3 - This will be like an extended flashback of Darth Vader's life and when you watch Episode 6,you will look at him in a different light. Episode 6- Epic finale You can go ahead and skip episode 1 if you want to save some time. PS: Don't go into too much research because you might end up reading a spoiler.
