What is the most interesting thing people learn from having their DNA sequenced?
My adult son has an undiagnosed developmental disability, and I have never been able to let go of the quest to understand the problem. For quite some time the general assumption by doctors has been that the origin of his problem is genetic. ("He has something but we don't know what," is the best I could get from one specialist.) Earlier this year, after an amazingly difficult time in finding someone willing to explore the problem, I learned that he is missing DNA from a gene on chromosome 11. Because there isn't a known population of people with the same deletion, our understanding of what that gene does is somewhat limited. We assumed this was the origin of his problem--until an assay was done on me as well. I am missing the same DNA, and I'm not disabled. And I have two other kids who likewise are fine. I'm told that this is most likely not the explanation we seek. More in-depth testing is still possible, but paying for it is a problem. So at this point the main lesson continually being reinforced for me is that there are no easy answers. What goes on in there?
