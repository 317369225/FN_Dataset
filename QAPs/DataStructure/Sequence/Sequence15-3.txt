Is it possible for a human to generate a truly random sequence mentally?
Brains are very complex objects with all kinds of feedback loops in systems of neurons. This means that brains are likely chaotic systems. Even tiny changes in the activity of a single neuron might eventually result in large changes in the behaviour of the brain owner. I expect this means that even random quantum events happening in neurons are likely to eventually have an impact on human behavior. (I'm not talking about Penrose style quantum computing in the brain. I'm talking about ordinary amplification of small phenomena as displayed by many chaotic systems.) Because I suspect brains can amplify quantum events, I expect humans can generate random number sequences that are just as random as any quantum experiment. I suspect that just making up a sequence of ones and zeros while making a mild effort to avoid patterns is good enough. "But", you say, if humans start generating sequences of ones and zeros we see patterns in them. For example people are well known to avoid sequences of the same digit even though these ought to occur in truly random data. But that doesn't matter. All that means is that the bits in the sequence probably don't have a 50/50 chance of being zero or one. And the bits in the sequence are very likely not going to be independent. But a sequence of bits that don't each have a 0.5 chance of being one, and aren't all independent, is still a random sequence. Or did you intend that the bits be uniformly distributed and independent? You didn't say so.
