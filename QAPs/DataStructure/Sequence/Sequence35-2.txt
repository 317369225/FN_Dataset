What should be the sequence of movies while watching Star Wars?
This is the correct order if you don't want to be spoiled about the 'twist': IV: A New Hope (original trilogy) V: The Empire Strikes Back (original trilogy) I: The Phantom Menace (prequel trilogy) II: Attack of the Clones (prequel trilogy) III: Revenge of the Sith (prequel trilogy) VI: The Return of the Jedi (original trilogy) VII: The Force Awakens (sequel trilogy) If you want to do this solely for the purpose of to be ready to watch 'The force awakens' , I would suggest you watch this video : Also while you are at it, watch the Star trek series too (The new movies).
