Number Sequence: What is the next number in the sequence: 1,3,7,13,21,31,43? The function f(n) = ... .
The given sequence is {[math]1,3,7,13,21,31,43,...[/math]} In detail, the terms can be written like this. [math]1^2-0=1-0=1[/math] [math]2^2-1=4-1=3[/math] [math]3^2-2=9-2=7[/math] [math]4^2-3=16-3=13[/math] [math]5^2-4=25-4=21[/math] [math]6^2-5=36-5=31[/math] [math]7^2-6=49-6=43[/math] [math]8^2-7=64-7=57[/math] Thus [math]57[/math] is the next number in the sequence. Now forming the function It can be easily seen that the function which defines this sequence is [math]\displaystyle{f(n)=n^2-(n-1)}, n=1,2,3,...[/math] Answers is getting collapsed. I didn't want to make the answer for this question dirty adding too many things as it is such an easy sequence to be analysed. After all, I have defined the function which was more than enough. But quora needs some lengthy answers I guess.. Happened this even before too..  Even this length didn't work. So I will add some more mathematical terms A function [math]f:A\rightarrow B[/math] is a relation from the set [math]A[/math] to set [math]B[/math] such that to each element of [math]A[/math], a unique element of [math]B[/math] is related. Otherwise said, its a mapping from [math]A[/math] to [math]B [/math] such that, each [math]a_i[/math] in [math]A[/math] is mapped to exactly one element [math]b_i[/math] in [math]B[/math] and we call it as the image of [math]a_i[/math] under the mapping. More than one element can be mapped to same element. It's necessary that every element of [math]A[/math] should have image, but it's not necessary that every element of [math]B[/math] should have a pre image. If this property is there then the function is said to be [math]onto[/math].
