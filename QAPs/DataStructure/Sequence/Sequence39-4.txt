Why do many car gears are designed in different order and not in sequence one after the other?
To understand the answer, let us understand how transmission works. This is the schematic of the transmission system in a regular automobile. Now, imagine what happens when you move the gear stick in the direction of arrow. The stick moves forward which further pushes the grey stick and engages the pink drives with the blue gears. So when you push the gear stick forward the pink drives engages with gears 1, 3, and 5 (at least as seen from the image above) and when you pull the stick backwards the mechanism engages the pink drives with gears 4, 2, and R. But remember what we do to change the gear from 2 to 3? We move the stick sideways (right), that's because we want to engage only the 3rd gear and not the 1st, 3rd, and 5th altogether. With this mechanism we are sure that when we move the stick to the 3rd gear, the gear is actually in the 3rd. There's no doubt in that. Instead of this arrangement, as you said if the gears are sequentially mannered then there would always be a confusion as others have mentioned in their answers, that in which gear the car actually is. Suppose the configuration is as you had described, sequential, and we are in the 5th gear or in the 1st gear (in case reverse is place before the 1st) and we changed to the reverse accidentally, and BANGGGG!!!! You just placed the moving car in reverse and your transmission is destroyed beyond repair (though the cars we have now wouldn't allow to go into reverse while moving forward, but still). So, to sum it all, It's inconvenient to have the gears arranged sequentially.
