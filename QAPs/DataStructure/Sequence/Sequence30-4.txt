Is this a good sequence to learn programming languages? What should I add?
While that is similar to the order in which I learned languages, it's not how I would recommend doing it. Things were different ~20 years ago. It really depends on what you want to do. If you want to be a very versatile programmer I suggest you do it the hard way. - C - C++ - Whatever you want after that depending on what you want after that. While pure C may not seem like it's used much anymore, it's used enough to still be relevant. The main reason I recommend staring here though is it will force you to learn very important lessons that will help you in ANY language you learn from then on. C++ will help introduce (and more) you to modern object oriented programming. Honestly beyond that point you will likely learn whatever you need when you are going to need it. For example, when I decided to start developing games in Unity I learned C#. I had never used it before but I did the research and concluded that it was a far better choice than UnityScript. It was easy to learn because I already knew the concepts.
