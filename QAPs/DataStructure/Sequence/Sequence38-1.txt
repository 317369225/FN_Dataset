What are some interesting "continue the sequence" questions?
Michael JÃ¸rgensen's answer can be extended further: the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 can be continued in surprisingly many ways! Here are a few (the sequence numbers in brackets are for The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences). 32: Powers of 2. [A000079] 31: Maximum number of regions obtained by joining n points around a circle by straight line. [A000127] 30: Number of positive divisors of n!. [A027423] 36: Number of ways for n people to choose n urinals, assuming each always chooses one of the most distant from those in use. [A095236] 20: Numbers n such that n divides 3^n-1. [A067945] 77: Reverse, Add, Then Sort (RATS) [A004000] 14: Sum of the digits of 11^n. [A066005]
