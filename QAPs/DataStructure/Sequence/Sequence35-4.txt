What should be the sequence of movies while watching Star Wars?
Prequels aren't important. If you aren't a crazy star wars fan you can skip them entirely. Even the sequel series has no relation to them. But if you are crazy about star wars (like I am) , you will enjoy prequels too. Then watch episodes IV, V, VI and then I, II, III . Prequels will act as spoilers for the original trilogy. You can watch episode VII after completing main /main and prequel trilogy
