Do the Fibonacci Sequence, Pi, and the Golden Ratio do anything to prove that the universe was "Intelligently Designed?"
No. Mathematics is technically a human invention based on observations of the universe. It's difficult to determine how much "design" is in as artificial a concept as Pi. Which is not to say that this argument's form cannot be made valid. Just that the specific proposition is not. You can find a much better example of this argument form in The Privileged Planet. The argument goes something like this. Assuming Big Bang cosmology, the circumstances necessary for intelligent life like ourselves to originate on an earth-like planet correlate with the circumstances necessary to discover and observe the universe scientifically. We would not expect to see a blindly created universe feature this correlation. Therefore: design. This approach is still faulted because it is very difficult to make a global argument when you only have one sample. We don't have undesigned and designed universes to compare with our own, so we can't fairly say how we could expect them to differ. Still, this is an interesting argument to say the least, even if it isn't particularly compelling. It may not imply a creator so much as science and philosophy are inseparable and scientific answers may not be as solid as we assume.
