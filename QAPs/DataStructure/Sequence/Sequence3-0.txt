Look at this sequence: 80, 10, 70, 15, 60, ... What number should come next?
20. 80 becomes 10: -70 10 becomes 70: +60 70 becomes 15: -55 15 becomes 60: +45 -70 became -55. So I imagine, -55 becomes -40 (adding 15 like in the previous pattern). So, the last number 60-40=20. Now, I don't know what a backward progressions or an internal series is. Just what seems like plain ol' logic.
