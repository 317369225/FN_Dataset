How many ways are there of partitioning a sequence of n items into contiguous sub-sequences?
The number of ways in which the sequence could be turned into contiguous ordered sub-sequences[math]= {2^{n-1}}[/math], where [math]n[/math] is the number of terms in the array. For our problem, [math]n=6[/math], so, Our answer[math] = 2^{(6-1)} = 2^5 = 32.[/math] This is the required answer. Thanks to Marshall Mayberry & Daniel Goldman, for providing different perspectives. Verification: For [math]n=1[/math], solution[math]=1.\\[/math] For [math]n=2[/math], solution[math]=2.\\[/math] For [math]n=3[/math], solution[math]=4.\\[/math] For [math]n=4[/math], solution[math]=8.\\ [/math] For [math]n=5[/math], solution[math]=16.\\[/math] For [math]n=6[/math], solution[math]=32.\\[/math]
