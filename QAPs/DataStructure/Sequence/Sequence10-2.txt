Why is it that every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence?
Things that get closer to the same thing also get closer to each other. A convergent sequence of numbers is a sequence that's getting closer and closer to a particular number called its limit.  A sequence has the Cauchy property if the numbers in that sequence are getting closer and closer to each other.  The statement above explains why convergent sequences should have the Cauchy property.  See Justin Rising's answer to Why is it that every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence? for the particulars. You also ask if every Cauchy sequence is convergent.  That depends on if the place you're looking for the limit has any missing numbers.  Suppose you're only considering numbers with finite decimal representations, and then look at the sequence      0.3, 0.33, 0.333, 0.3333, 0.33333, 0.333333, 0.3333333, ... It is a Cauchy sequence, but its limit is 1/3, and 1/3 doesn't have a finite decimal representation.  So among the numbers with finite decimal representations, that sequence doesn't have a limit. The real numbers do have limits for all their Cauchy sequences.  The term for that is complete.  The real numbers form a complete metric space.
