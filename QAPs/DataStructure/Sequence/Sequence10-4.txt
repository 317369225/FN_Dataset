Why is it that every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence?
Consider a sequence [math](v_i)_{i \in N}[/math] s.t. its convergent. If its convergent then: [math]\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N > 0 : n \geq N \implies \| v_n - v\| < \epsilon [/math] We want to show that if, the sequence converges, then its also a Cauchy sequence. i.e. we want to show the following property holds for any precision that we desire: [math]\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N > 0 : m, n \geq N \implies \| v_m - v_n \| < \epsilon [/math] Consider two indices in the sequence [math] m,n \geq N > 0[/math]. Then since the sequence converges these two statements are true for some m and n: [math] \| v_n - v\|[/math] and [math] \| v_m - v \|[/math] by triangle inequality we know: [math] \| v_m - v_n \| \leq \| v_m - v\| + \| v - v_n \| < 2 \epsilon = \epsilon' [/math] Therefore, whenever we want precision [math]\epsilon' [/math], we can just find two indices m,n according to setting the "original" epsilon to half of it. i.e. set [math] \epsilon = \frac{\epsilon }{2}[/math]. Since we can definitively find these two indices using the original convergent property for any [math]\epsilon[/math] and [math]\epsilon' [/math], then the sequences is also Cauchy.
