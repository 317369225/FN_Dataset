How does Harvard's Math 231 sequence (Algebraic Topology) compare with MIT's 18.905 sequence (Algebraic Topology)?
somewhat hard to compare imo because (at least at MIT) these 18.9xx-level classes vary greatly in difficulty and subject matter by professor.Â  Took the class with Michael Hopkins who was fabulous, but this was years ago.
