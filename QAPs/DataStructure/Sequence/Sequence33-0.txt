Does Pi contain my DNA sequence?
It isn't known if π is a Normal number or not, although it is expected that it is. If it is, then yes π does contain your DNA sequence (interpreting it in base 4 and using the digits A, C, G, and T). If it is not, it might or might not. Updated 15w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Aravind Pogu
