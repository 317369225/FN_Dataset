What is the most powerful song to accompany a suicide sequence in a film?
The Sound of Music This song is sung by Julie Andrews which is probably not what you're looking for, but if you could get someone to sing it, the words are perfect. The hills are alive with the sound of music With songs they have sung for a thousand years The hills fill my heart with the sound of music My heart wants to sing every song it hears My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds that rise from the lake to the trees My heart wants to sigh like the chime that flies from a church on a breeze To laugh like a brook as it trips and falls over stones on its way To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to prey I go to the hills when my heart is lonely I know I will hear what I've heard before My heart will be blessed with the sound of music And I'll sing once more.
