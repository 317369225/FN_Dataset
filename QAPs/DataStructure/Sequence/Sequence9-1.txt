How can the sequence "3, 7, 15, 31, 63, etc." be continued?
Thanks for the A2A opportunity. On first glance, if n is a number in the sequence then the next number in the sequence is 2n+1 and the previous number would be (n-1)/2, so the sequence is (n-1)/2 , n , 2n+1 {for any whole number n}. For the proof, one would need to ask a Mathematician, which I unfortunately am not :-) But let's give it a try :- If x is an element in the sequence and each subsequent element is given by 2x+1 then for :-    n=1 we have x, n=2 we have 2x+1, n=3 we have 2(2x+1)+1 = 4x +3, n=4 we have 2(2(2x+1)+1)+1 = 8x + 7 n=5 we have 2(2(2(2x+1)+1)+1)+1 = 16x+15 n=N we have {2^(N-1)) . x  + 2^(N-1)} - 1     Note: ------- We add 1 to the right hand most operand so that we can factorize by separating out 2^(N-1) but at the same time must also minus 1 to compensate.   For the n th element in the sequence, starting with x as the first and where n = N, we would thus have  :-                              A Plot of the function f(N)  for   -3 < N < 6 and x = 7 (datum)    Conclusion:    Works for all integers, positive and negative though the function is asymptotic for decreasing negative integers.    " x" can be any element within the series and negative values of N represent positions to the left of element x in the series while positive values of N represent positions to the right of element x.   For the plotted example  N = 1 when x = 7       ...
