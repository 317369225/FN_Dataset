What is the next number in this sequence and why?
As many people have stated, there is no acceptable answer.  There is a variation of this question called the Watson Test (Confirmation Bias) which isn't testing your mathematical skills, but actually testing psychology. People in general tends to look for confirmation that they are right, whether than test if they could be wrong. For example, if asked this question and allowed people to 'test' their results by giving them a 'yes/no' reply - most people would 'solve' the problem and input their solutions, for example '90'.  But if the underlying rule is actually (n-1)' < n' < (n+1') then 90 would generate a 'yes', but so would 43, or 2000. The lesson here is that you have to test your assumption by trying to disprove them, not by proving them.
