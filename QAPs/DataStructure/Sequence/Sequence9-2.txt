How can the sequence "3, 7, 15, 31, 63, etc." be continued?
Any finite sequence can always be extended in a completely arbitrary way. Two such arbitrary ways are: Any sequence of [math]n[/math] terms can be modelled by a polynomial of degree [math]n-1[/math]. This polynomial can then be used to directly find any term in the sequence. My favourite extension to any finite sequence is the answer to the great question of Life, The Universe, and Everything: the next term is [math]42[/math]. What people are usually looking for, however, is some form of simplest extension, but they rarely explicitly say so. Nor do they give any definition of simplest. Nevertheless in this case there is a rather simple exponential expression that gives the stated sequence:      [math]2^{n+1}-1[/math] for [math]n=1,2,3,\dotsc[/math] The next value for [math]n=6[/math] is, as others have said, [math]2^7-1=127[/math].
