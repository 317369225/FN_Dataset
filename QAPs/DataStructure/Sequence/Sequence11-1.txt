Is there an order/sequence for wearing makeup?
Haha yes, I believe people have complicated it a lot more than it should be. However, you can follow something simpler: 1- Primer (can be skipped) 2- Foundation (for a more natural look, mix a bit of moisturizer with it unless you have really oily skin) 3- Concealer on just under eye circles and/or any imperfections ( also, some people use concealer before foundation, you should experiment to see which gives you a better even finish) 4- Contour and highlight 5- When you're done with these move on to the most PROMINENT part of your makeup: i.e: if you plan on wearing really bright lipstick (red/plum/shocking pink etc) apply the lipstick first, then do the eyes/blush etc accordingly. If you plan on having heavy eye makeup do the eyes first, then lips and blush. Obviously, both eyes and lips bright together is a big no-no. 6- When it comes to lips, you can just wear lipstick/gloss and be ready to go! But if you're one to go into details and use more products on your lips then:  lip pencil -> lipstick ->gloss 7- For eyes again, for daily wear you don't have to bother with all these products just eyeliner and then mascara will do. But if you want the whole shebang :  base/neutral shade all over the eye -> highlighter under the eyebrow -> eyebrow pencil -> eye shadow -> eyeliner -> mascara. 8 Lastly- face (translucent) powder to set the whole face but this can be totally skipped.
