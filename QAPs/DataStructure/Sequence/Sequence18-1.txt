The sequency of the number is 17. If the second number is 3. What is the first number?
There's two schools of thought. One would call 17 the zeroth term and 3 the first. Another would call 17 the first and 3 the second. While it may seem silly to start indexing at zero, consider the following sequence: 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, ... If we index starting at 0, we get [math]a_{n} = a_{n-1} + 3[/math] and [math]a_{0}=5[/math]. We can also use [math]a_{n} = 5 + 3n[/math] In this case, n is the number of times we've added 3. If we index starting at 1, it's a bit more awkward. We instead getÂ  [math]a_{n} = 5 + 3(n-1)[/math] and n is one more than the number of times we've added three. Not horrible, but not as intuitive as the other. Zero-based numbering
