Do the Fibonacci Sequence, Pi, and the Golden Ratio do anything to prove that the universe was "Intelligently Designed?"
It doesn't prove anything, at least not by the standards of scientific proof. However, mathematical and physical constants, and their relationships, have intrigued many scientists and philosophers over the centuries.  From Pythagoras and Kepler (both searching for the "music of the spheres") to Eddington and his cosmological number, many have been seduced. This is a very human response.  We are essentially pattern matchers.  We have evolved to think and process information and notice patterns.  From the ancients who saw their gods and heroes in the random positions of stars, to the child today who sees an elephant in the clouds, we see patterns even when they don't exist.  Since scientists are not immune from the allure of patterns you can certainly find examples of scientists proposing significance, and then having it be rejected by his peers.  But this is not a coverup or a conspiracy.  In fact most conspiracy theories are just another form of this pattern matching tendency, taking scraps of random information and trying to match it into an alluring pattern.
