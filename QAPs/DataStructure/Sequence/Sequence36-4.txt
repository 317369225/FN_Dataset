What are the missing term number sequence 1,2,4,8,__, __?
There are different rules that could generate that sequence. According to me, there is not a universal answer. For example, your sequence could be generated by the power-of-2 rule: [math]a_i =[/math][math]2^i, i \in N_0[/math] hence next term is 16 ...or from the rule like "eachÂ  number is greater than the previous" [math]a_i = x_i[/math]such that[math] x_i > a_{i-1}[/math] hence next term could be 9 or 123, or any greater number than 8. (Also not natural number, why not!?) ...or also from the rule "each number is greater than the sum of all the previous numbers" [math]a_i = x_i [/math]such that [math]x_i > \sum_{i=0}^{i-1}a_{i}[/math] therefore next term could be 20.
