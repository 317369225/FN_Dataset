What are some interesting "continue the sequence" questions?
Here's an interesting couple of thoughts about continuing a sequence. Tell me, what comes next in the sequence: [math]1, 3, 5, 7, ...[/math] You may say "Oh, that's simply [math]a_n = 2n - 1[/math], and next comes [math]9[/math]!" What if I said that the next term is actually [math]\pi[/math]? And that I had an explicit formula for it? Check this out. First, take the formula that generates the first couple terms: [math]2n - 1[/math] Then, add what you want the next term to be, minus what it would be (so upon getting there the initial sequence doesn't interfere), with [math](n-1)(n-2)...[/math] multiplied to it so it doesn't appear in the first several terms, but divided by a factorial so that when your term is set to come about, it doesn't get multiplied by those terms (I hope I said that all okay, it sounds horrible to me): [math]2n-1+\frac{(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)(\pi - 9)}{4!}[/math] There we go! This formula gives us the sequence [math]1, 3, 5, 7, \pi[/math]. A completely mathematically true sequence! The idea is that what you want the term to be is disguised by repeatedly multiplying it by zero until it We can generalize this for any series like this: Given a series [math]a_n[/math] that you want to set to [math]c[/math] at the [math]m[/math]th term, create a new series: [math]b_n=[/math] [math]a_n+\frac{(n-1)(n-2)...(n-(m-1))(c-a_m)}{(m-1)!}[/math] Whew, that was a doozy to write for a LaTeX first-timer! With that, any random series of reals can be defined by an explicit sequence - just repeat the process for any new random term. That's right, just call [math]b_n[/math] the new [math]a_n[/math] and you can repeat this process for as many times as you want! It'll be a pretty giant formula, though. So from now on, if someone ever says you are wrong on a "next term" problem, just show them this.
