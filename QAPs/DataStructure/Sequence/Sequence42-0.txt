What do the lyrics in the opening sequence of "The Lion King" mean?
I'm guessing you're referring to the African chant at the beginning of the song as the sun's coming up, which most people would say goes a bit like this: ​ It's actually in Zulu, as is used in much of the background music. For the opening sequence specifically, this is what's being said: Nants ingonyama bagithi baba [Here comes a lion, Father] Sithi uhm ingonyama [Oh yes, it's a lion] Nants ingonyama bagithi baba [Here comes a lion, Father] Sithi uhm ingonyama [Oh yes, it's a lion] Ingonyama [It's a lion] Siyo Nqoba [We're going to conquer] Ingonyama Ingonyama nengw' enamabala [A lion and a leopard come to this open place] (repeats) [Cue English lyrics] ----- Sources: http://lionking.org/lyrics/OMPS/... http://learnswahili.net/lion-kin...
