What is sequence alignment?
Within the context of genomics / bioinformatics: "sequence alignment" is the process of matching "reads" (25 - 500 base-pair nucelotide chains) to their corresponding position along the entire length of the DNA chain. As you can imagine with a human genome coming in around 3 billion base pairs, thats ~60 million individual "reads"... each read having a fair amount of ambiguity as to where it might belong... Care is taken to over-sample each genome, often you will see something like "30x coverage of an Ecoli genome". This redundancy allows for higher integrity in the data once reassembled. A typical timeline follows: 1. sample dna extracted 2. sample dna strands hacked apart into smaller pieces ( "short reads" ) 3. short reads are digitized one base-pair at a time in a sequencer 4. the gross reads will be stored in a file format such as FASTQ or FASTA 5. large scale computing power comes into play to run either a dinovo ( a brand new alignment ) or a matched alignment ( if we're talking HUMANS... HG18 or HG19 will be used as a template )
