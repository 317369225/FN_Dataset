What is the next number in this sequence and why?
It's 2610. Because obviously the sequence follows the rule [math]y = n^5 - 20n^4 + 155n^3 -579n^2 + 1045n -720[/math] Which for n=2 → y=6 n=3 → y=12 n=4 → y=20 n=5 → y=30 n=6 → y=42 n=9 → y=2610 As usual in this kind of questions, there are infinite polimials that can go through the points being shown on the question, and therefore there are infinite answers that can be made depending on what you use to build the polinomial, and none of them would be "wrong". Obs: The "correct" answer to the puzzle has already been given by several people, and I agree with it. It's probably the most simple answer and the one intended by whoever made the puzzle. Nonetheless I'm just pointing a curious mathematical fact. Updated 27w ago • View Upvotes
