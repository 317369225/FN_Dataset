Why does the Fibonacci sequence repeat in nature?
I think this is due to two main factors. 1- The Fibonacci series has a name. Let me explain. My advisor at MIT ( Patrick Winston) likes to call this rule the Rumpelstiltskin principle (Based on a german folk story that once you know the name of something, you gain power over it). When humans, name a concept, that concept will acquire a symbolic pointer, and hence becomes accessible to everyone. With Fibonacci series, it is simple enough to be taught worldwide in middle schools, and many know the concept. Once they do, they become sensitized to it (Sensitization). Simply put, if you wear a striped pink sock to work tomorrow, you will more readily spot fellow striped-pink-sock wearers. We know fibonacci, many of us, so we are likely to spot it. We see thousands of other functions everyday, we just don't know them as well. 2- The construction of the series itself, is simple and 'naturally accessible'. Each new piece is created by addition of two already existing pieces. Imagine each two cells in a living organism, that would make their neighbor as large as themselves(and merge). The creation of that new cell is the addition of it's makers. This is of course hypothetical, but the sunflower seed rows are not. Namely, it is an 'easy' automaton to be implemented by nature. It needs very little memory, and requires just two pieces to start.
