What should be the sequence of movies while watching Star Wars?
The correct order to watch Star Wars is a question for which there seems to be no correct answer. Though the chronological order is Episodes I -> II -> III -> IV -> V -> VI, I had always thought it is better to watch in the order based on the year of release, which is IV -> V -> VI -> I -> II -> III. I have not counter Episode VII in this because, of course you should see it after all the others. The main reason for my opinion is that the original trilogy is very old. Once you are familiar with the CGI of the new trilogy, the old one might seem a bit too old (You have to consider that the first movie came out in 1977). But recently, I was having a debate with a friend about the same order and we actually ended up with a rather unique order. First watch Episodes IV and V, from the original series. Then move to Episodes I, II and III, before watching Episode VI. This way you don't spoil the suspense at the end. After watching episode VI, the whole of episode I, II and III becomes very predictable, as you already know how its all going to end. So you see the original trilogy just enough to make sense of the new trilogy. And then finish it with episode VI. And finally watch Episode VII, and all is right with the world. Looking forward to know your thoughts on this new order.
