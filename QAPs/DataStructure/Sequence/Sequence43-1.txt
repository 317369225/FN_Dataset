What are the best visualizations of sequence alignments?
If the sequences are not too much long, I think the clustalx may be a good choice for you Clustal X is a windows interface for the ClustalW multiple sequence alignment program. It provides an integrated environment for performing multiple sequence and profile alignments and analysing the results. The sequence alignment is displayed in a window on the screen.

The pull-down menus at the top of the window allow you to select all the options required for traditional multiple sequence and profile alignment.
