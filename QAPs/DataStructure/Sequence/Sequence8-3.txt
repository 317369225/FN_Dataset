Number Sequence:Â What is the next number in the sequence: 1,3,7,13,21,31,43? The function f(n) = ... .
As the others have stated, the answer is [math]57[/math]. The other answerers have constructed some very clever methods. Mine was a bit simpler. Since you are increasing by rates of 2 (2,4,6,8,10...), you can simply say: [math]a_{n} = a_{n-1} + (2 \cdot [n-1])[/math] Applying this algorithm, you get [math]a_{8} = a_{8-1} + (2 \cdot [8-1])[/math] [math]a_{8} = a_{7} + (2 \cdot 7)[/math] [math]a_{8} = 43 + (2 \cdot 7)[/math] [math]a_{8} = 43 + 14[/math] [math]a_{8} = 57[/math]
