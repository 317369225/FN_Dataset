How can the sequence "3, 7, 15, 31, 63, etc." be continued?
Asked to Answer. Edit: Some comments have shown that I have greatly overestimated the sense of humor of many Quorans. Yes, this answer does contain (much) sarcasm. This sequence is astoundingly intricate; in fact, solving this sequence is one of humanity's most undaunted challenges (save for defeating aging, increasing humanity's intelligence, and space exploration). Let's try a few approaches to attempt to determine the sequence's pattern: Attempt One: Arithmetic Sequence. 7-4=3 15-7=(17-2)-7=(17-7)-2=10-2=18-8-2= Since 7-4 is different from 15-7, this attempt fails, and the sequence is not arithmetic. After a cup of water, let's make a second attempt. Attempt Two: Geometric Sequence. If 7/3=15/7, then 7^2=15*3, thus 7^2=11*3+4*3, thus 7^2=(7+4)(7-4)+4*3=7^2-4^2+3*4, so 4^2=3*4. Dividing by 4, 3=4 which is false. Thus, the sequence is not geometric. After this second failure, I am prompted to fetch a greater glass of water than the first time. The dread of failure begins to sink in. I then decide not to give up, and writhe in pain as I conjure in my mind an idea for a third attempt. Attempt Three: Fibonacci sequence. Let's see if 3+7=15. Mercilessly, no. I try again to check that I am not undergoing hallucinations: 3+7=7+3=10. Let's check for a third time and average the two expressions: 3+7=((3+7)+(7+3))/2=(10+10)/2=20/2. I find myself in a slight hope that 20/2 is still equal to 15. To find out 20/2, start plugging in numbers to find a number h such as 2h=20. h=0 ---> 2h=0 h=1 ---> 2h=2 h=2 ---> 2h=4 h=3 ---> 2h=6 h=4 ---> 2h=8 h=5 ---> 2h=10 h=6 ---> 2h=12 h=7 ---> 2h=14 h=8 ---> 2h=16 h=9---> 2h=18 h=10 ---> 2h=20 As I breathe a sigh of relief that I won't have to try additional numbers, I notice that I could simply have plugged 15 into h to check whether 20/2=15. I notice that I have undergone a tremendous waste of effort. I then ingest 50 ml of vodka, to disinhibit myself from the task. I have been tackling this problem for now 45 minutes. I come back once again, confident that I will solve this enigma once and for all, and be applauded as much as Turing was for cracking the eponymous code. Attempt Four: Sleep I suddenly become dazed by the level of difficulty of the problem. I go to sleep out of spite, hoping that some sylphid or naiad will appear in my dreams and inspire me the correct answer. Attempt Five: Dream Recollection I wake up, having slept 36 consecutive hours due to the cognitive strain of the sequence. I am however, to my great dismay, unable to recover the slightest memory of my dreams. I realize that I am flesh and blood and failure. Attempt Six: Blind Guess In a fit of rage, I blindly choose 42 for the next number. I then agonize mentally as I painstakingly notice that the sequence is increasing and that the next number is probably higher than 63. But hey, maybe 42 is still higher than 63. After all, their quotient is 3/2, which is a pretty round number. I then notice that 3>2, so that either 63>42 or 42>63, as I can't remember which one of the numbers 63 or 42 was associated to 3 and which one was associated to 2. I repeat the above step, this time paying attention to keeping track on my simplifications. My working short-term memory hurts. Attempt Seven: Shifting. I tap into my deep knowledge of endomorphisms, hoping that linear algebra will grant me an advantage against this problem. I try to create new sequences out of this one. I begin by trying to use Shift, which translates the indices of terms. The new sequence is 7,15,31,63. I notice that I have even less information than before. I abort this attempt. Attempt Eight: Averaging. I replace the nth term of the sequence by the average of the first n terms. I obtain 3,5,25/3, then become desperate due to the fraction and instantly enter a depression. Attempt Nine: Call a friend. I call one of my friends at home and tell him that I am depressed. He asks me why. After several minutes where I summarize all of my attempts, he laughs at me and refuses to believe that I cannot solve this problem alone. I feel offended by his lack of help and treason. I reconsider whether or not to keep this friend. I then procrastinate asking myself what to do with the friend, happily noticing that I will not procrastinate on the problem any more since the friend has become the main problem and the sequence the lesser, more joyful task. Attempt Ten: Parity In a dazzling flash of insight, I notice that all numbers of the sequence must be odd. I conclude that the next number will also be odd. Sitting back, I realize that this insight was not so reliable after all, since either the 5 first numbers are in the set {3,7,15,31,63} and the next one likely isn't, or the first 5 numbers are strictly increasing and the next one isn't. The elation wears off. I listen to Coldplay's "I used to rule the world" from "Viva La Vida" as I shrink from this powerful vision to knowing nothing about the sequence. Attempt Eleven: Differences. I compute the sequence one obtains after subtracting each term from the previous one. I find 4,8,and after a few computations, 16. I am far too tired to calculate the last difference 63-31 however, and require the help of a machine as I am unwilling to indulge in such Taylor-like chain labor. I light up my old and very slow Gateway computer from the 1990's. After starting it, I notice that it refuses to load the desktop and rather shows an hourglass cursor. I spend the next day rebooting the computer a total of 76 times, using 8 hours of my time. On the 76th reboot, I notice the desktop slowly appearing. I notice that just before that, I was thinking about lettuces. I thus consider lettuces responsible for this change of fate, and decide to create a sect worshipping lettuces just after I finish the problem. I open the calculator program and enter 63-31, hoping every second that power will not go out and that the computer will not freeze, as I consider myself so lucky to have finally loaded this program. I obtain the result and.. hurray ! 32 ! To make up for my poor memory, I write on a sheet of paper the new sequence: 4,8,16,32. I realize after a few minutes of thought that this sequence is geometric, and that the next term is 64. I thus conclude that 64 is the correct answer. I slowly realize, however, that 64 is even. Not odd. Not good. So now what ? Attempt Twelve: Integration. After falling back to a state of utter disbelief, I slowly realize that I had forgotten to add the previous term. I once again use the computer calculator and find 127. Huzzah ! At long last ! I am dumbfounded, however, as the friend comes back explaining to me that one can go from a term to the next by simply multiplying the current term by 2 and adding 1. Attempt Thirteen: My life with this sequence: Travelling to Infinity. After dancing the entire day in my room, I am caught by the realization that I was asked to complete the sequence, not merely calculate the next term. Without additional information, I have no indication how many terms are required. I devote the remainder of my life to calculating as many terms as possible before I die. I frantically wake up every morning to compute additional terms, and turn my imagination as far away as possible from the idea of looking towards the future. I have become imprisoned. In retrospect, I realize that Jane Wilde's life was much easier than I thought. This has now become the 666,666,666th second of my ordeal. Every second of my life is endless suffering. I have almost become a burning corpse in a melting coffin. Updated 20w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
