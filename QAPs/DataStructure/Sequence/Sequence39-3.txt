Why do many car gears are designed in different order and not in sequence one after the other?
A2A I have read all the answers posted on the subject here I thank Sudarson Nantha for his beautiful explanation. Car gears are complex and needs multiple systems, gears, shafts, dog clutches, selector mechanism etc also in a compact shape and size. This makes it difficult for manufacturers to assign a different shaft to every gear. A single shaft can contain multiple gears and this makes the transmission system more compact and easy to assemble in the chassis with other components keeping the size of vehicle to the minimum. Most of the answers here have explained how a manual transmission system works and if you watch the video, it is clear that for selecting a dog clutch the gear stick can move in left or right direction and on selecting a particular dog clutch the stick can move forward or backward for selection of the gear. An automatic transmission system can change the gear ratio automatically and doesnot require a dog clutch for selection of gears, hence an automatic gear transmission system have a linear selecting mechanism for parking, reverse, neutral and drive. Hope this would have been helpful and if you have further queries please feel free to ask in comments. Peace.
