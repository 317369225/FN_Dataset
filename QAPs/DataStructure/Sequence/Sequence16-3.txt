What is the most interesting thing people learn from having their DNA sequenced?
I found the heredity and ancestry components most interesting.  It confirmed that I was part Jewish, but it was dominantly coming from my mother's side, which was a surprise.  My maternal grandmother was 1/4 Jewish and we never knew.  Another very cool aspect was that my parents also did it and my father had a mtDNA haplogroup A8 -- very rare for a Western/Central European.  It probably indicates that his maternal line descends from Tatars.  We know very little about his maternal side, so that is very cool. Additionally, since my daughter did it, we found out that she was 28% my mother and 22% my father -- just like she looks! I also found some second cousins that I didn't know existed.  My father had lost track of quite a few groups of cousins (he never met some of them) and they have since had children.
