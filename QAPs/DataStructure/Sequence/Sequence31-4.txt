Do the Fibonacci Sequence, Pi, and the Golden Ratio do anything to prove that the universe was "Intelligently Designed?"
My friends in the office just spent a couple of minutes laughing about this question and wishing we got more money from the Illuminati or the Devil to keep all this "cover up" in place. Sadly, I'll just have to tell you the truth... I have another friend - a layman with respect to mathematics - who believed that imaginary numbers were in some sense a proof of the existence of God. He had picked up somewhere that imaginary numbers were "mathematically impossible", and thus their existence indicated something more powerful that could make them be. I was eventually able to correct him about the nature of imaginary numbers*, though I never expect such a correction to change his overall theology. As for your friend's claims... The Fibonacci sequence is one of an infinity of possible sequences with the same properties - it is generated by the second order recurrence relation [math]F_{n+2} - F_{n+1} - F_n = 0[/math], with [math]F_0 = F_1 = 1[/math]. Clearly, any other choices initial conditions will result in another sequence with mostly the same properties. The value, meaning and properties of [math]\pi[/math] are consequences of the way we define certain things in geometry and arithmetic (in a flat space the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius cannot be anything other than [math]2\pi[/math]). It turns out that if you want to maximise the volume contained by a given closed area (or, equivalently, to contain a given volume within the least surface area) you'll get a sphere - because this is the most energetically favourable state of any "blob" of matter in 3D where surface tension plays a role. For the same reason, a sufficiently large blob of matter attracted by mutual gravity will obtain a roughly spherical shape. This is basically "order" arising out of simple rules and processes. The golden ratio is simply the larger of the two solutions to the quadratic equation [math]x^2 - x - 1 = 0[/math]. This is my quadratic equation. There are many like it, but this one is mine... Anyway, it turns out that the golden ratio appears in a lot of places (like a logarithmic spiral) because - again - of efficiency, here regarding packing. The quadratic I noted arises in finding the general solution to the recurrence relation above that can give the Fibonacci sequence. All up, your friend sounds like he lives in a rather exciting world, and I wish him the best of luck in it. Meanwhile, we poor sods with out feet on the ground have to live with mundane explanations for things. Rather tragic, really. (Actually, no, a lot of it is pretty cool and amazing - perhaps moreso than the intelligent design/conspiracy crowd's own stories - but somehow less exciting where the distinction between "goodies" and "baddies" isn't as clear.) * It's clear that there exist no real numbers whose squares are negative real numbers, so the imaginary unit comes to be from simply "supposing" that there is some number (or pair of numbers) whose square(s) give -1, and then supposing that the usual rules of arithmetic and algebra still make sense.
