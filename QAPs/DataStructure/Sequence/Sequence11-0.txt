Is there an order/sequence for wearing makeup?
Here is a step-by-step professional makeup routine courtesy of Burberry: In this case: primer concealer foundation shine palatte/ powder eyebrow liner lip liner lipstick I've often heard that foundation often comes before concealer, however. On a personal note, my mother advises me to use some lipstick for a polished elegance, and keep your skin clear and healthy so as to not need makeup at all. Mascara, as you mention, is always a mess, and goes bad easily- even when they withstand tears and rubbing, they may still end up looking like breakdancing spiders. Best to avoid it altogether unless you have a professional applying for you.
