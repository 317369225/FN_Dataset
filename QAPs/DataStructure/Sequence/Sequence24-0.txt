How does Harvard's Physics 251 sequence (Quantum Mechanics) compare with MIT's 8.321 sequence (Quantum Theory)?
They are both good enough. Of course MIT has more Quantum pedigree than Harvard. Go to Harvard if you want to either make people live longer despite their habits (Med-school) or take their money (Law-school), or meet future Democratic Presidents. (For Republican Presidents go to Yale and try to get balloted into the Skull and Bones fraternity). Better is the worst enemy of good enough! If they both teach you all there is to know, they are both good enough. You can really cover the whole field if you apply yourself for a year or two, max three, that includes quantum field theory, group theory. This is especially true for a relatively simple Physical field as Quantum Mechanics, which is described by a linear second degree differential equation over the complex numbers. As long as your force field is electromagnetic, the fine structure constant 1/137 makes perturbation theory (think Feynman diagrams) highly efficient, because the impact of higher order perturbations needed to analyze realistic processes falls off so fast with increasing number of higher order perturbing contributions. Try turbulent flows or plasma physics or chaos theory (especially non-dissipative systems like the Saturn rings) when you are looking for trouble.
