What was the purpose of the surveillance drone sequence in Interstellar?
In a movie so great done by such a great director, nothing absolutely is a coincidence or left to chance. My conjecture is that the drone was mentioned as Indian because one very compelling reason and that is related to the movie's central theme, that we, as a race must dream, discover, invent and go beyond no matter what the odds. India's Mangalyaan and many other space missions by ISRO has been lambasted by international media on pretext of  the perennial question - "Why should India spend money on Mars when it can't spend money on its poor people".  The fact that its solar also reaffirms about India's hope pinned on solar energy based technology and frugality. And of course all this resonates with the intelligent people out there, both as a message and with the movie's core audience. Nolan and/or his scripting crew, in  one stroke of genius perhaps proves that, any society, no matter how poor or impoverished or genius or rich, needs to do find answers to important questions in parallel and not in sequence, because for societies, as much as it is true for our lives, time is the only constraint, everything else is solveable. NB: This movie and these mentions are going to spawn the little kids we have in our collective societies to find out answers to questions that they would perhaps never or ask much later in their lives. The consequence of such movies are these discussions that propel some people forward.
