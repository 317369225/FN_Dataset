What are the differences between Sanger sequencing and Next Generation Sequencing in terms of generating DNA sequence data?
To me this is a quite broad, undefined question. Sequencing by PCR and Sanger seq, e.g. ABI chemistry is relative simple and cheap. And can be done even in a DIY fashion. Adding robotics yields a fast, streamlined process, with quick results and reports. MPS, massive paralel sequencing, aka NGS, is fairly complex & expensive, but yielding massive amounts of data and improving diagnostic yields in Dx. In research unravelled new scientific insights are all ready published. Really opening up new vista's. Great to see evolve. Wikepedia can give you a hand in list of differences.
