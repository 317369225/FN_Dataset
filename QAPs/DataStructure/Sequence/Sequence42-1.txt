What do the lyrics in the opening sequence of "The Lion King" mean?
A simple google search could have resulted in the same result, but, i'm not here to judge you. The opening lyrics in Zulu are: Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba Sithi uhm ingonyama Nants ingonyama bagithi baba Sithi uhhmm ingonyama Ingonyama Siyo Nqoba Ingonyama Ingonyama nengw' enamabala Word for word translating does not work for, but that is a different discussion. Essentially the song is about a lion. Heres the Zulu, with English beside it: Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba (Here comes a lion, Father) Sithi uhm ingonyama (Oh yes, it's a lion) Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba (Here comes a lion, Father) Sithi uhm ingonyama (Oh yes, it's a lion) Ingonyama (A lion) Siyo Nqoba (We're going to conquer) Ingonyama (A lion) Ingonyama nengw' enamabala (A lion and a leopard come to this open place)
