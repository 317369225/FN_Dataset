The sequency of the number is 17. If the second number is 3. What is the first number?
Why do people keep asking these stupid "what is the next term in the sequence" questions? Again, for any finite sequence, there are an infinite number of next terms. If you are asking for the term which came before the current set of terms in a sequence, that's really just asking for the next term of a different sequence (the finite sequence you just listed, backwards). So the next term is whatever integer you want it to be. Maybe it's orange. I don't know. UpdateThe question that I actually had answered was "In the sequence 17, 3, what is the 1st term?" Someone merged that question into this one. Updated 19w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
