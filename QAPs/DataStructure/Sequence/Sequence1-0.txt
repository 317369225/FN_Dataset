Which TV series has the best opening sequence?
The Wire had cold openings so it starts at about 3:10 The performer of the song changed each season. Season 4 was mostly focused either directly or indirectly on the youth of Baltimore so this one has a kid singing. Like the Wire, Weeds changed the artist rendition of their theme every season. I saw the Family Guy joke version but not the original, All in the Family AMEN! Even if you don't know/remember the show this song and opening was great. Empty Nest Dear John -- His face when he reads the note completely sets the tone for the show. It's great. The song is great too. Three's Company Sister Sister From season 2 on The Cosby Show had wonderful openings this one was especially worth noting. These are just a few of my all time favorites.
