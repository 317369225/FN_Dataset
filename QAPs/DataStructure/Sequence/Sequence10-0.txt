Why is it that every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence?
Things that get closer and closer to some flagpole necessarily get closer and closer to each other. A bit more formally: If for every prescribed distance, no matter how small, the numbers [math]x_n[/math] eventually stay within that distance from the limit [math]L[/math]... (this says that [math]x_n[/math] converges to [math]L[/math]) ...then for every prescribed distance, no matter how small, the numbers [math]x_n[/math] eventually stay within that distance from each other. (this says that [math]x_n[/math] is a Cauchy sequence). Or, transcribing this fully to precise mathematical language: [math]\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty[/math] is an infinite sequence of real numbers, or points in any metric space, and [math]L[/math] is another real number (or a point in that same space). The distance between two points [math]a,b[/math] we shall denote by[math]d(a,b)[/math]; if those are real numbers, this is just [math]|a-b|[/math]. 1. We say that [math]\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = L[/math] if, for every [math]\epsilon > 0[/math] there is some [math]N[/math] such that [math]d(x_n,L)<\epsilon[/math] for any [math]n>N[/math]. 2. We say that [math]x_n[/math] is a Cauchy sequence if for every [math]\epsilon > 0[/math] there is some [math]N[/math] such that [math]d(x_n,x_m)<\epsilon[/math] for any [math]m,n[/math] that are both more than [math]N[/math]. It's important the recognize the similarity between these two statements, which is very apparent, but also the key difference: in the first case we have a specific point [math]L[/math] which we claim that is a limit - the points in the sequence get closer and closer to that [math]L[/math]. In the second instance, the Cauchy sequence, there is no [math]L[/math]. The claim is intrinsic to the sequence: its elements eventually become closer than any prescribed distance. It should now be intuitively obvious that 1 implies 2. If everything condenses around [math]L[/math], obviously the points of the sequence can't stay away from each other either. However it should be equally clear that 2 does not imply 1. Things can get closer and closer to each other but the space they are in might be missing the limit point. If our space is the rational numbers, then there are many sequences which are Cauchy but their limit isn't in our space . Consider, for example, the sequence [math]x_n=(1+\frac{1}{n})^n[/math]: it is a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers, but it has no rational limit. A space is called complete if every Cauchy sequence converges in that space, and many metric spaces aren't complete. To prove that 1 implies 2: given any [math]\epsilon>0[/math] we must find a suitable [math]N[/math]. To do that we use the condition of 1 for the positive number [math]\epsilon/2[/math]; this gives you an [math]N[/math] with the property that [math]d(x_n,L)<\epsilon/2[/math] whenever [math]n>N[/math]. Now, if [math]m>N[/math] and [math]n>N[/math] we have [math]d(x_m,x_n) \leq d(x_m,L) + d(L,x_n) < [/math] [math]< \epsilon/2+\epsilon/2=\epsilon[/math] which is what we needed to prove.
