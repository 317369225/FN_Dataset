Is there an order/sequence for wearing makeup?
While there isn't a proper sequence for every product, your friends are right that sometimes certain things should happen first. For example, primer goes under foundation to set that foundation and help it last all day. So you've got to do the primer first. Mascara is typically a last step because it's messy and trying to apply shadow or liner after your mascara is on can smudge. Also, powder does usually go over concealer to help it set. If you like your own routine and are happy with how your makeup looks and feels, you don't have to change it though. The main thing is how it works for you.
