Is it possible for a human to generate a truly random sequence mentally?
1. Ask the aliens if the results from a Mersenne-Twister would be sufficient. If so, try your best (without a body, and poor memorizing/maths skills this is going to be a tough task). Otherwise, go directly to number 2. 2. Now that you know that you live in a world where aliens may come and take someone's (not only yours) fully intact head and spine off the body and put it in a very advanced jar, just to play a random game -- will you want to live in such a world? 3. My answer would be: "The square root of e to the power of pi" On the other hand, how would you know that our universe is not the result of a  random urn trial? Updated 209w ago • View Upvotes
