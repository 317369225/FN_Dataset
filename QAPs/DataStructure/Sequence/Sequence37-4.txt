Which film has the best montage sequence?
Well, ROCKY certainly is up there - the training montage has become a trope, but the images, the acting & Bill Conti's score make it work. The killing montage in GOODFELLAS is damn impressive and Pacino's rise to power montage in SCARFACE is very well done. These three popped in my head - obviously, there are many more (in fact TEAM AMERICA spoofs montages brilliantly)
