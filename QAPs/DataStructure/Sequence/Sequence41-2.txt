What is the best sequence of quadcopters to build for a beginner hobbyist?
I wrote a couple articles on this over at Drone Flyers - Quadcopter, Multirotor and Drones Resource Site, including: Beginners only - the best first Quadcopter! - Drone Flyers The best advice, IMHO, is to buy a sub-$100 (total including lots of extra parts and batteries) machine and get a number of hours on the sticks. As you do this, you will become more familiar with the terms, definitions and model availability. As your second or third models, you could consider many including the AR Drone (you can modify it to do fancier things) or the RTF Arducopter, which is much more advanced (waypoints, etc.).
