What are the missing term number sequence 1,2,4,8,__, __?
There are [math]\infty ^2[/math] right solutions. Or, using cardinals, [math](\aleph_0)^2[/math] solutions, unless it's a sequence of real or complex numbers, in which case there are [math](\aleph_1)^2[/math]. What makes you think there there should be only one "right" solution? You might say it's a smart feature to discern a pattern given a sequence. But then, wouldn't I be smarter the more complicated the patterns I see are? Then you could say, by Occam's razor, that it's more efficient to find the simplest pattern that explains what you see. But even then, couldn't there be multiple simple patterns that explain something? In general, see What is the next number in the following sequence? by Alexander Farrugia on Farrugia Maths But of course, yes, if someone asks you this question in a test, you're supposed to answer "16 and 32". Unless you're actually left free to argument your answer, in which case it's probably better to give the same meta-answer I gave here.
