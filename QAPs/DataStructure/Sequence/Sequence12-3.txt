Does anyone really believe in the evolutionary sequence of algae, fish, bird, mammal, human?
I hate to break it to Adriana, Daniel, other answerers, and even the OP. The real answer to the question is yes. Yes people actually believe that. The battle isn't against Christianity or religion. It is against ignorance. It just happens that a lot of Christians choose to remain in ignorance, but that is by no means the only source. Reading your excellent answers, debates, and comment threads, I have to say that you would be surprised how little the layman knows about the actual theory of evolution and how many of them think the process in the question is true. In that way, they "believe" evolution in the same way religious people believe in God - without knowing a shred of evidence. They can then proceed to get emotional and irrational in its defense...just like some Christians. A lot of false information has made its way onto official textbooks particularly in the developing world. And I would say most high school biology teachers who teach this in junior high have less than half of the knowledge presented in the existing answers on this single question in Quora. They "preach" it to their class without any intellectual curiosity of their own. The fact is many, many people think we evolved from featherless birds, and in China when I grew up, teachers say we evolved from the Neanderthal, who long ago were rat-monkeys. I first heard about the idea of the tree of life on Cosmos, so I went 20 plus years thinking that we did indeed go from algae to human. My grade 8-10 science teachers in Canada thought so too, probably still think so. It's a sad reality that the discussion evolution has taken such a corrosive nature due to attacks from YE creationists; that while being defensive, it's hard for real knowledge to be disseminated and discussions to occur.
