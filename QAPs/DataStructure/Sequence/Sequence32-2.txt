How many ways are there of partitioning a sequence of n items into contiguous sub-sequences?
The problem statement and examples are somewhat at odds, if I'm not mistaken.  The powerset interpretation (minus the empty sequence) fits the problem statement, but the examples suggest that the overall order should be preserved.  In this case, the first example [(1),(2,3,4),(5,6)] is distinct from [(1),(5,6),(2,34)], as well as the other four possible arrangements.   Simplifying the notation somewhat, let us say that the question concerns partitioning [123456] into:   [1,234,56]   [123,4,56]   [123,456]   [12,3456] etc.   A powerset intepretation still applies, but now the main concern is the number of commas involved in each partition (e.g., 0 in [123456], 2 in the next two examples, and one in the last two).  Looking at just how the sequence can be partitioned into 0,1,2,3,4,5 commas can be shown to be [math]2^(n-1)[/math] wherein the implicit order is preserved.  The proof proceeds directly from induction, but a simple combinatorial approach seems more intuitive:  [math](n \choose c)[/math], where [math]n[/math] is the length of the sequence, and [math]c[/math] is the number of commas. That the sum over all possible combinations is [math]2^(n-1)[/math] follows immediately.   Oops, looks like this has already been noticed.  Hopefully, both responses provide the intuition that I have suggested.
