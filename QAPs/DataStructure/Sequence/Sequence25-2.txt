What are the differences between Sanger sequencing and Next Generation Sequencing in terms of generating DNA sequence data?
Sanger sequencing was developed by Frederick Sanger and colleagues in 1977 and was widely used for about 25 years.  Nowadays its mostly replaced by Next-gen sequencing. Sanger sequencing is quite slow and can sequence only a few thousand nucleotides in a week.  The next-gen sequencing method is fast, easy to operate and cost effective.  It can sequence about 200 billion nucleotides in a week, which is going to rise to 600 billion in the next few years. Its like comparing the data stored in a floppy drive(Sanger sequence) to a 2TB hard drive(Next-gen sequencing). The level of advancement that genome sequencing has undergone in the last few years is so vast that now we can sequence the entire the genome of any individual within a couple of hours. This is just a basic idea. I hope it helps.
