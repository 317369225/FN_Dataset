Number Sequence: Given the sequence: 1,3,7,13,21,31,43 ... which number stands in place 1001?
Let's see if we can figure it out via the method of finite differences, which can be used to find a polynomial fit to the data. The 1st finite difference of a sequence is simply a sequence where each term is the difference between successive elements of the original sequence. In this case, since the original sequence is (1,3,7,13,21,31,43,...), the 1st finite difference of the sequence is (3-1,7-3, 13-7, 21-13, 31-21, 43-31,...) = (2,4,6,8,10,12,...). The 2nd finite difference of a sequence is the finite difference of the first finite difference. In this case, it's (4-2, 6-4, 8-6, 10-8, 12-10,...) = (2,2,2,2,2,...). (The 3rd finite difference is the finite difference of the 2nd finite difference, and so on. In this case, the 3rd and higher finite differences are all (0,0,...), which is rather boring). How does this help? Let's assume we have some sequence [math](a_0, a_1, a_2, ...)[/math] where [math]a_n = bn^2+cn+d[/math] (a sequence defined by a quadratic polynomial). What does the nth term of the 1st finite difference look like? [math]\Delta a_n = a_{n+1}-a_n = (b(n+1)^2 + c(n+1) +d) - (bn^2 + cn + d)[/math] [math] = ((bn^2 + 2bn + 1) + cn + c + d) - (bn^2 + cn +d)[/math] [math] = bn^2 + 2bn + cn +1 +c + d - bn^2 - cn -d[/math] [math] = 2bn + c + 1[/math]. Similarly, the 2nd finite difference looks like: [math]\Delta^2a_n = \Delta a_{n+1} - \Delta a_n [/math] [math] = (2b(n+1) + c + 1) - (2bn + c + 1)[/math] [math] = 2bn + 2b + c + 1 - 2bn -c - 1[/math] [math] = 2b[/math] This a constant sequence. It should be clear that [math]d = a_0, c = \Delta a_0 - 1, b = \Delta^2a_0/2[/math]. For our sequence, that means that it is [math](\Delta^2a_0/2)n^2 + (\Delta a_0 - 1)n + a_0 = (2/2)n^2 + (2-1)n + 1 = n^2 + n + 1[/math] You may note that this differs from the results others gave ([math]n(n-1)+1, n^2 - n +1[/math]), but that's because I treated the sequence as [math](a_0, a_1, ...)[/math], and they treated it as [math](a_1, a_2, ...)[/math]. The difference means that the 1001th item in the sequence, for me, has an index [math]n = 1000[/math], and for them[math]n=1001[/math]. So I get [math]a_{1000} = 1000^2 + 1000 + 1  = 1000000 + 1000 + 1 = 1001001[/math]. This technique, of finite differences, can be used for any sequence that can be approximated by a polynomial. It's common to go the other way, as well. If you have a polynomial that you know approximates a function of interest, you can build up the sequence from it's differences. Say you have [math]\Delta^2a = (2,2,2,2,2,...)[/math], and you know that [math]\Delta a_0 = 2[/math]. Then by repeated addition, you can get [math]\Delta a = (2,4,6,8,10,12,...)[/math]. If you also know that [math]a_0 = 1[/math], you can get [math]a = (1,3,7,13,21,31,43,...)[/math] It's possible to come up with a 7th order polynomial whose values from 0 to [math]89\circ 59'[/math] correspond to the sine function (one choice begins [math]-\frac{(2\pi)^7}{21600^77!}x^7 + ...[/math]). If you have such a polynomial, you can calculate [math] \Delta \sin(0'), \Delta^2 \sin(0'), ... ,\Delta^7 \sin(0')[/math] by hand once, then use simple (but repetitive) addition to calculate a sine table. It's a lot of work, but before computers it was the best way to do it.
