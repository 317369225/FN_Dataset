How many ways are there of partitioning a sequence of n items into contiguous sub-sequences?
Since [math]a_i[/math] and [math]a_j[/math] are considered different, even if [math]a_i = a_j[/math], we can essentially think of a finite sequence of length n as a set of n elements. This makes sense when you think of a sequence as a function from the naturals to some other set. Indeed, we could even write the sequence as a set of ordered pairs: [math]\{(1, a_1), (2,a_2), ..., (n,a_n)\}[/math]. So the answer is the same as the size of the powerset: [math]2^n[/math]. Rakshit Pandey uses [math]2^n - 1[/math]. This is also correct. It depends on the definition used. The empty sequence can be a valid sequence or not, depending on the way sequences are defined. Non-overlapping SubsequencesJoe Wezorek mentioned that he wants to ensure that the sequences are not overlapping. In other words, if an element is in one subsequence, it cannot be in another. I think it would depend on what subsequences you want to select. Suppose you select all the subsequences of one element. That would be n subsequences, but any other sequence, aside from the empty sequence, would overlap. Sorry, I misunderstood the problem, so there's a change from my original answer. The correct answer is known as the "Bell number." It is a non trivial number and is defined recursively. SubsequencesOkay. There seems to be some confusion about what constitutes a valid subsequence. Suppose we have the sequence (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4). Both (a_1, a_4) and (a_2, a_3) are valid subsequences. Why? Because there are no other elements in those sequences besides the ones that are in the original, and because if one element follows another element in the subsequence, it does so in the original sequence as well. In other words, subsequences are order preserving.
