What is the most powerful song to accompany a suicide sequence in a film?
I originally had thought to nominate Suicide is Painless (M.A.S.H. Theme), from the film but then read the details of the question and now realize it's unsuitable. The Rolling Stones did a couple of things that might be useful: 19th Nervous Breakdown, (which you really should hear) and ... my nominee: Paint it Black And I'd be surprised if you weren't interested in almost any song from Metallica's album, Death Magnetic, even if it was all copyright 2008. .
