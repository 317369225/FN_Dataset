What is the most powerful song to accompany a suicide sequence in a film?
Head Like a Hole... god money i'll do anything for you.god money just tell me what you want me to.god money nail me up against the wall.god money don't want everything he wants it all.no you can't take it no you can't take it no you can't take that away from me no you can't take it no you can't take it no you can't take that away from mehead like a hole.black as your soul.i'd rather die than give you control.head like a hole.black as your soul.i'd rather die than give you control.bow down before the one you serve.you're going to get what you deserve.bow down before the one you serve.you're going to get what you deserve. OR! (different vibe) Pink Floyd's Learning to Fly... Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I Above the planet on a wing and a prayer, My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air, Across the clouds I see my shadow fly Out of the corner of my watering eye A dream unthreatened by the morning light Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night There's no sensation to compare with this Suspended animation, a state of bliss
