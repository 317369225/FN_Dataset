Why is it that every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence?
Convergence to a limit x simply means that for an arbitrary distance [math]\epsilon > 0 [/math], I can find an index N in the sequence {x} such that for all n > N,  [math] | x_{n} - x | < \epsilon [/math]. Cauchy means for an arbitrary distance [math] \xi > 0 [/math], I can find an Index N in the sequence such that for all n, m > N:  [math] | x_{m} - x_{n} | < \xi [/math]. Now select [math] \epsilon = \frac{\xi}{2} [/math]. For a convergent sequence {x} we have [math] | x_{n} - x | + | x - x_{m} | < 2 \epsilon = \xi [/math]. Then from the triangle inequality on a metric space we have [math] | x_{n} - x_{m} | \le | x_{n} - x | + | x - x_{m} | < \xi [/math]. Therefore, a convergent series must be Cauchy.
