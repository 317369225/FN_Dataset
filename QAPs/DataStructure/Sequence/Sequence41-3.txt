What is the best sequence of quadcopters to build for a beginner hobbyist?
Like others here, I recommend starting with an RTF toy quadcopter around $100 or lower, to get your reflexes trained and to find out of you like flying quads. Then if you are actually interested in the building process (vs. buying an RTF system), the 3DR kits are great, as are the Hoverthings kits. With Hoverthings, you have an option to go with a NAZA flight controller, which is still simpler to set up then the (much improved and more capable) 3DR Pixhawk. Autonomy experiments and formation flights are not things done on a few weekends - you are looking at serious, very technical software development (and even hardware). You'll need an open platform (Pixhawk) and serious time. You might want to temper your expectations. The popular videos showing quadcopters doing things like flying formation and playing ping pong are done with research systems that use external high speed cameras and external computation; those things are not achievable with hobby grade gear relying on its own sensors (yet.)
