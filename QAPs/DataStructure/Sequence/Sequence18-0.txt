The sequency of the number is 17. If the second number is 3. What is the first number?
The question as it appears in multiple places on the internet is variations of "If The Number Of The Sequence Is 17 And the Second Number is 3 ,What Is The First Number."Â  The English construction of the sentence for many of them is lacking, but I believe the proper interpretation of the question is, "If a number in the sequence is 17 and the second number of the sequence is 3, then what is the first number?" Apparently we are looking for a sequence of numbers that meets the criteria of Ni where i is the position in the sequence The stated problem is the second number is 3 (for i=2) and somewhere in the sequence occurs the number 17. N1, 3, N3... Nx, 17, Nx+2 There are two possible solutions which meet this: it could be the sequence of odd numbers (i*2)-1 which gives 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19... first number in sequence is 1
