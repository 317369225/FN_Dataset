Why does the Fibonacci sequence repeat in nature?
The phenomenon is real.  It's not that the Fibonacci series is well known and therefore it was observed.  It's not just an approximation. In 1868 Wilhelm Hofmeister proposed that the precise spot where at the growing tips of plants form is furthest from older primordia.  The primordia then move outward and downward along the stem as the tip continues to grow. In 2000, Didier Reinhardt of the University of Fribourg worked out the biochemistry within a plant that creates this behavior. Before, in 1992, Stéphane Douady and Yves Couder performed an experiment in 1992 that dropped magnetized drops of ferrofluid which displayed the same phenomenon.
