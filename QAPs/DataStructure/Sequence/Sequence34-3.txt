What are the advantages/disadvantages of using Protein Alignment vs Nucleotide Alignment?
Alex provided a very good answer; I would qualify one of his points a little. He noted that because of redundant coding many DNA mutations "don't matter". That's broadly true because selection is usually at the level of the protein; however, if you're looking at evolution, the silent changes in DNA can be very informative because they can help determine the background drift level of mutation, that are not selected for or against. You can then use this background level to help quantify the amount of positive or negative selection that's going on (dN/dS).Â  There are also instances where silent changes are selected (e.g. codon usage is a selectable factor) but that's probably, mostly, more weakly selected than amino acid usage. In any case, amino acid alignments are a good starting point, but if you have the DNA sequences available you'd usually look at them as well for further information.
