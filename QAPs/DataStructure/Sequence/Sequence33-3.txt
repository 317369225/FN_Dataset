Does Pi contain my DNA sequence?
Yes, because Pi is a non recurring repeating decimal. Hidden in the infinite sequences of its decimal notation is DNA sequence of all the living beings (past, present and future) in the universe. Hidden in its decimal notation are all the solution (encoded in numeric form) to every possible question ranging from time travel, prediction of future events, polynomial time solution to NP Complete Problems,etc. All that needs to be done is decoding all this information......
