What is sequence alignment?
Sequence alignment is a fantastically powerful analytical tool in many sciences needing pattern recognition work. My favourite book on the topic: Time Warps, String Edits, and Macromolecules: The Theory and Practice of Sequence Comparison [1] It can be used across a wide range of research topics. For example: It can used in computational linguistics to align sequences and study things like dissimilation to see how frequently we'll drop sounds in language evolution (i.e. pronouncing surprise as "suprise").  In comparing a word list of spellings (often conserves their etymological origin) with a word list of pronunciations (evolved phonetic shifts), we would discover: surprise suprise These are almost identical sequences.  Our innate human pattern recognition lets us see that instantly.  Sequence alignment is the formality of what we naturally do.  The "su" sequence aligns and the "rise" sequence aligns - i.e. there are 2 substring sequence alignments here that coincide nicely and give us an automatic way to identify candidates for further analysis[2]. By aligning these sequences, we also get the single variant, the /r/, for free, and can also easily see that the distance between the two words is a single letter / sound. It can be used in the study of bird migrations by aligning sequences of bird songs to understand how similar or distant the songs are as the songs evolve as the birds migrate away from the song origin.[3] [1] http://www.amazon.com/Time-Warps... [2] Further analysis by a data expert is always important because otherwise you'll wind up with false positives like "jude" as a dissimilated candidate for "judge", which is total nonsense.
