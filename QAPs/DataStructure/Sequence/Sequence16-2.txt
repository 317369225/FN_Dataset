What is the most interesting thing people learn from having their DNA sequenced?
My girlfriend, and I did 23andme. The three most interesting things I learned were these. FAMILY: My girlfriend and I are 4th cousinsHaving grown up different places and with no known connection this was probably the most interesting. We have since tried to locate the common grandparent, but have been unsuccessful. People say we look alike, but we also don't. 4th cousin is so far away that it has no worrying implications, so it's just a fact that brings us closer together really. HEALTH: I am a carrier of the genetic disease my grand father died fromMy grand father had a very rare genetic disease that allowed the iron content in his blood to gradually increase. Since it is so slow-moving, it would be impractical to diagnose any other way. This is medically very useful, because if I had learned I had the disease, I could easily have taken measures that would allowed me to live with it just fine. I would just have to give blood every once in a while. And knowing that I am a carrier, I can take the neccesary testing on my children. ANCESTRY: Even though I have dark brown eyes, brown hair and easily tan, I am 99.7 % northern european. Now this is probably only interesting to me, of course. But to give you the whole story: my fathers line are darker (though otherwise nordic-looking), so there was a myth in the family that this is because some eastern-european boy was left on someones porch 500 years ago. Growing up I learned this as a fact. My genetic profile, however, completely rules out the story, since I have 0.0 % ancestry from eastern Europe or Asia. I haven't thought much more of it, but it absolutely was interesting to check the family stories. Updated 15w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
