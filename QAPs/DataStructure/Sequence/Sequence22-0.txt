Number Sequence: A sequence contains the following numbers. Can you find the function this sequence generates?
f(1)=f(5)=...=f(2n-1)=68 with n odd. f(4)=f(2)+10=...=f(2n+2)=f(2n)+10 with f(2)=88 and n e /N. f(7)=f(3)+40=...=f(2n+1)=f(2n-3)+40 with n e {3, 5, 7, ...}. f(2n-1)=68 with n odd. f(2n+1)=f(2n-3)+40 with f(3)=108 and n e {3, 5, 7, ...}. f(2n+2)=f(2n)+10 with f(2)=88 and n e /N. The sequence stems from a misunderstanding 16, 06, 68, 88, .. , 98, turn upside down and you get 87, children seem to see that immediately. I saw a sequence ..., 68, 88, 108, 98, 68, 108, 148, 118, 68, 128, 188, 138, 68, 148, 228, 158, 68, 168, 268, ...? Then i puzzled some function for the sequence which falls apart in three sequences. A simple mistake by a simple mathematician who doesn't think it's the ultimate solution but it was surely no insincere question. This sequence is bap- tized as The Parking Lot Sequence.
