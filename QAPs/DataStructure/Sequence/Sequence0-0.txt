What is the next number in this sequence and why?
90 If you look at the number sequences, you can see a pattern: 2 x ___ = 6, then 3 x ___ = 12, then 4 x ___ = 20, and so on. The missing numbers are 3, 4, 5, etc: the next highest numbers in the sequence. In other words, filled in, the column would look like this: 2 x 3 = 6 3 x 4 = 12 4 x 5 = 20 5 x 6 = 30 6 x 7 = 42 The question then skips the next two numbers to try to throw you off. All you need to do is repeat the formula to get the answer: 9 x 10 = 90. EDIT: I received a message from fellow Quoran Kumar Vaibhav, who asked me if I thought the following sequence could be correct. I really liked the way he put this together, so although we came up with different answers, with his permission I'd like to share it. (He tried to submit it and apparently came up against a roadblock several times.) If anyone has any feedback for Kumar, he'd appreciate hearing it. Please feel free to put it in the comments section. Thanks - 2+3=5+1=6  and  6+6=12 3+4=7+1=8  and  12+8=20 4+5=9+1=10  and  20+10=30 5+6=11+1=12  and  30+12=42 6+9=15+1=16  and 42+16=58 Updated 26w ago • View Upvotes
