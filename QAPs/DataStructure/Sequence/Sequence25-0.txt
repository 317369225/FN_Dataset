What are the differences between Sanger sequencing and Next Generation Sequencing in terms of generating DNA sequence data?
Sanger is high accuracy over long lengths but expensive. Next Gen are usually high output but less accurate (hence why you need to have "deep sequencing" of at least roughly 10X - i.e. a given region or nucleotide must have at least 10 occurrences in the sequencing results to be confident it is correct - even one missing or missplaced nucleotide could mess up a sequence). The best so far has been Illumina's sequencing technology which is high output and accurate due to its depth. However, the sequence lengths ("reads") are often quite short of a few hundred bases (compared to the billions needed for some genomes - that makes assembling a genome difficult). I really am hoping for something like PacBio's SMRT Cell technology, which is not high output but has very long read lengths similar to Sanger, except for the fact it is more error prone and rarely can stand alone.
