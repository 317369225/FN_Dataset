What is the best sequence of quadcopters to build for a beginner hobbyist?
Great question! This is quite an extensive topic, so rather than outline everything here, I'll just point you to a drone buying guide I created. It will walk you through DIY versus Ready to Fly drones, different buying attributes, the top drones for under $200, top aerial videography drones, and more. Feel free to check it out right here: see: How to Buy a Drone (Beginner's Guide)
