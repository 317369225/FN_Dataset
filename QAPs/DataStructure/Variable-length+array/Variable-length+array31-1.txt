My interviewer asked me what is there In C which is not in C++ and then he said if C++ includes all the features of C then why on the earth we teach C??
Your interviewer was trying to freak you out. That's a classic strategy that a lot of idiots (including me) have used and possibly still use (as your interviewer proves to be the case). In this specific case ... I think the answer is simple: what does C have that C++ doesn't? And the answer is: ELEGANCE. C++ is a language that is unable to decide what all it wants to achieve. It wants to be better than C. And then it wants to be object oriented. Oh, and Generic too. How about functional? How about logic? How about data flow? How about ...? All those and more are coming up in some future version of C++. C doesn't have such hang ups. Or at least the C I knew didn't seem to have such hangups. As K&R said in the 2nd edition of their book "The C Programming Language": C is NOT a big language. (See my answer here: Mahesh RS's answer to How do I learn C language online, in two weeks?) And in spite of being a tiny language ... C has helped programmers build fantastic systems. (See my answer here: Mahesh RS's answer to Which is the king of programming languages?) The C++-s and the Javas and the Gos and the Julias promise you the world. But when it comes to getting things done ... there's no better language than C. And that is the major difference between C and C++ ... and between C and every other language out there. C is small. C is elegant. And C helps you get real work done. Other languages ... they help you philosophize.
