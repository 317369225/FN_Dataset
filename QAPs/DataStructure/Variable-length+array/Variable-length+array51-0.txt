Which best IDE for c++ for windows code block or visual c++ 2015?
I have never used windows and probably never use for my development at least for their lame tool chain support, no open source document and no support for those languages which is not financially profitable for them. But there are still few things that I can answer. I don't know much about Visual Studio except the fact it is the best for C# but when it's a matter about C++ sooner or later they will drop the support for C++ 14 and I think they are not going to update for C++17 in near future.. Exactly they did with C. When C99 was released they supported only few features from it as they did with C++14..now C11 is available but Microsoft declared that they will not support it anymore..Sometime I think MVS user will never know what is variable length array(VLA) in C99 that even C++ doesn't have because they have never given support for it. Similarly In C++ they don't support the full features of lamda expressions or proper regex library support..adding boost library support is also very erroneous in Visual Studio.. In short you are doomed if you are a power user in C++. The solution is you use GCC/G++. But if you are using GCC/g++ then why you will use Visual Studio ?? Hence it is much more mature choice to use Code::blocks..the best part is that it is platform independent and you may install with GCC bundled version. But this GCC is not the actual GCC but rather a windows compatible rip off. Hence again you have to sacrifice a lot of features but not as much as Visual studio. On second thought, if you are open with other IDEs for C++ and paying a little bit money is okay for you then you can try two options. Try clion from Jetbrains.com Try online IDEs like WWW.c9.io, codenvy.com, koding.com, Ideone etc. My fav is koding.com Edit: Just as a reference here is the list of C++ compilers' ability to surprise you. Here needed to mention Apple/BSD's fanboy toolchain Clang/LLVM's success story as par with GCC Few More reads: C++ - Is it worth using GCC over MSVC on Windows? C++11/14 compiler and library shootout
