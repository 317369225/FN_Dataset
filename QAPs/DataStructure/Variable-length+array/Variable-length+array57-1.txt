Is a pointer to an array really a useless feature of C?
No.  One use is functions that are networking APIs and that always have a standard return for error.  An example, a function may have a signature like intget_query_results(DB_HANDLE *handle,                  DB_RESULTS **results,                   int *n_results); This would take an uninitialized DB_RESULTS array pointer and populate it with an array of structures that would be deallocated later. (It was a user choice as to whether to use this function or use a somewhat slower but iterative function that would use less RAM.) All the functions in this particular API returned 0 on success and a nonzero error code on error.
