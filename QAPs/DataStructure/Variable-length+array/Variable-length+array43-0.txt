What is vector in terms of programming language?
'Vector' can have several different meanings. In machine language, 'vector' can refer to the address of an interrupt service routine (ISR). For example, the 6502 processor has three vector addresses stored in the last six bytes of the address space so it knows what to do if a maskable interrupt, non-maskable interrupt, or reset event happens. In computer graphics or mathematics (particularly linear algebra), 'vector' refers to an ordered tuple of numbers, which may correspond to a coordinate in n-dimensional space, or an offset within n-dimensional space, or the coefficients to some polynomial. Usually these are fixed-size and stored in one-dimensional arrays. C++ has a 'vector' class that represents a list (variable-length array).
