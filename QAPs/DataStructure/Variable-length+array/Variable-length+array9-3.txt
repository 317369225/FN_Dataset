Why is sizeof() implemented as an operator in C?
Short answer: sizeof can work on data types Long answer: Well sizeof had two options: Either implement it as function Or implement it as operator Why sizeof is implemented as operator? Its because sizeof needs to be run at compile time. While a function is executed at runtime. Moreover, a function cannot work on data types, which sizeof does. What sizeof provides is not provided by function. However, C99 introduced an exception to work sizeof on Variable Length Array which is runtime.
