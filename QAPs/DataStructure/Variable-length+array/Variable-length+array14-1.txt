What is the best comment to a programmer who is still stuck at C-language (rather than C++)?
What do you mean by "stuck"? Is it that he's doing stuff which is better suited in C++, but he cannot get away from doing it using only C? Lots of assumptions in that sentence, never mind glossing over several reasons C might be "better" for specific use cases. There is no "best" language, and even comparing just the 2 is insufficient without also taking account of the environment. Remember C++ isn't something like a C 2.0. It's more like a C with added stuff stuck onto it making many C portions broken, obfuscated, omitted, replaced, unneeded, etc. And arguably C++ isn't doing "everything" correctly either, it made some drastic compromises which gives a C programmer a huge "shock" (i.e. a WTF moment). Actually a comment for someone from C++ background looking "down" on someone from C: "You're missing sooo much! Don't dis it before you really gave it a try yourself. You might be very surprised." But that same comment could go both ways, so you should be comfortable in both languages instead of always preferring one over another. Edit: Actually a good simulation of C vs C++ (or for that matter any language A vs B) - it's like asking someone what colour a shirt should be. Then criticizing them for choosing blue because it cannot be seen easily in low light, and them criticizing you for choosing yellow for the opposite reason. Any language may have it's niche where none other is quite as good (at least to a particular programmer's subjective "feel" of the situation), that never means that such language is "best" for everything.
