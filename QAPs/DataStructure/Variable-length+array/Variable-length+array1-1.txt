Is the alignment of variable length arrays standardized in C99/C11?
C/C++ generally do not natively let you specify much WRT memory alignment.  They are designed to be portable onto many different architectures, and allowing you to force a particular alignment might break certain architectures.  (This is also part of why they don't guarantee the sizes of base types like "int" or pointers.) One portable way to force alignment is to actually allocate (x+alignment) bytes, then start your usage at the first aligned address within the returned buffer.  (Note that on a platform with weird alignment restrictions, this may crash if you violate them.) If you're targeting a specific architecture, most compilers have options to enforce alignment -- but your code may not be portable.
