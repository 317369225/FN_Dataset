Int a [n] is this a valid declaration of array in c ie the subscript is not a number?
Hi Ritika, No,  it's not a valid statement of declaration in C or even in C++. Reason: The reason behind this is very simple. Arrays are given memory space by static memory allocation. That is, they are allocated space during compilation. Here n  is a variable. Hence the value will be defined during runtime. But compiler requires the size during compilation!  Hence it posses an ambiguity and as a rule, you cannot have any variable as size in array declaration statement. Hope it helps! Thanks for A2A Happy Coding!! :)
