How is sizeof() an operator but not a function? Can you give source code for it?
Its an operator because implementing the sizeof() specification requiresÂ  language support. It is a language primitive. There is no other C language primitive from which you can generate the equivalent behavior with respect to the following - scope: sizeof is a compile-time operation ( except in case of variable length arrays, where it evaluates at runtime. ) - access to metadata: sizeof operates on datatypes either directly or by inferring it from the operand. - syntax: sizeof doesn't require its types to be enclosed within paranthesis It can be implemented as a function only if could be expressed in terms of other language primitives
