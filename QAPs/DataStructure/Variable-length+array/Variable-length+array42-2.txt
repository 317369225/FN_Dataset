Why didn't Go (programming language) follow the C language style?
Go is syntactically loosely derived from C and if you are talking  about syntax style of Go being different than C in some cases then it was a deliberate decision by Go creators and the thought behind it is given here - Go's Declaration Syntax. It is a OOP language (check this article to confirm - Is Go an Object Oriented language? : spf13.com )with  garbage collection, some dynamic-typing capabilities, variable-length arrays and key-value maps additionally provided and is designed to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. Go also provides a way to handle concurrency in a more elegant way.
