Why do only character arrays end with a null character? Why not integer arrays?
Thanks for the A2A. Let me try to clarify in the context of C language. All character arrays are not null terminated. Strings are special character arrays which are null terminated. As I explain to my students, all strings are character arrays but all character arrays are not strings (i.e., null terminated character arrays). char x[3]={'a','b','c'}; is a perfectly valid character array which is NOT null terminated and therefore, cannot be printed as a string. The null termination is only a trick used in C to allow flexible usage of character arrays for storing variable length strings.Â  Character arrays need not end with a null character. I hope this clears your doubt.
