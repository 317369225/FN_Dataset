How is a long integer implemented in python?
Generally, In programming languages like C or C++, the precision of integers is limited by Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) hardware, which typically offers a precision between 8 to 64 bits. However, languages like Python or Ruby have built in support for very big numbers which is not limited by fixed number of binary bits related to the size of the processor register, rather they use variable length array of digits. You can handle such large numbers in C or C++ as well by using concept of handling number digits via arrays. There are various external libraries that implement this behavior. A major drawback, however, is that these operations are not implemented in hardware arithmetic and thus are considerably slower. If you want to have a look at the internals of implementation, start at Include/longobject.h and objects/longobject.c of python source code. As pointed out by Denis, Python implements multiplication using Karatsuba Algorithm. Updated 46w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
