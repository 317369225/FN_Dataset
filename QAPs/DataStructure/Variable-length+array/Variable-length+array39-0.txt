Why is everyone asking questions about C, C++ and JavaScript and not about Fortran?
I would say the provocative answer. FORTRAN in its latest version is a good language! It does well what it is designed to do: It does has modules which are still under discussion for C++. Better than C-include technology of copy paste. It handles multidimensional arrays nicely without the need of pointers of pointers or things like that. It has variable length array as well as allocatable arrays. C has VLA but not C++. Input variable to function can be specified intent(in), intent(out) or intent(inout). The intent(in) is equivalent of const& in C++, the intent(inout) of & but intent(out) has no equivalent in C++. So if a variable is designed to be only for output and not read you cannot specify that your function definition. Input variable can be put optional easily. Like in C++, you can have functions of the type foo(double), foo(int) but you have to be explicit about it by declaring an interface that contains the various version. That is you are explicit and not implicit.In other words the language is a kind of managed language like Python. There is less ways to shoot yourself in the foot than in C/C++. So, the language is not dead but its users have no need to ask questions on forum. The language is still massively used in meteorology/oceanography and related fields. Many low level library such as Lapack are also written in Fortran.
