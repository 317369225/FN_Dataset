What is the best comment to a programmer who is still stuck at C-language (rather than C++)?
Actually the one who should get a comment is you or someone who's under the delusion that C++ is superior/better... It's "horrible" and "sucks" according to Linus Torvalds (RFC Convert builin mailinfo.c to use The Better String Library.) The Linux kernel is completely "stuck" in C and assembly. He believes that Java is horrible too You may find many reasons C++ isn't liked here What are reasons why people dislike C++? Every language has its goods and its bads. Don't expect one to be universal and good in every aspects because nothing is perfect. C++ is good but in some applications Haskell, Prolog, C, C#, Java or some other languages are much easier/better to write or express the idea. Write a math intensive program in matlab, mathematica... and you'll see how easy it is compared to C++. C programmers will wonder why there's still no appearance of some useful features like variable length array, the new initialization type or struct/array assignment in C++14 while they have already available in C since C99. Some features are also introduces into C++ much later than C. Remember the C and C++ committee are different and they decide what they think the best for that language so those languages will continue to evolve although in a separate path
