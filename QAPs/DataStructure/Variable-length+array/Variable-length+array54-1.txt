What's the difference between writing software for Windows and Unix?
Programming in Visual Studio is out of the world in windows but visual studio is not the only thing out there. Let me give you a simple example of coding in python in windows and Unix. I had to install a module called 'paramiko' Unix $pip install paramiko Windows Download package Find out the package is tar.gz and cannot be unarchived in one go. Download new software called peazip. Install it. Use new software twice. Once for .gz and once for .tar open CMD, which is difficult than Unix and traverse to where the package is. run C:\...>python setup.py install Realize python classpath is not set. Do it. Error installing because it freaking needs visual studio 8 and pycrypto. Install Visual Studio 8 and do everything for pycryto. There are more steps based on errors. But you get the point. EDIT: it has been brought to my attention that there are software available to alleviate this pain. Hope its good. Updated 121w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
