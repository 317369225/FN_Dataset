Why is malloc used in this C code? What is the use of it anyway?
Like David Brower said, you can use a dynamic array in c99. Also, this code has a Memory leak in that the "x" array isn't freed - a free(x); should be used in main() before its return 0;. If this is a class assignment, it should be docked points because of the memory leak.Â  In production code, any type of memory leak is a bug.
