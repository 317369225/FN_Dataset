My interviewer asked me what is there In C which is not in C++ and then he said if C++ includes all the features of C then why on the earth we teach C??
Great answers (mostly), I'd add that with C, you can tell at a glance what every line of code does and costs. There's virtually no abstraction (other than functions) from what you see on the screen. OO hides some of the complexity and verbosity of C, but the cost is obscurity. In other words, given a code snippet, it's possible to infer most of the underlying machine ops in C, that's simply not possible with OO languages.
