How can I make an array with variable size in the C language?
You can only do that in C99 variable-length arrays void somefunc(int size){    int vla[size];    // do something with vla}  // vla is automatically destroyed when out of scope Note that the arrays are created in stack so you need to take care about the length, otherwise stackoverflow will occur. Before C99 you need to use malloc and free to allocate and delete memory explicitly. int *vla = malloc(size*sizeof(int)); In some compilers you can use alloca to achieve the exact result as C99's VLA but it must be used with care Why is alloca not considered good practice?
