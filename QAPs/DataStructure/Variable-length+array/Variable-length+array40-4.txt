What are the differences between C and C++? Which one should I learn first?
You asked me about C and C++ and where to start. The first thing you should know is C stands for Creativity. Code is something you learn in order to create things. C is very good for this since you have no limits in what you can create with it. You at least want this ability. When you learn just one way to do something, you are limited in solving problems or making things that don't fit that way you learned. People often learn best by trying out different ways of doing things. C is a language that gives you plenty of room to reshape the computer's capabilities to do the things you had in mind. As you try different things, you go down various paths that collectively lead towards being better at writing code. In between C and C++, you are going to learn this thing called algorithms. One thing you will deal with a lot in computers is lists of information. Sometimes you need to rearrange this list. Many techniques exist to rearrange lists and search them to find a needle in a haystack. That is where C++ comes in because you can repeat techniques others lecture about in a book or you can apply those techniques in a smarter way. C++ stands for Creative Code Technique. That is one of the reasons why there are 3 letters in C++. As you find your way with code, eventually you may want better structure. C++ contains features for pulling in different techniques and ways to organize programs. Algorithms in C++ is one of these features that allow you to use some of them in a consistent way. With that, you have now transitioned from the wide creativity in C to the structured focus available in C++. C and C++ are similar in that they both allow you to reshape the machine to your needs. You can go much further with C because it is can be more compact whereas your focus in C++ tends to be the type of structure you want to use. Sometimes the difference matters, but in most cases it does not. You can learn and use one without learning the other. A lot of people do. That may not be an option in some larger C++ applications. If you are going to understand both, start with C so you are comfortable combining the two when needed. ----------------------------------- Related Quora Discussions Why is C++ so hard?
