What are the benefits and necessities of having object in heap?
In C and C++, there are several reasons to use the heap instead of putting all data on the stack. First, the heap is necessary when you want an object to outlive the scope of your method or function. If you can only use stack for your data, any objects created by a function will disappear as soon as it returns, so to preserve the results you will need to put them in some preallocated areas on the stack, which can be quite complex if your data is not trivial. Another reason is that historically C and C++ did not have variable length arrays, so working with stack-based data of varying length was difficult, it was much more easy to allocate it on the heap.
