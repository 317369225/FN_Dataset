What are the benefits and necessities of having object in heap?
The question is actually quite sensible. The problem of the heap is all about having the allocation and deallocation done correctly. The stack is much better in that the compiler knows where to allocate and where to deallocate. The use of C++ objects with the automatic call to destructors is actually an attempt to have stack-like behavior for objects. I think this is a good style and that one can actually completely avoid the pointers and so (apparently) use only the stack. The problem is that the stacksize is usualy limited. Another problem is that all the variables have to be put as reference argument, i.e. No global variables. But this can be viewed as good style.
