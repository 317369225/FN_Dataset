Why didn't Go (programming language) follow the C language style?
What do you mean by C language style? Go is clearly strongly influenced by C. It is also different from C in significant ways.  Most obviously, the declaration syntax is different, and is much like that in Pascal.  This is because the C syntax is, frankly, confusing. Here is a C declaration for v: int (*((*v)(int)))(int); Here is a Go declaration that declares v the same way: var v func(int) func(int) In both cases v is declared as a pointer to a function that, when called with an int argument, returns a function pointer that, when called with an int argument, returns an int.  I think many C programmers would struggle to understand the C declaration.  Any Go programmer can understand the Go declaration.  Go changed the declaration syntax from C in order to improve it.
