Why do people still use C when they have C++?
They are different languages. C++ is not a superset of C. They evolve in different paths and the standard commitees for C and C++ are also different. There are things in C that are not exist in C++ like variable-length array and complex numbers. Conversely things like objects, templates, standard libraries... are not supported in C. There are far more different points that you can find here Compatibility of C and C++ In embedded systems and system programming, C is still the main language because you typically don't need objects there but more direct interface to hardward and low level things. Moreover you have more strict time requirements in critical code and low memory capacity available. Imagine how would you store a bunch of data overhead for C++ objects in a few hundred bytes of RAM in microcontrollers? Linux kernel is all written in C (probably because Linus thinks that C++ is a horrible language) [And Java too] Read more What are the fundamental differences between C and C++?
