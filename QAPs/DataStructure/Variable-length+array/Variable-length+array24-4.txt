How can I prove to my friend who says that pointers on C++ is a useless topic that he is wrong?
Pointers aren't useless, although you may not need them as much in C++ as you do in C. For instance, if you want to pass a variable into a function, and you want its value to be modified, there's no need to use pointers, you can just pass by reference: void multiplyByTwo(int &x) {   x = 2*x;}int a = 2;multiplyByTwo(a); In C, you would have to pass by pointers. You need to modify the value at a particular memory address: void multiplyByTwo(int *x) {   *x = (*x)*2;}int a = 2;multiplyByTwo(&a); One way pointers are used in C++ is to allocate dynamic memory like this: say you want to declareÂ  a variable length array: int n;cin >> n;int * array = new int[n]; However, you can do this with STL vectors too... so, Pointers in themselves are not useless, but in C++ you may not need them as much
