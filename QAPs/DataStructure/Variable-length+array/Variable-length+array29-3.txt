How is sizeof() an operator but not a function? Can you give source code for it?
Here is an implementation of own sizeof: there are two methods ........ 1) #include<stdio.h>   #define MYSIZEOF(X) ((X*)0 +1) int main() {         printf ("%d", MYSIZEOF(int));         return 0; } 2) #define my_sizeof(type) (char *)(&type+1)-(char*)(&type) int main() { double x; printf("%d", my_sizeof(x)); getchar(); return 0; } You can also implement using function instead of macro, but function implementation cannot be done in C as C doesn’t support function overloading and sizeof() is supposed to receive parameters of all data types. Note that above implementation assumes that size of character is one byte. Time Complexity: O(1) Space Complexity: O(1) I think it is enough to u fr understand what is sizeof and hiw its wrking
