What are the benefits and necessities of having object in heap?
Heap and stack are built for two basically different functions Heap - keeps the global variables and the arrays Stack - keeps the method calls and local variables Why? Heap - Â it is easier to traverse , modify & gives output in constant time. The memory is not affected by operations. Stack- It is a last in first out (LIFO) structure, so for eg. You have a nested function call... The innermost function will execute, but then it will leave the stack. You can not call the same instance of the function again. Similarly for local variables, once you are out of the scope.. The variables leave the stack. Hence for better traversal and storage, you need a heap
