Is a pointer to an array really a useless feature of C?
Huh? This can only be stated by someone who has learned C but has little experience in programming it. A pointer to the first element? You can think of an array as a pointer to pointers to data types. It can be used to sort data by changing only the pointers and not the data. It can be used to return variable length data, or even variable length sets of data where one row has more elements than another. I guessing your source would say that technically that is not an array. But in reality that is exactly the power of pointers in C that you can treat a set of 3D coordinates as an linear array of points, as planes of 2D points, or true 3D points for example. Then you can consider an array of pointers where the last element is NULL signifying the end. Now any routine can easily handle variable sized of variably numbered sets of data.
