Int a [n] is this a valid declaration of array in c ie the subscript is not a number?
Yes variable size array declaration is not valid in either C or C++. from this link : Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Variable-length automatic arrays are allowed in ISO C99, and as an extension GCC accepts them in C90 mode and in C++. These arrays are declared like any other automatic arrays, but with a length that is not a constant expression. The storage is allocated at the point of declaration and deallocated when the block scope containing the declaration exits. As said by Gobind Deep Singh and Ajay Choudhary the array size must be actually constant expression only and hence we should know it's value before only . It works fine ,but if variable is not initialized then it may try to access some restricted memory which may give segmentation fault. To avoid this you can always use malloc or calloc function in C and new operator in C++ to allocate memory dynamically using pointers.
