How do I create an array in C which keeps increasing in size as and when needed?
When you say "increasing in size as and when needed ", you essentially mean dynamic memory allocation. One solution to the problem, if you need arrays is to use repetitive doubling to allocate a new array of double the size, and copy the contents to the new array when you need the increased size. It can be proved that this has an amortized cost, in running time, of O(1). On a side note, This technique is quite popular, with both python lists and STL vector using similar methods.
