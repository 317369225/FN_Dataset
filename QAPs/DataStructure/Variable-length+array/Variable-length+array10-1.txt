Can we say "C++ is super set of C"?
It probably was originally because C++ was compiled by translating it to C first. Once it became a language in its own right incompatibilities started creeping in. It is a "functional" superset in that everything you can do in C you can do in C++ too (without having to do a lot of translation work).
