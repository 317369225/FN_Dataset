How do I create an array in C which keeps increasing in size as and when needed?
There is no specific way to allocate dynamic memory in C directly. But you can always use functions like malloc(), calloc(). These are the library functions. Vectors can be used in C too! But specifically, c++ compiler should be used for that. For more information, this could help- http://www.programiz.com/c-progr...
