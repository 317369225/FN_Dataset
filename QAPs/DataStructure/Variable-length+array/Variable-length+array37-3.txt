Why do we need arrays when we have vectors in C++?
The beauty of the C++ language is that you can use it in many different ways, at many different levels. You can use it as a portable assembler, and you can use it like a high-level language. The first reason why we need of arrays is actually the need to inter-operate with (mostly) legacy C code. It's not efficient to always have to allocate memory from the heap when you call functions from the standard libraries; a char array would be OK to be allocated on the stack (if it's small enough and its lifetime is small enough as well). You need it to define structures with well known dimensions. For example, if you want to have a string or a vector of ints, and you need to pass a structure that contains all the data (for example you want to pass it over a network stream), it's way easier to have all the data in one place and drop it directly to the wire than to collect all the data from fragmented memory space. This is probably one of those things that make the language so efficient and so flexible.
