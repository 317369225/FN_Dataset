How do I create an array in C which keeps increasing in size as and when needed?
You've got a "chicken and egg problem" here.  If you don't know how big the array is in advance, you can't "increase its size" without some sort of dynamism.  If you had dynamic memory management, you could use realloc(), or you could write your own "dynamic" memory manager using an "allocate once" piece of RAM that you allocate up-front. My guess is this is an embedded device problem?  Often dynamic memory allocation isn't allowed in embedded device programming.  How this is often  done in embedded is you preallocate some static RAM and write a simple memory manager that allows "dynamic" allocation and freeing within this chunk of RAM. Or you just download the source to a tight implementation of malloc() and use that to manage your pre-allocated blob of memory.
