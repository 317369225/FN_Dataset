What is C99 and C11 in C programming?
Well, these are the different standards of C language or more precisely, one can distinguish them based on the roots of the organization or a committee that released or published C. So, the standard C99 is an ISO 9899:1999 version that was a revised C version and denoted as the prime 'C Language'. However, it has was again replaced in 2011 by a higher and more revised standard of C called as C11 (originally C1X) that follows the ISO 9899:2011 standard. C11 stands out to be the current standard for the C programming language and is specified as the 'C Standard Revision'.
