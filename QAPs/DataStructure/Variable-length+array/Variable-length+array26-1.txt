Why does everyone use C with C++?
They're not the same, but very similar. C++ grew out of C.Â  C can be painful to program in and makes it really easy to shoot yourself in the foot. Just by using references and the C++ string libraries you can eliminate an enormous range of potential errors. You can write the rest of the code in almost plain C but you can stop thinking of strings as character arrays. C++ has a lot of these nice libraries that make life easy, which keep you from reinventing the wheel. A lot of the libraries are standardized too so what you've learned in this project will transfer to the next.
