Which C/C++ compiler is used for the Macintosh?
Apple has internal developers working on clang, and one of the reasons that clang has progressed so quickly is because of Apple's support. So the short answer is that clang is the best compiler on Mac OS X, as well as being the official one. GCC has been usable on OS X in the past, but support has been dying off steadily. It's quite difficult to use GCC on the Mac anymore due to binary incompatibilities with the default system libraries. There are still a few non-standard GCC extensions that don't work on clang (I've heard certain types of variable length arrays and OpenMP mentioned), so you might be forced to get GCC working if you need one of these. Try to avoid this. Apple's native development environment is the Xcode IDE. It is built on top of clang. It is available free of charge, and is powerful enough that you should probably be using it by default.
