Are all programming languages based on C?
C is a very popular low-level programming language that has been used to replace Assembly Language and teach programming to advanced Computer Science Students. It is extremely useful, and is the inspiration behind countless other languages, including C++, Java, C#, and Objective-C. There is no doubt that C is very influential. It is not, however, the base of all programming languages.Â  The curly-bracket syntax coined by C is shared by many other languages such as php, javascript, and perl. However, there is a class of languages that existed even before C did, and does not use that syntax. For example, BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL, PASCAL, and many other such languages were around a long time before C even existed, and also have a very different syntax and programming style.
