Is it necessary to make an int pointer (int *p) to point to an int and a char pointer (char *p) to point to a string?
Pointers are dependent types which support the following operations: Linear arithmetic - you can or subtract a value from a pointer, or subtract two pointers. The unit value is the size of the pointee type. Dereference - get the value at the address in the pointer, with the required pointee type This means that if an int is 4 bytes and an int* is incremented, the pointer points to the next int and not the next byte. In other words, the address inside the pointer is incremented by sizeof(int) when you increment the pointer itself by one. Also, dereferencing an int* gives an int value, dereferencing a char* gives a char value and so on. Therefore you can see that pointers are actually parametric or generic types whose behavior depends on the type of the pointee tyoe
