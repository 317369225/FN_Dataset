How can I prove to my friend who says that pointers on C++ is a useless topic that he is wrong?
There are two different issues with pointers: 1. Whether passing by reference or passing by value is better. Answer: There is always a need for both depending on the situation. 2. Whether a pointer that references a direct memory address is a good thing or not. This is the C++ pointer debate. On #2, there are benefits, mainly speed and machine control, and drawbacks, mainly programmer productivity and complex software stability. Because computers are fast enough, the pendulum has swung towards placing a premiumÂ  productivity and stability, which is why the world has moved to dynamic memory-managed pointers as in Java, python, ruby, and other languages.
