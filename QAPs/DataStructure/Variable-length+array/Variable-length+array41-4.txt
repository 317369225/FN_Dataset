I really, really want to learn to code. However, upon taking classes and practicing (in C), I realized that I hate the whole process of programming (debugging, constant unclear/ambiguous errors, confusing logic). What can I do to get over this?
First of all, you're starting at the deep end of the pool, just so you know. C is not an easy language for beginners. I would not recommend it for any beginner, particularly because it has you messing around with addresses and memory almost immediately, and unless you understand the memory model it's using, you're not going to know up from down. Secondly, C fools a lot of beginners, because it looks like the kind of language that would hold your hand, but it really doesn't. It wasn't designed for that. In fact, I suggest to people who want to learn C that they learn assembly language first, because that really teaches you what C is doing under the covers. Just a guess, but you might do better starting with a programming environment like Scratch, Python, or Scheme, until you get comfortable with the idea of programming, and then you might want to go back to C at some point. One of the hurdles I had to get over when I first started programming was understanding that each construct I was using was itself a boilerplate procedure of some sort. Each one went through one or more steps that I could not see, but it was predictable. I just had to figure out what it did. I also had to learn to stop seeing code in a literalist fashion, look at what each construct was actually doing, and then see what desirable effects it had that I could use to my advantage in figuring out how to construct things in such a way that the computer would do what I wanted.
