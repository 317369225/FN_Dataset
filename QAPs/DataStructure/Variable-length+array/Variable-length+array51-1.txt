Which best IDE for c++ for windows code block or visual c++ 2015?
It really depends on what platform you're on. If you're on Windows, Visual Studio is a *fantastic* IDE for C/C++. In my opinion the best. It has debugger visualizations for C++ standard library and tr1 data structures. What this means is that you can hover over a std::map or std::tr1::unordered_map (or any standard library/tr1 data structure) and it will show you a list of key-value pairs which are in the map or unordered_map very neatly. To the bets of my knowledge no other IDE does this as well (or at all). It's also made a lot better by plugins like Visual Assist X. However, VS and plugins cost a lot of money. Some people also think VS has a somewhat high learning curve, but I personally disagree with that. Any IDE takes a bit of time to get used to; you just have to live with that. I will admit however that it takes a more clicks to get a project up and running in VS than in other IDEs. However, if you're working on a project that's large enough to merit an IDE, it's really negligible. If you're on Mac, XCode is the best IDE for C/C++ that I've used. It has all the features you'd expect from an IDE, and needs 0 setup. If you're on Linux, there are a few alternatives which are Linux specific (KDevelop, etc.) but I find them to be pretty horrible. As for cross platform IDEs for C++, Eclipse with CDT is decent. It does everything you expect from an IDE as well. However, on Mac, Eclipse itself sort of sucks, so I don't use it unless I have good reason to (since XCode is free and better, I don't). On Windows eclipse takes a bit of setup - you need to install mingw compilers, etc. On Linux, it just works, and is the best option you have. NetBeans falls pretty much into the same category as eclipse - I just prefer eclipse because I use it for other stuff. There's aslo the Qt IDE. I haven't used it much, but I found it to be inferior to XCode on Mac as a generic C++ IDE. I've never done any Qt programming, so it might do that really well.
