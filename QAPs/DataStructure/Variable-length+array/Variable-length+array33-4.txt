What are common programming errors or "gotchas" in C++?
Not providing a deep copy constructor and assignment operator. not marking member functions as const. Giving same name to member variables and function parameters, causing the local variable getting updated instead of class member. Marking utility functions members of class, that too non-static. Confusing between pass by value/reference/pointer. Not checking pointers for NULL. Assuming that a function need not check the arguments, as the caller has already done it :) Leaving some control paths that do not return a value. like, bool f(int i) {    if (i > 10) {  return false;  } } Defining variables inside a stitch case, without putting them in a {block} Not paying attention to signed and unsigned. usigned i = 0; --i; causes goosebumps Doing #include instead of forward declarations in header file. using namespace XXX; in header file. Defining global functions in header file. //Will add more
