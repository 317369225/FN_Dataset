Is the alignment of variable length arrays standardized in C99/C11?
No, standard C says nothing about the alignment of VLAs (other than, of course, it can't be weaker than the alignment of the element type). As of C11, we have alignas, so you can make it as strict as you want. Also, most compilers allow the use of alignof with expressions in C even if the standard forbids it, so you can find out what it is in your cases. Example: #include <stdio.h>#include <stdalign.h>int main(int ac, char **av){    char a[ac];    printf("alignment of this VLA is %zu\n", alignof(a));        alignas(64) char b[ac];    printf("alignment of this VLA is %zu\n", alignof(b));} demo: gcc (prints 1 and 64) Coliru Viewer clang (prints 1 and 64) Coliru Viewer
