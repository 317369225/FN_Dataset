What is the advantage of using zero-length arrays in C?
The variable length array is very useful for dynamic structure size and its only use is memory saving. You can always allocate some memory dynamically but you would need an additional pointer to point to this chunk of memory. One has to be very careful when using the flexible arrays. There are some very easy to mess up gotchas. For example, *a = *b; would only copy the non-flexble portion of the structure. The flexible array would not be copied. Also, sizeof would only give you the length of the non-flexible portion of the structure. When using the flexible length array, you should always provide your own "sizeof" and "copy" functions. C++ does not support flexible arrays.
