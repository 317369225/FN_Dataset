Why does everyone use C with C++?
Although C came first, the way C++ was developed, C is a subset of C++.  A C program is a C++ program, and would compile with a C++ compiler.  A C++ program would not compile with a C compiler. C++ was originally a set of add on changes on top of C to allow OOP and some other higher level techniques that you could not originally do in C. I work on a system that is nominally written in C++, we use a C++ compiler, we have classes/objects and member functions and we use inheritance etc, but the basic code I write which will reside inside a C++ method is exactly the same as C code I wrote when we worked in C. In fact we moved from C->C++ as we needed multiple instances of our data/code and all we did was combine our data and relevant functions in to classes, we didn't need to change the operation of the code at all.
