In what cases is Java slower than C++ by a big margin?
In my areas of machine learning and high performance computing, where there are a lot of matrix and vector computations, the biggest speed gain from C++ vs. managed language (JVM or .NET) is the ability to write SIMD code using SSE/AVX instructions or CUDA/OpenCL (if you program to run on GPUs). That alone can easily speed up the program 4-8 times (without GPUs) [1]. Normally, our team write these computationally-intensive tasks in C and keep the high-level logic in C#/F#. Besides the benefit of SIMD instructions, we haven't observed significant perf hit due to garbage collection or inlining, etc. Believe me, those GCs are highly optimized. As a point for reference, we benchmarked our linear learner written in C# (with C code for vector operations) against highly-tuned packages written 100% in C++ (e.g. Vowpal Wabbit or LibLinear). For identical algorithm and settings, we observed that our implementation is on par with those packages, speed wise [2]. Side notes [1] A little of the perf benefit also comes from the ability to bypass bounds checking when iterating through arrays. [2] Of course, we also implemented better algorithms (in addition to canonical ones), which result in much better overall performance. See this paper, figure 5. Updated 43w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
