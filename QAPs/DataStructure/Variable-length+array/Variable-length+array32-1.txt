How does a structure differ from an array in c programming?
Well, for starters an array is a collection of homogeneous items ... like an array of ints, chars, etc. But a structure can be a collection of heterogeneous items like ... struct A {  int item_1;  char* item_2;  double item_3;}; And once you have defined a struct you cannot add more items to it. But with arrays, you can add more items by dynamic allocation using realloc, malloc, dealloc, etc. One plus point about structs you can define bit fields, e.g. struct packed_struct {  unsigned int f1:10;  unsigned int f2:1;  unsigned int f3:80;};
