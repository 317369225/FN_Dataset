Why i am getting "Runtime Error(SIGSEGV)" in codechef, while it works perfectly in my local system?
You are using VLA (variable length array) which is not standardized in c++. arr[n] is the object in question. It was standard in c99 but was made optional again in C11 due to its nuisances. An array in c++ should have the bounds defined at compile time. The reason you are getting the runtime error is because n is not initialized when arr[n] is declared. This is undefined behavior. (Using VLA is implementation dependent). I would strongly suggest switching to vector. For the purpose of solving your problem just move this line int arr[n] below the point where you are taking input for n.
