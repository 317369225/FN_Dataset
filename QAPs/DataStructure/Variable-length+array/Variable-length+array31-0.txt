My interviewer asked me what is there In C which is not in C++ and then he said if C++ includes all the features of C then why on the earth we teach C??
HI, Interview questions are designed to make you question your current understanding and defend a belief, they are also designed to test your ability to communicate a concept effectively. C came first, and C++ was an attempt to address some of the tougher concepts that newer programming students were not understanding. C++ is an OO language, meaning that it requires a shift in thinking as a developer. This shift moves away from the lower level API programming into a realm of objects and SOLID principles. I wont go into the symantics of each individual feature difference, other than to say that C and C++ should be treated as very differnt languages, and there is not a lot in C++ that cannot be done in C, except that you would have to re-write the frameworks that C++ gives you to achieve the same thing. ( you can find a simple comparison here Differences Between C and C++ ) On the flip side of that, is C is very good for embedded systems, where extensive frameworks are not common and low level hardware specific features are needed, with the 'bloat' of a fully fledged generic framework. I hope this helps, if so, share the love and upvote ;-)
