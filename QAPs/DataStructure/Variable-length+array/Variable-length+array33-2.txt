What are common programming errors or "gotchas" in C++?
One of the gotchas that caught me off guard when I started to program in C++ many years ago, was the initialization list ordering during construction of an object. When you construct an object, you use the initialization list to construct its member variables that don't have a default constructor. However, the ordering in which they are constructed is based on the order in which you defined them in your class, rather then the order you specify them in the init list. This can lead to great confusion and sometimes to crashes if you have dependencies between those members. For example if your class has two members of type A, B. and you declare A in your class before you declare B. If A's constructor accepts a B object (as a pointer for example) then you'll be in trouble regardless of the fact that in your initialization list you initialize B before A.
