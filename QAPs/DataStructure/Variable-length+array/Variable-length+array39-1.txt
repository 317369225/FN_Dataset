Why is everyone asking questions about C, C++ and JavaScript and not about Fortran?
No, it is not a dead language. But nowadays it is a niche language with a relatively small user base. It is a straightforward, easy-to-use, high-level language. Not the easiest but certainly up there with Pascal and BASIC. In addition its users are mostly smart, well-educated people who understand it well. As a result they don't need to ask many questions. Even when they do need to ask, they are more likely to ask a colleague than to ask random strangers on the Internet because they are more likely to find a knowledgeable colleague than a knowledgeable stranger. In contrast C, C++ and Javascript are relatively widespread, difficult, low-level languages and have a lot of "wannabe" learners without a support network of knowledgeable colleagues. So they try to replace that with random strangers on the Internet. That is why "everyone" on the Internet is asking questions about C, C++, Javascript, etc. and not FORTRAN.
