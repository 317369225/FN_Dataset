Why do we need arrays when we have vectors in C++?
You have to define what you mean by these terms. Sometimes they mean different things. Technically, what most programming languages call "vectors" aren't vectors. A vector isn't just a one-dimensional array. It's a one-dimensional array that transforms according to various rules. To put it another way, it's a one-dimensional tensor, or a tensor of rank one. Often in programming languages, what they call vectors provide a lot of features that arrays do not, such as the ability to change the number of elements. A lot of the time, however, these are unnecessary, and the overhead of element access is undesirable.
