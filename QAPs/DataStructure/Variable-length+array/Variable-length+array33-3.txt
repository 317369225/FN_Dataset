What are common programming errors or "gotchas" in C++?
The order of elements in initializer lists doesn't affect the actual order of initialization (instead, the order follows how variables were declared in the class): class sundae {      ice_cream flavor_;      topping topping_; public:     sundae(const topping& t)         : topping_(t), flavor(topping_)     {} };  Calling a function without parentheses returns the address of the function, rather than actually calling the function. Function arguments and subexpressions aren't evaluated in any particular order; with subexpressions, this happens regardless of association or parentheses.
