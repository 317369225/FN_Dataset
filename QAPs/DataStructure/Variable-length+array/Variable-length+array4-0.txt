To what extent is C a subset of C++?
There are numerous differences between C and C++, most of which are minor. I won't list them here because you can already find lists of them online. Instead I'll mention a few features in C that have no direct equivalent in C++: hexadecimal floating point constants type-generic expressions compound literals restrict-qualified pointers variable-length arrays static array parameters designated initializersIn C++, I suggest the following features as (more complicated) alternatives for some of the above: overloaded functions and function templates for type-generic expressions constructors for compound literals std::vector for variable-length arrays
