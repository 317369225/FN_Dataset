If I have a string array in a free Pascal card = array [1..52] of string, how can I remove one member of the array so that I have an array of 51 articles?
You can't. You would have to create a new array of 51 items and copy all but the one item over using a for loop or similar. More reasonable is to keep a separate integer variable that tells you how many items are in your array, and delete an item from the array by copying over the deleted item with the next item in a loop from the deleted item to the number of items in the array (given by your variable) minus one. You can clear the last item in the array that is redundant if you like to keep things tidy. Then take 1 from your integer variable because you are now using one less in the array than you have the capacity to use. In this way you can define an array up front that is larger than what you need initially, and have similar functions for inserting as well as deleting to avoid continually redefining arrays. There are many other more sophisticated ways of dealing with this problem such as indexes, binary trees, pointers (in C and similar languages) and head/tail stuff in functional languages. But that's a good place to start.
