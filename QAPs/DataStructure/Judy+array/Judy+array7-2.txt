Who is your favorite author(s) and why?
My favorite authors 1. Norman Vincent Peale Ever felt like you don't want to live anymore? Ever felt like you have no hope left in life? Ever felt like life challenges are too hard on you. You want advice? But yet no lectures. Here it is Stay Alive All Your Life (1957) Why Some Positive Thinkers Get Powerful Results (1987) Six Attitudes for Winners The Power of Positive Thinking for Young People It saved me from suicide it will save you too. 2. Dale Canergie I loved debates, I loved talking to people, I wanted to be a public relations officer. But what I lacked was guidance. Here his books were bible for me. They are your best agony aunts. 1915: Art of Public Speaking 1934: Little Known Facts About Well Known People 1936: How to Win Friends and Influence People. 1937: Five Minute Biographies. 1944: Dale Carnegie's Biographical round-up 1948: How to Stop Worrying and Start Living. 3. Agatha Christie When I was in my teens, I had this enormous appetite for suspense thrillers. The first book that I read was "Murder on the Orient Express". The lion got it's taste of blood. There was no stopping me. I finished the Hercule Poirot series and Miss Marple series.Agatha never ceased to surprise me. Never ever. 4. Robin Cook The man that you see in the picture is the famous Robin Cook. I always had interest in Biology yet I couldn't muster courage to become a doctor. His books take me through the mind of a medical student, a surgeon, paediatrician, ophthalmologist and what not. The books give a deep insight of medical practices and crises. Very thrilling, strong story line, unpredictability at its best, strong female protagonist. Year of the Intern (1972), Coma (1977), Sphinx (1979), Brain (1981), Fever (1982), Godplayer (1983), Mindbend (1985), Outbreak (1987), Mortal Fear (1988), Mutation (1989), Harmful Intent (1990), Vital Signs (1991), Blindsight (1992), Terminal (1993), Fatal Cure (1994), Contagion (1995)Read all of them. YES ALL OF THEM! 5. Paulo Coelho How can a girl not mention Paulo Coelho as her favorite writer. If there is a man who knows women inside out, it is him. He knows what women think, react, believe about love, life, relationships, ambitions. I got my hands first on The Alchemist, believe me I wrote it's quote in a copy. Then Brida, Veronica decides to die, Zahir, I sat next to River Piedra and wept, Eleven Minutes, Winners stand alone, The fifth mountain, Light of a warrior, the Witch of Portobello, and I am still reading. He magnificently portrays emotions.
