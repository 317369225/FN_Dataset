Who is your favorite author(s) and why?
As my most favourite author, J.K Rowling has already been mentioned, I'll move on to the others: 1.Erich Segal. This man has moved me like no other and ignited in me an undying love for romance. He is an exceptional romance writer and surpasses the current ones by leaps and bounds. 'Love Story' and 'Man, Woman and Child' are among his most popular books. 2. Elif Shafak Another one would be Elif Shafak, a Turkish author inspired heavily by Sufism. Her works are purely esoterical and leaves you gasping for air. Her best books are 'The Bastard of Istanbul,' 'The Forty Rules of Love' and 'Honour.' 3. Jane Austen She will always be my first love, especially among classic novelists. She understands women like no one can and you can't resist swooning over her badass heroines and gorgeous men in cravats. 4. John Green  Cuz' all of me  wants all of him. His sensitive side is perfectly reflected in his works and he has managed to touch millions of lives with his simplistic writing style and plots dealing with real-life issues. Other authors I admire are Jodi Picoult, Dale Carnegie, Dan Brown, Emily Bronte, Charles Dickens and Sir Shakespeare. Thank you, for the A2A, Asutosh Padhy.
