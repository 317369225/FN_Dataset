Which is better, "Java for Dummies" or "Head First Java"?
Very much depends on your aptitude and style, both are good books.  I personally think the 'dummies' books over simplify, which slows me down. The book that finally made it all make sense to me was Core Java Core Java Web Page Its actually a series, not a single book... But I was glad I read it. I thought it had a very nice balance of readability, and technical detail.  Never too hard or too soft.   However I came in with programming skill in other languages, if you're brand new, it might not be the right one for you. Hope that helps.
