Which is better, "Java for Dummies" or "Head First Java"?
Head first Java is really not bad. But personally i prefer a very old book by Judy Bishop called Java Gently. I will explain why.. there are tonnes of programmers out there but not all are CS graduated. I will not even consider data scientist near to know CS. So in CS, the algorithm and fundalmentals are strongly based on maths and understanding how for example, array works behind the maths, data type structure and characteristics and their limitations. So in a way, it is computer scientist and not programmer. By understanding the core fundalmental, picking up a programming language is easy. So there is a very thick line difference and i will encourage some one who is about to start programming, ignore the fanciful UI, web, android etc. Java gently covers the necessary fundalmental in a very introductory manner. Before going advance. Both Head first and Java for dummies were written by programmers to get you a quick start. But the core fundalmental understanding were not illustrated. Quick start or start well and be a professional. Your choice dude.
