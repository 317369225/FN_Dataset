Who is your favorite author(s) and why?
You are an evil person! making people choose one favorite author *sigh* Charles Dickens(NO answer of mine, containing the words 'favorite author', can go without the mention of his name) Now, I can peacefully move on with my answer. Almost all the books that I read, make me fall in love with the author, but owing to the longevity of our relationship, as an author and reader, I am going to go with  Ruskin Bond. He was one of the first people who got me started on the wonderful journey of reading. The way he describes the scenery, sets an atmosphere of homeliness, and then effuses the emotion of the protagonist into you. The 'rusty' series starting with The Room On The Roof was a constant companion in the pre-facebook and pre-quora era. But more than his novels, are his short stories, which have kept generations hooked! His short stories, almost always have a pleasant or shocking twist in the end, similar to Roald Dahl's short stories. These stories talk about love, respect, sadness, shame,happiness and almost all the feelings that mankind has ever felt, in a very articulate manner. His stories are mostly, like several other authors, biographical in nature. Most of his works are influenced by life in the hill stations at the foothills of the Himalayas, where he spent his childhood.So we get to hear the perspective of an Anglo-Indian who was brought up in Dehradun by his grandmother after his father died in the pre-independence Era. Isn't it an interesting perspective? Above all, Ruskin Bond, as a person, is as good as he is a writer. -He has adopted the family of the domestic help that he had. -He always greets his readers warmly, either when they pester him to sign a  book, or if you visit his place to have a chat:D (He does grant this wish too)
