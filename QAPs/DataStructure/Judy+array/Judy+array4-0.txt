What's a full, coherent, artistically sound array of plants I can have in my yard that won't be jeopardized by all the deers?
You need to grow a fence of barbed wire flowers. A bit thorny but stops deer. Joking apart a hedge of mixed holly varieties looks great, plain leaves, yellow leaves and variegated all mixed together.
