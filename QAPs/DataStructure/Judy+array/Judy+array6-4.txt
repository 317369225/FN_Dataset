Who is the greatest music legend alive today?
It's a very debatable topic, and a number of names instantly flashed through my mind: B.B. King At the age of 89, he is still performing. He is one of the biggest names in Blues music, and he is also an accomplished guitarist. Hundreds of musicians across different genres grew up listening to him, and many would die to get a chance to collaborate with him. Paul McCartney Of course, Paul earned a great amount of respect for his career in The Beatles as one half of arguably the best singer-songwriter collaboration, ever, but his solo career has also been stellar. Till date, he keeps on releasing consistently great materials, and he is one of the most well known names in the music industry. Ozzy Osbourne Black Sabbath was formed in 1968, and they are still going great. They are set to release their 20th album, and all through this 46 year journey, Ozzy Osbourne has been an integral part of the band. He might seem crazy, or even delusional to many, but he has created awesome music, and he still rocks. Others have mentioned Stevie Wonder and Bob Dylan who are also noteworthy. Mick Jagger, while not a personal favorite, also holds his ground as one of the founders of Rolling Stones. Other honorable mentions: Eric Clapton Santana Kenny Rogers Paul Simon Cliff Richard Chuck Berry Roger Waters David Gilmore Mark Knopfler Jimmy Page Robert Plant Phil Collins See how difficult it is to single out one person from this list?
