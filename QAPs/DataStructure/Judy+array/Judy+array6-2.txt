Who is the greatest music legend alive today?
Stevie Wonder. In fact, five of his albums from the 1970s are among the best American popular music ever created. Talking Book, Songs in the Key of Life, Innervisions, Fulfillingness' First Finale and The Secret Life of Plants are so far above almost anything released during that era that had Wonder never released another album he would have been considered a legend from those works alone. if you are talking about a top five list of greatest music legends who are still alive, if the list has any meaning Wonder's has to be near, if not at, the top.
