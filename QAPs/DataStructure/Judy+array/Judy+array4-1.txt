What's a full, coherent, artistically sound array of plants I can have in my yard that won't be jeopardized by all the deers?
It depends on where you live. My local nurseries all post signs on plants that say if they are deer resistant. This was true when I lived in Massachusetts and also here in California. Nursery catalogs also talk about plants that are not eaten by deer.
