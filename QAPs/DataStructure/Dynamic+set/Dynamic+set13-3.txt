Can the artificial neural network algorithm be used on a dynamic data set like weather or traffic?Yes they can. Remember that neuromorphic systems (artificial neural networks) are ideally suited to searching huge data streams and locating both simple and complex patterns in the data from the data stream. I have yet to hear of neuromorphic systems being used for weather prediciton; but, that does not mean that it is impossible. Though, I have heard of traffic signals being dynamically operated by neuromorphic systems and such systems are common in Asia. For more information on this topic go to Dr Marco AV Bitetto and chat with Dr. Bitetto. He is more of an expert for your type of question. I would suggest that you get your hands on Dr. Bitetto¡¯s dissertation because it will both provide a starting point of information and also an extensive list of resources that you can consult (in the bibliography) for further answering your question.
