Is there a Python script or way to send a file or two to two different computers that have changing IP addresses (due to using different wifis and dynamic set up)?You're going to need some server or site to get the information to. Store the ips or something. I'd need more info about where they are coming from, the files. A random computer or a server or site? Are you in control of that? If it is a server, you can have the computers pull down the files themselves instead of the other way around.
