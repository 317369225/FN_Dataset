Can the artificial neural network algorithm be used on a dynamic data set like weather or traffic?A bit of intuition though would be useful to formulate the problem properly. Weather data will typically entail measurements from multiple sensors for data such as pressure, humidity, wind direction/average speed etc.. and each such measurement will have a time stamp and a location. The sought for prediction will be something like the temperature/gust/cloudiness etc. at some later time. So typically, the features of the output layer of a neural network for weather prediction will be a subset of the input features (or all of them) just at a later time.
