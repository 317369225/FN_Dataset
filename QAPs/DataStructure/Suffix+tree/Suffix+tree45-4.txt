What are some of the best algorithms?
On an academic level, I'm fascinated with the Fibonacci heap algorithm.  I think its a very ingenious algorithm, props to Fredman and Tarjan.  I also like Fisher–Yates shuffle algorithm. I've been asked twice on interviews the question of how sort a deck of cards so that algorithm has been quite handy! On a practical level, I really like all the bit arithmetic algorithms, I find them quite practical, simple, and clever.  For instance, to find out if a number is a power of two: bool IsPowerOfTwo(uint x) {     return (x & (x - 1)) == 0; } To compute the max without branching: int max(int x, int y){return  x ^ ((x ^ y) & -(x < y));  } Swap two integers in-place: int swap(int x, int y){x = x ^ y;y = x ^ y;x = x ^ y;}
