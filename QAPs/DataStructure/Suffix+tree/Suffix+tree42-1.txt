What data structures are used in codechef questions?
Atleast you should have a basic understanding of data structures like arrays, arraylists, graphs, trees, etc. You should not always take contests on websites like codechef or topcoder like a "do or die" thing. Each time when u encounter something new, u get an opportunity to learn something new. Take it as a process of becoming a full-fledged programmer, by learning new concepts in every competition. Otherwise whats the use of these contests if u r not learning something...
