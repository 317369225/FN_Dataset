Is it possible for alternative algorithms to problems with the same time/space complexity as the previous solutions to get published?
This is definitely possible if your solutionÂ  is a lot simpler to understand for instance. To be publishable it must contribute something new and non trivial. That's perfectly possible without improving asymptotic time/space complexity...
