What data structures are used in codechef questions?
In Questions in CodeChef what is required is not just the Correctness of the code but also the Complexity, both in terms of Time and Space, is considered. Data structures such as Arrays, Sparse Arrays, Linked Lists,Doubly Linked Lists, Binary search Tree, Binary Index Tree, Red Black Tree, Weight Balanced Tree, B Tree, B+ Tree, Binary Heap, Trie, Hash List, Hash Map, Graphs etc are used. Best way to learn all this by checking out the Stanford Videos online. They would really give you an in-depth concept of exactly how and where to use them. You can even go through the wikipedia links of these Data structures to know about the basics and how to use them efficiently and correctly in the code. Eg: This is where I learnt Hash Map from.I found this as the best explanation till date !! There are many more like these to help you with all this !! All the Best !! Keep Learning !!
