Introduction to Algorithms (book):Â Are suffix arrays and suffix trees discussed in CLRS? What are some important concepts which this book does not cover ?
You should read this. :P Answer by the author only. I found some topics missing in the book CLRS by Thomas Cormen, like cuckoo hashing, then from cuts and flows like the minimum cost problem, weighted matching, Hall's theorem and then something like skip lists. Wouldn't it be better if these topics were added to the book? And whatever CLRS is missing doesn't matter, this book is still Bible of programming.
