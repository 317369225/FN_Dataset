What are some good resources on data structures like Tries, Suffix Trees and Suffix Arrays?
A great resource for the same is Steven Skiena's course on Computational Biology [1], which deals with all the data structures mentioned above since it has great number of applications in the field. Lectures 5 and 6 deal with the same. One of the best reference books for the same is Dan Gusfield's book on "Algorithms on Strings, Trees and Sequences: Computer Science and Computational Biology" [2] which covers a wide range of string algorithms. I have also written a couple of posts [3][4] on Tries and Suffix trees. It is pretty basic, but gives you an introduction to the topic. [1] http://www.algorithm.cs.sunysb.e...
