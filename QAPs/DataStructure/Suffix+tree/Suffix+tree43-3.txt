What is the most difficult algorithm you have implemented?
In high-school, maxflow codes, a version of Heavy-light decomposition with a seg-tree, that I thought I was the first to find. In college: An improved algorithm to compute Solid Partitions, which was published in this paper, the iTEBD algorithm to get the ground state for the Ising model.
