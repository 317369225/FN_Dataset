Write an algo to compare two string such that k mismatch are allowed. Suffix Tree?
1. Consider any of the two strings(if the two string don't differ in length by more than 'k') and remove the characters from string A which are not in string B. Now repeat the same for String B.(Remove characters from String B which are not in String A). 2. If number of characters removed >k then set flag=1. Go to Step 5. 3. Now do the sub-string search for the resultant string A. 4. If sub-string search is successful then flag=0, else flag=1. 5. if flag=1 return False(mismatch) else return True(match).
