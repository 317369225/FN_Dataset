What is the coolest data structure?
Splay trees have several really nice properties and open conjectures related to optimality. In particular, splay trees do well on large real world data since they have in built cache-like performance benefits (through splaying). Another data structure that fascinates me is Treap, mostly because of the ease and the neatness with which it can be implemented. Surprisingly in the experiments that I ran on medium level tests (couple million entries) treaps did better than splay trees. Of course queries were random and had no locality which splay trees exploit sweetly. Updated 101w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
