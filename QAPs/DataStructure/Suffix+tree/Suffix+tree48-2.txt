What algorithms should I know to become a good programmer?
Step 1 : Start Step 2 : prepare a new problem Step 3 : think creatively  Step 4 : try to solve with 100%                             attention Step 5 : never quit Step 6 : if answer is not right go to                      step A Step 7 : goto step 2 Step 8 : End Step A : look out for mistakes Step B : take a break for some time Step C : goto step 3 Whichever language you learn, that's the must algorithm which you should learn. After all for programmer logic is what matters and it cannot be mug up through textbook. You have to try and keep trying.
