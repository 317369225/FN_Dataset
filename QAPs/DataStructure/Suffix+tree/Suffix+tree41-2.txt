What's an intuitive explanation on how suffix arrays work?
Suffix array is a data structure. Given a string, if all the suffixes of that string is sorted in ascending order, the resulting array is called a suffix array(it can also be a list). How to construct a suffix array? The naive approach is simple and it is a (n^2 log n) approach. The part in which we can tweek a little is on the sorting part.Since the strings we are sorting are actually part of the original string and not some random strings, we can make use of this and do some ordered fashion sorting(considering characters in powers of 2 and grouping), like first sort based on first two characters, then improve by first four characters and so on, until we reach a length after which all strings are themselves sorted. This approach takes (n log^2 n).[look for sort index in every step which will be used for sorting in the next step. Since we'll be forming tuples of sort index and sort index + 2 and sort based on them]. There are code samples of implementation for this approach. If you can just trace the execution once with an example, you will get it easily.
