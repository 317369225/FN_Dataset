What are all the data structures that you have come to know about? Which of these do you use very frequently?
1) Linked list - most underrated and underused IMO. I've seen many huge perf gains by refactoring core data structures to Link lists 2) Skip list - Easy to implement, threadsafe, search and sorting algorithm which has a log n expected time complexity 3) quadtrees/octrees - great for spatial partitioning in game programming
