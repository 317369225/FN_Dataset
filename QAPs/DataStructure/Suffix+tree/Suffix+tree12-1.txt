What are some good resources on data structures like Tries, Suffix Trees and Suffix Arrays?
For suffix array, First, read this paper, may be you won't understand much. Second, read this tutorial on suffix array , it tries to explain the first paper. If still you want more clarity ( which has a really high probability ) Third,  read this, the cpp program written here is easier to understand.  If still you want to read more then follow the following piece of code. while (not clear) { do first; do third; } For tries: There are many articles for tries on Internet but one of the very important applications of tries in CP is in performing faster 'xor' operation as required in this or this problem. For such problems this article is the best. Updated 2w ago • View Upvotes
