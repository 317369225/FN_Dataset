As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove?
I would suggest to add a section of Introduction to Streaming Algorithms including few topics such as: Bloom Filters Sketches and frequency Moments (e.g Count Min Sketches, AMS sketches etc.)and i think, some of the chapters from advanced sections from can be removed such as mentioned by @Peeyush Kumar, Linear programming....
