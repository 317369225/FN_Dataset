How can we find the number of palindromic substrings in a string in linear time?
In addition to suffix tree solution, there is another linear solution using Palindromic tree, which is a data structure invented by MikhailRubinchik - Codeforces and represented during Petrozavodsk Summer Camp 2014. The basic idea is to have a tree-like graph where: - Each distinct palindromic substring is represented by a node. - Each Edge from node x to node y, with character a represents that we could construct the palindromic substring of node y by appending character a to both sides of the palindromic substring of node x. - Additional links between nodes, where each additional link from node x to node y mean that palindromic substring of node y is the largest palindrome which is also suffix of the palindromic substring of x. This blog Palindromic tree nicely explains Palindromic tree. It shows how to build Palindromic tree in linear time. It also contains sample code for it. After building the palindromic tree, you can easily get the number of distinct palindromic substrings using the number of nodes.
