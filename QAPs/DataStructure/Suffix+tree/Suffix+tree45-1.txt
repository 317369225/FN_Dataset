What are some of the best algorithms?
How is it that no one has mentioned Quicksort? Is it because it is not esoteric enough? Or because every CS major learns it in college? Quicksort has everything you could want in an algorithm. It's classic for a reason: So simple it can be written in a few lines of code. So counter-intuitive that nearly everyone who learns it could not reproduce it without looking it up. So useful that it has become universal in every software program. It even uses recursion, everyone's favorite algorithm feature. I give you Quicksort.
