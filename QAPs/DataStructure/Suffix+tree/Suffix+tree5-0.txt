What's an intuitive explanation on how a compressed suffix tree works?
A compressed suffix tree is shallower version of a suffix tree. If any node in suffix tree has only one child that node will be combined with that child in the compressed suffix tree. Here is the example on Wikipedia: If the word BANANA were placed in a suffix tree, there would be nodes for A, NA, ANA, NANA, ANANA and BANANA. From the root node, there would be a child N that has one child A (this is the NA node) which then has a child N which has a child A (this is the NANA node). Because the N nodes have only one value each (A) those node-child pairs can be compressed to NA. You can see in the image that the N branch has been compressed from being 4 deep to being 2 deep. You can also see in the diagram that the B branch went from being ''-B-A-N-A-N-A to ''-BANANA because the B branch was ultimately 1 wide.
