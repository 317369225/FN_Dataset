From Suffix tree ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree ) : "Suffix trees can be used to solve a large number of string problems that occur in text-editing, free-text search, computational biology . . . Suffix trees are often used in bioinformatics applications, searching for patterns in DNA or protein sequences. . . Suffix trees are also used in data compression. . . Variants of the LZW compression schemes use suffix trees . . . . . . also used in suffix tree clustering, a data clustering algorithm used in some search engines . . ." The same reference shows many research papers from as recent as 2007/2008/2009. So the short answer to your query "Are suffix trees used in real applications these days ?" is YES.
