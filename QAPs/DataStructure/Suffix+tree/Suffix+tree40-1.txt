Write a program to return the longest repeating  substring in a string.
Just echoing more what Alon Amit said , longest repeated substring will be nothing but the finding deepest node in suffix tree with more then one child ,It actually make sense right ? We can create the suffix tree using suffix array and LCP array that being said you can achieve the same thing using these(Suffix and LCP) array as if you create suffix tree directly.Thus longest repeated sub-string problem for a string [math]S[/math] of length [math]n[/math] can be solved in [math]O(n)[/math] time using both the suffix array [math]A[/math] and the LCP array [math]L[/math],I'm leaving the part of construction of suffix array and LCP array. Perform a linear scan through the LCP array in order to find its maximum value max in [math]L[][/math] and the corresponding index [math]i[/math] where [math]max[/math] is stored. The longest sub-string that occurs at least twice is then given by[math] S[A[i],A[i]+max-1][/math], where [math]S[/math] is the original string. Suffix array for string  [math] S=ababab [/math] will be [math] A= {ab, abab ,ababab ,b ,bab, babab}   [/math] LCP array for given suffix array will be [math] L= {-,2,4,0,1,3} [/math] finally max in LCP array will be [math] max=4 [/math] and its index in LCP array will be [math] maxIndex=2[/math] Longest Repeated Sub-string will be  [math]S[A[L[maxIndex]],[/math] [math]A[L[maxIndex]]+max-1][/math] which is [math]abab[/math] , here [math] index=A[L[maxIndex]][/math] will return a index in suffix array for given string e.g. its lexicographic location so simply we can return sub-string from original string using index and max and expression can be we-written as [math]S[index,index+max-1][/math]. Time to build Suffix Array is [math]O(n)[/math] using DC3 Algorithm. Time to build LCP array is [math]O(n)[/math] using linear scan of Suffix Array. Time to find the Longest Repeated Sub-String [math] O(n)[/math] linear scan of LCP array followed by returning sub-string from original string , its also [math]O(n)[/math] in worst case.
