What are some good websites to learn data structures and algorithms?
Originally Answered: What are the best algorithm websites?I really like this site Algorithms, 4th Edition. You can follow the related course at Coursera here Page on coursera.org. The lectures, videos, exercises should be enough (to cover the most important topics) for anyone who is starting to learn the basics of computer algorithms and data structures. Also, this other site visualising data structures and algorithms through animation could be useful for people who need to see a visual representation of an algorithm or data structures in order to understand who it works.
