How do I start learning or strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?
Originally Answered: How did you start learning programming language with data structures and algorithms? I learned programming by trying to implement other programs I saw. I had no formal ideas about “data structures” or “algorithms”. I just felt my way through. The first time I became aware of “algorithms” was,I think, when my dad suggested I come up with an efficient way to sort some numbers. However, even then (I was ten or so), thoughts about data structures algorithms weren’t really central in my passion for programming. I was just trying to figure out how make a better Pac-Man or Reversi. 604 Views · 3 Upvotes · Answer requested by Sean Doody
