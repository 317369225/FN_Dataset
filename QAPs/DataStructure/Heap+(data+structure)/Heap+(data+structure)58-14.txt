What basic data structures and algorithms should one learn before starting competitive programming?
Originally Answered: What are some basic algorithms for competitive programming?First of all, a solid understanding of searching algorithm(BFS, DFS, Searching tree pruning: A star, apha-beta) builds your first step in competitive programming. Then, graph theory, advanced data structures(Segment Tree, Trie, AVL balance tree, prefix tree, Union-Find-Set). Last but not least, network flow, number theory, computation geometry, approximation algorithm and greedy algorithm(this category of problems can become very hard, not as easy as many people imagined) 5.1k Views Â· 7 Upvotes
