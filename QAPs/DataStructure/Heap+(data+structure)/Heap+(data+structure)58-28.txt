What basic data structures and algorithms should one learn before starting competitive programming?
Programming and learning can go side by side.don't think about learning all the algorithms then solving problems. I suggest that pick a problem then learn and code it. For learning purpose start with SPOJ or Codechef easy problems . These type of questions has already been answered , like What are the "must known" algorithms for online programming contests?
