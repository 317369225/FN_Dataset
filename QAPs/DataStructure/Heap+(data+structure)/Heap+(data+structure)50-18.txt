How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
I went through exactly same situation. If you just read the text book, you will feel that it is easy. So, it is recommended to practice in java. Always ask the question "Can it be done better?" Designing the algorithm by implementing a real life problem and relate underlying data structure will clarify the concepts. I found the course by Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick on coursera very useful. 2.3k Views Â· 3 Upvotes
