What is the practical application of trees or graphs in data structures?
Trees are a type of graph. In general, graphs model entities (represented as vertices) and relationships between those entities (represented as edges). This allows many seemingly different problems to be stated using a unified framework. For example, the following three questions can all be modeled and answered using the same or similar algorithms on graphs: If I have a map of possible flights, how can I get from city A to city B in the least number of flights / in the shortest time? If I have two people on LinkedIn or Facebook, what's the shortest chain of introductions that would connec... (more)
