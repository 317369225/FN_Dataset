What are all the data structures that you have come to know about? Which of these do you use very frequently? Group them in "Basic" and "Advanced".
Weight balanced structures (binary tree, skip list, treaps, etc...) is an idea that is very very important, but is usually not taught (I would consider myself very lucky to be exposed to it by my grad. algorithms professor, Dr. Bender :) ). I would classify them under intermediate. There's also a whole set of external memory data structures, a lot of which can be found beautifully explained by Dr. Bender here: http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~bender... Data structures are also called "crystallized algorithms", and you can (sometimes) convert an algorithm to a data structure - by stealing ideas f... (more)
