What algorithms and data structures should any software engineer know?
The Technical Interview Cheat Sheet and Big-O cheat sheet are highly recommended. Also you should take a look at the book Introduction to Algorithms.   Knowing what are the “most important” data structures/algorithms is important for sure, but there's more about it. I think this list is not new to most people, however, very few actually have a clear understanding of them. Take BFS as an example: knowing BFS is basic, but far from enough. What are equally important are things like pros and cons of this algorithm, how to compare with DFS, when to use which algorithm, etc..   Take a look at Bu... (more)
