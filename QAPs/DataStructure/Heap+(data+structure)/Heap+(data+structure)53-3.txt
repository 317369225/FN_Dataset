What are some tips for self-studying Data Structures and Algorithms?
Learn how to analyze and implement common algorithms used in data processing. Start by learning about the complexity theory, then jump into learning about numerical algorithms, including randomizing arrays, prime factorization, and numerical integration. Then learn about linked lists, such as singly linked lists, sorted, and doubly linked lists, arrays, stacks and queues, and sorting. After that learn about searching, hash tables, recursion, and backtracking algorithms, trees, balanced trees, decision trees graphs, and network algorithms. Read each data structure theoretically and implement dif... (more)
