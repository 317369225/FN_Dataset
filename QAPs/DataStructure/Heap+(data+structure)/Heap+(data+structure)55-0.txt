Why is dynamic memory allocation called heap memory allocation?
The term is definitely unrelated to the heap data structure, and is a tradition that goes back several decades.  In TAOCP volume 1, Knuth says: Several authors began about 1975 to call the pool of available memory a 'heap.' But in the present series of books, we will use that word only in its more traditional sense related to priority queues. [1] I don't know who originated the term, but presumably the word was used in the usual English sense.  There is a reference to it being used by Adriaan van Wijngaarden (an Algol designer) in 1971 [2].
