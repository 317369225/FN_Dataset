How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
Not everyone can visualize the problem, but if you can , that's a differentiator for you.  Also, school only teaches you the concepts with some very limited actual work on actual problems.  Take a job at a non-google doing programming and algorithms and learn how to really put into practice what you learned.  Then, a Google interview will be as simple as drawing upon your post-scholastic experience, where only a limited number of the factoids you learned in school really have any impact on the interview. 2.2k Views · 2 Upvotes
