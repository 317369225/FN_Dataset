What basic data structures and algorithms should one learn before starting competitive programming?
Originally Answered: What is the best way to learn data structures and algorithms for competitive programming? Should one learn on demand, or learn standard algorithms first? What are some resources to learn? Hey, best way and also the most fun way, is coding on online judges like SPOJ,Codechef,Codeforces,TopCoder. You would’t even realize and with time you would start understanding algorithms and data structures so well. You don’t even need a guide as online coding acted like a virtual guide. From tutorials and online discussion forums and blogs from fellow competitors, you get to learn so much every time you find yourself stuck. The best thing about it is, it makes you smarter. And it is super fun.Just have patience. All the best!:) 516 Views
