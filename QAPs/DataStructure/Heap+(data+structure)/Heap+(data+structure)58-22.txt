What basic data structures and algorithms should one learn before starting competitive programming?
basic data structure and algorithms that one should know. Its not like that, you would be knowing most of data structures and algorithm but until u start coding them they are of none use because even if you know them. So the question should be how to start competitive programming rather than knowing data structure and algorithm. So lets start:- The way we learnt math , physics same way we would go for it also. Math and physics are what we have learnt from childhood but computer programming most people start when they go to engineering . So I will break the way of learning in 4 years. It goe... (more)
