What are some good websites to learn data structures and algorithms?
Originally Answered: What is the best resource to learn data structure and algorithm (must contain practice assignments too)? I’ve stumbled across Coursera, but does it cover all the essential details about DSA? Video lectures Lectures in Advanced Data Structures (6.851) Take a course in undergrad/grad CS and enroll for the data structures section. CSE 638 Advanced Graduate Algorithms (and Data Structures) and CS 61B: Data Structures Take a course in advanced algorithms. Advanced Algorithms, Spring 2013 Read Jeff Erickson's notes and solve his assignment problems. They are very well presented and thought through. Find someone who is equally interested, and discuss problems with him/her. This will go a very long way. Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Are you satisfied with this answer?
