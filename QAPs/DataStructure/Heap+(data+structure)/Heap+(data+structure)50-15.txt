How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
I would recommend the book "Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen,Â  Leiserson, Rivest and Stein". Start with Data Structures first, read a chapter and then implement and use the structure in any program on your computer. Make sure you use all the different variations of the structure, this way you will know when you have missed something in the book. After completing DS, start with algorithm. Implement the examples given in the book. Once you are done with the examples, pick up some questions from net that can be solved using that particular algorithm. Solving more questions will help you u... (more)
