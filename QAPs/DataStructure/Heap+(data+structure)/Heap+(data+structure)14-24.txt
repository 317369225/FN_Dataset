As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove if the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition?
Its time to break the book into two volumes. Basic and advanced(Ideally should end as a book series on algorithms). Basic volume should deal with fundamentals, useful thing very often used. Advanced volume to satisfy the curious. Many people are saying to remove linear programming but it is very often used in practice. Because of two volumes now there is a lot of space to satisfy wider audience. 2.4k Views Â· 22 Upvotes
