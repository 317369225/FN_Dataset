Shout out to Michal Fori≈°ek (misof) and Dima Korolev (DmitryKorolev). Solve the problems in the USACO Training Program Gateway. Solve problems in online judges and compete in programming contests. For data structures in particular, in my experience, Central/East European OIs tend to have the most interesting problems. For algorithms, try to solve problems from a variety of different sources so you can learn to apply as ma... (more)
