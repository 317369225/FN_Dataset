What basic data structures and algorithms should one learn before starting competitive programming?
You probably should not think about any algorithm or data structure before getting into competitive programming. The only thing you have to do is choose a language and get started. All you need to know about the language is some basics like variable, array(very very important), conditional statements and loops. A basic knowledge of some basic libraries of that language is also equally important. Then just open any website like CodeChef or Hackerrank and start to think about and solve the beginner problems, which do not require the knowledge of any algorithm or data structure. Once you start ... (more)
