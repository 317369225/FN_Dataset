How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
As Robert Love said, intuitively understanding how different data structures work & when to use those is extremely important. This helps us shape decisions which ultimately impacts the performance of the program. Since this aspect has already been explained, I wanted to make an effort to illustrate this a little further using some basic examples which I feel should help create a base for further exploration and for interviews. At a high level we have two abstract data types namely dictionaries, containers [Priority queues are special containers since they don't have fixed order of data ret... (more)
