What is the best data structure for heap implementation?
Heap is a collection of items stored in a manner that there is a ordering between some elements and can not be inferred between some others (partial ordering). The ordering is best understood by considering a Heap to be tree where the ordering relationship exists between the parent and its children. One way to keep a heap will be to keep both the data items and the relationship of that data item with other data items as a tree. In case of binary trees, this relationship normally results in a complete binary tree. For complete binary trees, the relationship can implicitly be inferred from ... (more)
