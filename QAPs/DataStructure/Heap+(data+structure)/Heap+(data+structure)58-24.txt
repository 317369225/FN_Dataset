What basic data structures and algorithms should one learn before starting competitive programming?
Algorithms are solutions to problems. There are lots of ways to solve all kinds of problems. When you talk about them in the context of computer science, you are speaking of the way we solve a problem programmatically. These solutions use basic logic. If A, then do B. If not A, then do C. This is extremely simple logic and itâ€™s not written in a programming language (though many languages look similar to this) but an algorithm could be this simple. This is A way to solve a problem that a computer understands. Algorithms get much more complex than this but at their core, they are assembled using ... (more)
