How do I do expedi spoj problem using heap data structure?
I can solve it using a segment tree. Build a segment tree, store at every node a range maximum (maximum fuel, and the node with that value, furthest from the start). (Something like range minimum Segment Tree | Set 2 (Range Minimum Query) - GeeksforGeeks ). You have your tree. Now it is a greedy solution. stops_required = 0; Step 1: If fuel in tank Pi >= distance to the town Li, return stops_required. Step 2: Find the shop with maximum fuel from current position Ci to Ci + Pi. Update current position, stops_required++. Repeat. Step 3: If you are at the last stop and cannot reach the town, return -1 (or whatever). O(nlogn) for building the tree. O(nlogn) for all the queries. O(nlogn) overall complexity. Proof of correctness: Lets say our algorithm predicts stops at a1a2a3...an and the optimal path is o1o2o3...om, and they are different or m < n. Step 1: if ai == oi, continue. Step 2: from current position, both oi and ai are reachable, which means fuel at oi < fuel at ai, or ai is closer to the town (according to our condition and assumption). In any case, if we replace oi with ai, the optimality of the solution won't be affected. Hence the new path becomes a1a2a3.....a(i-1)aio(i+1).....om. continue. Step 3: if m == n, proved. Step 4: if optimal solution becomes a1a2...am and is shorter than the solution predicted by our algorithm, which means the destination is reachable from am, and our algorithm should also have terminated at am. proved. PS: Let me know once you have given it a try. I will share the code after that. 492 Views Â· 2 Upvotes
