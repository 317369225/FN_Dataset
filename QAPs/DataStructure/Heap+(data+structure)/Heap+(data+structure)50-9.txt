How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
Data Structures and Algorithms are one of the toughest subjects of Computer Science. How many Software Engineers in the industry can even talk in these subjects, I have doubt. Even after spending 15 years in this induatry, I cannot say that I am fluent in these subjects. There are plethora of books in the market by leading professors like Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et.al. or even the master series by Knuth. The problem is that they are daunting.
