How do I start learning or strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?
Originally Answered: What are the good websites to learn data structures and algorithms?Cormen is elementary, atleast according to me. Cormen assumes no prior knowledge of anything except basics of programming. Cormen builds up from the root and this is why it is the bible. If you are facing problem with cormen, you should probably give more time to it. You will understand it eventually. Read it like a novel. Page by page. Other places to learning is online courses. Udacity, Coursera, Edx and many more. They all have data structures course. On coursera the course offered by princeton and stanford are my personal favorite. 1.2k Views Â· 6 Upvotes
