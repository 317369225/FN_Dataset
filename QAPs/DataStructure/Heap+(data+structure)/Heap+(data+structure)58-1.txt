What basic data structures and algorithms should one learn before starting competitive programming?
You're in luck. There are plenty of resources. I would suggest starting out with the USACO Training Gateway (Page on Delos). It's a compilation of hundreds of problems and tutorials that are meant to help people train for USACO. But, one could use it to train for essentially any programming competition. It might start out as pretty basic for you, but as soon as you get into the later part of Chapter 1 and into Chapter 2, you will cover some graph theory concepts as well as Dynamic Programming. It's probably one of the best resources out there to start training for competitions. Another se... (more)
