How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
I had the same problem as you had. I didn't study algorithms and data structures formally. I'd go with every point mentioned by Robert Love and I'd like to resonate the same. Identifying what data structure or algorithm is the right fit to the problem is the key skill IMHO. Steve Yegge mentions this in his post, Get that job at Google. I'm just quoting it here, For instance, if they ask you about coloring U.S. states in different colors, you get major bonus points if you recognize it as a graph-coloring problem, even if you don't actually remember exactly how graph-coloring works. And if... (more)
