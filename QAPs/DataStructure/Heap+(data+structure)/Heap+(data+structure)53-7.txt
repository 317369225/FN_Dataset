What are some tips for self-studying Data Structures and Algorithms?
Here is how I prepared on Data Structures and Algorithms for Competitive Programming. Strong fundamentals: You can use Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen. Focus on these chapters: Sorting Stacks & queues Trees (you can avoid AVL, Red-Black Trees) Graphs Dynamic and Greedy programs Get your hands dirty: Donâ€™t just look at algorithms. Practice in your favorite language editor (like Eclipse). Ensure that you are able to write code that successfully handles all corner cases. In time, you will develop the ability to simulate code mentally to spot bugs in it.... (more)
