Why does the heap data structure does not get importance in many of the data structure and algorithm books?
I honestly don’t now why, but if I had to take a guess: Anything that has to do with heaps requires you to learn about something else before they’re of any use. A heap isn’t an base data-structure; it’s a way to organize/structure data within a more basic data-structure. Weather you are using a binary-heap or a tree-heap, you still need to know about the underlying data structure first. In other words, learning about heaps is dependent on first learning about arrays and trees. Then, there’s what we use heaps for. I’ve seen them used for creating priority queues, sorting, and in conjunction wi... (more)
