How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
If you already know some Algorithms, you won't want to use a video course. Instead, you'll want a resource that lets you quickly jump to the parts you're interested in and lets you practice what you know. You could skim through a good Algorithms book, such as the Algorithms Design Manual. I would suggest trying out my Algorithms tutorials on Learneroo. It lets you easily skip to what you're interested in, and you can practice implementing and applying the different algorithms and data structures.
