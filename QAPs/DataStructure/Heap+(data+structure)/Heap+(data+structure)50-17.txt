How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
I would suggest doing as much programming as possible.  Nothing like practical, hands on experience to strengthen your knowledge.  Try to work on the most difficult problems you can handle and don't be afraid to reinvent the wheel.  If you can program a complicated algorithm from scratch, it's a fair bet that you understand it. 4.6k Views · 9 Upvotes
