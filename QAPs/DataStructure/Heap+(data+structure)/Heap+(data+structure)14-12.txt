As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove if the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition?
I started self-studying Introduction to Algorithms a few weeks ago, and am still in the Foundations section. So far, I think the content is great, but there are a few things I’d like to modify. 1. Change the indexing The book uses index 1 as the starting or base address of any array in its pseudocodes. Every time I go for testing an algorithm through a program, I suffer a great deal while struggling with the indexing mismatch, as all the programming languages I know use zero-base indexing. (I’m not sure if there exists a programming language that begins counting from 1; the language I’m using... (more)
