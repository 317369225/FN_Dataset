When would I want to (theoretically) use a van Emde Boas data structure vs a Fibonocci Heap? What are the advanatages van Emde Boas have over Fibonocci Heaps?
They support different operations. Fibonacci heaps support fast remove-min, find-min, decrease-priority, and insert. Van Emde Boas trees support all of the above but also fast find, floor (predecessor), and ceiling (successor). 327 Views Â· 1 Upvote
