What algorithms and data structures should any software engineer know?
These aren't really in a specific order, just as they pop into my head. Algorithms: 3-way Quicksort (standard general purpose sort) Merge sort (a more scalable sort with similar asymptotic complexity to quicksort) DF/BF searches (particularly knowing which the proper one to apply) Prim's / Kruskal's (minimum spanning tree) Dijkstra's (shortest path)...
