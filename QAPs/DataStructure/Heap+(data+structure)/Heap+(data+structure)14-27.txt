As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove if the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition?
I do believe CLRS should keep its fantastic features such as subject orientation, great ideas for practical use,etc. I think you'd better consider something beyond worst case analysis. Introducing how sufficiently we can work with ,for instance, those NP-problems that have already been implemented in industry. regarding for ex. Competitive analysis in Online problems. I believe wost case is rare in reality and its better have another tools for algorithm analysis. 509 Views
