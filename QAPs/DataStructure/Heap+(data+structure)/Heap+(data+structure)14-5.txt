As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove if the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition?
Here's my two cents on what can be thrown in: Parameterized and Multivariate Algorithms Recently, there is a large and thriving body of research in the field of parameterized algorithms; particularly in developing exact algorithms for hard problems. Given the theoretical (in some sense, analyzing the complexity of an algorithm as a function of multiple parameters always seems to be a much deal compared to a worst-case analysis based on just the input size) and practical (a large fraction of practical problems are in fact hard to compute; and there are genuine situations---like voting algor...
