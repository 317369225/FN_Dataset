How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
I do it by studying and getting hands on practice on non-trivial problems. I don't wait to have a course on it to study it. And if I need to know it want to know it badly I keep studying it, day and night until it clicks. The practical hands on part is absolutely essential to my learning. So how can you do it? 1. Keep track of how you learn certain types of things best. 2. Apply that knowledge to this problem domain. (i.e. LEARNING about data structures and algorithms) In otherwords, learn how to learn this subject. 3. When possible build off of something you do know well.... (more)
