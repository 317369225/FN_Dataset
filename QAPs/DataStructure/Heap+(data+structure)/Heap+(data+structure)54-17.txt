What algorithms and data structures should any software engineer know?
Some of the algorithms that I would suggest at Stage 2 or Stage 3 of your Engineering Career. 1. K - Means What does it do? k-means creates groups from a set of objects so that the members of a group are more similar. Itâ€™s a popular cluster analysis technique for exploring a dataset. 2. The Apriori algorithm. What does it do? The Apriori algorithm learns association rules and is applied to a database containing a large number of transactions. Association rule learning is a data mining technique for learning correlations and relations among variables in a database. 3. C4.5 What does it do? C4.5 ... (more)
