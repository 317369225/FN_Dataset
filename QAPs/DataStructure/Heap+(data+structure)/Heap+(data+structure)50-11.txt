How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
Algorithms and Data Structures,Â  in a way go hand in hand. In order to implement the algorithms we use Data Structures. So you can say Data Structures are the tools to implement the algorithms that we learn. Now there could be various ways to implement an algorithm based on the Data Structure you are choosing. So your choice will determine how much space and time it takes . This is the so called "Space and Time Complexity". So I would suggest read initially the Basic Data Structures like Arrays , Linked List , Stacks , Queues , Trees . [ Very Important ]. Once you are comfortable with th... (more)
