How do I master the tree data structure and heaps in C? Are there good tutorials that provide enough details?
Start reading "Data Structure and Files by Andrew Tanenbaum". It'll help in understanding the concepts. It's my personal favorite. Once you start getting the concepts, follow through with the example codes given in the book.Â  That should help you in understanding how to convert mathematical representation of these data structures into a working program using language specific constructs. Once that is done, refer "Design and Analysis of algorithms by T. Cormen". This is an advance book and has more complicated problems, try to solve the questions from these books, programmatically of c... (more)
