How do I start learning or strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?
Originally Answered: How did you start learning programming language with data structures and algorithms? It’s fruitless to ask how other people learned to program. Personal experiences vary widely and you won’t find a meaningful pattern. I recommend you learn how to program by starting with a good teaching language: see Richard Kenneth Eng's answer to What is the best programming language for a beginner to learn from scratch? Learn the basic programming concepts, then practice what you’ve learned by writing lots and lots of programs. Do not overly focus on the programming language. Learning a programming language is NOT learning programming. 761 Views · 5 Upvotes · Answer requested by Sean Doody
