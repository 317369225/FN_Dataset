Is there any application using leftist heap? What is the real use of heaps in data structures?
A Heap is a partially ordered data structure. A Priority Queue can be efficiently implemented using  a heap. It is also very useful for solving certain problems like : 1. Finding a minimum/maximum element from a collection of elements - O(1) time 2. Finding K-th min/max element - can be solved in O(k log N) time  using heap. Heap data structure is used in a very simple & efficient sorting algorithm : Heap Sort which performs in-place sorting of elements. Its worst-case complexity is O(nlog n). Heap is not useful when we have to search a key efficiently since there is no relative ordering among its elements unlike in a Binary Search Tree.
