How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
You need to read books and science articles to learn more algorithms. But besides reading you need to train implementation skill. You need to get practice solving problems on topcoder or codeforces and similar sites. Some of this problems are similar to real development problems. This will help you to choose what algorithm you need to use in different situations and write it faster and without bugs. About science books. I can suggest you to read Cormen. This is one of the best books about algorithms and data structures as i think. 2.8k Views Â· 11 Upvotes
