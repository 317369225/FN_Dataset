What is a d-heap data structure?
A d-heap (sometime called a d-ary heap) data structure is similar to a binary heap. A binary heap is actually a special case of the d-heap data structure where d = 2. Here is an example of min binary heap on the left and max binary heap on the right: The binary heap has the properties of being a complete tree (missing items are only on the bottom of the tree and all nodes are as far left as possible) and satisfying the min/max heap property (in the case of a min heap, every node is less than or equal to to it’s children). The only difference between a binary heap and the d-heap is that instead of each node have 2 children, each node has d children. Here is an example of a 3-ary max heap: Here is an example of a 5-ary min heap: 677 Views · 3 Upvotes
