I have experience in programming. Currently I'm planning to study either algorithms or data structures. Which one should I get started with?
A traditional CS 2 course focuses on data structures.  But they're not so interesting without applications, and the applications can be interesting algorithms on their own.  A good example would be the binary min-heap data structure as a way to implement a priority queue.  That's a nice data structure on its own, but use it within Dijkstra's algorithm for single-source shortest paths on a weighted, directed graph with nonnegative edge weights, and now you've got something interesting and practical. 20.7k Views · 309 Upvotes
