Why we need heap(max and min) data structure instead B tree as well as even for sort? When i should use heap over Binary Search Tree?
A binary heap is a “complete” binary tree meaning that every row or level is full except for the bottom which is filled from left to right. Every element satisfies the “heap order” which for a min-tree means that no child node has a key that is less than that of its parent. So the minimum key is in the root node and can be found in constant time. Insertions and deletions (of the minimum node) take logarithmic time but are usually faster than for the equivalent binary search tree since you don’t need to search for the insertion/deletion point. Searches for any other key take linear time however. ... (more)
