How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
Learn how the two are related to each other. It takes practice. And as another poster had said -- learn how to visualize the data structure and visualize the motion of the algorithm acting on the data structure. In a way, it's a dance between them. A rule of thumb for me is that if the coding is fluid then the data structure I chose to use is appropriate to the problem I am trying to solve. 1.3k Views Â· 4 Upvotes
