As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove if the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition?
I would have liked to see these topics added: Zero-Knowledge Proofs: When I took 6.046 at MIT, we covered ZKP in class and it was the only topic outside CLRS that semester. It was pretty interesting and paired well with RSA (instructors were Rivest and Goldwasser) and the other material.Â  It could replace primality testing or integer factorization. Although it doesn't really fit in the "Number theoretic algorithms" chapter. An overview of Boosting/ Multiplicative Weights Update would also be extremely useful in my opinion. Given the fact that learning algorithms are increasingly important i... (more)
