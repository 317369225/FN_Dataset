What algorithms and data structures should any software engineer know?
I have read the CLRS(all contents before selected topics, which is enough &required for a programmer), I think the most important two parts are DP(Dynamic-Programming) and Greedy Algorithm. DP is more logical , cause it does some calculations before making a choice. Like the Matrix-Multiplication issue. It loops every possibility by counting L(numbers of submatrices) from 2 to n. Greedy Algorithm is more intuitive, it makes a choice before doing some calculations. Like finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. When it comes to one vertex, then chooses a smallest weight(the number on th... (more)
