What are the top 10 algorithms every software engineer should know by heart?
None. Rather than memorizing algorithms, you should understand algorithmic principles, and know those algorithmic principles by heart. The goal in understanding algorithms is to be able to analyze algorithms you havenâ€™t seen before, to be able to apply existing algorithms to new problems, and to be able to create new algorithms from scratch. Of course, in order to gain a good understanding of those algorithmic principles, you will need to study a lot of algorithms (way more than 10). It may be useful to keep to these algorithms you learn in your mind as canonical examples of the principles they deploy. ... (more)
