What algorithms and data structures should any software engineer know?
I’m assuming that the question intends to say “must-know” and not “most-know.” All algorithms have some basis in a few core mathematical concepts. understanding those core concepts is key to understanding all of the core algorithms, and the key to being able to devise novel algorithms. There are a number of books that teach this, including Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, et. al., and The Art of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth. (Though Knuth is quite a bit more in depth than most people really need.) Here’s my list of the most important concepts, in no particular order, and not real... (more)
