How are students in Indian colleges taught programming?
Something that stands out for me was how we were taught the backtracking algorithm, using the n queens problem. The course prescribed a great text book. Introduction to Algorithms But the teacher recommended and followed an extremely simplified version of this book by a local Indian author. This book simplified the backtracking approach in algorithms, to a few pages with a diagram of a chessboard that showed one of the solutions to the n queens problem. This was apparently covered in a a single class by my professor and she recommended answering a question about backtracking/n queens al... (more)
