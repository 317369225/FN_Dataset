What are the top 10 algorithms every software engineer should know by heart?
Algorithm is a solution. It means, the work is done. We figured it out, made a library and moved on. Unless you have to work specifically on those tasks due to not having any library support, you will never write a tree, a list, or any kind of sorting in your life. Your time is better spent on problems that are actually interesting, because they haven't been solved yet. This is not to say that algorithm theory is a waste of time. Knowing the criteria for selecting the right tool for the job is very important. But specific algorithms? No, not really. You can look them up if you really need them. 6.3k Views Â· 39 Upvotes
