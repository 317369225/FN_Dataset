How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
Simplest answer is practice practice lots of coding. Even if you understand all theoritcal data structures, you will need to start applying them to feel confident. I highly recommend reading a algorithm topic and solve lots of problems related to it. My personal favorite is topcoder, where you can filter problems based off a topic. Make a genuine effort to solve those problems even if takes more time and do not read solution unless you really have exhausted all possibilities. While reading solution you should think why the person solving problem could think that way and why you failed to do... (more)
