How do I start learning or strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?
My favoite author on Data Structure is Robert Sedgewick. I have his books from the 1st edition to the 3rd. He is readable. He presents a explanation that is understandable. He uses algorithm animation pictures to show how the algorithms work. His 3rd edition comes in C, C++, and Java variants. His 4th is focused only on Java and he has removed a lot of interesting algorithms. Work the problems in his book. With the current cache architectures and memory prefetching, Big O analysis does not give “what runs faster” on real machines (like Intel). Learn to benchmark algorithms so as to measure ... (more)
