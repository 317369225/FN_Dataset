How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
The following are some tips : - 1) Try to learn a data structure well before moving to the next. There is no use of partial knowledge. 2) The more you spend time on a data structure , the more you gained from it. 3) Try to follow standard text books . I recommend "Introduction to Algorithms  , CLRS  ". Remember : One who can do Bubble sort very well is better than one who can do Quick sort partially " 1.2k Views · 9 Upvotes
