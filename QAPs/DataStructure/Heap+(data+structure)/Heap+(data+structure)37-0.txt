Why we need heap(max and min) data structure instead B tree as well as even for sort? When i should use heap over Binary Search Tree?
We don't “need” to use heaps. They just have some advantages, like being able to be implemented using a single array with no space consumed for pointers. Heaps use less space by a constant factor and usually also less time by a constant factor. One asymptotic improvement that heaps do have is that they require only O(n), rather than O(n log n), time to build if n elements are given in advance. This is useful in a small number of problems, but usually not the main consideration for choosing heaps over trees. 306 Views · 3 Upvotes · Answer requested by Deep J
