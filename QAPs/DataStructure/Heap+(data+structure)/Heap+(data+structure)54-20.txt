What algorithms and data structures should any software engineer know?
As a software engineer, gaining the knowledge of basic algorithms and data structures is absolutely necessary. There are a lot of interesting things as pointed out by many excellent answers on this question already. Depending on your field, your employer may emphasize very different must-have skills on algorithms and data structures. For example, most embedded software engineers do not really know, and need not to know any of most-used basic algorithms used in the machine learning. It is interesting to know what is the most used data structures and algorithms in a field with an example. I ha... (more)
