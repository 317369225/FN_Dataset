How do I start learning or strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?
A good method for strengthing your data science knowledge is to collaborate with another data scientists using some open source tools in some open DS project. There are such tools similar to Kaggle Kernels - like new DVC open source tool - it sharing DS project across Git (code) and cloud storages (data )and consider machine learning modeling as an iterative process and keeps track of your steps, dependencies between the steps, dependencies between your code, code running arguments (stored in Git) and data files (stored in cloud storages like S3 or GCP) - Data Version Control beta release 791 Views Â· 3 Upvotes
