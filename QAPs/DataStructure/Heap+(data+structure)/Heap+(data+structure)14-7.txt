As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove if the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition?
I suggest including an introduction to Parameterized Algorithms and Parameterized Complexity or Online Algorithms, and removing Fibonacci Heaps. Do not remove Linear Programming if you plan to keep Approximation Algorithms in there (as it clearly is needed within the Approximation Algorithms section in its present form, nor should it be removed). LP-techniques and approximation algorithms go hand-in-hand constantly. Personally I think the book is just as relevant as it was when the third edition came out. There are great specialized texts that are more recent for more specialized topics (lik... (more)
