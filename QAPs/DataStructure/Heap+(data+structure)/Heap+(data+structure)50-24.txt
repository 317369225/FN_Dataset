How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
If you want to hone your skills in Data structures doing a course wont help you strong rather than writing  code on our own.Data structures is a nightmare for many programmers perhaps.Solving maths and aptitude questions and puzzles keeps our memory active and orient us towards programming skills.Unless otherwise we practice ourselves to write various algorithms we cant improve our coding skills in it.If you need any clarification you can write me on my mail Id :kathir.twwi@gmail.com.I can train you to improve your skills.Thank you. 1.8k Views · 4 Upvotes
