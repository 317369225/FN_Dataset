How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
One ought to learn algorithm design principles and not mere solutions to problems. Algorithmic theory is mathematics; so one has to have solid math foundations. There is no reason why one should think that doing well in Google's interviews or TopCoder's competitions means mastery in Algorithms unless the above said is fulfilled. 779 Views Â· 1 Upvote
