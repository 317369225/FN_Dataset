Why is dynamic memory allocation called heap memory allocation?
The dynamic memory that we typically allocate through calls to malloc() in a C program gives us a contiguous chunk of memory from the "heap" part of the virtual address space of the process making the call. This heap does not correspond to the "heap" data structure. All the memory allocations done by the process at runtime are served off this part of the address space of the process. It is not fixed in size in the sense that when program is loaded into memory, you will have fixed code, data, bss sections in the address space. Heap is the memory region that is grown dynamically (based on the ... (more)
