What is a list of data structures that a competitive programmer must know?
It's all depends on the question you are trying to solve. In order to solve complex problems ..you need to be aware of Arrays, Stacks, Queues(Types), Trees(Types) , Symbol Tables(Dictionary), Graphs( ShortestPaths) with their understanding and applications. A problem can be solved by using two or more datastructures, but you have to choose best datastructure I.e taking time and space complexity in to consideration. 571 Views Â· 6 Upvotes
