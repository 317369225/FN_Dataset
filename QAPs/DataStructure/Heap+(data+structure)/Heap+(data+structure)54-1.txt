What algorithms and data structures should any software engineer know?
10! In current competitive world, this question should be renamed to 100 must-know algorithms. Still, lets try to categorize the algorithms in 10 broad categories. But first, learning such a small subset(only 10!) will do no good. The more you learn, the more you will stand out from the crowd. Learning and visualizing algorithms will change the way you tackle real life situation, you will always start looking for an optimized way to do things. And that's great, that's what smart people are - LAZY, yes, they always try to do more work with minimal effort and that's optimization. Start devel... (more)
