What algorithms and data structures should any software engineer know?
In short, you can find your answer here: stacygohyunsi/algorithms-primer I have created a repo summarising a list of algorithms and data structures for easy reference, for a quick recap of concepts, for preparation of technical interview, and just because I found it interesting! It includes common interview questions asked, what are the important concepts to note and what are the resources you can use to read up more on the topic if you want to. Itâ€™s open source, so feel free to contribute to it and let me know what you think! -Stacy Goh (http://imstacy.com) 160 Views
