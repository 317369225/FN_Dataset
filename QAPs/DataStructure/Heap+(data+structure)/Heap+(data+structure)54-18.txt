What algorithms and data structures should any software engineer know?
I used to have a professor (Dr. Marvin Solomon at U. Wisconsin, Madison), who said - all problems in computer science can be solved using hashing and indirection. He followed it up by saying that indirection usually leads to a reduction in performance, which can be handled by caching. I think there is a grain of truth in this. I love algorithms, and data structures and have learnt a lot a about a lot of them (I have a Bachelors, Masters, and PhD in CS); but in over 12+ years of real-life programming, I've rarely had to use much other than hashtables, and sorting, and occasionally trees. ...
