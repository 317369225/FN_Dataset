What basic data structures and algorithms should one learn before starting competitive programming?
You should learn 1.Linked List Linked list data structure provides better memory management than arrays. Because linked list is allocated memory at run time, so, there is no waste of memory. Performance wise linked list is slower than array because there is no direct access to linked list elements. Linked list is proved to be a useful data structure when the number of elements to be stored is not known ahead of time. There are many flavors of linked list you will see: linear, circular, doubly, and doubly circular. 2.Stack Stack is a last-in-first-out strategy data structure; this means that the e... (more)
