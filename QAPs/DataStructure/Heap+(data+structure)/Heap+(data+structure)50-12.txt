How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
Follow CLRS. This book covers everything: from basics to advanced, run-time analysis of algorithms.  It is a really nice read and if you want to excel just do the exercises: they are just great. If you want to see lectures there is a course on MIT OCW on data structures(some of them are taken by Prof. Charles himself). Course with the book will remove any fracture you have. And for what to read, just follow the lecture contents: Here is the link of a older version:Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503) of course and the newer one: Introduction to Algorithms. 4.9k Views · 6 Upvotes
