As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove if the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition?
My two cents! If link-cut trees were added as a topic, I'd suggest placing more emphasis on heavy-light decomposition since it's an algorithmic technique that has wide applications outside of just link-cut trees. Another very awesome concept is fractional cascading which I would love to see covered in CLRS. In general, my preference is towards including more algorithmic techniques (since this is an algorithms textbook after all!) as opposed to more advanced data structures. 3k Views Â· 7 Upvotes
