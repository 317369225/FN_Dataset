As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove if the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition?
I'm very satisfied with CLRS already, but as a student I don't have enough experience to judge the quality of the topics. If I were you I would look through algorithms syllabi from various universities and see if there are any topics that they're consistently covering that aren't in the book. This is a class that's being taught at Stanford this quarter: CS 161 -- Design and Analysis of Algorithms -- Course Information And this is a class that was taught at Caltech: CS 38 (Winter 2014) 6k Views Â· 39 Upvotes
