What is the practical application of trees or graphs in data structures?
Let us start with your operating system. This file management system is a tree. You may use facebook, that is based on graph and its algorithm. also the google maps is based on graph algorithms. Data structures are used whenever we have to structure data. The only question is to use the most efficient data structure at your disposal and graphs and tree are used a lot. They are also used in network design. I hope that answers your question. Happy coding… :) 2.8k Views · 4 Upvotes · Answer requested by Gaurav Singh
