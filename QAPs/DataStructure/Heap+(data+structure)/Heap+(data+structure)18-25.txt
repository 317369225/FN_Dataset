What are the top 10 algorithms every software engineer should know by heart?
There is no algorithm that a software engineer needs to know by heart. A good software engineer is aware of the existence of a wide variety of algorithms, but there’s no reason why she has to have any of them memorized. I don’t remember, off the top of my head, exactly how Kruskal’s minimum spanning tree algorithm works. But I know that it exists (along with a few other algorithms for finding minimal spanning trees) and if, in the course of solving some specific problem I realize that my problem can be transformed into a minimal spanning tree problem, I can then grab a book or a search engin...
