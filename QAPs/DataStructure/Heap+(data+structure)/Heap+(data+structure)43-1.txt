I have experience in programming. Currently I'm planning to study either algorithms or data structures. Which one should I get started with?
So far I only used my hands when eating but now I'm planning to learn how to use either a fork or a knife. Algorithms and data structures are the same thing. It's actually impossible to learn one but not the other. Each method of a data structure is an algorithm. Most algorithms use some data structures. You don't actually have a choice. 6.9k Views Â· 77 Upvotes
