What basic data structures and algorithms should one learn before starting competitive programming?
In my opinion, it’a not a very good idea to learn algorithms before starting competitive programming. The best way to become a good competitive programmer is to solve a lot of problems. Period. Of course, it’s not very clever to solve just any problems (you won’t get any better if you solve A+B a thousand times). One approach I’ve read somewhere is the following: Choose some online judge (personally, I like codeforces.com) Go to the archive Sort all the problems by difficulty Start solving. If you feel the problems are too easy (you solve most right away), skip a couple of pages. If you feel they... (more)
