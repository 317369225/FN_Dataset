What are the top 10 algorithms every software engineer should know by heart?
Algorithms is not something that most programmers can beneficially memorize. I’ll list 10 ideas/concepts/techniques instead. Name things after what they are. Variables, methods, functions, modules—the best place to document something is its name. Make your code short. The fewer tokens and complexity, the less room for bugs. Put related things textually close. Hash tables. Use whenever appropriate. Modularization. Break up software into understandable and testable modules. Caching. All computer science is an exercise in caching. Optimize what matters: in a CPU- or memory-bound program, only a tiny ... (more)
