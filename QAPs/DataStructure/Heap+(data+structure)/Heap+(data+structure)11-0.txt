What are some real-world applications of a heap data structure?
A heap data structure is an implementation of a “priority queue”. Instead of just joining a queue at its tail, a person or object may be inserted further up the queue depending on their priority. One application of this sort of queue might be one where priority is given to customers who take a short time to serve rather than priority to their arrival time. For example, a licensing centre might give priority to customers who only have a simple bill to pay. This reduces the average waiting time for all customers in the queue. 184 Views · Answer requested by Carol Hannum
