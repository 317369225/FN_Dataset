What basic data structures and algorithms should one learn before starting competitive programming?
As you are second year student of Computer Science, you must be having Data Structures and Algorithms course. Do that course faithfully and try solving some exercise problems in Cormen. For your kick start in Competitive programming, you should understand following topic in sequence: Sorting and searching algorithms: Try to implement searching and sorting algorithms like, Binary search, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort etc. Try to twist these algorithm till you get feel of how algorithm is working. Linked List, Stack, Queue: These standard data structures will help you to solve most of problems. ... (more)
