What are some good websites to learn data structures and algorithms?
Originally Answered: What is the best resource to learn data structure and algorithm (must contain practice assignments too)? I’ve stumbled across Coursera, but does it cover all the essential details about DSA? Coursera course with their exercise and Coremen exercise is good to start with. But later you can go through 'Knuth' also. For practice, start doing questions from different websites( like carrercup etc..). Take questions from Google code jam More practice of real world problems will sharpen your skills.  All the best !! 4.6k Views · 2 Upvotes
