What basic data structures and algorithms should one learn before starting competitive programming?
For starters, you require very few algorithms as it is mostly about logic. Still these are some algorithms worth knowing: Fast Sorting (merge/quick sort , counting sort) Finding all primes in a range: Sieve of Eratosthenes Fast power function: Exponential Squaring Finding Combination: Pascal's Triangle ...
