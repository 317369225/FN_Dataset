What is a list of data structures that a competitive programmer must know?
That depends on the problem you are trying to solve. If a problem is mapped to the most efficient data-structure which captures the essence of that problem, then it leads to an elegant solution of the problem. The "right" choice of data-structure would not only depend on the representation of the inputs, but the query it is supposed to be optimal for. E.g if asked to find a number among the list of number efficiently, then BST(Binary Search Tree) is a choice which would efficiently represent the input data for the set of all point search queries. If the query was for a range of numbers, an... (more)
