What algorithms and data structures should any software engineer know?
Karim Naggar gives an excellent list of data structures and algorithms, but I would say you don't need to know most of them. Rather, be aware that they exist and roughly what they're intended for. Then go learn them if you need them. I'm saying this as a high-level software engineer and PhD in computer science. The best thing you can do is familiarize yourself with arrays, lists, hash tables, sorting, and search/selection.Â  If you're a C++ programmer, take a look at the STL and its most popular templates. There's analogs for Java, etc. Again, you don't have to understand these algorithms ... (more)
