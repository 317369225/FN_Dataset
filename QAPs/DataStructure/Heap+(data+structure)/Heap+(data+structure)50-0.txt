How do I strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms? Both have left me with a fractured knowledge of the subject with lots of gaps in between. What would be a good way to go about filling the gaps and making progress?
I see it time and again in Google interviews or new-grad hires: The way data structures and algorithms—among the most important subjects in a proper computer science curriculum—are learnt is often insufficient. That's not to say students read the wrong books (see my recommendation below) or professors teach the wrong material, but how students ultimately come to understand the subject is lacking. The key to a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms is not an exhaustive survey of every conceivable data structure and its subforms, with memorization of each's Big-O value and amorti...
