What are the top 10 algorithms every software engineer should know by heart?
There are no such algorithms. A true software engineer knows how to look up an algorithm when it is needed and is open minded enough to consider several alternative algorithms when presented with a challenge. Yes you learn various algorithms in school but the most important thing you learn is the existence (or non-existence) of algorithms for various purposes and their relative advantages and drawbacks. A true software engineer (as opposed to a programmer) is more concerned about how to design an effective and appropriate software solution. This may involve research on solutions and algorit... (more)
