As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove if the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition?
Please add meet-in-the-middle and dynamic programming optimizations. (like, certain problems can be solved in O(n 2 )  O(n2) , but with optimization they can be solved in O(nlogn)  O(nlog⁡n) . Expand on heavy-light-decomposition. Add link-cut trees as well. I would also suggest adding more string-related algorithms. Explain splay trees and skip lists. They are really useful; there's even a lecture by Erik Demaine on skip lists in MIT OpenCourseWare (but it doesn't seem to be in the book, so why not add it?) 3.4k Views · 12 Upvotes
