As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove if the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition?
Discuss algorithms in the context of functional programming (not in as much depth as Okasaki, of course). In addition to discussing implications of purity, strictness/laziness and implications for complexity, it would be interesting to show applications of lambda and higher order functions. After covering some of the concerns, you could ask the student to make functional versions in exercises, for instance. Presenting only imperative algorithms, in 2014, does not seem reflect how much the programming language landscape has already changed and will continue to change. 5.1k Views Â· 29 Upvotes
