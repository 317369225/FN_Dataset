As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove if the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition?
Add Probabilistic data structures: Bloom filter, Locality sensitive hashing, Minhash, Skip lists Optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing, k-means clustering, nearest neighbor Distributed algorithms and Map-Reduce Distributed data structures such as Big table and sparse matrix Adjancy list, Nested sets, Scapgoat trees R-Trees/Quadtrees, Kd-trees and Interval trees. May be BSP trees, Hash trees and Fenwick trees may be good as exercise.... (more)
