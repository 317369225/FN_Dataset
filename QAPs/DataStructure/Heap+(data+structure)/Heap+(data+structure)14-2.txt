As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove if the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition?
I think CLRS is fine just the way it is, and the third edition is no less relevant today than it was five years ago. I also think consistency is valuable.
