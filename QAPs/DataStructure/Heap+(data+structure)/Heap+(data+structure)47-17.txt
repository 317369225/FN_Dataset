What are the best books to learn algorithms and data structures? Are there any good blogs/posts on these? Which books explain these concepts in a simpler way?
You can go for Schom Series (book). I've personally referred it. If things go difficult then one can go for YouTube as the channels guide one well. Good Luck! 216 Views Â· Answer requested by Rachit Mathur
