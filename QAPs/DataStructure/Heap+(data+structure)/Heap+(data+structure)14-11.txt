As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove if the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition?
My $0.02: Online algorithms and their complexity. Intro into distributed algorithms. Intro into probabilistic algorithms and data structures. Functional programming examples and their complexity analysis. Plus a bit more emphasis on the fact that algorithms and data structures are one aspect of programming, while system engineering is another aspect. Too often these days I see the code where a useful, handy and cleanly implemented by itself algorithm is hardcoded into another, bigger and clumsier piece of architecture. Which hurts both ends of the spectrum badly. 7k Views · 62 Upvotes · Answer requested by Vinay Kumar
