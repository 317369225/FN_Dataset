How do I start learning or strengthen my knowledge of data structures and algorithms?
[Featured on Quora FB] Data structures and algorithms are hard to learn. Here's a huge list to show how much there actually is out there: Data Structures and Algorithms. So how do you improve on this? Mastering these things require two things: understanding and implementation. Here are some steps to follow. #1 Read about the data structures/algorithms. I have given you a good list of things to study, but this won't get it entirely. Here is another link to find lists of algorithms: What are the algorithms required to solve all problems (using C++) in any competitive coding contest? Obviously, thi... (more)
