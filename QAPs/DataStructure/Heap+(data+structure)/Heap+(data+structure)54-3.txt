What algorithms and data structures should any software engineer know?
www.codingeek.org 1. Divide and Conquer - A divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same (or related) type (divide), until these become simple enough to be solved directly (conquer). The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem. This divide and conquer technique is the basis of efficient algorithms for all kinds of problems, such as   (e.g., QuickSort , Merge Sort ), multiplying large numbers (e.g. Karatsuba), syntactic analysis (e.g., top-down parsers), and computing the ...
