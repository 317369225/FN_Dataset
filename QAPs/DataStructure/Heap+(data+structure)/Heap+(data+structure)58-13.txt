What basic data structures and algorithms should one learn before starting competitive programming?
Originally Answered: What are the things/algorithms I need to know to be successful in programming competitions?Like you've said, 80% of problems are solved by adapting known Dynamic Programming or graph algorithm. It's pretty basic stuff, so it doesn't matter where and how to learn it. You can start by reading Introduction to Algorithms. After that it's thousands of hours of practice. Luckily for you there are dozens of online algorithm contests you can compete in for free. 1.5k Views Â· 3 Upvotes
