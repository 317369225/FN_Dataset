As we start planning the next edition of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), what should we add and what should we remove if the 4th edition cannot be larger than the 3rd edition?
My vote would be to add Cache-Oblivious Algorithms, more randomized algorithms and to retain van Emde Boas trees (didn't know they were there in the book, and just saw someone's comment about that). vEB tree is a beautiful data-structure, and is essential for CO algorithms. It would be also nice to add something on LSM Trees, Fractal Trees, etc. With some information on Write-Amplification, etc. 4.3k Views Â· 4 Upvotes
