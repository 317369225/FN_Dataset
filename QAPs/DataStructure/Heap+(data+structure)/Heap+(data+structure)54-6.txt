What algorithms and data structures should any software engineer know?
As everybody has mentioned in this thread, there's a common set of data structures and algorithms that you need to know to do basic programming. This includes lists, trees, maps, hashing, sorting etc. If you are into typical enterprise software development, a basic understanding of these will suffice. However, at the same time you need to be aware of the basic and subtle differences between closely related implementations of each of them.
