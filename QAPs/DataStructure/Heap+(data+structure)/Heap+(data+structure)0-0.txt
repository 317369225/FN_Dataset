Why is a heap (data structure) called a heap?
The metaphor is far from being ideal, but there are at least some similarities between the data structure and *some* real-life heaps of things. Consider a max-heap: it is a data structure where the large elements can be seen on the top and the small ones are usually on the bottom. Now imagine a pile of stones of different sizes. A similar thing happens: what you can see on the top are mostly the large ones. If you drop new stones onto the pile, the large ones will usually stay somewhere visible, the small ones will usually fall through the cracks and get lost somewhere at the bottom of the pile. 4.9k Views Â· 44 Upvotes
