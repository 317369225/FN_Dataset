I am a decent programmer in C. However, it is hard to implement all the data structures like heaps, hash Tables, range trees, etc. within the time limit of competitive programming. How do I make the transition to C++ and its useful standard library?
We keep our templates ready for Data Structures if we are going to use our code, and just paste it and then use it appropriately. You are correct that there isn't enough time in a competition to code those skeletons as well as solving the problem, so those skeletons are kept ready and deployed whenever needed. For example, if a range minimum problem is there, then we just paste the segment tree code that is already saved in our local or private cloud repositories. Now, considering the transition to C++, take any past contest and look at the solutions of other coders in C++ for the same problems that you solved in C, or at least for problems you had a clear understanding. Then you will get to know how to use STL. A nice way for this would be to look at solutions by red coders on TopCoder or Codeforces. You can sort solutions by language. And from the next contest, write solutions in C++. 339 Views Â· 2 Upvotes
