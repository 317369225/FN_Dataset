What are some good websites to learn data structures and algorithms?
Here is how I prepared on Data Structures and Algorithms for my Tech Interviews. Strong fundamentals: You can use Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen. Focus on sorting, stacks & queues, trees, graphs, dynamic and greedy programs. Get your hands dirty: Donâ€™t just look at algorithms. Practice in your favorite language editor. Ensure that you are able to write code that successfully handles all corner cases. In time, you will develop the ability to simulate code mentally to spot bugs in it. Practice competitive programming: Solve programming challenges. You can sign up in a number of competitive... (more)
