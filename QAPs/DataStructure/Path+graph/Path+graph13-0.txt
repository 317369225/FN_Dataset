How I can compute all the paths in a graph that has multiple inputs and one output?
NetworkX module in Python has a function called "all simple paths". It computes all simple paths (acyclic non-overlaping paths) from a source to destination. You can apply it for each input of your neural network: all_simple_paths - NetworkX 2.0.dev20140922121148 documentation Beware: the number of simple paths is exponential on the size of the network. The aforementioned function returns an iterator object which generates each path "on-the-fly", since you will likely not have enough local memory to store all paths.
