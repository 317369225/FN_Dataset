How can I find the longest simple path in a directed, not necessarily acyclic graph?
Consider this reduction from a general undirected graph G(u) to the directed graph G(d). Now, for each edge, u-v in the undirected graph G(u), you can add two directed edges u ->v and v -> u . Now , the longest path in the directed graph G(d) would also be the longest path in the undirected graph G(u) and vice -versa due to the above construction.  So , if supposedly , we can find the longest path in the current  directed graph in polynomial time , then we can solve the problem of solving longest path in undirected graph in polynomial time too ( which is impossible of course ,as finding longest path in an undirected graph is NP-complete)
