How do practical path-finding algorithms work on huge graphs?
Google Maps graph might not be that big ( consider Manhattan, NYC has roughly 700 streets). Also, it may only use a interstate highway maps to find the ways between two distanced places and then use a more detailed local map when it's close to the two end points. Social graphs like Facebook friends or Linkedin connections are much larger: hundreds of million of nodes, each nodes connect to ~50 edges. For such graph, I don't think traditional path finding algorithms like DFS,BFS work ( 50^6 is 15 625 000 000 already ).
