Will the social graph continue this path of consolidation over Facebook, or will it reverse its course and be fragmented over a few different social networks?
hi there, This is an interesting question that I actually wrote about recently (see here: http://randallhelms.com/2011/01/...). My feeling is that we will see a consolidation of the trend that is occurring at the moment - that Facebook is no longer just a destination in itself, but is also a tool for accessing other social media services. In a sense, Facebook is becoming something of a hub around which other services are arranged like spokes on a wheel, something that Twitter also does. Consider Quora - I signed up to Quora using my Facebook login, and when I comment on Posterous blogs these days I log in directly through my Twitter account. There was no need to go through a complicated process of setting up an account and filling it with my information - I just clicked a few buttons and I was ready to go. To conclude, therefore, my guess is that Facebook (and Twitter) will continue to be the de facto centres of the social graph, but that people will increasingly use them as tools for accessing other, newer social services.
