What is the easiest way to prove that if the intersection of 2 paths is a connected graph, then the union of the 2 paths has at least one circuit?
The question is actually slightly ambiguous. Intersection of two paths being disconnected does not necessarily imply that their intersection contains a circuit. Consider a [math]P_8[/math], path with 8 vertices, with vertices labelled [math]v_1,...,v_8[/math] taken anticlockwise. Now let [math]P_1=v_2-v_3-v_4[/math] and [math]P_2=v_4-v_5-v_6[/math]. Intersection of [math]P_1[/math] and [math]P_2[/math] is v_4,hence trivially disconnected, but their union does not contain any cycle. If, however, the intersection is more than 1, say [math]a,b[/math], then follow [math]P_1[/math] from [math]a->b[/math] in the union graph and then follow [math]P_2[/math] from [math]b ->a[/math] in the union graph to get a cycle. If the intersection is more than two, then you need to chooseÂ  [math]a,b[/math] such that both lie in different components in the intersection.
