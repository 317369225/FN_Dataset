How are graph measures of neural connectivity (e.g. characteristic path length, global efficiency, clustering coefficient and small-worldness) changed in autism spectrum disorders?
Sorry this is only a tenth of an answer.  My understanding is that neural connectivity is significantly increased in certain parts of the brain during the second trimester of pregnancy.  That reflects abnormally high cell proliferation (and probably reduced cell death) during that phase.  I've simply snagged details from the wordier news sources due to my work with people with autism. Anyway, this is probably redundant, given the detail you're seeking but I don't like seeing unanswered questions on important topics!
