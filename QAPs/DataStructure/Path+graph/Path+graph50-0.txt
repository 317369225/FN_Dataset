For a directed graph, what is the upper bound on the number of simple paths that include all vertices?
First, a simple path that includes all vertices is called a Hamiltonian path. Determining an exact upper bound is probably going to be impossible without iterating over the graph and counting each Hamiltonian path. A loose upper bound would be the maximum number of Hamiltonian paths possible in a graph.Â  If you have [math]N[/math] vertices, then you can think of each possible Hamiltonian path as a permutation of [math]N[/math] vertices, so the upper bound would be [math]O(N!)[/math]. I'm sure there is probably a tighter bound, though.
