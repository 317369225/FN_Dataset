What are some algorithms to find all paths of length L in an acyclic graph?
Floyd–Warshall: The Floyd–Warshall algorithm typically only provides the lengths of the paths between all pairs of vertices. With simple modifications, it is possible to create a method to reconstruct the actual path between any two endpoint vertices. Adding a restriction to length L would be trivial.
