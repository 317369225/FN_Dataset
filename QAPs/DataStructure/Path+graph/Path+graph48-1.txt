Can I get all the shortest paths from source node to destination in graph using bfs?
You can get them using any form of graph search. Your primary concern is the time it will take to perform - with no optimization and no stopping condition, you're going to find paths to every node from the source. This will work just fine on unweighted graphs (where each edge represents same travel distance), but the optimized version of Djikstra's Algorithm will perform better on weighted graphs (where the edges can represent different distances). From the way your question is phrased, it sounds as if you are looking for algorithms to find the shortest path to a specific destination node - that's something that can be done more efficiently than by brute forcing it with BFS - check out Efficient Point-to-Point shortest path algorithms for some possible solutions
