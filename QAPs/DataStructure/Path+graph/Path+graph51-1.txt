Geometry: Which of the two are likelier to meet first: two graph plots moving purely randomly in a plane; or one of the plots moving purely randomly, and the other following some decided path?
Let's suppose that Alice and Bob are looking for each other.  Compare these two strategies. Alice and Bob alternate, each taking one random step.  In two time units they've both taken one step Alice takes two random steps, but Bob stands still.  In two time periods Alice has taken two steps but Bob noneWhich strategy is better? They're equally good.  If you use a coordinate system where the origin is Bob's location, the two strategies have the same path.  For the first strategy, when Bob takes a step, Alice's location changes relative to the coordinate system making it appear that Alice has moved. Note, however, that both of these strategies are better than    3. Alice takes one random step in two time periods, but Bob stands still. Using strategy 3, it will take twice as long for them to meet as either strategy 1 or 2. Updated 75w ago • View Upvotes
