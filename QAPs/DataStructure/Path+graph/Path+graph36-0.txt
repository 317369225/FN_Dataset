Graph Theory:Â Nodes are removed to create partitions in graphs. Are the minimum number of nodes that should be removed to create >=2 partitions in the graph unique?
No. Consider a simple path graph with at least four nodes. Any node excepting the end points can be removed to break the graph in two pieces.
