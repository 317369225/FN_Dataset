What is a program in C/C++/Java to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph input as an adjacency matrix and the nodes traversed in that shortest path?
It depends upon the edge weights. If the graph has unit edge weights, it can be easily done with Breadth-first search. If the graph has non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm is what you are looking for. If the graph can have negative edge weights, look into Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm.
