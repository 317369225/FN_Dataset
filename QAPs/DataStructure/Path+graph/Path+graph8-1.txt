Algorithms:Â  Can we modify Dijkstra to compute longest path for DAG graph?
Dijkstra cannot be used to compute the longest path. Or if it can, it wouldn't be efficient. Simply do the edge relax to all edges in topological order. It will be the most efficient method. To compute the longest path, reverse all the sign of edge weight before doing the calculation and the result will be the longest path in reversed sign. This approach can't definitely be used with Dijkstra because Dijkstra's algorithm doesn't work when negative edges are allowed. Note: Finding longest/shortest path in a DAG is not NP hard. In fact, it's the easiest kind of graph to deal with. We have a very efficient exact algorithm to compute the shortest/longest path in DAG. O(V+E) For the problem to be NP hard, the graph must have cycles.
