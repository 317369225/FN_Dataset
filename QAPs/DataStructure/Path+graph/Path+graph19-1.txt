What are few must-do DP problems and why?
Here is the list of some common DP problems that I think you should know how to implement and their time and space complexities. Computing Fibonacci numbers. Largest Sum continuous Sub-Array problem. Knapsack problem. Text Justification. Sequence alignment or edit distance. Longest Common Sub-sequence (LCS). Longest Increasing Sub-sequence (LIS). Maximum Weighted Independent Sets in Path Graphs. finding Optimal Binary Search Tree. Bellman-Ford algorithm for finding shortest path in a graph. Matrix-Chain Multiplication. Cutting rod problem Coin change problemAll most all ofÂ  these problems can be found in book, Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS .
