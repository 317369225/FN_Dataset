If multiple shortest paths exists between 2 nodes in an undirected graph, is it possible to print all of them using Dijkstra's algorithm?
Chong's solution does indeed work, but I would like to offer a simpler method. Using Dijkstra's algorithm, constructed the distance to all the vertices. Then, for each edge of a graph, assign a direction from the vertex with a smaller distance to the vertex with a larger distance. This would result in a directed acyclic graph. Finally, from the target, perform this recurrence. If dist(s) + weight(s,t) = dist(t), for all incoming edges to t, print out (Paths to s)-s-t
