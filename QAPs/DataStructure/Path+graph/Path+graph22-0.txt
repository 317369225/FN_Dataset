What is an intuitive explanation for the meaning of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a graph's Laplacian?
The eigenvectors of a graph's Laplacian tell you what standing waves or vibrational modes on the graph look like, and the eigenvalues tell you what frequencies they vibrate at. Remember that light waves, sound waves, and the kind of waves you get if you vibrate a string are all solutions of the Wave equation, which I'll write as [math]\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial^2 t} = \Delta u[/math] where [math]u[/math] describes the height of the wave at a given point and time and [math]\Delta[/math] is the Laplace operator [math]\Delta = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_1^2} + ... + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_n^2}.[/math] The Laplace operator measures how much a function differs at a point from the average of the values of the function over small spheres centered at that point. As it turns out, the Laplacian of a graph does something completely analogous: namely, it measures how much a function on a graph differs at a vertex from the average of the values of the function over the neighbors of the vertex. This makes it possible to set up a "wave equation" on a graph, which looks exactly like the above (now [math]u[/math] is a function on the set of vertices of the graph together with a time variable). If you write down a sequence of graphs that approximates, for example, the real line, then you'll get a sequence of "discrete wave equations" whose solutions approximate solutions to the wave equation on the real line. (You can verify this by actually computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Laplacian of a Path graph.) The wave equation on a finite graph is really easy to solve: if the Laplacian has eigenvectors [math]v_i[/math] with eigenvalues [math]\lambda_i[/math], then all solutions are linear combinations of the standing wave solutions [math]u(x, t) = e^{\sqrt{\lambda_i} t} v_i(x)[/math] and these are just waves with a shape determined by [math]v_i[/math] vibrating at a frequency determined by [math]\lambda_i[/math]! (The eigenvalues of the Laplacian are always non-negative, so [math]\sqrt{\lambda_i}[/math] will be purely imaginary. See Euler's formula if you aren't familiar with complex exponentials.)
