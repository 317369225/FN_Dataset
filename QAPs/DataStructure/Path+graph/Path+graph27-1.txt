Is it possible to find the longest path between two vertices in a graph in polynomial time?
Nope..As Cosmin Negruseri said, this problem is NP-complete. Here is an intuitive reasoning why the easier version of the problem (for two specific vertices) can't be solved in polynomial time. If you can findthe longest path between two given points u and v using some polytime algorithm A, then A can be called repeatedly for every pair - O(n^2) of vertices to find the longest path. Thus, either both or none of the problems can be solved in polynomial time. Now assume that the algorithm A - in fact exists and that we run it for every pair of adjacent vertices (pairs of vertices connected by an edge). Then, if the solution returned for longest path in any of these iterations is equal to $|V| - 1$ (the length of the longest path), then since the vertices were adjacent to start with, we have proved the existence of a hamiltonian cycle in polynomial time - or P = NP! Unless P = NP, there is no solution for the longest path problem (both cases in the question).
