How do you explain the definition of data type, abstract data type and data structure clearly?
Firstly talking about data type, a data type is a form of data e.g. there're three main types of data types in C those're int (integer), char (character), float (rational values) *there're others too like double, etc* these define the way the values'll be treated by the compiler or interpreter whether they'll be taken as an integer or a character and so on.. Secondly Abstract Data Type or ADT is the way 'you can interact with data' or you can say 'How you implement various operations on data' say e.g. a queue can be implemented using a linked list or using array in any of the programming languages irrespective of the syntaxes, the way of implementation'll remain the same. ADT is rather a theoretical concept itself instead of being a practical one which most people mis-understand it to be. Lastly, Data Structure is a way of defining data may it be in form of linked list, queue, stack, tree, graph, etc it's study is related more to ' What data structure should be used to keep the Time and space complexity minimum', it's a way through which we can know 'How can we implement the given info. into a definite/defined data structure so as to make the overall program performan efficiently'.
