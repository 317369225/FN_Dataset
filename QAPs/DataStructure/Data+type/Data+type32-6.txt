Can the % operater be used on all data types in C?
When a division is performed the remainder of the operation is given by modulus operator. The modulus operator is denoted in c by symbol %. Say for instance we have two integer values x and y and then the operation x % y called as x modulus y gives the result as (x- (x / y) * y). Say if x=18 and y =5 the x % y gives value as (18- (18 / 5) * 5) which gives (18-15) which results in 3 in other words the remainder of the division operation. But there is a restriction in C language while using the modulus operator. There are two types of numerical data types namely integers, floats, double. But m... (more)
