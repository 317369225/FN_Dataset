In C/C++, why are pointers given a data type?
when you increment the pointer then it is incremented by the no of bytes of your pointer data type.you could even use another pointer data types in your program but u should take care while incrmenting itâ€¦an example program is down here /*why it is DATATYPES FOR POINTERS EVEN THOUGHEVERY POINTER IS STORED IN TWO BYTES */ //WHEN U INCREMENT THE POINTER THEN IT IS INCREMENTED BY THE NO OF BYTES OF ITS DTATYPE //IF U USE INT PTR THEN IT IS INCREMENTTED BY 2 BYTES,IF YIU USE CGAR ,AND WHEN YOU INCREMENT IT ,IT'LL B INCREMENTED BY 1 BYTE ONLY #include<stdio.h> #include<conio.h> void main() {...
