When do programmers specify data types?
The answer can be surprisingly complex. The simple answer(s) have been well covered in existing comments/answers. The answer becomes way more complex when you get involved with numerical analysis, or language design, or security issues. Among others I can’t recall at the moment. Or you start debugging problems introduced by typing. These issues can involve long discussions and really deserve questions of their own. On maybe a forum dedicated to these issues. Quora is a little too general as a reference forum. 23 Views · Answer requested by Kyo Sho
