What data type do transistors use?
They don’t. They use electrical current. A transistor is to a data type as a sheet of paper is to the US Constitution. In other words, transistors are many levels below the concept of a data type, and exist in a completely different domain. A data type, just like the US Constitution, has no physical reality. It’s just an idea. We can translate that idea into bits and bytes and wrap some computer code around it to act upon it, but that is not the idea itself, it’s just an implementation that encodes the idea. A transistor might end up involved in switching or even storing one of those many bits... (more)
