What is the differences between abstract data type and user defined data type?
Not too much. If you're talking about C, a user-defined type is a struct, or a simple typedef, such as defining something like some_type to refer to int, or some other primitive type. An abstract data type (ADT) is a design technique for a user-defined type (typically a struct) that sets up a set of procedures that have exclusive access to the user-defined type's value(s). You can declare variables to be of the user-defined type, but with an ADT, you're not supposed to directly manipulate the value(s) stored in it. Only the procedures you set up for it are supposed to do that. 2.4k Views · 3 Upvotes · Answer requested by Sam Ho
