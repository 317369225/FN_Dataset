What is data type in c++?
Computer hardware can only store and retrieve binary numbers. All other types of data such as English text, graphics, dates, currency, and so forth are just an agreement or an understanding on how to interpret the binary numbers stored and retrieved from computer memory. In C++, the places where you store and retrieve numbers are called variables. And the data type of a particular variable is the agreement on how to interpret the binary number stored in that particular variable. The name and type of variables are defined by C++ Programmers using “definition statements.” 160 Views · 1 Upvote
