It can be implemented in many ways, but one common and simple method is to utilize the linked-list (see What is the linked-list abstract data type?)Â  data structure and keep track of an additional variable, the "top" of the stack. Then it is simple to define the functions of pushing and popping. For the former, (assuming the stack is non-empty) simply let the previous top element point to th... (more)
