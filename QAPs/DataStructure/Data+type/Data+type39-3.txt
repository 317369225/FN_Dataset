What data type should I use for n=10^18?
it depends, do you need fractional parts?   Do you need exact results? a 64-bit integer will be more than enough to represent 10^18 as an exact integer. a 64-bit real, often called a "double", is NOT large enough for that, but it can represent fractional parts, and give you 15 digits of precision.
