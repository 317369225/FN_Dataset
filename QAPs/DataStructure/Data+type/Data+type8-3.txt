What's the difference between a data structure and an abstract data type?
An abstract data type is an interface: it is defined by what operations it will support. It doesn't specify what data structure or algorithmic technique will be used to provide those operations. For example, there's many different ideas that can be used to implement a queue: it could be a circular queue, a linked-list based queue, a queue implemented using two stacks, or any one of a number of other implementations. A priority queue could be implemented with any one of the many types of heaps or BSTs. Coming to the problem you discuss in the question details, a linked list is a specific data ... (more)
