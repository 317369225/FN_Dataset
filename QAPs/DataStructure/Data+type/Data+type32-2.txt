Can the % operater be used on all data types in C?
C allows any data type to be cast or treated directly as an integer. Therefore the mod operator “%” which results in the remainder after integer division: 7 / 2 = 3 7 %2 = 1 Most of the time it makes no sense to use the mod operator on data that represents something else besides integer. Inadvertently doing this can lead to some subtle bugs as an answer may be yielded. In the case of a logical operation that answer may be correct some of the time. If y is 2 and if (x%y == 0) is true the 50 percent of the time true will be returned regardless of the contents of x. Modding by 2 results 0 if the lo... (more)
