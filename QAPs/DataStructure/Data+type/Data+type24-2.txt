Is an Array an abstract data type?
As most splendid things in life, both yes and no. Array can mean the abstract notion of a, usually fixed length, sequence of elements readily accessible by index. Array can also mean the quite concrete notion of a sequence where the elements occupy a contiguous block of memory, with accompanying complexity promises. Look at JavaScript, for instance, where the abstract data type Array is — at least in the naive case — implemented via a non-constant access time concrete data type, such as a binary tree. NOTE: in languages like C++, the array types, both built in and the Boost-inherited one, have ... (more)
