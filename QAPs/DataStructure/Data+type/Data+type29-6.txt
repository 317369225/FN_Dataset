What are the differences between the double and float data types?
A float or single-precision float is 32 bits (4 bytes) long and a double or double-precision float is 64 bits (8 bytes) long. In the IEEE specification, 24 of the bits in the single precision are the "mantissa" which gives the actual value while the rest are for the "exponent" which gives the magnitude. The double has a 53 bit mantissa. This translates to roughly 7 (2^24=16777216) and 15 (2^53=~9.0072*10^15) digits precision respectively. Using similar arithmetic you can figure out the range for the exponent, keeping in mind that everything is represented in base-2. 2.4k Views
