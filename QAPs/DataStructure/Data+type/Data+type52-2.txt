What is the benefit of different data types in programming?
Data types plays a crucial role in any programming language: Set the behaviour of variables . Type safe languages (like C++) have the advantage that many errors are found at compile time (as opposed to run-time). That means using Qt.grey (note the e) would fail to compile because the type is not defined. Better performance and less memory. Behind the scenes Qt.gray is a number, and number operations are much faster than strings. In the pyqt case, because the library wraps a C++ library it looks more like c++ than like Python code. 243 Views
