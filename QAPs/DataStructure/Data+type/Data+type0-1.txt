What are abstract data types?

Common examples of abstract data types are the built-in primitive types in Haskell, Integer and Float. Haskell supports the definition of abstract data types via the module system. In many cases it is not necessary to completely hide the representation of data, so a normal data type definition is sufficient. In addition, parametrized types can be viewed as a kind of abstract type, because they leave some parts of the data type undefined, or abstract. Example: 1)Tree Here's an example of a ... (more)
