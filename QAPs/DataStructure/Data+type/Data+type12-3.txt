Which data type is better either float or double in c++?
There is rarely cause to use float instead of double in code targeting modern computers. The extra precision reduces (but does not eliminate) the chance of rounding errors or other imprecision causing problems. The main reasons to use float : You are storing large arrays of numbers and need to reduce your program's memory consumption. You are targeting a system that doesn't natively support double-precision floating point. Until recently, many graphics cards only supported single precision floating points. I'm sure there are plenty of low-power and embedded processors that have limited floatin... (more)
