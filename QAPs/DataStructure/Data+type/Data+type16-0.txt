Why would anyone use int or long data types in C?
Efficiency, generally. You know that both data types will hold a certain range on all platforms , so as long as you're working within that range (e.g. 16 bit for int, which the standard guarantees) it's sometimes faster to use the native data sizes. Also, if you' re NOT writing portable code e.g. a machine-specific driver or a piece of code that is in a non-portable language (they used to be much more common than now), it may be well worth it for performance reasons. Most compilers will optimise things for you these days, but when I started programming in C, a compiler with optimisations was... (more)
