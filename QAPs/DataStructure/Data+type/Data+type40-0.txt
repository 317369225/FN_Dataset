When do programmers specify data types?
Using the correct data type allows a programmer and the computer language compiler or interpreter to obtain maximal performance or maximal use of resources to perform a task. As an example: if you need to store one million numbers that are all under 250 (such as a log of temperature values), storing that in an array of bytes will use one million bytes of computer memory or storage. Using an array of int or long values will use two, four or eight million bytes of memory, depending on whether the language is using 16 bit, 32 bit or 64 bits to store int or long values. Similarly, a float value m... (more)
