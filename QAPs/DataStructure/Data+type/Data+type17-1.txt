What is the difference between a data type and a data structure?
If you think data type like int is also data structure but in smallest form. Data structures defines how data is organised and what operations we can optimally perform on data stored in them. For example int stores one integer and if we go on further we may have need to store more data hence, we come up with array of integers. Arrays are good for some kind of operations like random access to elements. We get this advantage with array because we designed it in such way that space allocated is continued. Further we need to store more data.We know data will be in RAM and can't have all data in... (more)
