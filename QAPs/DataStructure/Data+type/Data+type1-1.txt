Is 'void' a data type?

It is a type, but it’s one that generally appears as part of another type—a function type involving void or perhaps a pointer (void*). This means that it isn’t really a data type. It behaves differently than other types and you rarely see expressions with just type void. (Composite types like void* are much more common.) Languages with simpler type systems than C or C++ (especially the ML family) often have a type called unit that fills the same role as void, but is a perfectly normal data type. This type has ...
