Which data type is better either float or double in c++?
Using float or double depends on how much memory is needed for a specific task. float can hold values from 2^(-31) to (2^31)-1 for Signed and 2^(-32) to (2^32)-1 for Unsigned variables. double can hold values from 2^(-63) to (2^63)-1 for Signed and 2^(-64) to (2^64)-1 for Unsigned variables. Though internally float datatype is treated as double if needed (usually called implicit typecasting ). 39 Views
