What is the difference between a data type and a data structure?
Originally Answered: What is the difference between data structure and data type? A data type stores certain information without any semantics. A data type can be an integer, a floating point, a string (basic data types) or something more complex like a struct or a union. It contains information. In a data structure information is, well, structured, and there are certain ways you can access the information stored and certain actions you can perform on the data structure. For example in a First In First Out (FIFO) queue you can add information to the back and retrieve information from the front. You can check if the queue is empty. You want that thing in the middle? Too bad. Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Are you satisfied with this answer? YesNo 975 Views
