In C/C++, why are pointers given a data type?
Pointer is a variable which stores the address of that variable to which it is pointing. So the variable to which it is pointing will definitely have a datatype like int, float, char etc. So, a rule states that pointer and the variable to which the pointer is pointing should have the same datatype. So, that’s why pointer is given a specific datatype. All pointers can’t have same data type because of size differences of various data types. An internal mapping is done by the compiler which makes the pointer of a variable compatible to store the address of that particular variable. 255 Views
