One of them applies to member functions only, and specifies that a derived class can supply an alternative implementation of that function. This is the basis of C++'s object oriented programming paradigm, also referred to as runtime polymorphism. It is not the preferred model for abstraction in C++, but there are times where it is useful, and early adopters of the language embraced it enthusiastically, leading to numerous older books and tutorials that focus on this aspect of the language. The other applies to cla... (more)
