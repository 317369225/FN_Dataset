Which data type is better either float or double in c++?
None. They both are crap, inaccurate, slow, haughty and arrogant. "ooooh. Look at me. I'm float. I'm so damn precise that 5 minus 3 is 1.99999999998 or 2.000000001" "ooooh I'm double. If float is bitch. I'm super bitch.0000000000001" Unless there is major division involved, stay clear of them. You will be inviting your doom if you ever checked for equality on a float. They don't talk to others. Add a char to double, it will promote it to double, do its high precision crap and then tell you the answer. No doubt everyone talks to peers but char to int is simple- either sign extend or fill 3 bytes with 0s. ... (more)
