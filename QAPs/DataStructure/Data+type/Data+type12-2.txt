Which data type is better either float or double in c++?
PRACTICALLY it is not that which datatype is good or bad but its all dependent on situation and demand. BASIC DIFFERENCE: it is basically used when we need space of 4 bytes for a variable that also with the higher precision with decimal whereas double needs a space of 8 bytes. In short, although double allows for higher precision in its representation, for certain calculations it would produce larger errors. The "right" choice is: use as much precision as you need but not more and choose the right algorithm. Many compilers do extended floating point math in "non-strict" mode anyway (i.e. use a... (more)
