In C/C++, why are pointers given a data type?
Because different datatypes have different sizes. Dereferencing a pointer is tantamount to reading a number of bytes from the memory location equal to the size of the data type. e.g int *p when dereferenced as *p returns an int value which is equal to the value of sizeof(int) bytes from the memory pointed to by p . You have also have pointers of no size in the form of void * pointers, which is generally avoided especially in case pointer arithmetic is involved. As far as I know its use in C is similar to templates in C++. See Why is pointer arithmetic with “void*” considered b... (more)
