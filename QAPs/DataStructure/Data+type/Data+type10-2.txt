In C/C++, why are pointers given a data type?
All pointers within an architecture are of the same size. They just point to an address in memory. But because at that address in memory there usually is something, an object, a structure, an array of something, or a primitive type, such as an int or a float, it makes sense to keep the information about what the pointer points to with the pointer. So if you have, for instance, a pointer to an array of RGB pixels and you try to assign that to the address of an image header structure, again just as an example, the C++ compiler wouldn't like what you are doing and would generate a warning or a...
