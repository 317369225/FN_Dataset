Which data type is better either float or double in c++?
There is niether called better.For variable type float the typical bit width is 4 bytes ranging between +/-3.4e +/- 38 (7 digits) and for variable type double the typical bit width is 8 bytes ranging between +/-1.7e +/- 308 (15 digits) .So in different case different variable type is good. Now I would like to add that one can use double in place of float without having any trouble but the reverse cant be done cause you can keep 1 lit of water in a 2 lit bottle but you cant keep 2 lit of water in 1 lit bottle similarly the same thing goes for these variable types. 41 Views
