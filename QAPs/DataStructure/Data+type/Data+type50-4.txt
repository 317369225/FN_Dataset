Why string is not a primitive data type in Java?
Java has two variable types, primitives and object references. The only reason why primitives exist is for performance reasons. Having to use an Integer object for a loop iteration for example would not be very efficient as compared to a primitive. Hence, it made sense to have the 8 primitives that we have today. On the other hand, a String is internally an array of characters. An array of primitives is already an Object in java. There could have been some special modification done to still treat a String as primitive, but the performance gains it offered were not worth it. 352 Views Â· 2 Upvotes
