What data type should I use for n=10^18?
Use 64-bit integer data type (signed or unsigned). In C++, long long or unsigned long long or int64_t (last one is platform independent). In Java, long data type (Long is its boxed version). You can also use java.math.BigInteger for arbitrarily large numbers. In Scala, it is Long type. BigInt is a wrapper around Java's BigInteger class. In Python, you don't need to worry. In Haskell, you can use Integer type (not Int type. They are different). It is like BigInteger in Java. It is i64 or u64 in Rust. It is int64 or uint64 in Golang.... (more)
