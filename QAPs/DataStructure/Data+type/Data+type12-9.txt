Which data type is better either float or double in c++?
No any data type is better than other. What is the point of having data types then? They all are used in very different scenarios. float occupies less memory and is less precise (stores values upto 7 decimal places) hence can be used where we don't need very precise results and have a limited memory. double occupies double the memory and is more precise (stores upto 15 decimal places) hence can be used where we need super accurate results like scientific calculations and memory is not a boundation.
