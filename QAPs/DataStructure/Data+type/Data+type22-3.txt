What is the differences between primitive data types and user defined data types?
Primitive data types are basically the fundamental data types such as 1,2,3 which may be integer or character or float values. Whereas the non-primitive data types are the user defined data types such as structures, union, etc. The non-primitive data types can be built using primitive data types. Thank you for your feedback!
