What is void data type?
Void is actually used to to denote a placeholder which is used to represent no-data. But void is often considered as a generic data type as well. An object of void type cannot be declared. But void pointers can be defined. Void pointers are not aware of what type of data its going to point. It all applies when you try to define the pointer and then you cast it to a specific datatype. Again that can be changed to store address of any other datatype and may be this is the reason void is considered as a generic datatype w.r.t. pointers. 429 Views Â· 1 Upvote
