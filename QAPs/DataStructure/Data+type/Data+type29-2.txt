What are the differences between the double and float data types?
A floating point number is an extension of an older format, called fixed-point numbers. A fixed point number would store a fixed number of digits before and after the decimal point (in binary). For example, +1110101.00001000 is an example of a 16-bit fixed point number in 7.8 format (one bit is spent on the sign). A floating point number adds an exponent, something like +1.01101001E0000001. This one would also be 16 bits (the leading 1 is implied). This allows for expressing a much wider range of values, but the precision is variable. It's called a 'floating' point number because you can t... (more)
