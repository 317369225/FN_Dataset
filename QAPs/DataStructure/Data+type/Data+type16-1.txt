Why would anyone use int or long data types in C?
stdint.h was introduced in C99. Many shops still use C90, or C90 with whatever C99 features that are found useful, and is provided by their current implementation. Further, while [u]int_[8|16|32|64]_t guarantees exact size, a platform need not implement them, they are in the words of Fixed width integer types (since C99): "provided only if the implementation directly supports the type". So, they might not be the  be-all and end-all of available, portable, strict sized integers. 791 Views · 4 Upvotes
