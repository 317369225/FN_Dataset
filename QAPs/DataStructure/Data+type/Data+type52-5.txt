What is the benefit of different data types in programming?
Data types tell the compiler or VM how to deal with a bit pattern. The computer stores and retrieves bit patterns in memory, when the bit pattern 0100 0001 is loaded from a memory location, the program needs to know what it is supposed to represent in order to manipulate it properly. If the data type assigned to the variable is an integer type then it is the number 65, if the data type is a character or string type then it is the capital letter A. If the data type is a pointer then it refers to memory address 0x41. The computer (the CPU) does not know or care about data types, but the progr... (more)
