In C/C++, why are pointers given a data type?
Or you can think of another way: specifying a data type for a pointer tells the compiler how many bytes to read from memory when you dereference that pointer.  If your architecture imposes a 4-byte integer, when you dereference an int * variable the compiler will retrieve 4 bytes of data from the place in memory where your pointer points.  This is why you have to be careful with pointers.  If you define a char variable in your code and force an int * to point to that variable (via casting), when you dereference that int * you may get unexpected results (because you are accessing 4 bytes fro...
