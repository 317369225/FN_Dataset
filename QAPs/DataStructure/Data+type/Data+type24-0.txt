Is an Array an abstract data type?
An array is not an abstract type because it indicates that data is stored in a particular way and that various allowed access patterns have well-defined performance characteristic. Accessing an array index, for example, is O(1). To contrast with that, a List is abstract: You can implement a list over an array, or over a linked list, or, heck, even over a hashtable or tree. Each implementation presents a different set of performance tradeoffs. To put it another way - I am not aware of any language that has multiple concrete implementations of arrays.
