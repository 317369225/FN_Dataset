What is the linked-list abstract data type?
you have got a clear view of linked list from previous answers, they are data structure which are linked to other similar data structure. * They are called abstract data type because as we know data structure are indeed user defined data type only so as and we can do operations on linked list (we can do operation on data types only ) so they are data type, we now know why they called data type. *Abstract because we are not given all information about what and all it contain inside it,  only required information is given , so it is ABSTRACT (not concrete). 529 Views · 1 Upvote
