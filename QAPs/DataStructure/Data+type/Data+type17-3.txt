What is the difference between a data type and a data structure?
A data structure is an abstract description of a way of organising data to allow certain operations on it to be performed efficiently. For example, a binary tree is a data structure, as is a Fibonacci heap, AVL tree, or skip list. Theoreticians describe data structures and prove their properties in order to show that certain algorithms or problems can be solved efficiently under certain assumptions. A data type is a (potentially infinite) class of concrete objects that all share some property. For example, "integer" is a data type containing all of the infinitely many integers, "string" is a...
