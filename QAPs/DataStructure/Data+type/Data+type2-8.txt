What are data types in c?
Underneath it all is just memory, a collection of “cells” used to store data - each “cell” being the size of the native “word” for the processor being used. A “word” is generally a byte (8 bits), or with some processors a 16-bit or 32-bit “word” - a “word” is however many bits exist at a single memory address for the given physical processor. For the sake of this answer, we’ll say that a “word” equates to a byte - 8 bits. Data types in C allow the programmer to “abstract” the contents of one or more memory locations into a single “entity” which can be programmatically accessed using a label (... (more)
