What are the differences between the double and float data types?
The standard defines five basic formats that are named for their numeric base and the number of bits used in their interchange encoding. There are three binary floating-point basic formats (encoded with 32, 64 or 128 bits) and two decimal floating-point basic formats (encoded with 64 or 128 bits). The binary32 and binary64 formats are the single and double formats of IEEE 754-1985. They are represented as flat and double datatypes in Java float (binary32): occupies 4 bytes (32 bits) Can be divided into 3 parts : (from leftmost to rightmost bit) 1. sign bit : 1 indicates negative, 0 indic...
