What was Josef Mengele like as a person?
My grandmother was a prisoner at Aushwitz. Her sister was pregnant and they were separated. For some reason my grandmother claims that she "knew" that something bad was going to happen and that if she didn't act now she would never see her sister again. My grandmother has had a lot of stories about her life that have elements that are supernatural, unexplainable. How she sometimes just knows things that there's no possible way she could know. So at this point I'm just guessing somehow god gave her that feeling and made her know these various things. Anyways she knew she needed to act. She saw this well dressed, good looking officer surrounded by soldiers reporting to him so she figured that was the guy in charge. She walked over to him, unfortunately the soldiers around him didn't want her to talk to him and started beating her but somehow she pushed through them, all bruised and bloodied, crawling she kissed this officer's boot and begged him to let her sister come with her and not to separate them. He was apparently impressed by her ability to endure the beatings of his soldiers and probably figured something along the lines of "They're gonna die anyways. Why not let them die together?" and granted my grandmother's request. They were led to the barracks that would be their homes for the next few years. Later found out that her sister was in the line to be gassed. My grandmother had been 16 at the time while her sister was 20. After the war while reading reports about the concentration camps, she came across writings about a doctor, named Mengele, who had performed inhuman experiments on Jewish and Roma prisoners. It had a picture of Dr. Mengele, and she realized that he was the officer that had let her sister live all those years ago. I asked her what she thought of Mengele, if she hated him and such once. She told me that she had forgiven him because he had saved her sister.
