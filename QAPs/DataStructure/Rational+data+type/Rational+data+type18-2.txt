I am against same-sex marriage. Will everyone hate me?
I have a friend, Kevin.  He's the first person I knew to have a same-sex marriage.  His husband Chris seems a good match for him.  Of course, you never know about such things, but I'm hopeful about their future as a pair.  Kevin is just a terrific guy.  He's a very talented pianist and works with various groups in the area where I live including an Opera company and a youth orchestra.  His parents don't approve of his marriage. When Kevin goes home for holiday gatherings it's understood that his husband isn't welcome.  He goes to these gatherings anyway because despite their refusal to understand who Kevin really is, he loves his parents.  He accepts their disapproval as he's accepted it all his life.  It hurts him deeply, but it's pain he's used to.  It's a price he pays out of love for his mother and father.  His story isn't unusual.  I know many gay people who pay this price every day.  And it moves me.  It touches me deep down.  It's a hell of a sacrifice made simply out of love. So no, everyone will not hate you.  Most of the gay people I know, and straight supporters of gay rights like me, will not hate you.  We will accept you as you are.
