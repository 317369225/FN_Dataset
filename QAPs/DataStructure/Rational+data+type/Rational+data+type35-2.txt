How is it possible to have a rational and civil discussion about the Israeli Palestinian conflict?
Oh, I have plenty of civil discussions on Quora without a problem.  Yeah, I run into the haters and don't take it to mean that because they exist, I can't have civil discussions.  Yeah, they might call me names or question my integrity, but that is their problem.  They don't last long on Quora and on one or two occasions, I've helped them out the door.  I've also called to the attention of Quora some pro Palestinian folks who I felt were very good contributors to the site on the topic.   In fact, one of my favorite people to discuss the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is a Palestinian born IRL friend.  Raised on the West Bank, he was there in '67 when the Israelis took over.   But, he'll say that the best the Palestinians ever had it was the period between '67 and the First Intifada, so, its easier to talk about.  The family really does not look favorably upon the days when Jordan controlled the West Bank. On Quora, my favorite pro Palestinian is Egyptian Adel Helal.  We almost never agree  on  anything. Updated 31w ago • View Upvotes
