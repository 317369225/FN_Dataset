What is the difference between data science and statistics?
I'm in complete agreement with David. I've been asked this question before as well and have even gone down the path of scope discussions. However due to my recent product brainwashing (I mean training) I would suggest starting with the problems they can or should seek to solve, each respectively for a clear distinction. For instance Data Science seeks specifically to solve market based problems through either insights or innovation which can be derived from supporting and predictive data or in some cases comparativeness data. Pure Statistical Analysis does not necessarily have to be comparative and would be more an exercise of pure math and the conclusions you can arrive at are mathematically based as opposed to comparatively based. Such as the case for instance with cleansing mailing addresses or many other types of data processing such as merge purge logic and more. These aren't statistical exercises so much as data exercises based off other data sets. This is where you would set one as your delta and develop various algorithms to match, compare and correct the sample data based on delta. Edit: Disambiguation Statistics is the application of the ability to collect and interpret quantitative data intelligently/rationally. Statistics would only be one discipline within the several that would have to be leveraged as tools in order to perform Data Science. Much like a Rocket Scientist deals with Stats, Physics and more a true Data Scientist must also have cross discipline training and insights into various forms of both mathematical schools of thought and various other ones ranging from Information Technology to Computer Science. Depending on the vertical being focused on other forms of education would also become important such as Sociology or Psychology, Engineering or Geography and the ability to apply them in rational and meaningful ways to the data you are dealing with.
