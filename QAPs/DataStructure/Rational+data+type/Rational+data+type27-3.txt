Why do atheists say something is wrong without providing proof?
"Prove" what,exactly? It comes as a surprise to most theists but their beliefs have never proven, so there's no need for atheists to disprove them. First prove that the being whom you worship exists, and then we can begin to engage in a serious debate.. The elements which would have to be proven by believers for atheism to seriously challenged are: The existence of a supernatural entity who can't be seen, heard or touched. The fact that this unseen entity in manner interacts with the natural world as we currently know it. The fact that these "interactions" can be measured and quantified in manner which would provide empirical evidence they are actually "occurring." That any form of being exists after physical death That there is an alternate reality where anyone (believers or non-believers) will "reside" after their physical deaths. The fact any states of being resembling karma or reincarnation exist. Since empirical proof has never been presented that any of the above exist, have existed or can possibly exist is woefully lacking despite the myriad scientific advancements of mankind, the burden of proving anything remains on the shoulder of believers, not atheists.
