Why do atheists say something is wrong without providing proof?
Science, and criminal law for that matter, require proof of POSITIVE claims. The burden of proof is over the one who claims divinity EXISTS. For example, the accusation: "I argue to the court that who ever wrote this question, killed 22 boy scouts, and hid them in his basement, because he hasn't provided proof that he hasn't. ARREST HIM AT ONCE!" won't cut it. And a good thing too.
