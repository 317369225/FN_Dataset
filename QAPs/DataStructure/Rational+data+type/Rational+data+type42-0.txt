Can the Langlands Program be described in layman's terms?
Let me give it a quick go. I'll be quite vague and restrict myself to special cases some of the time. I'll number footnotes in brackets and include them at the bottom. So, there are these things called "groups". They basically are a formal way of talking about symmetry. When you come across a random group, it's easier to study it if you view it as the symmetries of something. This is called a "representation" of the group. We'll be talking about a special type of representation called a "linear representation" (but usually just called a "representation" for short, as I'll be doing in the rest of this exegesis (can I use that word here?)). This is what happens when a group is viewed as the symmetries of a "vector space" (such as three-dimensional space [math]\mathbf{R}^3[/math]). The prototypical example of a symmetry group of a vector space is the "general linear group", [math]GL(n,\mathbf{C})[/math], which consists of the invertible [math]n\times n[/math] matrices with entries in the complex numbers [math]\mathbf{C}[/math]. And we consequently know a lot about this group.[1] One side of the Langlands program deals with a certain type of representation of a certain type of group. The groups are what are called "reductive linear algebraic groups (over the rational numbers)". Examples of these include [math]SO(3)[/math] (the "special orthogonal group in three variables"), which is basically the group of rotations about a point in three-dimensional space; [math]GL(n)[/math], which is the group of invertible [math]n\times n[/math] matrices; and even the Lorentz group of transformations of four-dimensional space-time in special relativity.[2] The word linear in there means that they are basically groups of matrices. As things go, these are, in some sense, relatively uncomplicated groups. Being matrices, linear groups already come with some natural representations. But we're interested in something much more complicated (read interesting) than that. The representations studied are called "automorphic representations" and are typically *infinite-dimensional*.[3][4] As things go, these are rather complicated representations. The underlying vector spaces are spaces of very interesting functions satisfying nice symmetry properties (functions such as "modular forms"). One way to phrase the Langlands conjectures is to say that the collection of all automorphic representations (i.e. all these complicated, generally infinite-dimensional, representations of all these different groups) are actually just the finite-dimensional representations of some other group, called the Langlands group.[5][6] This group is much more complicated and since this is all a conjecture it's not known to exist. So, there's some trade offs going on where you trade in complicated representations of a bunch of relatively uncomplicated groups for (maybe) simpler representations of one rather complicated group. You can think of this as parametrizing these automorphic representations by the finite-dimensional representations of this one group, the Langlands group. That's a kind of "representation-theoretic" point of view on the Langlands conjecture (and remember that Langlands started off as a representation theorist). And just to be clear, the assertion is that there is some sort of correspondence between automorphic representations and representation of the Langlands group, so given one type of thing, you get a corresponding other type. Neither direction of this correspondence is known in general. Where does number theory come in? Well, since the algebraic groups are "over the rational numbers" and, as mentioned in footnote [4], we're really looking at the "adele points" of these algebraic groups, there's already some "arithmetic" (another word for "number theory") going on. But here's the *huge* link: the Langlands group should be pretty close to something called the "absolute Galois group of the rational numbers". What is this thing? Well, it is the group of all symmetries of the roots of all polynomials (whose coefficients are rational numbers). So, as the name attempts to imply, this is basically the mother of all symmetry groups of the "arithmetic" of rational numbers. To give an idea of what this "Galois group" is, think about the quadratic formula: the roots of [math]ax^2+bx+c[/math] are [math]\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}[/math]. That [math]\pm[/math] reflects a symmetry in the roots: if [math]1+\sqrt{2}[/math] is the root of a polynomial, then so is [math]1-\sqrt{2}[/math]. There is also a "cubic formula" for roots of a degree three polynomial, which involves not only taking square roots, but also cube roots; and a "quartic formula" for degree four, which also involves taking fourth roots. However, due to the nature of the symmetry of the roots of a general degree five polynomial, there is *no* "quintic formula", even if you allow taking fifth roots, sixth roots, etc. This information is all contained in the absolute Galois group of Q and one of the central problems of number theory is to understand this Galois group and unlock its mysteries. How does the Langlands program help? Well, we know of one rather complicated representation of the absolute Galois group of the rationals, namely the one that comes from its definition as the symmetry group of the roots of all polynomials. But it would be really helpful to have smaller, more manageable representations. These are provided by the Langlands conjecture: an automorphic representation should correspond to a representation of the Langlands group and since this group is close to the Galois group, under nice circumstances the automorphic representation will provide us with a (finite-dimensional) representation of the absolute Galois group of the rationals. Such a thing is called a Galois representation and is all the rage in number theory these days. One more thing I want to mention about the Langlands program is the following. It provides you with a kind of correspondence between Galois representations and automorphic representations. Now, there are some things that are really easy (maybe completely trivial) to do with Galois representations, which under this correspondence become extremely interesting facts about automorphic representations. And vice versa, some very important questions to do with Galois representations are really easy to solve on the automorphic side of things, so if you know the Langlands conjectures are true you can just move things over. As alluded to in another answer, Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is a good example of this. What Wiles proved (the Shimura–Taniyama conjecture), is saying that to certain Galois representation there is a corresponding automorphic representation. A solution to Fermat's equation (if such a thing existed) would give a Galois representation. By Wiles' result, a specific case of the Langlands conjectures, there would then be a corresponding automorphic representation. It is "easy" to see that this automorphic representation cannot exist. So that's an example of something that's easier on the automorphic side than on the Galois side. Some more advanced comments: What I've discussed above is basically the global Langlands conjectures over the rational numbers. These conjectures are actually stated for what is called a "global field" (the rationals are a specific example, the reals are not). There are also the local Langlands conjectures. These involve "admissible representations" instead of "automorphic representations" and "local fields" instead of "global fields" (the prototypical example of a local field is the field of p-adic numbers, also the real numbers). Part of the Langlands program is that there should be some sort of "compatibility" between the local and global conjectures. There are also related conjectures: the geometric Langlands conjectures and the p-adic local Langlands correspondence. Footnotes: [1] This is basically what "linear algebra" is about, and we know things such as the "Jordan canonical form" and the "Gram–Schmidt process".Or in bigger words, we know about "conjugacy classes" and the "Iwasawa decomposition". [2] The "algebraic group" bit means that, when I think, say, of GL(n), I'm really thinking of it as a family of groups as follows: you can think of all invertible matrices with entries that are rational numbers, or the ones with entries that are real numbers, or with entries that are complex numbers; those are three of the groups in the family. They are called the "rational points", the "real points", and the "complex points" of the algebraic group, respectively. [3] This means that we are studying ways to view the groups as symmetries of infinite-dimensional vector spaces. Remember that space (at least before the 1900s) is three-dimensional, so infinity is a whole lot of dimensions. [4] These are really representations of a specific member of the family of the algebraic group, namely the "adele points" of the algebraic group. The adeles are basically a souped-up version of the rational numbers that keeps track of all sorts of information about the rational numbers. [5] In technical terms, the assertion is that the collection of automorphic representations forms a "neutral Tannakian category". [6] This is a lie as stated. Really, you have to break up the collection of all automorphic representations into a bunch of things called L-packets. Each of these packets contains a finite number of automorphic representations; no two L-packets contain the same automorphic representation; and every automorphic representation is in an L-packet. The L-packets should correspond to representations of the Langlands group. In this way, the conjectures themselves are vague in that part of the conjectures is that there is *some* way to break up things into L-packets, but no specific recipe to do this is given.
