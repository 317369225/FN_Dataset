What drug compounds were initially developed using rational drug design?
Nearly all compounds discovered have gone through a process of rational design. For some compounds the 3D structure of the target is known, for others it's unknown, and for others the target is unknown. In all cases a compound goes through many optimizations. The chemical structure is modified to see how the change affects potency and many other properties. More changes follow based on rational data analysis. In those cases where a target is known and there is a 3D structure available, one can also use various techniques to look at protein-ligand interactions and suggest ideal changes to the compound. This is not as straightforward as one may think, and many times a lot of serendipity goes into it as well. The protein structure changes conformation, the ligand may bind in a different way, and so on. To answer the question, one of the first compounds discovered by looking at protein-ligand interactions was Relenza, see more on wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zan.... This was discovered in 1989, at time where computers where not so powerful for these type of calculations, although it's interesting that the methods used today are not so different.
