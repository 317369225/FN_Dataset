I am against same-sex marriage. Will everyone hate me?
Some people hate those who threaten or even just disagree with them. That appears to be a core part of human nature, unfortunately. Others will be disappointed that you feel this way and perhaps choose not to associate with you, but that doesn't quite rise to the level of hatred. Others will disagree and still feel comfortable being your friend. You can help facilitate this by being kind and respectful of their perspective; hopefully they will return the favor. Of course, many will agree with you wholeheartedly.
