In Matrix Revolutions, what's going on when Neo and a sentinel appear to merge?
There is a very interesting fan theory that Zion is actually just an extension of the matrix, a second level, if you will, to prevent humans from realizing that they have not escaped. It provides a better explanation for the existence of Neo's powers outside of the Matrix, as well as clarifying a few of these confusing points from the movies (such as getting into the matrix without jacking in). As a result, I think that that successfully explains how a life force from a sentinel traveled through a glass windshield. With this theory in mind, I think that this is a callback to the ending of the first movie, in which Neo fused with Agent Smith, and Agent Smith died, only to be tied to Neo. It is generally regarded that most of the sentinels in Revolutions were corrupted by agent Smith. Assuming that he had control of these few, it can be perceived as an complete reversal. In the first movie, the introduction of humanity to machine broke them both, but allowed them to become stronger. In the final movie, the introduction of machines to humanity destroys them both. In the end, that is the moral of the trilogy: Without humanity, technology is just a means to destruction.
