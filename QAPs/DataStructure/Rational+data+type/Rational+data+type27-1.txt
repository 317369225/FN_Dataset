Why do atheists say something is wrong without providing proof?
In certain circumstances, I've seen atheists pull evidence and show it to a religious person and Joshua said, some people just don't want to believe it. For example, just watch Richard Dawkins conversation with Wendy Wright on creationism. For me, and for most rationalists, all six parts of this youtube conversation was excruciatingly painful to watch simply because he kept providing facts and citing examples of evidence and Darwins Theory for Wendy (and she would never believe any of it and kept asking for cold hard facts. I found this even more upsetting because there is no way she could prove her side and yet she was demanding evidence from Richard. I guess the key word here is 'believe'. Christianity asks people to have faith and 'believe' when atheism asks people to look at rational facts and evidence. These two will never see eye to eye unfortunately. As far as the "it hurts" comment, I'll never understand that. Christians don't offend me personally because they believe something different than I do, so why should my "beliefs" or lack thereof offend them? Reminds me of this cartoon I saw awhile back:
