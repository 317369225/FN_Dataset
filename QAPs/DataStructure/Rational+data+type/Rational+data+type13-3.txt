What are the boolean values in Java?
The boolean datatype in Java, and every other programming language that has a boolean data type built into it, is designed and implemented on the 'output' of either a zero or a one (0 or 1). If the statement in question, equals the declared value of the boolean variable, then the implicit return value would be a zero, meaning it is true. If the statement does not equal the value of the declared variable, then the implicit return value would be 1 and the statement would be false. For example: boolean earth = true;while (!earth) {    if (mercury) {        // code something     }    else if (venus) {        // code something    }    else if (mars) {        // code something    }    else if (jupiter) {        // code something    }    else if (saturn) {       // code something    }    else if (uranus) {      // code something    }    else if (neptune) {      // code something    }    else          earth = true;} In the code that I created above the boolean datatype, declared with the boolean keyword and the variable earth, was initialized to be true. Then a while loop was created, and the terminating condition of the while loop was !earth (not earth). By doing this, we are programming an instruction that says cycle through the set of statements that reside with in the while loop, until earth equals true. Once the last conditional statement with in the loop (the 'else' statement) is reached, the boolean variable of earth, is once again stated to be true. At that point in time the while loop will terminate its execution, and control will passed back to the main part of the program. It should also be stated, just for clarification, that in Java methods can also be declared of type boolean. In which there would be an explicit boolean return value. Example: public boolean TheBull(){    boolean bull = true;    /*     * code something that has relevance to the outcome     * of the overall program that needs to be encapsulated     * by the method, and can meet the condition of true or false     */      return bull; } I hope this helps!
