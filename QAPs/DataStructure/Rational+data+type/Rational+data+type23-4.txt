Why do people appear to be so systematically misinformed about basic facts?
While information may be readily available, that doesn't mean it will be readily sought out or digested or even understood by all. Humans still tend to rely on confirmation bias and subjective trust in traditions and authorities in their life. Once a person has formulated an idea about an issue or set their mind on an "answer" to a query they have, it is usually difficult to override this. The human brain likes to believe it has it figured out. Parents are a strong influence in the next generation, in addition to peers. When a person is relying on a social circle for learning and gaining knowledge about their world, it becomes very much a cycle of ignorance in many cases. There is also an incorrect understanding of what is factual and what is opinion. Quite frankly, while there are many people who might be informed, there are not very many who are educated. There is a difference.
