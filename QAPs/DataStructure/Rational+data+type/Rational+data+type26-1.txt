What does transformation in IT really mean in the short term?
It really means that IT/multi-system solutions professionals will have to navigate this ever-expanding cloud connectivity market and departmental software solutions. Instead of traditional on-premises integrations IT professionals will have to have a deeper understanding of potential cloud solutions to enable a business professional at any level of the business. An emphasis will be placed on agile solutions to be reliably connected regardless of the software used or updates made.
