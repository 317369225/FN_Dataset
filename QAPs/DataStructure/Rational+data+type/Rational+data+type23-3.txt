Why do people appear to be so systematically misinformed about basic facts?
The question is about people being, "systematically misinformed," not just ignorant, uninformed, or uninterested.  I think the most fundamental reason is, people want the world to be simple and people want the answers to all problems to be simple.  We like binary choices.  We like cheering for out team and booing the other team (as Marcus Geduld said in his answer).  We dislike and underestimate complexity, especially in public life.  If you believe in simple choices, then once you've made up your mind, additional facts are irrelevant. People's choices of simple answers limit what they pay attention to and/or believe.  This is known as confirmation bias. In extreme cases, people limit their information intake to sources that share their biases.  It would be great if schools could teach and newspapers/magazines/TV could report that most political and economic events have different effects on different people.  How many people are better off, and what is the range of their benefit?  How many people are worse off and what is the range of their benefit?  If you look at these questions and think, "I don't care," you might be part of the problem :-)
