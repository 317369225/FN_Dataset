How much does it cost a developer to make an iPhone app and submit it to Apple?
Before someone can give you a good answer, they’ll have to know what kind of house you want to build and who you want to build it.   Who is your architect and how will he or she design it?   Mobile app development is very similar, we need to know things like, iPhone, iPad, Android or Windows? Do you need a web portal to manage content? Do you plan to have in-app purchasing? Is the user interface design generic, customised or branded? etc.   Even after understanding the above mentioned rational if you want a ballpark estimate, then I would say that to develop a quality app with around 10 screens, with offshore development model, it should cost you around USD 5,000 if you want to launch it on one platform, either iOS or Android. If you want to get everything done in US, then this can easily cost you around USD 8,000k to 80,000k.     To understand the factors which affect the cost of developing an app,let’s understand different types of apps in the market today.   Types of Apps:   1) Basic functionality App 2) Data Driven App 3) Games 4) Modification of in-built features 5) Completely dynamic app 6) Custom utilities   Process of App Development   1) Wireframing 2) UI Design And Programming 3) Application Framework And Server-Side Programming 4) Development of Web Services also called as APIs (Application Programming Interface) 5) Testing 6) Backend security 7) Setting up Cloud 8) Submitting to the app store     Interested in designing your own app?  Are you looking to hire a skilled developer or the app development company to build an app within your budget?    We’re always open for exciting and challenging new projects.
