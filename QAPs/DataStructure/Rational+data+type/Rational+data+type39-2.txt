How does someone get a meeting with angel investor David S. Rose?
David -Brava!  Outstanding detailed answer that companies should apply to seeking meetings with ANY investor or potential advisor.  As I continually advise companies: Know WHY you are asking the person you are asking. Know WHAT you are asking for (yes, people really do just start talking about their company without a mission for their calling). And, you really should know more about me and be able to tell me why you think I would be a good fit to invest in your company not why YOU are a great company in which I should invest (that part comes later). I am much more impressed by companies who know exactly why I would be the best person to help them either with money, advice, experience etc..
