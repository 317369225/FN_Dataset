How much does it cost a developer to make an iPhone app and submit it to Apple?
Consider the opportunity cost of time and what a developer and designer could be making with it, and where they are. In NYC, you could be making 12k/month freelancing if you're a developer, or you could spend the same time building an app. But remember it's not just a developer, but also a designer, and not all apps are created equal, so a good team will cost more. Hope that helps.
