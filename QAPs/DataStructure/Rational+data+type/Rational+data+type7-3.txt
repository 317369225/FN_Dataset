Do you still think Americans need to own guns following the latest shooting incident in Arizona?
I believe America has two different cultures. One that owns guns, believes in guns and will defend them.  They say that guns are safe in the hands of responsible gun owners with training. One that sees the violence, poverty, and shootings and says that our gun culture is out of control. The statistics and the research don't matter.  I'm sure that a very high percentage of guns that exist are in the hands of responsible gun owners.  We actually have one, but it's in a locked gun case in the shed and an unfired antique Winchester.  There are too many guns in this country and too many guns in the hands of those that are not responsible. The laws should change, even though Americans should continue to be allowed to hold guns.
