Is Emacs Lisp the same as Common Lisp?
No, it's not the same.  Dynamic scope is probably the biggest difference.  The 'cl package will help and I highly recommend it, but differences remain. Yes, it's easy to go on to Common Lisp, at least compared to going there knowing only Java or C++.  It's probably slightly easier than going there knowing just Scheme (I think.  I know all 3 but not in that order).  Elisp and CL are closer to each other than to Scheme, IMO. Probably yes, it is the best path, not because of any superiority of the language itself but because living in emacs and having so many immediately useful things written in it, it is very accessible.
