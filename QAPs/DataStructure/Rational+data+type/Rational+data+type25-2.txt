What was Josef Mengele like as a person?
Creepy as hell. From what I understand, he displayed no outward aggression or hostility most of the time. In fact, he purposely and carefully crafted friendships with the children of the camp - even getting them to refer to him as "Uncle Josef". He would appear as a father figure in this way, comforting children and lulling them into a false sense of security. Until he was ready for his experiments, that is, and sliced them open alive with a rusty blade and no anesthetic. Or else force-feeding them poison, human waste, etc. slowly enough for him to observe all possible disease as it occurred. He would leave them to die after torture, without anesthetic, suffering to their last breath. I'm sorry for being so graphic, but as this IS the question and my response is quite shockingly the truth without sugar-coating it, it's unfortunately necessary. I can tell you one thing - if the Devil does exist, it was within Josef Mengele.
