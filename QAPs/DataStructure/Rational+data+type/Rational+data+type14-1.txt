What do the following terms mean: variable, data type, one dimensional array and subroutine? Can you provide an example of each?
Let me explain this by taking examples from mathematics. What is a variable? Variable is a placeholder for a value. for example in Mathematics(algebra) we have variables like [math]x,y,p,a,q[/math] etc.  e.g. [math]x^2+2x+a=0 [/math] here x and a are variables and x can have any value, either positive, negative, fraction, imaginary, complex number. So basically variable is a name for a value. What is data type? Data type is constraint for a variable. It tells us that a variable can contain only a specific type of value. for above example we can say that x can be a real number or whole number or positive real number, etc. E.g [math]x^2+2x+a=0  \in mathbb{R}[/math] Now here x is a variable who can have only real values (not imaginary/complex or any other type) so the datatype of 'x' is Real number. Now lets compare with programming language(C Programming Language) #include<stdio.h>int main(){         int a,p;         float b;         bool x;                  printf('Hello Quorans !');} Here we have 4 variables ('a', 'p', 'b', 'x'). and three types of datatype (int, float and bool). int = integer float = fraction/rational/irrational/ real numbers bool = boolean (True or False) data type of varaible 'a' and 'p' is Integer, data type of varaible 'b' is Float/Double, and so on. [NOTE:] A variable name can be anything made of english alphabets(small/capital letters) and underscore. although few languages support '$' also. you can use numbers in variable name but you can't start a variable name with a digit. e.g.  var23 is a valid variable name but not 2var3. Every programming language has its own datatypes. but there are few  common datatypes , like integer, string, boolean, array/list etc. other  than these programming language can have its own datatype (For example  Python has Dictionary datatype) What is a Subroutine? In mathematics we have functions. [math]f(x) = x^2+1 [/math] now this function will return the sum of squre of input value plus 1 if we give input 4 it will give us 17. [math]f(4) = 4^2+1 = 17  [/math] exactly for same behaviour we have subroutine/functions in programming language. #include<stdio.h>int myfunction(int x) {      return x*x + 1; }int main(){        int var = myfunction(4);  // here "myfunction" will give us 17 which will be type of integer so we will // store that value in a variable called "var" which should be of same type (i.e. Integer)                  printf("%d", var);} So here "myfunction" is a subroutine/function/module.
