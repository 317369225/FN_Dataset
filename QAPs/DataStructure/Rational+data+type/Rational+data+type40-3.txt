What does Balaji Viswanathan think about the BBC documentary "India's Daughter", and the admiration and criticism it has got?
Government somewhat overreacted on the documentary issue, I think that's what BBC needed, hype. The whole censorship row made it popular otherwise video is much below the standards of BBC. Media brings on the news, people discuss about it, news becomes an issue.People forget about it,something else becomes an issue.Â  That's how media work these days. Violence against a gender, is our failure as a modern society, only society can solve it. I don't think banning a documentary or showing a documentary makes a difference.
