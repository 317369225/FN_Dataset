In Matrix Revolutions, what's going on when Neo and a sentinel appear to merge?
Neo's awareness that we are all one. What is demonstrated in this scene is that the entire universe down to the smallest particle is a flow - what we perceive is what we are conditioned to perceive. As awareness changes, so does our perception. There is no "solid" mass.
