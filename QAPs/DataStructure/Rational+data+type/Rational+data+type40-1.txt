What does Balaji Viswanathan think about the BBC documentary "India's Daughter", and the admiration and criticism it has got?
Balaji Viswanathan's answer is one of the best answer that should be seen by our blind,spineless Indian media who follows western masters to get the liberal certificate from them.Further I like to add that I understood gender issues are big problem in India but I was disgusted the way western media used it against us as a racial attack weapon to demoralize/stereotype entire country based on acts of few psychopaths.Will they call all Americans mass murderer or all Arabs minority haters ? nope....they don't have balls to do that but they will keep coming for rising India as we are too weak to ignore their dictate. I can't begin to tell you how much damage this hate campaign has done to Indians abroad and within the country....few of our enemy states are using it as psy-ops weapon against India,Islamic states who never give a damn about women rights,are now giving lectures to India on this issue,Feminists and their white knights are shaming entire country to look cool and to get appreciation from their western masters....I can go on and on! Oh and now we are getting lecture from Middle east countries about women rights and gender issues.....what an irony ! Worse...few of our stupid politician has worsened the situation by making sexist comments which have been used by western media as a weapon to prove Indian govt doesn't help women right activists. This kind of hate campaign against rising countries( which poses significant threat to western economy and who have different social/political/foreign policy) is nothing new.I remember how they used to mock Chinese govt on the issues like pollution,human rights......that campaign has been slowed down as china has got western countries in her pocket and western,pseudo liberal,leftist media has got new target :India. Our govt's over sensitive nature is not helping at all....sometimes ignorance towards miscreants can be an advantage.But that doesn't mean we should not work on gender issues in India(particularly in few states where male patriarchal,masochistic,aggressive outbursts are synonymous with manliness and the mindset against women is alarmingly dangerous).....but whatever we do,first,we need to stop this racial attack against India in the disguise of women empowerment. This pseudo liberal western media has no time to look into Arab/Islamic countries where women are under 16th century dark age rules or in their own countries where rape/sexual attaks are on the rise.EX-Rotherham mass rape case of UK,Rapes and mistreatment of female soldiers in US army,income equality/closeted sexism towards women  in many western countries etc etc.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal But their biggest and the most dangerous racial attack has been towards Indian men.They will never talk about Nirbhaya's boyfriend who almost died protecting her .Do they remember Reuben-Keenan....two Mumbai youth who died protecting their female friends or millions of of other Indian men who directly or indirectly fight for women rights everyday side by side with their women counterparts ? Will they ever acknowledge that Indian govt/Supreme court/Legislative councils are trying to go extra miles to protect the women rights ? Two Young Men’s Deaths Stun Mumbai The most bizarre part of this entire thing is how Indian media over sensitizes each rape issue and portray India as a hell for all women.They never offer true solidarity towards victims or even sometimes,they jump to the conclusion without investigating the true nature of that case.Take the example of Rohtak bus incident where false allegations were made against a man in the pretext of petty issues such as occupying bus seats......but our media painted that man as a potential "rapist" and hailed those two women as brave-hearts who were beating that man to occupy the bus seats. Page on in.com Is there more to Rohtak sisters' story than they claim? To our Indian media and Indian elite class....when will you learn to think on your feet without blindly following your western masters?When will you investigate to find the truth and help the real victims without over sensitizing these harrowing crimes? To pseudo liberal,racist,biased western media....We know you have no intention to help Indian women who actually need help....we know you will be coming for us with your racist attacks with tweaked statistics and rhetoric arguments....we know India/Indians will face more subtle yet dangerous racist attacks in future...but you should know,this is not journalism and bring it on ! P:S: Hello BBC...I'm waiting for the day when you will make movies about these daughters of India.I hope you will show world about the both sides of a large coin called India.
