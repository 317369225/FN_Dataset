How do INTJs think?
I'm not going to give a scenario, but as for what you want to understand: INTJ types lead with Ni first. That's intuition, not thinking. Intuition is a perception function, not a rational one. This effectively means the INTJ needs to first see for themselves the extent or nature of the problem, which may also yield insight into the solution. Then the INTJ can "use" Te, the thinking component, to access and figure objective methods and data to apply to secondary tasks like figuring out any corollaries, practically resolving the problem and/or expressing the solution. This is why feedback from INTJ types will often request specifics or details - not because INTJ are detail-oriented thinkers, but because they reveal the whole mess as-is for an INTJ to find the best solution. There is a similar kind of process for every Pi-Je (IxxJ) type with different specific methods of looking at data and different types of resolutions given.
