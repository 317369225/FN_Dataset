How can the number [math]e[/math] be irrational (follows no pattern) if its Taylor Series representation is constructed using a beautiful pattern?
Beautiful pattern and irrational aren't necessarily the same thing. The Taylor series for [math]e[/math] is beautiful and indeed the sum [math]\Sigma_{r=0}^{r=n}\frac{1}{r!}[/math] is rational when [math]n[/math] is finite. But whenÂ  [math]n[/math] is infinite that changes. The pattern remains beautiful but [math]e[/math] being irrational means that it cannot be represented as a fraction of 2 integers, which does not contradict the beauty of its Taylor series representation. It just means that the beauty of the pattern given by the Taylor series is different to the repeating pattern beauty of the decimal representation of a rational number. Funnily enough Fourier's proof that [math]e[/math] is irrational comes from the Taylor Series. The general idea is to suppose that [math]e=\frac{p}{q}[/math], where [math]p[/math] and [math]q[/math] are coprime integers and show, using [math]e=\Sigma_{n=0}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{n!}}[/math], that [math]x:=q!(e-\Sigma_{r=0}^{r=q}\frac{1}{r!})[/math]is an integer strictly greater than [math]0[/math] and strictly less than [math]1[/math], which gives a contradiction as no such integer exists.
