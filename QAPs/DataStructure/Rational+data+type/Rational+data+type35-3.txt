How is it possible to have a rational and civil discussion about the Israeli Palestinian conflict?
The irrational, propaganda-based discussions currently held on Quora are almost always about the past. Who was first to attack? Who was first to settle the land? Who killed more and who has more respect for life? Considering the extraordinary amount of junk and fiction spread nowadays via the internet, I fear it will be impossible to roll things back to the point where discussions about the past are based on facts. I think the only way forward and the only way to have rational and respectful discussions is to talk about the future. To discuss the big and small steps each side can take (perhaps simultaneously) and the effects those steps will have on the two peoples and the movement forward. Only this type of discourse will slowly-but-surely begin the long process of turning fear into hope, hatred into compassion, swords into plowshares, both here on Quora and in the land itself.
