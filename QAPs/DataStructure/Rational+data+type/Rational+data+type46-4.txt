What is the difference between data science and statistics?
It is just hype. "Statistics" has a negative connotation for a few reasons: It is more often used for descriptive statistics (mean, median, etc) than for predictive statistics. In the US educational system at least, statistics is the subject you take if you can't handle calculus. Hence it doesn't get the kind of respect most mathematical subjects get. This is kind of ironic since the core mathematical operation in statistics is integration. In the academic world outside statistics there is a perception that it is a little focused on distributions and has somewhat of a stamp collecting feel to it. Hence people who don't want to do this tend to call what they are doing something else ("data mining", "machine learning", or now "data science"). This is a common cause of handwringing among statisticians. Updated 222w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
