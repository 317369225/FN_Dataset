What is the difference between data science and statistics?
Mathematical statistics as a discipline primarily involves the study and development of a number of models based on probabilistic uncertainty. What probabilistic uncertainty means depends on your interpretation of the term "probabilistic uncertainty." Bayesians think of it as being the subjective degree of belief. Frequentists make appeal to sampling theory. Machine learning tends to be more algorithmic in nature. The uncertainty isn't explicitly modeled as a probability distribution. Presumably "data science" is much broader and involves lots of the pre-processing that's necessary to develop analyzable datasets at all plus visualization . There really are going to be specializations in this. A good database engineer might have a passing familiarity with the intricacies of statistical analysis, but probably won't be able to develop new ones or deal with really advanced analysis. Vice versa for a statistician, who should know something about databases but probably won't be an expert at this and be able to deal with really advanced database work.
