What circumstances shape the United States Customs and Border Patrol sectors map?
Politics. The first job of CBP and other government agencies is to secure their survival. The second job is for management bureaucrats within the organization to grow their areas so they can get promoted and gain more power. A distant third is to do the job the agency was created to do. To accomplish goals one and two the agency has to appeal to its congressional and executive overlords. Favors get traded buildings get built annd boundary lines get drawn. The result is the sectors shown above. In order to be successful at job two managers need to do a bit of job three. So the sectors make some sense in that respect. But if you were building the organization from the ground up the sectors wouldn't look like this. Don't think it's politics? Try closing stations or realigning people within the organization. Unless you are adding more it's very difficult.
