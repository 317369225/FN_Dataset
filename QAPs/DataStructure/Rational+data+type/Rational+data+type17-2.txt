How does mathematics play a big role in programming?
Day to day programming actually doesn't require advanced mathematics - you can understand everything you need to know about math for general purpose programming, including most commonly used algorithms, with basic arithmetic and algebra. Many people, myself included for most of my career, never learn more than that. If you work in a more specialized field, you'll find yourself applying higher math on a day to day basis. Good examples are 3D graphics, finance, or scientific data. Mainly geometry, linear algebra, trigonometry and a little calculus for graphics, calculus in finance and potentially anything/everything in scientific data depending on what you're doing with it. You'll also find yourself needing a solid grasp of binary if you're working closer to bare metal where every bit and every operation counts (e.g. systems programming).
