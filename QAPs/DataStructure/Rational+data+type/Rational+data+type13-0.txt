What are the boolean values in Java?
In Java programming language, there are a set of universal/primitive statements which are called data types, that helps in identifying the type of input to be executed and implemented to get the desired output. They can either be integer, float or double, or boolean. Now the Boolean data type comes under primitive data type, which gives value in either true or false, one or zero (1 or 0, as binary digits), and helps in compiling statements that are conditional, which are, if, if-else, if-then-else, while or do-while statements. The instance variable for a boolean data type is always false, i.e., 0. The syntax for a boolean expression looks like this: Boolean variable_name; // initializing Variable_name=0; Let's run a program for you. public static void main(String[] args) {                                /*                  * boolean is simple Java type which can have only of two values; true or false.                  * All rational expressions retrun this type of value.                  *                  * Declare boolean varibale as below                  *                  * boolean <variable name> = <default value>;                  *                  * here assigning default value is optional.                  */                 boolean b1 = true;                 boolean b2 = false;                 boolean b3 = (10 > 2)? true:false;                                System.out.println("Value of boolean variable b1 is :" + b1);                 System.out.println("Value of boolean variable b2 is :" + b2);                 System.out.println("Value of boolean variable b3 is :" + b3);                    } } /* Output would be: Value of boolean variable b1 is :true Value of boolean variable b2 is :false Value of boolean variable b3 is :true */ The key to understand the basic problems regarding boolean expression programs is to solve as many questions as possible. Don't forget to dry run them first before compiling them. Happy coding!
