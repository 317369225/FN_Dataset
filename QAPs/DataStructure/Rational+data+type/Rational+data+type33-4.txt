Why are ISIS militants driving Texas-made Toyota trucks apparently modified for U.S. Special Forces?
Firstly, those do not look anything like the model of small truck Toyota sells in the states, which is called the Tacoma. The front end is all wrong. They look much more like the Hilux, which is the model Toyota sells outside of North America. Secondly, Toyota trucks are one of the most common vehicles in the region anyway. Thirdly, ISIS has looted a lot of equipment from the Iraqi army, so if the US did use those trucks, they likely left them behind and they were abandoned by the Iraqi army, then stolen by ISIS. No great conspiracy here.
