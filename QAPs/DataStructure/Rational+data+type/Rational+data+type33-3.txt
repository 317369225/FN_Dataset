Why are ISIS militants driving Texas-made Toyota trucks apparently modified for U.S. Special Forces?
Update 11/1/15 Toyota pickup trucks are ubiquitous. It is hard to imagine that ISIS would NOT have access to them. There does not need to be a secret conspiracy in order for ISIS to obtain then. Additionally, thousands and thousands of modified vehicles of all sorts, from F150 and Toyota pickups to Humvees, were bequeathed by our military and military contractors to the governments of Iraq and Afghanistan, not just for military and infrastructure reasons but because it would not be cost-efficient to transport them back to the U.S. The enemy does not obtain them just through capture, but occasionally through the "private enterprise" of those who have access to them and who are willing to sell them to anyone. Obviously, those surprised by U.S. vehicles or equipment being in enemy hands have no idea of conditions in a war zone or the Middle East. War is messy, and the control of equipment is not perfect.
