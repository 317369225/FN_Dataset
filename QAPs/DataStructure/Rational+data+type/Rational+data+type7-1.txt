Do you still think Americans need to own guns following the latest shooting incident in Arizona?
This question is so tainted at every level I'm almost afraid to touch it.  But, since I was A2A, here goes... First, the title and the description have nothing to do with each other.  Is it about Americans? Or is it about children? Or is it about American children? Why anyone would link a fanatically generic question like "Do Americans still need guns?" to a story about an unbelievably rare shooting involving a 9-year old blows my mind. Paul Theodoropoulos nails the statistical analysis of the description, which is born of highly-biased, agenda-focused "research". Jon Mixon hits everything else square on Lastly, the tragedy of the 9-year old shooting her instructor was entirely the instructor's fault.  He had no business giving her an uzi in the first place, he had no business being on her left side with one hand behind her back, and he had no business telling her to fire on full-auto.  The question here needs to be around instructor training and safety, not about children and guns. So, to answer the question... Yes, we still need guns.  And even if we didn't need them, they will still be here.  And children will continue to be trained to use them.  And yes, you have the right in this country not to use them or teach your children to use them or to teach your child not to be around other children or families who use them. And yes, it appears that people will continue to leverage children for their own agenda.
