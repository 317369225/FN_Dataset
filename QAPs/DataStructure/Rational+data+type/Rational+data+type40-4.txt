What does Balaji Viswanathan think about the BBC documentary "India's Daughter", and the admiration and criticism it has got?
The government is supposed to GOVERN and maintain law and order. The government is not a mere spectator, that except for the economic policies they should keep a blind eye to everything in the society, I don't agree with that. A stupid, yes utterly stupid journalist who shot this documentary hoping to make change the world, make a better world for woman. Which when came into the awareness of the Indian government officials, they rightly thought and decided to ban this stupid documentary. As we all know that getting access to the documentary is not an issue in the age of internet but it's not about that. It's about raising a voice against something which you do not approve of. I find it very strange that Mr. Balaji Viswanathan just took a stick and beaten the government for a rightful decision. Anything good or bad that goes on in the nation, voluntarily or involuntarily, the goverment just cannot detach itself from it, forget about turning your head away. Was Indian government supposed to see all this silently and speak nothing about it. Like a small lamb when sees a lion freezes out of fear, cannot shout, cannot scream, cannot act. For a change try teasing a lion, maybe poke him with a stick or a needle and see whether he behaves exactly as the lamb. The previous goverment was surely a bunch of lambs, that's why Manmohan Singh, the mute primeminister, when went to US, said that "I come from a very poor nation". The current government is surely not a pack of sheep or lambs. There was nothing wrong in raising a voice. By raising the voice the government has given the message that you do whatever you want to do but we are neither part of it not accept these bullish documentaries.
