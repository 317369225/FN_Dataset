Why do atheists say something is wrong without providing proof?
Since I was asked to answer ... As others have said, the onus of "proof" is always on the claimant.  If you claim your "God" exists, you are the one making a positive claim and it is up to you to support it with convincing arguments, evidence or (rarely in the case of philosophical questions) actual falsifiable, scientific proof.  Most atheists are not making any claim at all - we are simply people who are unconvinced by the reasons, arguments and supposed "proofs" given by theists. And I too have no idea what the "I get the, 'you are wrong it hurts,' comment quite a bit" part even means.  I don't say "you are wrong" to theists, just "you are unconvincing to me".  And the "it hurts" bit is plain weird, I've never heard an atheist say anything like that to a theist. (Is it just me or is the quality of questions from theists on Quora descending into the plain hopeless, inarticulate and stupid lately?)
