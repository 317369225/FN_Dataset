Imposter Syndrome:Â What are some effective ways to overcome the Impostor Syndrome as a female engineer?
I ask myself what the cockiest man in the room would do. Here are some things: Ask any question that comes to mind. Introduce yourself to anyone you want to meet. Assert your authority. Tell people why they should listen to you. Believe that anyone should want to hear what you have to say. Assert opinions and hypotheses with confidence. Stand up for what you think even if others seem to disagree. Claim credit for your ideas and what you have done. The more I did these things, the more other people treated me like I belonged. The more other people believed I belonged, the more I felt like I belonged.
