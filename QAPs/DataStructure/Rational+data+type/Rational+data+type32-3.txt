Is believing in gods more rational than atheism?
Let me put the video in this way. Premise - The Beginning (cause) of this current universe is unknown. Question - Is it rational to accept our lack of understanding which will make us continue the search for the cause ? (or) Is it rational to assign an entity called "god" just to complete the equation ? By convincing ourselves that there should have been a "mover", some of us are seeking closure. But in that process we lose sight of the reality. The reality is that none of theories regarding the start can be proved yet. Science is not about closure. Its about truth. As much as there is no evidence of god, there is none for a multiverse. So it seems like believing either of them is equally correct, right ? Here's where the difference comes. People who believe in a scientific reasoning would gladly discard the idea if the evidence for the contrary is found. Be it Multiverse or Big Bang. That's how science is done. 1) Guess. 2) Experiment. 3) if(result != hypothesis)          Throw away idea          Goto step 1     else          continue with this idea and see if other scientific laws holds true. But, People who believe only in god are not looking for an evidence.  They sit around waiting the asses off for magic to happen. Faith healing and what not. This, I have a problem with. Would a religious person be willing to know about a theory that explains the presence or absence of "god", if found ? I don't think so. Entertaining the possibility of god is different from believing only in god. Hint for the fanatics - The former is better. Food for thought - Lets assume that there is a single creator who did nothing but initiate the big bang. Why should we worship him ?
