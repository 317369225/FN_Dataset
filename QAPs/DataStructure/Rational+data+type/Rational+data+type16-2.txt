Is intuition a manifestation of rationality operating below consciousness?
We don't know.  Firstly the concept of 'below conscious' or 'unconscious' is an area of vague theory where hard verifiable science is hard to come by.  Also concepts like intuition and rationality are hard to define. Essentially there are two main ideas for people who believe in an unconscious mind: Freud For Freud the unconscious mind is purely irrational, prone to instincts and repressed complexes and desires beyond the influence of the reality principle until it enters the preconscious.  The intuition therefore needs to be seen as the product of irrational, pre-congnitive unconscious which sometimes gives insight but sometimes does not.  Freud would probably tell you that sometimes you rationalize your instincts and 'dream work' after the fact. Jules Henri Poincaré Henri Poincaré This wonderful thinker only came to my attention after reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.  I was taking a course on child development at the time and we were looking at the intellectual skills of pre-verbal children as a window in to the unconscious. Poincare speculated that there was a rational process working unconsciously, and that this process which had a sense of balance, time, symmetry and beauty was developing insights for us. I think what evidence I have seen points to Poincare, but no questions most such feelings of  being right for some reason come from unconscious prejudice or complexes.  Most people's intuitions are sadly banal and predictable, and not very rational.
