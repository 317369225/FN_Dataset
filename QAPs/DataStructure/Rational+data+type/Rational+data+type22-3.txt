What are the best ways to fight corruption in India?
The answer lies squarely in this matrix, first explained by 1976 Economics Nobel Prize winner Milton Friedman in his famous best-seller "Free To Choose":   Let us investigate this matrix, row-wise.   1st square represents you spending your own money on yourself. Here yourself encompasses your family and those who you hold very dear. So when you spend your own money on yourself, you tend to spend the least possible and try to gain the maximum value. Of course a rich person will spend more than a poor person, but he will also demand more value for whatever amount he spends. If he wants to buy a private jet, he won't simply buy the 1st one he finds and whatever price. He will shop around, check the specs, negotiate etc. and then buy. This quadrant is the best case possible.   On the top row, to the right, the 2nd square deals with you spending your money on someone else. Let us say you are buying sweets to distribute among your office staff, most of whom you barely know. Certainly for your close friends you would buy excellent quality sweets, but for the rest? You would probably buy some decent sweets without burning a hole in your pocket. You wouldn't spend hours hunting for the best quality sweets for the same price. Any decent quality is going to be fine.   The 3rd square(first on the bottom row) talks about you spending someone else's money on yourself. The best example would be the food allowance employees get when they are working overtime or travelling on company's business. Usually the company sets a limit, say Rs. 500 per meal. You will be reimbursed maximum that much amount when you submit the bills. If you eat for less than Rs. 500, you don't get the balance amount refunded to you. In such a case, pretty much everybody will try to spend around 500 Rs. Even if normally you spend say 100 Rs. on a meal, now you will ensure you go to a high-class restaurant where you can get 500 Rs. worth of food and service. In this case, you don't economize i.e. you don't try to save money. But you do go to the best possible restaurant you can. After all you are going to eat that food, so you are likely to search for the best restaurants in that expense range. You wouldn't go to a crappy restaurant and waste Rs. 500, even though that Rs. 500 is being borne by the company.   And now finally the 4th square. It is coloured red because it is the worst possible scenario. This is the domain of bureaucrats and politicians. They get their money through taxes. Taxes are forced. You can't choose to not pay your taxes just because you are unhappy with the Govt.'s handling of various schemes. If you don't pay your taxes, you will be tortured in jails and your whole career and life will be ruined. So whether the bureaucrats and politicians are good or bad, they can force you to pay them with the threat of violence. Knowing that the money they spend is not theirs and the people they spend it on (i.e. the general public) are not related to them, they simply don't care.   After all, which mad man would visit the same restaurant again and again if it serves filthy food? Wouldn't people stop going and won't it shut down? But if the restaurant was owned by some gundas who have threatened to kill you if you don't come often, then you will patronize that restaurant out of fear. The exact same is the case with bureaucrats and politicians. Our grandparents, our parents and we are suffering for decades under a system that has failed over and over again. Yet we fund them relentlessly with our taxpayer's money. And this will continue to our children and their children unless we change things.   Think of the highly-educated IAS officer who has to do some work for a village. He is allotted say Rs. 10 crores by the Govt. to do the work. The money he spends is not his. He gains nothing except maybe a small bonus if he finds the cheapest but best contractor to do the job. The benefits of the work are reaped by some strangers not related to him. Neither he nor his family has any connection to that village, let alone live in that village. So why should he go to great lengths to economize and save money? Why should he go to great lengths to ensure the best quality of work is done? And mind you, I haven't even touched upon the topic of the IAS officer stealing those funds or doing anything illegal. That would be even worse. What he spends is not his. And what he saves is not his either.   What if the same IAS officer is building his own house. Let us say he has about 1 crores of his savings to spend on it. Do you think he will so callously spend his own money? Do you think he will buy the land at whatever price is quoted to him? Won't he first survey and study the land? Won't he then engage the services of a reputed contractor who uses good quality materials? At every stage, won't he shop around and negotiate? Won't he go to people and websites,  and get information from them? So why the stark difference?   Why this selfishness towards what is your own and complete apathy to what is not yours? Would you have done better? Are you also that selfish? Here is a small test : Imagine you have to send your 2 children to school. You and your spouse are working full-time and you can afford to spend 5000 Rs per child per month. So that's Rs. 10,000 per month in total you have budgeted for your kids' education.   You have a choice : Send your 2 children to a good private school for Rs 10K per month OR send your 2 children and 8 other very poor unrelated children to a Govt. school for Rs. 1000 per month. Remember that you are playing with your children's whole future. If they drop-out of school, they will never go to college. So are you still ready to sacrifice your own children's future in order to help 8 other children who otherwise would have no schooling at all?   But you say how about I send my 2 kids to this good private school for Rs.10K and additionally send the other 8 poor children to Govt. school for 1000 Rs each? But here too, you have shown amazing selfishness and partiality! Clearly you value your own kids much more since you are OK with those 8 children getting lousy education at {�ء. school , but not your own! You care so much more for your kids than others' kids!   And what if you say "Maybe when I have 10 times more money, I will send all of them to the good private school". Ok let me increase your salary 10-fold. Now you have Rs. 100,000 per month to spend on education. Will you still send your children to that same private school or will you now try to send them to an even better International school? Or save that money so you can send your own kids abroad for higher education? Think carefully and honestly! Wealth and poverty are relative! You can grow as rich as you want but you will never sacrifice your own children's future to ensure other childrens' futures.   But this was just one example. All of us reading this are rich enough to afford cars. But would we decide to buy a bike instead and distribute the rest among poor strangers so they could have bikes too? Would we buy a good house in a nice locality for ourselves or would we instead buy 3 more poor families low-cost houses and ourselves also a low-cost house?   And if you think this selfishness is because it is your money, would you have done differently if you won a lottery?   But then if we all are so selfish, what is the way out? Are the people in corruption-free countries altruistic and unselfish? No! Instead they have utilized their selfishness to benefit not just themselves but the society as a whole yet while having very low corruption? By what mechanism is this possible? In short, how can we, being selfish Indians, end corruption in India?!   Dr. Milton Friedman   The answer to this can be found by watching Milton Friedman's "Free to Choose" documentary series or reading his book of the same name. The book and the documentary were made in the 1980s, a time when there was regulation, stagnation and corruption even in the Western world, not to mention the Communist countries and our very own socialist India. But his crusade against them brought about a revolution not just in the Western world, but also led to the downfall of Communism  and Dr. Manmohan Singh to implement the reforms. We would still be stuck in ration lines and waiting years for our telephone lines and our scooters if it wasn't for him and his philosophy. We owe a huge debt to this man!   If you are truly interested in learning the answer and ending corruption, you owe it to yourself to watch his documentary series. Just watch the 1st episode and you will get your answer from this intellectual powerhouse who changed our lives forever. Please upvote and share this post if you feel this is truly insightful.
