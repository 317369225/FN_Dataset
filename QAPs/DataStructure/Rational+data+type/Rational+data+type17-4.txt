How does mathematics play a big role in programming?
When I was in my starting years in Programming and related degree course, I too had the very same question. Then I stumbled upon a subject, called Discrete mathematics. Once you learn this subject, and spend some time in development, you would start to relate the programming to mathematics. Obviously, not entirely the mathematics we learnt, but yes, it is based on mathematics nevertheless. I learnt another subject Graphics programming. It is related to the programming for GUI. During this subject, I heavily used trigonometry. Yes, our old trigonometry which I learnt several years back and hadn't used since then. I was amazed that something which I never wanted to learn will be used in this way. As per Mathematics, mathematics is the study of of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space and change. Well, in programming, we use at-least three concepts out of the four mentioned above, i.e. quantity (numbers), structure and change. I hope that I am able to clear some of your doubt.Why some? because until you spend some time figuring the answer yourself, you can't believe it. :)
