How do INTJs think?
I don't know how INTJs think because I don't know too many personally, other than me and my dad.  I mean I see some finished INTJ products here on Quora, but that doesn't tell you much about process. As for how I personally think, my mind looks like this gaudy picture. Imagine trying to get from the floor to the landing.  I think in small, measured steps.  I always have a plan A and a plan B, in case plan A fails.  There's always an escape route, and a calculated point-of-no-return.
