I am against same-sex marriage. Will everyone hate me?
At the risk of stating the obvious: People who support same-sex marriage believe, before all else, in the all-conquering power of love. So, no, nobody will hate you. As Dan says, they might view your logic with serious skepticism, and perhaps think you unoriginal or pusillanimous... but that's not the same as hating you. Importantly, opponents of gay marriage these days are frequently in the habit of accusing their opposites of suppressing dissent and inciting hatred against opponents of marriage equality. Though this is no doubt true on occasion, it's usually not the case. There's a big difference between thinking someone is a close-minded douchebag who needs to think before taking a political stance, and hating them simply for who they are.
