Do you still think Americans need to own guns following the latest shooting incident in Arizona?
Do Americans need to own guns? Of course not. Is that a right guaranteed by the second amendment? Absolutely. And the courts agree. I grew up never having shot a gun (still haven't). I grew up far and away from gun culture and I grew up without any real desire to have a gun. I had friends that hunted, their families taught them how to hunt, and they grew up around guns and I didn't hear of any bad incidents through their families. Fast forward to my university years and I was thrust feet first into a state (Montana) with an incredible gun culture. My friends brought guns with them to college (not to class, but it was something they moved with, which was totally weird to me), my friends would go out shooting before class or after, and there was a generally mature tone to it all. From people I knew who were talking about regulating local populations of animals to those who were avid about making sure that children being brought up in gun communities learned how to appropriately handle a firearm. Unfortunately (as pointed out in edit #2) there are some bad things that happen with firearms. These are tragedies. Whether a school shooting, a robbery gone wrong, or an innocent child who was learning to use way too early, these things happen. Many of these - like the latter - are avoidable and you'll find few people encouraging nine year olds to shoot an uzi. Americans aren't simply "gun fanatics." The vast majority want people (them, their children, their families, and the other people down the street or in the deer blind half a mile over) to be educated, responsible firearm owners and users.
