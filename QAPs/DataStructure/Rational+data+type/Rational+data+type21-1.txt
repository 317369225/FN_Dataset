How can the number [math]e[/math] be irrational (follows no pattern) if its Taylor Series representation is constructed using a beautiful pattern?
An irrational number is not a number whose decimal representation "follows no pattern." It is a number whose decimal representation does not follow a very specific kind of pattern, namely, the pattern of having a sequence of digits that endlessly repeats. In fact, there are irrational numbers whose decimal representations have simple patterns. A famous example is Liouville's constant, [math]L=\sum_{n=1}^\infty 10^{-n!}=0.110001000000000000000001...[/math] which has 1 in the n!-th decimal place and 0 everywhere else. This has quite a simple pattern, doesn't it? Yet, the decimal representation has no sequence of endlessly repeating digits, so it is irrational. Not only is this number irrational, but it is in fact transcendental. So, there is nothing surprising in the fact that e which is also irrational (and transcendental) can also be expressed using a simple pattern: [math]e=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!}.[/math] It is very fascinating, though, that the irrational and transcendental numbers that we can explicitly talk about (i.e., those that are definable) are only a countable subset of the uncountable set of real numbers. So, almost all real numbers have absolutely no pattern whatsoever. They will forever elude our grasp. In a sense, they are ineffable.
