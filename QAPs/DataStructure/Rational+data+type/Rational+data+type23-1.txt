Why do people appear to be so systematically misinformed about basic facts?
Different people have different definitions of "basic facts."  As a math person I'm always surprised when people don't know what a rational number is, but as a politics person you might be surprised when I tell you I have no idea what a TARP fund is (nor do I really care).  The fact is, most people are not informed about everything, and it's often because they ascribe higher importance to different types of knowledge.
