How is it possible to have a rational and civil discussion about the Israeli Palestinian conflict?
Joel, I am one of those who questioned your integrity, and I still do. Because I have seen occasions when you purposefully promoted false information and did not fix it when I showed you evidence that proved otherwise. You have blocked me from commenting on your answers, when I didn't insult you or violate BNBR. You blocked me, because every time you presented a baseless argument, I countered it explicitly. Moreover, when I answer your questions on Israel, in a respectful way, you try your best to get them to collapse. When you have owned a question, you have marked my top-voted answer to collapse as 'not answering the question'. Remember when you said that muslims who boycott Israeli products should not be treated when they get Syphilis, because the cure discovered was by a Jewish doctor (who btw does not identify himself as Jewish)? Remember then, that you listed a group of Jewish contributions, and followed up by asking if muslims have ever contributed anything useful to the world? These don't sound like someone interested in rational discussion. These sound like someone trying to say one ethnicity or religion is better than another. Another example is pretending to have a conversation is this question, asked by Joel, and answered by him in about three minutes: Joel V Benjamin's answer to Israel in 2014: Is Israel responsible for casualties resulting from their response to Palestinian missile attacks on Israeli civilians? If you are interested in civil discussions, you should start by not blocking people, having a discussion, rather than victimizing yourself. I'm more than happy to have discussions with people who are honest, and willing to listen, not people who are interested in propaganda. Updated 102w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
