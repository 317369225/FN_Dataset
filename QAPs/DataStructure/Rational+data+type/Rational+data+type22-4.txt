What are the best ways to fight corruption in India?
Let me list a contrarian answer. A good deal of it can be reduced simply by reducing the size of government.     The government is involved in plenty of areas, that it has no business being in. Plenty of regulations and need for permits for running a business, factory, importing and exporting etc. creates all of the following: 1. Needless hurdles of wealth creation and growth. 2. Plenty of government bureaucrats to bribe or manipulate. 3. Businesses that win in the market are not the ones that make the best products cheapest, but ones that manage to best get in bed with politicians. Milton Friedman gives an example of how England was far more corrupt in the 18th century when there was a lot of government overreach. Once that was removed, 80% of the reason for corruption was gone!     This tended to chip away at the remaining 20% also, because human beings are remarkably consistent in their behavior. Read Robert Cialdini's book for more: If pretty much everyone is forced to indulge in some acts of corruption such as bribing the local officials to set up a small business, it greatly lowers the bar for them to indulge in other real acts of corruption as well, such as using the police to intimidate competitors. Ideally you only want governments to be involved in national defence, running the police and the courts. You want minimal extra government involvement beyond this, and a government greatly overreaching these leads to the following: 1. The government doing a lousy job of running the police and courts. 2. Needless hurdles to wealth creation and incentives for corruption. Updated 92w ago • View Upvotes
