Is intuition a manifestation of rationality operating below consciousness?
Not sure, but this seems relevant: This “bodily turn”, as I like to call it, began to emerge well before  the current millennium, though its progress continues unabated. It has  historical precedents, most obviously in materialist philosophies that  declare everything that exists to be physical. But materialism is a  general position about the fundamental nature of reality, and the bodily  turn has a much more personal dimension: it directs philosophical  inquiry to the ways that our individual physical selves and their  idiosyncrasies affect who we are, what we value, how we know. For example, emotions, with their palpable mingling of physical  turmoil and racing thoughts, have become a hot topic, engaging not only  philosophy but also psychology and the neurosciences. The increasingly  cross-field use of neurological research, such as the data from  functional magnetic resonance imaging, has grounded the idea that (in  some sense) emotions occupy space, just like physical objects. More  important for my point here, emotions bring about physical alterations  that we consciously experience. Insofar as they are the means by which  we discover certain value-laden aspects of the world we live in, the  agitations they occasion give our bodily responses a capacity for  knowledge that is sometimes overlooked. -- Carolyn Korsmeyer, 'The Turn to Body', TPM http://www.philosophypress.co.uk...
