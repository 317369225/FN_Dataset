What psychological tricks and hacks are useful to know?
When you don't like someone pretend that you do The idea was introduced to me when reading C.S. Lewis. He was talking about how it was particularly hard for him to have good will toward someone he didn't like. He wrote: “Do not waste time bothering whether you ‘love’ your neighbor; act as if you did. As soon as we do this we find one of the great secrets. When you are behaving as if you loved someone, you will presently come to love him.” I paired this with another epiphany I had had at the time: "Liking something is a way better experience than not liking something." It made sense to me that I would have more quality experiences if I liked more people, and also more things. I've tried increasing the chances of liking people and things ever since. It's improved the quality of my experiences with others, and also things like music and food, in a surprisingly enjoyable way.
