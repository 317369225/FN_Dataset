Game Theory: How can we move from a rational society to a superrational society? How close are we to the same?
Most of the evidence indicates that we DO live in a super-rational society as per your description. There's a large body of work dedicated to figuring out why anybody, experimentally, would ever choose "wrong" in the prisoners dilemma. [1] (people do) In the question details, you mention people lining up, and wonder why anyone would do it. The fact that people do is immediate evidence that some powerful force is working,  right now, at a societal level, to make people cooperative. In the United States we have a word for people who don't play cooperatively (read: don't think super-rationally), we call them assholes.
