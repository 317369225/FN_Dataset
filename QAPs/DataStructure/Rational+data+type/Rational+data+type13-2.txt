What are the boolean values in Java?
Boolean is a  data type. This one is actually a primitive and it  can have two values, boolean true or false. And this is all there is to  it. Conditional statements – there’s a condition and it can hold true or  not. And then something is executed or not. Boolean makes it easy to give conditions to your programs.
