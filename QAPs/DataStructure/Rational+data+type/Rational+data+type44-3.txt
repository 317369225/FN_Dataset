Game Theory: How can we move from a rational society to a superrational society? How close are we to the same?
1. Replace people with robots. 2. Not very. Game theory is a useful tool, but like many social sciences that describe (and proscribe) human decisionmaking, it's more helpful as a reference point than as a complete theory of where we are/where we should be. There are many reasons that humanity will not make any real "progress" toward superrationality.  Among them: the strength of social norms (keeping the vast majority of us waiting in line) and the distrust we all have of each other (pushing the prison dilemma into that non-Pareto Nash equilibrium point). That said, with repeat play, many humans can approach superrationality: tit-for-tat brings the Prisoner's Dilemma to Pareto.  But as a general rule, with strangers, we rely on social norms, and we distrust others.
