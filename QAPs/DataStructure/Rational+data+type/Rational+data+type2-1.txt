What are the main differences between the Haskell and Wolfram programming languages?
Haskell is a standardized, minimal, elegant, and (in some ways) provably correctly behaving language. It is compiled to machine code with state-of-the-art compilers. It can be run on just about any system, and executables can be delivered to users and customers. Wolfram Language is a proprietary language with no rational means of having anything but a monopoly of an implementation. Application delivery is not possible unless you install black box plugins in your web browser. The language does not have a simple core set and can't be efficiently compiled to machine code. It has a gargantuan library existing in a single namespace, and there's evidence of confusion in its design (multiple incompatible confusing binding and scoping rules, for example). It is untyped, and there is no way to make new data types except essentially by tagging lists with symbol names, a very inefficient and unsafe engineering practice. Updated 75w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
