In Matrix Revolutions, what's going on when Neo and a sentinel appear to merge?
Per The Matrix 101 site: This one's fun. Just like Neo's ability to stop the sentinels at the end of Reloaded, he again manifests power over machines. Neo appears to be able to merge with and absorb information from this sentinel as it passes through him. Immediately after this, Neo knows they have to fly above the clouds where the sentinels can't follow to get past them. These abilities in the real world add fuel to the "Neo's gotta be part machine" fire. Source: http://www.thematrix101.com/revo... Updated 207w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
