Imposter Syndrome:Â What are some effective ways to overcome the Impostor Syndrome as a female engineer?
Think about one thing that you've accomplished in your field of choice. Internalize it, accept it as something you wouldn't have accomplished if you're a total failure. Whenever you feel insecure / like an impostor, accustom yourself with quickly replying in your head "no way I'm that bad, I did X", then get on with your life. Once you're used to it, impostor syndrome, when it hits, hopefully wouldn't affect you for longer than a couple of seconds. I don't think it's realistic to aim to completely get rid of insecurity - the best thing we can do is to learn how to best handle and react to it when it comes. I found that the above strategy strikes a good balance of not letting insecurity affects your focus and your work, while at the same time using the energy that comes from a little insecurity to motivate me to do better. For context, in high school I did competitive programming, which has even less women than tech companies. It's also the type of programming that needs laser focus during the 5 hours of your competition, and more hours of your training camp -- it can be very costly to your performance if your mind were to drift somewhere else. Developing coping mechanisms to things like this is hence super useful to your overall performance, not only in competitions but also generally.
