Is there any rational/data-driven reason why the United States should not/can not apply the European model healthcare systems in the US to achieve better health outcomes at a lower cost?
Most people in the USA are already complaining about how high their taxes are - they don't realise how low they are compared to many countries. The idea of increasing taxes further to pay for the European-type model wouldn't get anywhere in today's economic/political climate.
