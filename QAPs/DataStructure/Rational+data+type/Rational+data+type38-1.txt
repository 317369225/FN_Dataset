What are some things that mathematicians know, but most people don't?
1. Mathematics is broad, deep, and actively researched. Some people seem to think whatever they learned in high school, or maybe first-year college, is pretty much all there is to it. But mathematics has a plethora of branches, with complex connections between them and a vast array of results in each. Sometimes, struggling to solve an open problem in one branch leads to the creation of entirely new branches. The collection of mathematical knowledge accumulated so far can (and does) fill whole libraries, and research of new knowledge will go on for the foreseeable future. 2. Some mathematical results require extensive background knowledge just to understand what they are about. But some problems are very easy to state with only elementary knowledge, yet are extremely difficult to solve. The Goldbach conjecture says: "Every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers". Easy enough right? Well, most people believe it's true, and yet to this day nobody knows how to prove it. The Collatz conjecture: "Start with any positive integer. If it is even, divide by 2. If odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process. Eventually you will reach the number 1". Sounds a bit like those parlor tricks, but again, no proof was found yet. Fermat's last theorem: "if [math]a, b, c, n[/math] are positive integers and [math]n>2[/math], then [math]a^n+b^n\neq c^n[/math]". Mathematicians sought a proof for this statement for centuries, until they found one - which was 150 pages long and used some very advanced modern theories. The Jordan curve theorem is easy to visualize intuitively, tricky to formalize, and difficult to prove: "If you draw a curve in the plane, it has an inside and outside". 3. Some unsolved mathematical problems have a cash prize attached. Most famous is the Clay Institute Millennium prize problems - a challenge issued in 2000 and offering a $1M prize each for the solution of 7 problems. Among them is the Riemann Hypothesis, one of the (if not the) most important unsolved problems of mathematics. "Every root of the analytic continuation of [math]\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^s}[/math] is either a negative even integer, or has a real part of [math]\frac12[/math]." It's more involved to state than the Goldbach conjecture, but still fairly approachable as far as cutting-edge research goes. 4. Mathematics isn't about manipulating numbers. It is about analyzing structures. Mathematicians pick an abstract structure that interests them and try to learn whatever they can about it and how its different pieces interconnect. Numbers are an interesting structure to study, and the study of many structures can benefit from the use of numbers, but there are plenty of mathematical results and proofs that don't have any number in sight. 5. Mathematics is not always rigorous. Some consider rigor an ideal to shoot for, with the gold standard being proofs written in a way a simple computer program can verify. But even so, no mathematician adheres to this standard because he could never get any work done if he bothered himself with this. They take shortcuts, and they require experience and intuition to know which shortcuts are legitimate, and which are not. We could hope that all proofs accepted in journals could, in theory, be rewritten in a rigorous way, but even that much isn't certain. And this rewriting is a tedious process, despite software tools to assist in the matter. 6. Mathematics is useful. The physical world is based on mathematical laws, and if we want to understand the world around us we must understand mathematics. Engineers and other professionals obviously need it, but also our everyday life can be improved by knowing more math. The thing is, no real life problem comes with a label stating which mathematical branch you should apply - you need to figure it out yourself, and unfortunately most education programs don't do a very good job of preparing you for that. Probability and statistics is one particular area which people could use more familiarity with, if for no other reason than to resist being lied to with statistics. Also notable is that humanity as a whole rarely knows in advance which mathematical theory will be useful when and for what. 20th century mathematician G. H. Hardy is famous for taking pride in how useless is his field of study, number theory (the study of integers). Little did he know that number theory would eventually form the basis of cryptography, which is critical for the operation of the internet as we know it. 7. Mathematics is beautiful. It doesn't need to be useful. It is a creative art as fine as any other. It can be casual recreation, and it can be profound and intense. Updated 3w ago • View Upvotes • Asked to answer by Ron Gross
