What is the difference between data science and statistics?
Data science encompasses more, as explained in Michael Hochster's answer to What is data science? I will use the nomenclature from that answer in this one. Type B data science uses some statistics but it also involves significant coding skills not traditionally considered part of statistics (though a certain amount of coding is of course necessary to be a statistician in the modern world). Even for Type A data scientists, statistics is just one tool in the box.Â  Data scientists must also be able to manipulate and process very large data sets, create compelling visualizations, automate tasks, propose new analyses, explain their analyses to a variety of audiences, collaborate well with engineers and business/product people, and make recommendations based on the data. Many statisticians can do all these things and function as Type A data scientists, but the standard curriculum focuses more narrowly on statistical inference, certain kinds of models, and to a small extent, sampling and design.
