What do the following terms mean: variable, data type, one dimensional array and subroutine? Can you provide an example of each?
A variable is a container that holds some stuff, like a number of a number. TheÂ  reason it's called a variable because the programmer can change the value that the variable holds during the course of execution of the program. Now, before you store the stuff in the variable, Java (or C, or whatever it is that you're using) needs to know what you're going ti store. Imagine if you stored someone's name in a variable and then promptly changed it to a number. That doesn't worked. So, when you're creating your variable, you need to state what you're going to store there. The details of how to do that differs from language to language. Now, imagine that you had to find the sum of ten numbers. Now, you could declare ten variables, but imagine how much you'd have to type if there a thousand or more numbers. So, you use an array which is basically a group of variables that can be referred to by the same name. Again, the details of array declaration differ from language, so I can't help you with an example if you don't tell me what language you're using. A subroutine refers to a special construct. You can give the subroutine a variable, then the subroutine does some stuff with it, and then returns an entirely new value, which you can now use in your program. There you have it. No examples, though.
