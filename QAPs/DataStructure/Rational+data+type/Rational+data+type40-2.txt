What does Balaji Viswanathan think about the BBC documentary "India's Daughter", and the admiration and criticism it has got?
In fact, by the ban, we brilliantly did what should NOT have happened! The DAMAGE imagined by the film can NOW actually happen. The ban has made impressionable segments actually watch the film looking for some titillation. It will not be unfair to conjecture that a good proportion of people on social media still belong to that category that believes in the crap that women are designed for use and blah blah. When they hear out qualified lawyers saying the same thing, their theory gets a ratification. A stupidity goes viral as a truth Media has become the most cunning, wily and ruthless of marketers, we'll see in our times and in the future. Not for nothing that, Alvin Toffler prophesied that the third world war will be fought in the gopherspace, along - what I call - the infobahns. The best way to promote a poor media product is to obtain a ban on it; spin some controversy around it, and lo and behold, your crappie just hit a million eyeballs! Equally crappy offerings ride high on your product (advertising) get promoted, and by the time people figure out the film is a garbage, you've earned your money. This is a famous xxx business model, hacked by hassled mainstream media and newsÂ  outfits - and even political parties - pretty successfully as well. Indeed, Times Now too, must've earned millions by making a mountain of a molehill - and this WAS a well thought-off ploy of the channel. Blow up the issue, create a public opinion, whip up the controversy... A team is on a beat, on a prowl for such issues that can be flared up to get TRP. Had this not happened, this documentary too would have gone down as just another shoddy thing without anybody noticing it. By the time the Editor's Guild and the intelligentsia wake up and respond, everybody who wanted to make money out of shit, has made it already!!!.
