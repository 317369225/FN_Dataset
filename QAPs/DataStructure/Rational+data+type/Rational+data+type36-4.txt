What psychological tricks and hacks are useful to know?
A few effective psychological tricks that I try to apply to my daily life are: Visualization I look at myself in the mirror each morning and visualize myself as a confident, successful, attractive, and valuable/helpful individual. I go over key traits mentally each day, the traits that I wish to improve upon the most. I've tried and tested this trick several times in different form before basketball games as well, and it seems to be quite effective. (I visualize for 15 minutes going through each drill in my head, going over the proper balance, form, and techniques. Shooting, rebounding, passing, ect.. I go over everything.) It definitely seems to have a noticeable impact. Cold Shower Starting the day with a cold shower not only gives you a nice boost of energy, It's a great way to face one uncomfortable situation before the day even starts, and it influences the rest of the day. Making Your Bed This one is so simple you might think it's stupid, but making your bed first thing in the morning gives you a feeling of accomplishment. It sets the tone for the day. Meditation I meditate every night before going to bed. I do it to ease mental and/or physical tension, and to get into the right state of mind before falling asleep. Every time I do this I wake up the next morning feeling calm and at peace. The entire day is better because of it. There you have it. Four simple psychological tricks that you can easily follow and develop into daily habits.
