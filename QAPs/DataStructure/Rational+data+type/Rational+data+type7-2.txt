Do you still think Americans need to own guns following the latest shooting incident in Arizona?
Schools close on the first day of hunting season because so many kids are absent the school won't qualify for state funding that day. This isn't the schools encouraging hunting. It's the schools responding to the fact that hunting is a part of life in rural areas. Hunting isn't "gun culture". If anything it's environmental activism. Guns are around. They are around in the US, and they are around in many countries that supposedly prohibit gun ownership. Teaching kids how to be responsible with firearms is just... responsible. People in the UK and Australia ought to be doing the same, and I suspect that outside the cities they are doing exactly that. Handing a 9 year old an Uzi is just moronic. The only victim here was the little girl, but she wasn't a victim of a gun. She was a victim of bad parents, a halfwit range instructor, and a business owner more concerned with money than common sense. She is a child abuse victim. Not a poster child for assuming this country has 330 million morons residing in it. Stop. Fucking. Using. This. Kid. She's been through enough. She doesn't need to get caught up in your sanctimonious bullshit.
