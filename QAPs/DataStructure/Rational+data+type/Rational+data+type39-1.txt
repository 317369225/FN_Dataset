How does someone get a meeting with angel investor David S. Rose?
Building on David's thoughtful advice, I would like to add a sentiment that will seem a little counterintuitive.  So let's start with the old wise-crack "If you want money ... ask for advice.  If you want advice ... ask for money." I don't want to explore it from the Dale Carnegie semi-manipulative approach of influencing people.  Rather, I want to suggest that you might reach out to an angel investor in your community for their advice on a particular challenge you are legitimately unsure about.  Angel investors are generally willing to reach back and try to help an entrepreneur and they are more susceptible to a good story than are most reps for VCs.  Initially seeking their advice (rather than their money) might net you some valuable free insights and possibly the meeting you want.
