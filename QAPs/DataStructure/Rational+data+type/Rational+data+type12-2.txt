What is being done to improve PHP?
The people who generate the most hate toward PHP are basing what they know of it on PHP 5.2 or earlier. The language has come a LONG way in the last 5-6 years, and people need to separate themselves from their preconceived notions and give it a go again. I did, and it completely changed the way I look at PHP.
