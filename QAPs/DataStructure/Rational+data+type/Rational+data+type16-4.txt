Is intuition a manifestation of rationality operating below consciousness?
I hold that intuition is simply intelligence. As with humour, historically women have been discouraged to manifest such...assertive qualities. Thus the invention of intuition became necessary to explain a female outlier. It softened "intelligence". Instead of something to pursue, which would be wholly inappropriate for a woman (unacceptable) it became an "accidental" talent. A mysterious gift. Not so intimidating to a less talented male. Since then it has evolved into an accidental idea. A use of intelligence that...like any intelligence can be refined given determination and practice. It helps to have a Proclivity. It really is just a habit. A practical way of solving a problem. Somewhere between the way a dream might help to solve a problem, and what we would normally call intelligence or problem solving. Intuition in fact has existed as long as sentient beings. The label intuition was invented by an unconscious albeit urgent need to make it "okay" for a woman to think.
