How can the number [math]e[/math] be irrational (follows no pattern) if its Taylor Series representation is constructed using a beautiful pattern?
It's not really correct to say that the digits of e follows no pattern. We can write an algorithm that will output any given digit of e, so in that sense we totally have a pattern for the digits of e. What I think you mean by 'no' pattern is just the fact that e is irrational. All this means is that e is not the ratio of any two whole numbers. It turns out that there is a bijection between rational numbers and real numbers whose decimal representations eventually follow a strictly repeating pattern. That is, the digits eventually repeat the same exact fixed set of digits forever. For example, 0.123498989898989898..... These two facts put together allow us to conclude that the digits of e never fall into some exact repeating pattern. Please note that this is not at all the same as having no pattern. I'll add an example of another number that has a very clear pattern, but is also clearly irrational (that is, it never repeats the same fixed set of digits forever). https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/... 0.12345678910111213141516... This number is just all of the counting numbers concatenated. Updated 2w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
