Why are ISIS militants driving Texas-made Toyota trucks apparently modified for U.S. Special Forces?
My understanding was the took them from the Iraqis who abandoned them and from other groups we were funding in Syria who they beat or who joined them. Every town they take in Iraq they get American arms. Most people think that individual Saudis, Kuwaitis and Qataris, and from the Gulf, with a wink and nod from the Kingdom, have been funding and supplying them for years.Â  The foolish idea was that Shi'a were more of a danger to the Saudis than Sunni extremists becuase the Saudis are an extremist sect themselves.
