What was Josef Mengele like as a person?
I would ordinarily write an answer, but honestly just reading about it makes me want to vomit.  I can't write anything deep and introspective, or helpful.  I will offer these three pieces: This is a factual account of atrocities, including a discussion of his "favorite" twins who survived, Eva and Miriam Mozes (little girls at the time): http://www.auschwitz.dk/eva.htm This is a fascinating interview from a pair of older twins who watched family members die in the Holocaust, went through the horrors of testing, had a horrific job, and nearly died in the winter evacuation march - but still speak of Mengele as though they had a crush in him ("he was the handsomest man"): http://www.thedailybeast.com/art... And a series of interviews with experiment survivors: http://articles.chicagotribune.c... Painful stuff, but you'll certainly learn quite a bit about this horrible time in human events. Paint your kids' faces in kisses tonight, and extra hugs because you're lucky enough to be able to. Kind regards, Alexandra
