I am against same-sex marriage. Will everyone hate me?
No, of course not. First, a lot of people share your bigotry. Second, unless you wave it around, most people won't know about it. I don't ask each of my friends "What's your opinion of same-sex marriage?" and, in most cases, I don't know their opinion. Third, some people who know about your views and disagree strongly will still not hate you. I don't have any friends who are (to my knowledge, see "second") against gay marriage but I do have some friends who disagree with me on other important issues. However, the proportion of people with your view is shrinking (thankfully). Soon, it will be as small as those who don't think Blacks should "be allowed" to marry Whites. Then it will be as small as those who don't think Irish people should marry English people. Updated 77w ago â€¢ View Upvotes
