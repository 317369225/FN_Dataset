Why do people appear to be so systematically misinformed about basic facts?
The public goes with what they feel is going on, and doesn't necessarily have the time to do an in depth factual analysis. Despite being imperfect, their instinctual grasp of the situation has some truth behind it. First, taxes actually were raised in the Obama healthcare plan[1], so although taxes had not gone up yet, it was understood that they were going to go up as part of that plan. Second, it's widely recognized that Obama wants to raise taxes on the rich. It's understandable why people might feel that taxes were rising - even though they hadn't actually risen yet. Second, in a difficult economic situation, GDP isn't the only way to measure things, and the public, accurately discerned that it was a tough job market and a difficult situation. So it might have felt to them that GDP was decreasing. Third, with respect to TARP money, financial predictions are not the public's strong suit, so that doesn't reflect misinformation so much as the public's failure to predict the future fate of TARP money. Further, although most TARP money was recovered, billions were lost in some instances. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are too prominent examples. In each case, there is some truth that drives each of the public's misperceptions. Why is it that way? Well sometimes people take an overview. The economy feels worse to them, so they assume GDP shrunk. Banks lost tons of money and it's easy to assume that that trend will continue. Obama agreed to raise taxes to fund his healthcare plan and talks of further tax increases, so it feels like taxes are rising. [1] http://blog.heritage.org/2012/05...
