How did you secure an internship with Google Mountain View being from India?
In my case, before my first internship, I was referred by a Googler. Then, a recruiter asked me to send them my CV and transcripts. After grades and skills analysis, I've done 2 phone interviews and got approved. At the beginning of the interviews process, they ask what are the candidate'sÂ  location preferences (I chose Mountain View (MTV), San Francisco and NYC). Finally, they found a team for me in MTV and arranged my J-1 visa.
