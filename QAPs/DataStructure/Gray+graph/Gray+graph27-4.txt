I feel like a loser and lost all my hope to live anymore. What should I do?
I remained too much inside my head and ended up loosing my mind! When it comes to love, everyone's got a hidden vault filled with unexplained feeling. Its funny how obsessive we become to make someone love us when the answer is right in front of you, love yourself and the rest will follow.But i don't blame you. Feeling the loss is as important as feeling the love but what's essential is making peace with it and moving on Â Another day another dude. You might think its easier said than done but trust me, har andheri raat ke baat saveri aata hi hai. Live the life my friend, live the moment. live the laughter, live the silence live the pain, live the loss, live the love. YOU WOULD'NT BELEIVE WHO HELPED ME FIND THE ANSWER Im an extremely introvert person. Ive never had the capability to speak my mind with anyone so when i had a bad break up i had no idea how to handle it. I cut off my friends ,family and anyone who cared about me.Its then that i came across this site online called Your D.O.S.T - An Emotional Support System....so basically these people have created a domain where one could talk about their deepest problems to the help offered under absolute anonymity. I told em everything i felt and they rearranged my problems for me and gave me a clearer picture about my feelings. I realized how minor my problem really was when compared to all the great things which are waiting for me out their. I own my sincerest thanks to em....hope it helps you as well
