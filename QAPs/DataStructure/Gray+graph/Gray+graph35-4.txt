What is the outcome of a $15 minimum wage in the U.S.?
There isn't going to be a $15 minimum wage in the United States any time soon. The current national minimum wage is almost half that. Some areas have recently instituted a $15 minimum which is being introduced gradually over the next few years. I think the jury is still out on how this will effect employment and the economy in general in these areas. We may not know for sure for several years yet. If things go fairly well, a higher minimum may catch on. However, local minimum wages should, and probably will be, closely tied to local cost of living. The areas that I know of that are trying higher minimum wages, are high cost of living areas.
