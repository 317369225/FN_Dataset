If I am slow at programming & problem solving specifically, does that mean I am not going to improve or it just needs more practice?If I need practice then what kind of problems I should practice. Note: When I say programming I don't mean web development which seems much easier than programming involving stack, queues, trees, graphs, algorithms, mathematical knowledge etc.
Take a look at my graph on Codeforces There were days that I was really depressed and I didn't think I can go on, didn't think I can make it to green, then didn't think I can make it to blue, Now I don't think that I can make it to be candidate master or master You know what makes my predictions fail every single time ? Practice With good practice you can push your limits, put some effort in the right path and see the results I bet you will do far more better than me if you are a beginner, Good Luck !
