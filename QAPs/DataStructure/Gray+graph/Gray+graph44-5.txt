What are the greatest dashboard designs, and why?I am looking for some cool dashboard designs following the latest design trends and UI Patterns. Dashboards mainly displaying the analytics, performance graphs and the most vital information.
dashboard.imamuseum.org | Indianapolis Museum of Art The Indianapolis Museum of Art's dashboard is a purposefully constructed tool to provide transparency to those interested. The dashboard provides statistics for museum usage, artworks on loan, memberships, endowment size, even energy usage and water depth of a river adjacent to the property. It is a great example of openness and providing information in easy-to-digest chunks while removing the walled silo approach so many museums (and other cultural institutions) exist in. The Museum's Information department is a full fledged software development and consulting company provided the technology behind the dashboard and many other useful technology projects for reuse.
