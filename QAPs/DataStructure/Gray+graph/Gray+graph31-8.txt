Why are people suddenly using Quora?A half-dozen people have followed me over the holiday...
Consider the people using it and the network of people they bring with them.  I saw a post by Dave McClure on twitter and that is what brought me here.  People with that kind of fan base can easily ramp up the traffic to a site. Which does bring up an interesting point... If they have the power to bring these sites to life how much more power do they have of taking them down?  It's a crazy shift of power when the Social media giants can wave a hand and your site is going or gone.
