Why darker area of Spectrograms means higher amplitude?I believe the Spectrograms is just frequency changes along the time, so is it should be a line in the figure? say the figure is sound wave, frequency zero means no air pressure in mouth. But I do not understand why the darker area means higher amplitude? I think darker means there are more time span on that frequency, so more lines make it darker?
The three independent values are time, frequency, and amplitude. Instead of graphing on a third axis in 3D, they simply make the 3rd dimension into a color or gray density (in black and white) so you can see it in 2D. The black means amplitude because it's defined that way. This is a Fourier decomposition where at each instant (the time) there are various amplitudes of each pure frequency. So three separate values at every point in 3-space. One is collapsed into grey scale in 2-space.
