What are the greatest dashboard designs, and why?I am looking for some cool dashboard designs following the latest design trends and UI Patterns. Dashboards mainly displaying the analytics, performance graphs and the most vital information.
The best dashboards surface actionable information. I find most of these examples pretty, but not necessarily actionable.Â  One example that comes to mind is Gawker's top stories display. Editors need to know whats performing in real time and this enables them to tweak headlines, what's featured and expand stories based on their current performance.
