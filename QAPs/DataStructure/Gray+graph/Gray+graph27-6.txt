I feel like a loser and lost all my hope to live anymore. What should I do?
Story of my life : Always an achiever and quite good at various things. Passed my MBBS with good grades. Started studying for post graduation and simultaneously fell for one person. Didn't opt for anything during the first attempt, assuming to do better the next time. Relationship was long distance plus the person didn't give it a shit and left. He got in the next time. Is in 2nd year of his post graduation, and I meanwhile fought with some stupid negativity. Ahh! C'mon I won't give him credit for my pains even. He wasn't good enough to be responsible for my pains even. I WAS. I'm gonna appear in the exams this time again, and I'll make sure I give my best because what happend doesn't define me. What I'll end up doing ultimately is gonna define me. :) So, screw that guy and screw whatever happened till yesterday. Take control of your life. There's so much to be happy about and so many battles to be won or gloriously lose that the one you're fighting doesn't stand anywhere. How can you give anyone the right to write your story or define your present and future? You're much more than you think you are. So get up. And leave somethings on time (like not getting the sight of that jerk, everyday). Kindly, see the bigger picture. And start dreaming big. Lastly, be nice to your parents. I never took my frustration over them cause they are like a happy drug to me. The more closer you'll be to them. The more happier you'll feel.
