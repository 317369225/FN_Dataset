How important is social media monitoring in your company? How much time and money do you invest in it?In my experience, social media monitoring it’s an important step in every company, regardless of the industry, and can bring great benefits for a business if it’s properly managed. Do you have such a service in your company? Do you think it should be automated or handled manually?
Currently there is no really good way to automate this task, but tools can make this task easier. The problem is that people who uses those tools and people who may know how to respond or gain insights from are not the same people, because the use such tools require some specialization of functions. In some cases such cross functional collaboration has to happen in real time, but this is really difficult to pull off from all sorts of reasons, from skills, knowledge, culture, workflow, tools, etc.
