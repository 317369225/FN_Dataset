If I am slow at programming & problem solving specifically, does that mean I am not going to improve or it just needs more practice?If I need practice then what kind of problems I should practice. Note: When I say programming I don't mean web development which seems much easier than programming involving stack, queues, trees, graphs, algorithms, mathematical knowledge etc.
Thinking and learning aren't just a matter of speed. There are different learning curves for different people (and for different kinds of results these people can produce). Some people need only a superficial knowledge for starting building applications, and they do it fast but, in general, that's always the same kind of application without a large room for creativity. Other people need to learn in a deeper sense (and in a longer way) for starting understanding about a certain domain of knowledge, but they become able to develop code that can work as a foundation to other artefacts of software. This usually isn't so fast as the former ones' productivity but much fewer ones can do it. Perhaps you are comparing yourself with a mistaken group. Trust yourself and look for the kind of development which is adequate to your own professional traits.
