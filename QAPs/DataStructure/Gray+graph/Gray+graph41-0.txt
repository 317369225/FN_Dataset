Neuroscience: What is the simplest organism that has grey/white matter?
White Matterâ€™s tracts connect the Brain and the Spinal Cord whereas Gray Matter connects Motor and Sensory Neurons through Interneuron. In a worm brain (C. elegans), the axons crowd together in a Nerve Ring orbiting the gut tube. The ring extends into the belly of the worm called the Ventral Cord. It seemingly plays the role of White Matter. [1] Central Nerve Ring with Nerve Net is present in Echinoderms while Nerve Net is present in Cnidarians (like Hydra). They all have long axons. But Gray and White Matter constitute the Vertebrate Nervous System, so the simplest organism should come from the same category! As for Mammals, here is a graph that shows the volume of White Matter and Grey Matter in 59 organisms [2]. The density of neurons decreases with brain size. [1].
