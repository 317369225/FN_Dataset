What are the greatest dashboard designs, and why?I am looking for some cool dashboard designs following the latest design trends and UI Patterns. Dashboards mainly displaying the analytics, performance graphs and the most vital information.
We wrote a post on this exact topic not so long ago at Geckoboard: Page on geckoboard.com We believe there are 6 Golden Rules to successful dashboard design: RULE 1 - WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO IMPRESS? - It’s important to ensure that where possible your dashboard consists of data that’s specific to a single audience RULE 2 - SELECT THE RIGHT TYPE OF DASHBOARD - There are 3 common types of dashboard, each performing a specific purpose: Operation, Strategic / Executive & Analytical RULE 3 - GROUP DATA LOGICALLY - USE SPACE WISELY - A well designed dashboard will ensure that data is displayed in logical groups. RULE 4 - MAKE THE DATA RELEVANT TO THE AUDIENCE - An Executive dashboard can have a number of different audiences. Ensure that the data you display is relevant to the users. Think about the scope and reach of your data. RULE 5 - DON’T CLUTTER YOUR DASHBOARD - PRESENT THE MOST IMPORTANT METRICS ONLY - Dashboards are often cluttered. Cluttered displays deflect the focus from the important messages. RULE 6 - HOW OFTEN DOES THE DATA REALLY NEED TO BE REFRESHED? - Ensuring that your dashboard data is being refreshed at the right intervals saves time during development (why go through the pain of sourcing real-time data, when all you need is a weekly feed) and can ensure optimal performance once the dashboard is live.
