How can I get a job at Facebook or Google in 6 months?How should I be going? I need a concise work-plan to build a good enough skill set. Should I join some other start-up? Should I build my own projects or start-up? Should I just focus on practicing up on Data Structures and Algorithms ?
Follow these 10 steps  and eventually you may be in good position to apply to these companies Stick to one programming language, make sure you can code with absolute ease in this language. I am sure Google and FB dont have affinity to one specific language.Code them on Linux or Mac preferably. They are Unix variants Get yourself a good book on Algorithms and data structures Complete the book so that you get the hang of all basic algorithms and data structures. (Book,Data Structures Using C) Learn other computer basics like OS concepts, bit programming, networking and about data bases(Preferably The world's most popular open source database (MySql) should be enough) Understand that you have just completed the course and you are still not expert in Algorithms! Now you need to sharpen your coding and algo skills, which should be taken  in parallel. Fork some small and famous  Build software better, together (Git)  projects and try understanding the code and if possible try contributing to it. This will ensure that you code the right way! Participate in topcoder or codechef or codesprint. These sites have practice problems which will sharpen your algorithms skill. I find Programming Interviews has some awesome explanations to very nice problems from a IITian if you can follow Indian English accent. Please glance back what ever you learn in these days and make sure you dont forget what you learn Updated 6 May 2013 • View Upvotes
