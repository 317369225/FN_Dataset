If I am slow at programming & problem solving specifically, does that mean I am not going to improve or it just needs more practice?If I need practice then what kind of problems I should practice. Note: When I say programming I don't mean web development which seems much easier than programming involving stack, queues, trees, graphs, algorithms, mathematical knowledge etc.
You are not likely to catch up to a person to whom it came more easily.  But yes, you will get better with practtice.  If you can achieve a thorough understanding of arrays, insertion sort, quick sort, heap sort, linked lists, doubly-linked lists, binary search trees, AVL balancing, hash tables, and time and space ccomplexity, that's a solid foundation.  But each area, web, embedded, specific applications, has it's tricks.  Different programming languages have their ins and outs too.  There's no one super-hard sort of programming where you have a zen moment and then you can do anything.  You will specialize, and those who specialize in different ways will know things you don't.  Even if what they're doing seems relatively easy.
