Is President Obama a socialist? Why or why not?This claim is made about his ideals and goals all of the time, usually as a slur. In what ways is there any merit to this label? Please feel free to list any "close hits" that are not quite socialism, but strongly lean in that direction. Since this is likely to be contentious, I remind you that providing your own answer is a stronger response than attacking the answer of another user.
No. Socialism in the Ghandi or Nelson Mandela sense is the lower left quadrant I call this the "Jesus Christ" or "Star Trek" style idealist socialism where the society voluntarily redistributes resources for the collective good .  Authoritarian socialism is the upper left - that is the "Stalin" or "Mao" style socialism that involves centralized planning and forcing everyone to contribute to the collective good.  The lower right is libertarianism, like Ron Paul.  The upper right is conservatism - free market capitalism with some restrictions.  The further up you go the less you tolerate political dissent.  Hitler would have been in the upper right too, more toward the middle but very much at the top. Obama is squarely in the mainstream of global political opinion, which is mostly right-wing.  Here's an international comparison of current world leadership: The Political Compass Updated 7 Dec 2014 • View Upvotes
