Who are some of the greatest scientists, past and present, in the field of distributed or concurrent systems?Also what are their accomplishments?
Obviously Leslie Lamport.  Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System is fundamental to understanding distributed systems, and Paxos (computer science) was the way to do state machine replication. Robbert van Renesse at Cornell is very prolific with a lot of  papers on distributed systems middleware.
