How could one predict the direction of an additional geometrical dimension with reference to the n-space graph the additional dimension is being dropped onto.The coordinate system is Rectilinear Cartesian.
If this were to go in a Physics direction, one might postulate that higher dimensional objects live with the Planck limit and that if a higher dimensional object happened to have a solution that ALL lay in the lower dimension for some quantum of time, that the lower-space observer would see an object wink into and out of existence for a short time, but getting a read on the higher dimensional directionality would be a theoretical impossibility. and Brane theory presumes that the space-time Lorentzian {3:1} manifold that we observe every day is actually just a solution of a much higher order equation which has a significant solution set in this reduced dimensional subspace. So you might say that Brane theorists are trying like mad to get a picture of the higher order space.
