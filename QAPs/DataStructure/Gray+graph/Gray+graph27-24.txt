I feel like a loser and lost all my hope to live anymore. What should I do?
Well I'll Just tell you one thing, and i will Keep It simple! You Don't want to Live Anymore For you? Start Living it to Spread Happiness! How? Simplest of all--->> Go out there, start teaching The Poor Children! The way they will see you with a smile, I Don't Need to say more! :D Life is too precious to Waste on someone who doesn't Give you enough Respect/Importance. Make Your life Count! :)
