Which CS areas have the most low-hanging fruit for research?
Low hanging fruit in research is a bit of an oxymoron. It can mean one of two things, posed as a modification of the original question: 1) How can I get a job with the least effort and skill as a teacher or researcher? In other words what is "hip" today? 2) Where is the most (in hindsight) obvious but not yet discovered breakthrough? 1) is easy to answer, though not by me since I am not very hip! 2) is impossible to answer by anyone! To me 2) is the fun question. Over and over again something is discovered that turns a field upside down. No one could see it coming. For example: Use Fourier integrals to streamline convolution? Crazy! Then viola! N log(N) FFT! Quantum computing using linear optics? Impossible until, bam! The brilliant idea to use observation as a control not gate! Edit gene sequences quickly and deterministically? No! Then sure! Use CRISPR!
