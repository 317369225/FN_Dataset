Why is e-commerce such a hot area in venture capital now?
Just an observation but here's my take on why ecommerce has been such a hot area for VC: a business model that is not fully dependent on advertising 30% year over year growth in the last 5 years, and trends show this will continue Improvement of online payment method and increasingly larger volumes of online and mobile shopping In some cases, negative working capital (!) Cloud computing has made it much cheaper to operate Fragmented industry which is slowly consolidating: Amazon and eBay will continue to make acquisitions (zappos, woot, fraudsciences, buyvip, etc)
