Which CS areas have the most low-hanging fruit for research?
Note: This answer is at the intersection of Which physics areas have the most low-hanging fruit for research? and this question, since it involves using advanced supercomputing techniques in order to parallelize computational physics (N-body simulations). The goal is to scale such simulations to the point that biological structure (e.g. proteins) can be simulated. A specific area of computational biology that is of interest to a lot of people is computational drug design. Research into this area has forced computer scientists to think outside of the box in terms of parallelism and the limits of computation. Examples of efforts to solve the protein folding problem (which is closely related to drug development) include Vijay Pande's Folding@Home [1] and the specialized hardware (Anton) developed at D. E. Shaw Research [2]. David Shaw discusses this in a Stanford lecture [3] aimed at people with backgrounds in both EE and CS.
