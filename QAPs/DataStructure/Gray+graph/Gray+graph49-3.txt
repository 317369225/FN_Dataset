Can i use a Razer DeathAdder mouse without a mousepad ? On any surface?
I have the DeathAdder 3.5. The mouse works on the most surfaces. I think the underground for the mouse should be solid and not really colourful. I check the following surfaces which worked well: - Blue slighty soft pad - Kitchen table with colours from gray to brown - White hard plastic - Simple graph paper (just for testing) Best Regards
