How can I make my blog content more visible/shareable?
Write good authentic content and share it with your followers, friends and anyone interested in what information you have to share. Also install social sharing widgets like AddThis to make it easier for users to share it. If you want paid distribution you can look at networks like Outbrain and Taboola.
