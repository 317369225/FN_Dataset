Has Google Reader seen a decline in usage as Twitter's popularity has grown?Brian Shih mentions "RSS" as being alien to mainstream. Twitter abstracts away RSS and provides similar functionality. Although not all users use Twitter this way, news consumption is a common use case. This is a follow-up question to Is Google Reader a popular product? Why?.
Great to see hard data. Thanks Louis. Personally, I've connected my Google Reader into Flipboard on the iPad and this has made me love Google Reader even more. As I "favorite" Twitter links I love, this gets redirected into Google Reader which in turn I read via Flipboard. By "favoriting" these links, I also give permission for others to read what I love on Twitter. Before FlipBoard I would skim through Google Reader but now, I get to see all these wonderful stories presented in such an appealing way that it encourages me to read more. Talk about getting stuck in "the flow". I would guestimate that many more people who own iPads would likely feel the same way and the effects on Google Reader may stay quite positive, strong and robust in its growth. Flipboard has definitely improved the stickiness factor in my books. All the best!
